PILOT PROJECT FOR PLUMAS, LASSEN, AND TAHOE NATIONAL FORESTS TO \n              IMPLEMENT QUINCY LIBRARY GROUP PROPOSAL.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As a consequence of fire suppression and an over-\n        accumulation of natural fuels, forest stands in the Sierra \n        Nevada, particularly within the Plumas National Forest, Lassen \n        National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of the \n        Tahoe National Forest in the State of California, have been \n        highly altered both in structure and function by the \n        development of dense, shade tolerant understories that place \n        such forest stands at an unnatural risk of epidemic mortality \n        from disease and insect infestations and high-intensity stand-\n        replacing fire.\n            (2) Enhanced resource management activities, including \n        thinning, salvage logging, pruning, brush clearing, prescribed \n        fire, and uneven-aged timber stand management (using individual \n        tree and group selection) are necessary throughout these three \n        national forests to mitigate unnatural tree mortality, reduce \n        fuel loads, break up fuel continuity in areas of fire prone \n        forest, and achieve long-term forest health.\n            (3) Communities in the Sierra Nevada throughout northern \n        California rely upon the revenues derived from the sale of \n        forest products from Federal lands for education, roads, basic \n        infrastructure, and overall economic stability.\n            (4) The Quincy Library Group of northern California is a \n        coalition of representatives of the timber industry, \n        environmental organizations, citizens, and local communities \n        that formed to develop a resource management program for \n        Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada that could be carried out in \n        a manner that simultaneously maximizes forest health, cost-\n        effectiveness, and social and economic benefits to forest-\n        dependent communities.\n            (5) The agreement reached by this group in 1993, known as \n        the Quincy Library Group Proposal of 1993, recommended a \n        localized, adaptive management strategy for designated lands in \n        the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and the \n        Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest for \n        implementing, in a cost-effective manner, the resource \n        management activities necessary to reduce fire risk and enhance \n        forest health while providing greater economic stability to \n        forest-dependent communities.\n            (6) Implementation of the resource management activities \n        recommended in the Quincy Library Group Proposal of 1993 as a \n        pilot project on these national forests can demonstrate the \n        feasibility of utilizing locally-developed adaptive management \n        strategies that may be applicable throughout California and the \n        intermountain northwest.\n    (b) Pilot Project Required.--\n            (1) Implementation and purpose.--The Secretary of \n        Agriculture, acting through the Forest Service, shall conduct a \n        pilot project on the Federal lands described in paragraph (2) \n        to implement and demonstrate the effectiveness of the resource \n        management activities described in subsection (d), as \n        recommended in the Quincy Library Group Proposal of 1993.\n            (2) Pilot project area.--The Secretary shall conduct the \n        pilot project on the Federal lands within the Plumas National \n        Forest, Lassen National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger \n        District of the Tahoe National Forest in the State of \n        California depicted on the map entitled ``Quincy Library Group \n        Community Stability Proposal'', dated June 1993. The map shall \n        be on file and available for inspection in the appropriate \n        offices of the Forest Service.\n    (c) Exclusion of Certain Lands; Exception.--\n            (1) Exclusion.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), all \n        spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers \n        located within the pilot project area designated under \n        subsection (b)(2) will be deferred from timber harvesting \n        during the term of the pilot project.\n            (2) Exception for designated catastrophic event areas.--The \n        Secretary may designate an area within the pilot project area \n        that is otherwise precluded from timber harvesting pursuant to \n        paragraph (1) and subsection (b)(2) as a catastrophic event \n        area in which the resource management activities described in \n        subsection (d) may be applied if the Secretary, upon completion \n        of an environmental impact statement, finds that--\n                    (A) the area proposed for designation has \n                experienced disturbances from wildfires, insect \n                infestations, disease, drought, or other natural causes \n                and will suffer further environmental degradation, such \n                as soil erosion, stream damage, or habitat loss, in the \n                absence of the resource management activities; and\n                    (B) implementation of one or more resource \n                management activities described in subsection (d) in \n                the area proposed for designation is likely to reduce \n                or prevent continued environmental degradation.\n            (3) Notice of proposed designation.--Immediately upon \n        publication of the draft environmental impact statement \n        required under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall publish in \n        the Federal Register notice of any prospective decision to \n        designate a catastrophic event area under such paragraph on the \n        basis of the environmental impact statement. The notice shall--\n                    (A) set forth the location of the affected area;\n                    (B) describe the forest health conditions in such \n                area;\n                    (C) provide the reasons for proposing to designate \n                the area as a catastrophic event area; and\n                    (D) contain a brief description of the resource \n                management activity or activities that the Secretary \n                proposes to select for the area.\n            (4) Public comment.--The Secretary shall provide a 45-day \n        period for the submission of public comments regarding a draft \n        environmental impact statement prepared under paragraph (2) and \n        any prospective decision to designate, on the basis of the \n        environmental impact statement, a catastrophic event area. The \n        comment period shall begin on the date of the publication of \n        the draft environmental impact statement or the date notice is \n        published under paragraph (3) of the prospective decision to \n        designate the catastrophic event area, whichever is later. \n        During the comment period, the Secretary shall hold a hearing \n        on the decision in a community near the area proposed for \n        designation.\n    (d) Resource Management Activities.--During the term of the pilot \nproject, the Secretary shall implement and carry out the following \nresource management activities on the Federal lands included within the \npilot project area designated under subsection (b)(2):\n            (1) Construction of a strategic system of defensible, \n        shaded fuelbreaks on not less than 50,000 acres per year.\n            (2) Implementation, on an acreage rather than volume basis, \n        of uneven-aged forest management prescriptions utilizing \n        individual tree selection and group selection to achieve a \n        desired future condition of an all-age, multi-story, fire \n        resistant forest.\n    (e) Cost-Effectiveness.--In conducting the pilot project, Secretary \nshall use the most cost-effective means available, as determined by the \nSecretary, to implement resource management activities described in \nsubsection (d).\n    (f) Effect on Multiple Use Activities.--The Secretary shall not \nrely on the resource management activities described in subsection (d) \nas a basis for administrative action limiting other multiple use \nactivities on Federal lands included within the pilot project area \ndesignated under subsection (b)(2).\n    (g) Funding.--\n            (1) Source of funds.--In conducting the pilot project, the \n        Secretary shall use--\n                    (A) those funds that were specifically provided to \n                the Forest Service by the Secretary during fiscal year \n                1996 to begin implementing resource management \n                activites according to the Quincy Library Group \n                Proposal of 1993; and\n                    (B) other funds as are appropriated for the \n                administration of Plumas National Forest, Lassen \n                National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of \n                the Tahoe National Forest.\n            (2) Prohibition on use of certain funds.--The Secretary may \n        not conduct the pilot project using funds appropriated for any \n        other unit of the National Forest System.\n    (h) Term of Pilot Project.--The Secretary shall conduct the pilot \nproject during the period beginning on the date of the enactment of \nthis Act and ending on the later of the following:\n            (1) The date on which the Secretary completes amendment of \n        the land and resource management plans for Plumas National \n        Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest \n        pursuant to subsection (i).\n            (2) The date that is five years after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act.\n    (i) Corresponding Forest Plan Amendments.--Commencing on the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall initiate a process to \namend the land and resource management plans for the Plumas National \nForest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest to, where \nappropriate--\n            (1) incorporate the pilot project and area designations \n        made by subsection (b) and the resource management activities \n        described in subsection (d); and\n            (2) make other changes warranted by the analyses conducted \n        in compliance with section 102(2) of the National Environmental \n        Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)), section 6 of the Forest \n        and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 \n        U.S.C. 1604), and other applicable laws.\n    (j) Reporting Requirements.--Not later than January 1 of each year \nduring the term of the pilot project, the Secretary shall submit to \nCongress a report on the status of the pilot project.
