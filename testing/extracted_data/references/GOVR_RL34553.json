    "content": "House office closing activities are supported by the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Clerk of the House, and House Sergeant at Arms. Resources related to closing a congressional office are available to House offices through the 113 th Congress transition website on the House intranet. When it becomes known that a Senate office will be closing, the Sergeant at Arms contacts that office to initiate closing support services. The Senate Sergeant at Arms provides office closing services through an Office Support Services Customer Support Analyst (CSA) assigned to each Senate office. A CSA helps coordinate an initial closing office planning meeting between the office and all Senate support offices, and it facilitates the provision of the following: office equipment inventory reports assistance with archiving documents information on closing out financial obligations information on benefits and entitlements available to a Senator after leaving office Payroll for staff of Members who are leaving office at the conclusion of a Congress typically terminates automatically on January 2. The employing authority, a Member in the case of a personal office that is closing, determines whether outgoing staff are eligible to receive a lump sum payment for any accrued annual leave. Other potential benefits, including retirement plans, post-employment life or health insurance benefits, and student loan repayment programs, are administered through the House Office of Human Resources, according to statute and chamber regulation. The office will continue to interact with former House employees on a wide range of post-employment matters, including wage and earning statements, employee benefits, and any forms that must be completed by former employees. In addition to staff procedures to support the closing of a Representative's office, the House provides certain post-employment services to departing staff, including a r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 referral service to House staff who desire employment with Members-elect, provided by the CAO; individual outplacement and technical assistance, as well as job search strategies and transitional techniques to separating employees of the House, provided by the House Outplacement Services Resource Center; and help for affected employees focused on designing and developing a successful job search, provided by the Office of Employee Assistance. Staffs of Senators who will leave office when their term of office officially expires at noon on January 3 of the year in which such a term ends remain on the payroll until the close of business on January 2 of the year in which the Senator's term of office expires, unless terminated sooner. The Senate Disbursing Office addresses issues related to the termination of employment of departing staff and provides information on the available options to staff regarding post-employment insurance and retirement programs and other benefits. The Senate Placement Office provides application and referral service for professionals and support staff, and it can assist outgoing Senate employees who are seeking positions in new congressional offices. The departing staff who are interested in this service must complete an application form and be interviewed by a personnel specialist. Placement office personnel then review applications and send them to offices with matching available positions. According to the Clerk of the House, the files generated by a Member's congressional office and accumulated in the course of service in the House are the personal property of the Member. The House pays for point-to-point shipping of all official records and papers for departing Members of that chamber. Official papers are generally described as those materials that may be mailed under franking regulations. Other materials, including memorabilia, photographs, and documents that do not relate to official business, must be shipped or disposed of at the outgoing Member's expense. Guidance regarding records management is available from the Office of the Clerk. Shipping of records is carried out by the House CAO. The Senate Records Management Handbook notes that neither statute nor the standing rules of the Senate define which items constitute a Senator's papers. For management purposes, the Secretary of the Senate defines Senators' papers as \"all records, regardless of physical form and characteristics, that are made or received in connection with an individual's career as a United States Senator.\" The manual notes that, by tradition and practice, any such records are the private property of the individual Senator. The principal exclusion from Senators' papers are committee records that are defined by statute and Senate standing rules to be records of the Senate. Senate office closing guidelines specify a detailed process for the handling of a Senator's records. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides courtesy storage facilities to Members of Congress for records created in Capitol Hill offices at the Washington National Records Center (WNRC) in Suitland, MD, and at regional storage facilities around the country for records generated in state or district offices. NARA courtesy storage expires at the conclusion of a Member's term of office. WNRC can be reached at 301-778-1650. Contact information for NARA regional facilities is available at http://www.archives.gov/locations/ . The House Office of Finance requests that contact information for each closing office be provided to expedite resolution of final payments to vendors. Closing offices must settle several accounts, with units of the Secretary of the Senate and the Sergeant at Arms, as well as other government agencies. The Senate Disbursing Office is authorized to withhold from Senators' pay, reimbursements, mileage, or expense money for delinquent indebtedness to the Senate. At the conclusion of a Congress, the Architect of the Capitol has in the past advised that departing Members must vacate their Washington, DC, offices not later than noon on December 1, of the second year of a Congress. A Departing Member Service Center has provided functional workspace for departing Members and staff once their office suites are vacated. The center is typically secured by the U.S. Capitol Police and has a central administrative facility that is staffed by CAO employees. Each departing Member office is assigned a single cubicle that can accommodate the Member and one other person at any given time. Each cubicle is equipped with a telephone, networked computer, and basic supplies. Senators may remain in their personal offices in Washington, DC, until their terms of office expire. Senators leasing federal office premises or commercial space in their home states must notify the General Services Administration (GSA) or private landlord in writing at least 30 days in advance of their intention to vacate the premises. The Sergeant at Arms requires that a copy of an intent to vacate letter be provided to his office at the same time it is provided to landlords. All office space must be vacated by the close of business on January 2 of the year in which the Senator's term expires. House Support Services (HSS) staff will begin scheduling final equipment inventories for the Capitol Hill offices of departing Members shortly after the November elections. GSA is responsible for performing the final inventory for the district office locations of departing Members. All furniture and equipment (including copiers, faxes, telecommunication systems, computers, personal digital assistants, and any other equipment used to support office operations), whether used in office settings, or in the residences of Members and staff, must be accounted for in those inventories. Representatives are allowed to purchase their chairs and desks only from the Washington, DC, inventory. In district offices, succeeding Members will receive all of the equipment and furniture items of the outgoing Member. If the succeeding Member chooses not to use office items of the departing Member, those items will then become available for purchase by the departing Member. Furnishings in a departing Senator's personal and Capitol offices remain in place. Keys for Capitol offices must be returned to Sergeant at Arms Capitol Facilities. The Asset Management Section of the Sergeant at Arms conducts an inventory of all office and information technology (IT) related equipment in closing offices. Telecommunications equipment must be returned to the Senate. Outgoing Senators may purchase select office equipment and non-historical furniture used in their Capitol Hill offices. Emergency equipment, including annunciators, escape hoods, emergency supply kits (go kits), and victim rescue units, will be inventoried by the Office of Security and Emergency Preparedness (OSEP). Outgoing Senators may purchase office furnishings from only one of their state offices at a price equal to the acquisition price less depreciation. A Member of Congress may leave office prior to the expiration of his or her term, due to resignation, death, or for other reasons. On the first business day after the death, resignation, or expulsion of a Member of the House, his or her office is renamed the Office of the ___ Congressional District of State/Territory. Pursuant to House Rule II, cl.2(i)(1), staff on payroll of the congressional office when the outgoing Member departs remain employed by the House, and carry out their duties under the supervision of the Clerk of the House until a successor is elected. Senate practice regarding the closing of the office of a Senator who leaves office prior to the expiration of his or her term of office varies according to the circumstances of the departure. In addition to the expiration of the regular term of office, the Senate Handbook notes that a Senate office might be closed due to the following categories: resignation termination of the service of a Senator who is appointed and who does not stand for election, or is defeated death of a Senator Employees in the personal office of a Senator who resigns are continued on the Senate payroll at their respective salaries for up to 60 days after the Senator leaves office, unless the Senator's term of office expires sooner. Employee duties are performed under the direction of the Secretary of the Senate. An amount equal to one-tenth of the official office expense account portion of the Senator's Official Personnel and Office Expense Account is available to the Secretary of the Senate to defray those expenses directly related to closing a Senator's office. Expenses are paid from the Contingent Fund of the Senate as Miscellaneous Items. Employees in the personal office of a Senator whose appointment is terminated are continued on the Senate payroll at their respective salaries for up to 30 days after the termination of the Senator's service, or until they have become otherwise gainfully employed, whichever is earlier. The office space in Washington, DC, and in the state of an appointed Senator must be vacated on the day preceding the swearing-in of the successor, if the Senate is in session. If the Senate has adjourned sine die, an appointed Senator who will not continue to serve in the Senate must vacate office facilities the day before a successor is certified, or 30 days after a successor has been elected, whichever is earlier. Employees in the personal office of a deceased sitting Senator are continued on the Senate payroll at their respective salaries for up to 60 days after the Senator's death, unless the Senator's term of office expires sooner. The Committee on Rules and Administration may extend this period in cases where it will take longer to close a deceased Senator's office. Employee duties are performed under the direction of the Secretary of the Senate. An amount equal to one-tenth of the official office expense account portion of the Senator's Official Personnel and Office Expense Account is available to the Secretary of the Senate to defray those expenses directly related to closing a Senator's office. Expenses are paid from the Contingent Fund of the Senate as Miscellaneous Items. The Senate Financial Clerk provides information concerning allowances for the operation of the deceased Senator's office during the 60-day period."
