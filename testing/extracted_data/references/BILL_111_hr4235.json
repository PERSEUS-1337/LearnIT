In applying such provisions, \nthe Secretary may make such modifications as may be necessary to apply \nsuch provisions with respect to women's hospitals.\n    ``(d) Making of Payments.--\n            ``(1) Interim payments.--The Secretary shall determine, \n        before the beginning of each fiscal year involved for which \n        payments may be made for a hospital under this section, the \n        amounts of the payments for direct graduate medical education \n        and indirect medical education for such fiscal year and shall \n        (subject to paragraph (2)) make the payments of such amounts in \n        12 equal interim installments during such period. Such interim \n        payments to each individual hospital shall be based on the \n        number of residents reported in the hospital's most recently \n        filed Medicare cost report prior to the application date for \n        the Federal fiscal year for which the interim payment amounts \n        are established. In the case of a hospital that does not report \n        residents on a Medicare cost report, such interim payments \n        shall be based on the number of residents trained during the \n        hospital's most recently completed Medicare cost report filing \n        period.\n            ``(2) Withholding.--The Secretary shall withhold up to 25 \n        percent from each interim installment for direct and indirect \n        graduate medical education paid under paragraph (1) as \n        necessary to ensure a hospital will not be overpaid on an \n        interim basis.\n            ``(3) Reconciliation.--Prior to the end of each fiscal \n        year, the Secretary shall determine any changes to the number \n        of residents reported by a hospital in the application of the \n        hospital for the current fiscal year to determine the final \n        amount payable to the hospital for the current fiscal year for \n        both direct expense and indirect expense amounts. Based on such \n        determination, the Secretary shall recoup any overpayments made \n        and pay any balance due to the extent possible. The final \n        amount so determined shall be considered a final intermediary \n        determination for the purposes of section 1878 of the Social \n        Security Act and shall be subject to administrative and \n        judicial review under that section in the same manner as the \n        amount of payment under section 1886(d) of such Act is subject \n        to review under such section.\n    ``(e) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Approved graduate medical residency training \n        program.--The term `approved graduate medical residency \n        training program' has the meaning given the term `approved \n        medical residency training program' in section 1886(h)(5)(A) of \n        the Social Security Act.\n            ``(2) Direct graduate medical education costs.--The term \n        `direct graduate medical education costs' has the meaning given \n        such term in section 1886(h)(5)(C) of the Social Security Act.\n            ``(3) Women's hospital.--The term `women's hospital' means \n        a hospital--\n                    ``(A) that has a Medicare provider agreement under \n                title XVIII of the Social Security Act;\n                    ``(B) that has an approved graduate medical \n                residency training program;\n                    ``(C) that has not been excluded from the Medicare \n                prospective payment system;\n                    ``(D) that had at least 3,000 births during 2007, \n                as determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n                Services; and\n                    ``(E) with respect to which and as determined by \n                the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, less than \n                4 percent of the total discharges from the hospital \n                during 2007 were Medicare discharges of individuals \n                who, as of the time of the discharge--\n                            ``(i) were enrolled in the original \n                        Medicare fee-for-service program under part A \n                        of title XVIII of the Social Security Act; and\n                            ``(ii) were not enrolled in--\n                                    ``(I) a Medicare Advantage plan \n                                under part C of title XVIII of that \n                                Act;\n                                    ``(II) an eligible organization \n                                under section 1876 of that Act; or\n                                    ``(III) a PACE program under \n                                section 1894 of that Act.\n    ``(f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section, $12,000,000 for fiscal year \n2010, and such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2011 \nthrough 2014.''."
