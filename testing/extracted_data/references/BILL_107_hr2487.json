FINDINGS.\n\n      The Congress finds that--\n            (1) young people under 18 years of age are now our most \n        impoverished age group with 1 of every 5 living in poverty, a \n        higher proportion than in 1968, with the percentage for \n        minority children being about twice as high;\n            (2) more than 1 of 4 families is headed by a single parent \n        and the percentage of such families headed by such single \n        parents has risen steadily over the past few decades, rising 13 \n        percent since 1990;\n            (3) there is a need to engage youth as active participants \n        in decision-making that affects their lives, including design, \n        development, implementation, and evaluation of youth \n        development programs at the Federal, State, and community \n        levels;\n            (4) existing outcome driven youth development strategies, \n        pioneered by community-based organizations, hold real promise \n        for promoting positive behaviors and preventing youth problems;\n            (5) formal evaluations of youth development programs have \n        documented significant reductions in drug and alcohol use, \n        school misbehavior, aggressive behavior, violence, truancy, \n        high-risk sexual behavior, and smoking;\n            (6) compared to American youth generally, youth \n        participating in community-based organizations are more than 26 \n        percent more likely to report having received recognition for \n        good grades than American youth generally and nearly 20 percent \n        more likely to rate the likelihood of their going to college as \n        ``very high''; and\n            (7) the availability and use of Federal resources can be an \n        effective incentive to leverage broader community support to \n        enable local programs, activities and services to provide the \n        full array of developmental core resources, remove barriers to \n        access, promote program effectiveness, and facilitate \n        coordination and collaboration within the community.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n    Subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nis amended--\n            (1) by redesignating section 407E (20 U.S.C. 1070a-35) as \n        section 406E; and\n            (2) by inserting after such section the following new \n        chapter:\n\n                 ``Chapter 4--Public Service Incentives\n\n``SEC. 407A.
