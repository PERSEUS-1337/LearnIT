FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 2003, an estimated 1,334,100 Americans will be \n        diagnosed with some form of cancer.\n            (2) In 2003, an estimated 556,500 Americans will die of \n        cancer. In the United States, 1 in every 4 deaths results from \n        cancer.\n            (3) In 2002, the National Institutes of Health estimated \n        the overall cost of cancer at $171,600,000,000.\n            (4) In 2003, an estimated 211,300 American women and 1,300 \n        men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,200 will die \n        of the disease. A mammogram every 1-2 years can reduce the risk \n        of dying by about 16 percent for women 40 years of age and \n        older.\n            (5) In 2003, an estimated 40,100 women will be newly \n        diagnosed with cancer of the uterine corpus and 6,800 women \n        will die of the disease.\n            (6) In 2003, an estimated 147,500 Americans will be \n        diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 57,100 will die of the \n        disease.\n            (7) Incidence rates of colorectal cancer stabilized between \n        1995 and 1999. Research suggests that declines may be in part \n        due to increased screening and polyp removal.\n            (8) The Chronic Disease Prevention Department found that \n        screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the number of deaths \n        by at least 30 percent.\n            (9) Regular screening examinations by a health care \n        professional can result in early detection of cancers of the \n        breast, colon, rectum, prostate, testis, oral cavity, and skin. \n        If all these cancers were diagnosed at a localized stage \n        through regular examinations, the 5-year survival rate would \n        increase from 82 percent to 95 percent.\n            (10) Cancers of the lung, mouth, larynx, bladder, kidney, \n        cervix, esophagus, and pancreas are related to tobacco use. The \n        American Cancer Society estimates that in 2003 more than \n        180,000 cancer deaths will be caused by tobacco use. Smoking \n        alone causes \\1/3\\ of all cancer deaths.\n            (11) More than 1,000,000 skin cancers expected to be \n        diagnosed in 2003 could have been prevented by protection from \n        the sun's rays.\n            (12) An estimated 9,000 new cases of childhood cancer are \n        expected to occur in 2003.\n            (13) Cancer is the chief cause of death by disease in \n        children between the ages of 1 and 14.\n            (14) The American Cancer Society estimates that \n        approximately \\1/3\\ of the 556,500 cancer deaths expected in \n        2003 will be related to nutrition, physical inactivity, \n        obesity, and other lifestyle factors that could be prevented.\n            (15) About 77 percent of all cancers are diagnosed at age \n        55 and older. In order to ensure high quality cancer care for \n        American seniors, medicare reimbursements must reflect the true \n        cost of treatment in every treatment setting and medicare \n        payments should accurately reflect the cost of drug and \n        biologics as well as the cost of administering drugs and \n        supportive care therapies.\n            (16) Despite an aging population, death rates for the most \n        common cancers, lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate continue \n        to drop at an average of 1.7 percent per year.\n            (17) In May 2001, Gleevec, the first in what is expected to \n        be a number of cancer treatments, was approved for use by the \n        Food and Drug Administration as it appeared to be effective in \n        stopping the growth of deadly Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cells \n        within 3 months of use. In 2002, Gleevec showed ability to stop \n        growth of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.\n            (18) In early 2003, researchers used gene chips to \n        accurately predict whether or not breast cancer tumors would \n        spread in the future. If the findings are validated, doctors \n        will be able to determine which patients are likely to relapse \n        and need chemotherapy, while sparing those with a favorable \n        prognosis from additional treatment.\n            (19) The Lance Armstrong Foundation, a leading national \n        organization providing services and support for cancer \n        survivors, defines cancer survivorship as living with, through, \n        and beyond cancer.\n            (20) In 2001, there were 9,600,000 cancer survivors in the \n        United States.\n            (21) Sixty percent of adults diagnosed with cancer survive \n        at least 5 years.\n            (22) While nearly every childhood cancer diagnosis 20 years \n        ago was fatal, today more than 80 percent of children diagnosed \n        with cancer survive at least 5 years.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n    It is the sense of the Senate that the United States is at a point \nin history in which we must take the proper steps to reach the goal of \nmaking cancer survivorship the rule and cancer deaths rare by the year \n2015.\n\n                   TITLE I--PUBLIC HEALTH PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 101.
