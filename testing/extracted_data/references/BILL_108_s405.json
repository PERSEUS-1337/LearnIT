FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1)(A) The first 5 years of a child's life are a time of \n        momentous change.\n            (B) Research shows that a child's brain size doubles \n        between birth and age 3.\n            (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n        activity of the brain cells actually changes the physical \n        structure of the brain, and that without a stimulating \n        environment, a baby's brain suffers.\n            (3) Research also indicates that there is a connection \n        between the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical \n        stimulation young children receive from their early childhood \n        teachers and caregivers and success in learning, school \n        readiness, and intellectual growth. There are important short- \n        and long-term effects of that stimulation on cognition and \n        social development.\n            (4) High quality early childhood education correlates with \n        better language development, mathematics abilities, and social \n        skills.\n            (5) 11,900,000 children younger than age 5 spend part of \n        their time with a child care provider other than a parent. By \n        2000, 64 percent of 3- to 5-year-olds were enrolled in some \n        type of preschool program. Demand for child care is growing as \n        more mothers enter the workforce.\n            (6) Good quality child care, in a healthy and safe \n        environment, with trained, caring providers who provide age-\n        appropriate, developmentally appropriate, and effective \n        activities, helps children grow and thrive. Recent research \n        shows that most child care needs significant improvement.\n            (7) Good quality child care depends largely on the \n        provider, yet providers of child care earn on average $7.86 per \n        hour, or $16,350 per year. Such earnings cause high annual \n        turnover, up to 31 percent of the staff in some child care \n        programs. High turnover affects the overall quality of a child \n        care program and causes anxiety for children.\n            (8) Children attending lower quality child care programs \n        and child care programs with high staff turnover are less \n        competent in language and social development than other \n        children.\n            (9) The quality of child care is primarily related to high \n        staff-to-child ratios, staff education, professional \n        development, and administrators' prior experience. In addition, \n        certain characteristics distinguish poor, mediocre, and good \n        quality child care programs, the most important of which are \n        teacher wages, education, and specialized training.\n            (10) Each State requires kindergarten teachers to hold at \n        least a bachelor's degree and certificate in early childhood \n        education. Only 20 States and the District of Columbia require \n        teachers in prekindergarten programs to satisfy those \n        requirements. Thirty States allow caregivers with no previous \n        training to work in child care programs.\n\nSEC. 3.
