FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the western United States is currently experiencing its \n        worst drought in modern history;\n            (2) the drought in the western United States has caused--\n                    (A) severe losses in rural, agricultural, and \n                recreational economies;\n                    (B) detrimental effects on wildlife; and\n                    (C) increased risk of wildfires;\n            (3) it is estimated that throughout the western United \n        States tamarisk, a noxious and non-native plant--\n                    (A) occupies between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 acres \n                of land; and\n                    (B) is a nonbeneficial user of 2,000,000 to \n                4,500,000 acre-feet of water per year;\n            (4) the amount of nonbeneficial use of water by tamarisk--\n                    (A) is greater than the amount that valuable native \n                vegetation would have used; and\n                    (B) represents enough water for--\n                            (i) use by 20,000,000 or more people; or\n                            (ii) the irrigation of over 1,000,000 acres \n                        of land;\n            (5) scientists have established that tamarisk infestations \n        can--\n                    (A) increase soil and water salinity;\n                    (B) increase the risk of flooding through increased \n                sedimentation and decreased channel conveyance;\n                    (C) increase wildfire potential;\n                    (D) diminish human enjoyment of and interaction \n                with the river environment; and\n                    (E) adversely affect--\n                            (i) wildlife habitat for threatened and \n                        endangered species; and\n                            (ii) the abundance and biodiversity of \n                        other species; and\n            (6) as drought conditions and legal requirements relating \n        to water supply accelerate water shortages, innovative \n        approaches are needed to address the increasing demand for a \n        diminishing water supply.\n\nSEC. 3.
