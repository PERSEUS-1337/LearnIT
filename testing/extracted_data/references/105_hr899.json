Report on access to child care by low-income working families.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Availability and affordability of quality child care is \n        a major obstacle for working parents who struggle to remain \n        self-sufficient.\n                    (A) Compared to all other income groups, the \n                working poor are the least likely to receive assistance \n                with their child care costs.\n                    (B) Low-income families spend 24 percent of their \n                household income on child care, whereas middle-income \n                families spend 6 percent of their household income on \n                child care.\n                    (C) 38 States have waiting lists for child care for \n                the working poor. Among those States, Georgia has \n                41,000 individuals on its waiting list, Texas has \n                36,000 individuals on its waiting list, and Illinois \n                and Alabama each have 20,000 individuals on their \n                waiting lists.\n                    (D) One survey of low-income families on a waiting \n                list for subsidized child care found that of those \n                families paying for child care out of their own funds, \n                71 percent faced serious debt or bankruptcy.\n                    (E) Half of the States and the District of \n                Columbia, even before the enactment of the Personal \n                Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act \n                of 1996 (Public Law 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105) during the \n                104th Congress, increased the proportion of child care \n                slots or dollars going to families on welfare, rather \n                than to working poor families.\n            (2) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that there \n        will be $1,400,000,000 less expenditures of child care funds \n        for working poor families as a result of the States \n        implementing the work requirements imposed under the Personal \n        Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 \n        (Public Law 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105).\n            (3) Important types of child care are not available in \n        certain States including infant care, school-age care, care for \n        children with disabilities and special health care needs, and \n        child care for parents with unconventional or shifting work \n        hours.\n                    (A) A 1995 State study by the Comptroller General \n                of the United States found a shortage of child care for \n                infants and children with special needs in inner \n                cities, and a shortage of all types of child care in \n                rural areas.\n                    (B) Only one-third of the schools in low-income \n                neighborhoods offer school-age child care, compared \n                with 52 percent of schools in more affluent areas \n                offering such care.\n                    (C) Eighth-graders who are left home alone for 11 \n                or more hours a week report significantly greater use \n                of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana than eighth-\n                graders who are not left home alone.\n                    (D) Existing child care arrangements do not \n                accommodate the work schedules of many working women. \n                According to a 1995 statistic published by the \n                Department of Labor, 14,300,000 workers, nearly 1 in 5 \n                full-time workers work nonstandard hours, and more than \n                1 in 3 of those workers are women.\n                    (E) Only 10 percent of child care centers and 6 \n                percent of family day care providers offer child care \n                on weekends. Yet one-third of working mothers with \n                annual incomes below the poverty level and one-quarter \n                of mothers with annual incomes above the poverty level \n                but below $25,000 work on weekends.\n                    (F) Less than 30 percent of Head Start programs \n                operate on a full-time, full-year basis.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR CHILD CARE FOR LOW-INCOME \n              WORKING FAMILIES AND FOR CHILD CARE SUPPLY SHORTAGES.\n\n    Section 658B of the Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 \n(42 U.S.C. 9858) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(excluding subparagraphs (E) and (F) of \n        section 658E(c)(3))'' after ``subchapter'',\n            (2) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``There'', and\n            (3) and by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) There is authorized to be appropriated to provide child care \nservices under this chapter to satisfy the requirement specified in \nsection 658E(c)(3)(E) $1,400,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1997 \nthrough 2002.\n    ``(c) There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out child \ncare activities under this chapter to satisfy the requirement specified \nin section 658E(c)(3)(F) $500,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1997 \nthrough 2002.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
