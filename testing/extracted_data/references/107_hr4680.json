    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Science Undergraduate Community \nCollege Education Enhancement Development Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Providing a trained workforce needed to sustain the \n        Nation's post-industrial economy will require strengthening \n        undergraduate education in science, mathematics, and technology \n        at associate-degree-granting colleges.\n            (2) According to the American Association of Community \n        Colleges, nearly half of all United States undergraduate \n        college students are enrolled in associate-degree-granting \n        colleges.\n            (3) The National Science Foundation has determined that as \n        many as 40 percent of the Nation's science and mathematics \n        teachers have taken courses at associate-degree-granting \n        colleges, with an even higher percentage in some States.\n            (4) Associate-degree-granting colleges educate the vast \n        majority of the three to five technicians that support each \n        engineer, scientist, and medical doctor across the Nation.\n            (5) Millions of students take core mathematics and science \n        courses at associate-degree-granting colleges to lay the \n        groundwork for further studies. These core courses may be the \n        most important curricular component at these colleges because \n        they are required of all associate degree and transfer \n        students, including future teachers.\n            (6) The Advanced Technological Education Program \n        administered by the National Science Foundation has been \n        effective in improving advanced-technology education at \n        associate-degree-granting colleges and should be expanded, \n        including through activities to improve core education programs \n        in science, mathematics, and technology.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Associate-degree-granting college.--The term \n        ``associate-degree-granting college'' has the meaning given \n        that term in section 3(g)(2) of the Scientific and Advanced-\n        Technology Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 1862i(g)(2)).\n            (2) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n        the Foundation.\n            (3) Foundation.--The term ``Foundation'' means the National \n        Science Foundation.\n            (4) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Advanced \n        Technological Education Program of the Foundation.\n\nSEC. 4.
