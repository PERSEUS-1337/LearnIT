FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) historically, Federal education programs have addressed \n        the Nation's most pressing educational problems by providing \n        categorical assistance with detailed requirements relating to \n        the use of funds;\n            (2) while the approach described in paragraph (1) has \n        proven generally successful, some program requirements may \n        inadvertently impede educational achievement;\n            (3) the Nation's schools are being asked to deal \n        effectively with increasingly diverse educational needs that \n        current program structures may not be flexible enough to \n        address; and\n            (4) in an era when educational change and reform must \n        prevail, it is more important than ever to provide programs \n        that--\n                    (A) result in improved educational outcomes for all \n                students;\n                    (B) promote the coordination of education and \n                related services that benefit children and their \n                families;\n                    (C) respond flexibly to the needs of a diverse \n                student population;\n                    (D) stop the proliferation of unnecessary Federal, \n                State, and local regulation; and\n                    (E) place less emphasis on measuring resources and \n                reviewing procedures and more emphasis on achieving \n                program results.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a national \nprogram which--\n            (1) promotes educational reform that leads to improved \n        educational outcomes for participants in affected programs;\n            (2) holds accountable the schools and other recipients of \n        Federal funds for achieving specific educational goals in \n        exchange for increased flexibility in the use of their \n        resources; and\n            (3) enables school and program administrators, teachers, \n        parents, local educational agencies, and community groups to \n        work together to develop effective education programs that meet \n        the needs of all participants, particularly those who are \n        disadvantaged.\n\nSEC. 3. FLEXIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN EDUCATION AND RELATED \n              SERVICES.\n\n    Subpart 1 of part C of the General Education Provisions Act (20 \nU.S.C. 1221 et seq.) is amended by adding after section 421A the \nfollowing new section:\n\n``SEC. 421B.
