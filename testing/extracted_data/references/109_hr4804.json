    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``FHA Manufactured Housing Loan \nModernization Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) manufactured housing plays a vital role in providing \n        housing for low- and moderate-income families in the United \n        States;\n            (2) the FHA title I insurance program for manufactured home \n        loans traditionally has been a major provider of mortgage \n        insurance for home-only transactions;\n            (3) the manufactured housing market is in the midst of a \n        prolonged downturn which has resulted in a severe contraction \n        of traditional sources of private lending for manufactured home \n        purchases;\n            (4) during past downturns the FHA title I insurance program \n        for manufactured homes has filled the lending void by providing \n        stability until the private markets could recover;\n            (5) in 1992, during the manufactured housing industry's \n        last major recession, over 30,000 manufactured home loans were \n        insured under title I;\n            (6) in 2004, fewer than 2,000 manufactured housing loans \n        were insured under title I;\n            (7) the loan limits for title I manufactured housing loans \n        have not been adjusted for inflation since 1992; and\n            (8) these problems with the title I program have resulted \n        in an atrophied market for manufactured housing loans, leaving \n        American families who have the most difficulty achieving \n        homeownership without adequate financing options for home-only \n        manufactured home purchases.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide adequate funding for FHA-insured \n        manufactured housing loans for low- and moderate-income \n        homebuyers during all economic cycles in the manufactured \n        housing industry;\n            (2) to modernize the FHA title I insurance program for \n        manufactured housing loans to enhance participation by Ginnie \n        Mae and the private lending markets; and\n            (3) to adjust the low loan limits for title I manufactured \n        home loan insurance to reflect the increase in costs since such \n        limits were last increased in 1992 and to index the limits to \n        inflation.\n\nSEC. 3. EXCEPTION TO LIMITATION ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PORTFOLIO.\n\n    The second sentence of section 2(a) of the National Housing Act (12 \nU.S.C. 1703(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``In no case'' and inserting ``Other than \n        in connection with a manufactured home or a lot on which to \n        place such a home (or both), in no case''; and\n            (2) by striking ``: Provided, That with'' and inserting ``. \n        With''.\n\nSEC. 4.
