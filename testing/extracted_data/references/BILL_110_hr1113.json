FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n        inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.\n            (2) Crohn's disease may occur in any section of the \n        gastrointestinal tract but is predominately found in the lower \n        part of the small intestine and the large intestine. Ulcerative \n        colitis is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the \n        innermost lining of the colon. Complete removal of the colon in \n        patients with ulcerative colitis can potentially alleviate and \n        cure symptoms.\n            (3) Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis behave \n        similarly, they are collectively known as inflammatory bowel \n        disease. Both diseases present a variety of symptoms, including \n        severe diarrhea; abdominal pain with cramps; fever; and rectal \n        bleeding. There is no known cause of inflammatory bowel \n        disease, or medical cure.\n            (4) It is estimated that up to 1,400,000 people in the \n        United States suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, 30 \n        percent of whom are diagnosed during their childhood years.\n            (5) Children with inflammatory bowel disease miss school \n        activities because of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, and \n        many adults who had onset of inflammatory bowel disease as \n        children had delayed puberty and impaired growth and have never \n        reached their full genetic growth potential.\n            (6) Inflammatory bowel disease patients are at high risk \n        for developing colorectal cancer.\n            (7) The total annual medical costs for inflammatory bowel \n        disease patients is estimated at more than $2,000,000,000.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY \n              DISEASES; INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE RESEARCH EXPANSION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director of the National Institute of Diabetes \nand Digestive and Kidney Diseases shall expand, intensify, and \ncoordinate the activities of the Institute with respect to research on \ninflammatory bowel disease, with particular emphasis on the following \nareas:\n            (1) Genetic research on susceptibility for inflammatory \n        bowel disease, including the interaction of genetic and \n        environmental factors in the development of the disease.\n            (2) Research targeted to increase knowledge about the \n        causes and complications of inflammatory bowel disease in \n        children.\n            (3) Animal model research on inflammatory bowel disease, \n        including genetics in animals.\n            (4) Clinical inflammatory bowel disease research, including \n        clinical studies and treatment trials.\n            (5) Expansion of the Institute's Inflammatory Bowel Disease \n        Centers program with a focus on pediatric research.\n            (6) Other research initiatives identified by the scientific \n        document entitled ``Challenges in Inflammatory Bowel Disease'' \n        and the research agenda for pediatric gastroenterology, \n        hepatology, and nutrition entitled ``Chronic Inflammatory Bowel \n        Disease''.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n            (1) In general.--For the purpose of carrying out subsection \n        (a), there are authorized to be appropriated $80,000,000 for \n        fiscal year 2008, $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, and \n        $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2010.\n            (2) Reservation.--Of the amounts authorized to be \n        appropriated under paragraph (1), not more than 20 percent \n        shall be reserved for the training of qualified health \n        professionals in biomedical research focused on inflammatory \n        bowel disease, including pediatric investigators.\n\nSEC. 4.
