FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the leadership \n    of the Russian Federation has publicly committed itself to \n    building--\n            (A) a society with democratic political institutions and \n        practices, the observance of universally recognized standards \n        of human rights, and religious and press freedom; and\n            (B) a market economy based on internationally accepted \n        principles of transparency, accountability, and the rule of \n        law.\n        (2) In order to facilitate this transition, the international \n    community has provided multilateral and bilateral technical \n    assistance, and the United States' contribution to these efforts \n    has played an important role in developing new institutions built \n    on democratic and liberal economic foundations and the rule of law.\n        (3)(A) Since 1992, United States Government democratic reform \n    programs and public diplomacy programs, including training, and \n    small grants have provided access to and training in the use of the \n    Internet, brought nearly 40,000 Russian citizens to the United \n    States, and have led to the establishment of more than 65,000 \n    nongovernmental organizations, thousands of independent local media \n    outlets, despite governmental opposition, and numerous political \n    parties.\n        (B) These efforts contributed to the substantially free and \n    fair Russian parliamentary elections in 1995 and 1999.\n        (4) The United States has assisted Russian efforts to replace \n    its centrally planned, state-controlled economy with a market \n    economy and helped create institutions and infrastructure for a \n    market economy. Approximately two-thirds of the Russian \n    Federation's gross domestic product is now generated by the private \n    sector, and the United States recognized Russia as a market economy \n    on June 7, 2002.\n        (5)(A) The United States has fostered grassroots \n    entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation by focusing United \n    States economic assistance on small- and medium-sized businesses \n    and by providing training, consulting services, and small loans to \n    more than 250,000 Russian entrepreneurs.\n        (B) There are now more than 900,000 small businesses in the \n    Russian Federation, producing 12 to 15 percent, depending on the \n    estimate, of the gross domestic product of the Russian Federation.\n        (C) United States-funded programs have contributed to fighting \n    corruption and financial crime, such as money laundering, by \n    helping to--\n            (i) establish a commercial legal infrastructure;\n            (ii) develop an independent judiciary;\n            (iii) support the drafting of a new criminal code, civil \n        code, and bankruptcy law;\n            (iv) develop a legal and regulatory framework for the \n        Russian Federation's equivalent of the United States Securities \n        and Exchange Commission;\n            (v) support Russian law schools;\n            (vi) create legal aid clinics; and\n            (vii) bolster law-related activities of nongovernmental \n        organizations.\n        (6) Because the capability of Russian democratic forces and the \n    civil society to organize and defend democratic gains without \n    international support is uncertain, and because the gradual \n    integration of the Russian Federation into the global order of \n    free-market, democratic nations would enhance Russian cooperation \n    with the United States on a wide range of political, economic, and \n    security issues, the success of democracy in Russia is in the \n    national security interest of the United States, and the United \n    States Government should develop a far-reaching and flexible \n    strategy aimed at strengthening Russian society's support for \n    democracy and a market economy, particularly by enhancing Russian \n    democratic institutions and education, promoting the rule of law, \n    and supporting Russia's independent media.\n        (7) Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Russian \n    Federation has stood with the United States and the rest of the \n    civilized world in the struggle against terrorism and has \n    cooperated in the war in Afghanistan by sharing intelligence and \n    through other means.\n        (8) United States-Russia relations have improved, leading to a \n    successful summit between President Bush and President Putin in May \n    2002, resulting in a ``Foundation for Cooperation''.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n        (1) to strengthen and advance institutions of democratic \n    government and of free and independent media, and to sustain the \n    development of an independent civil society in the Russian \n    Federation based on religious and ethnic tolerance, internationally \n    recognized human rights, and an internationally recognized rule of \n    law; and\n        (2) to focus United States foreign assistance programs on using \n    local expertise and to give local organizations a greater role in \n    designing and implementing such programs, while maintaining \n    appropriate oversight and monitoring.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \nStates Government should--\n        (1) recognize that a democratic and economically stable Russian \n    Federation is inherently less confrontational and destabilizing in \n    its foreign policy and therefore that the promotion of democracy in \n    Russia is in the national security interests of the United States; \n    and\n        (2) continue and increase assistance to the democratic forces \n    in the Russian Federation, including the independent media, \n    regional administrations, democratic political parties, and \n    nongovernmental organizations.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United \nStates--\n        (1) to facilitate Russia's integration into the Western \n    community of nations, including supporting the establishment of a \n    stable democracy and a market economy within the framework of the \n    rule of law and respect for individual rights, including Russia's \n    membership in the appropriate international institutions;\n        (2) to engage the Government of the Russian Federation and \n    Russian society in order to strengthen democratic reform and \n    institutions, and to promote transparency and good governance in \n    all aspects of society, including fair and honest business \n    practices, accessible and open legal systems, freedom of religion, \n    and respect for human rights;\n        (3) to advance a dialogue among United States Government \n    officials, private sector individuals, and representatives of the \n    Government of the Russian Federation regarding Russia's integration \n    into the Western community of nations;\n        (4) to encourage United States Government officials and private \n    sector individuals to meet regularly with democratic activists, \n    human rights activists, representatives of the independent media, \n    representatives of nongovernmental organizations, civic organizers, \n    church officials, and reform-minded politicians from Moscow and all \n    other regions of the Russian Federation;\n        (5) to incorporate democratic reforms, the promotion of \n    independent media, and economic reforms in a broader United States \n    dialogue with the Government of the Russian Federation;\n        (6) to encourage the Government of the Russian Federation to \n    address, in a cooperative and transparent manner consistent with \n    internationally recognized and accepted principles, cross-border \n    issues, including the nonproliferation of weapons of mass \n    destruction, environmental degradation, crime, trafficking, and \n    corruption;\n        (7) to consult with the Government of the Russian Federation \n    and the Russian Parliament on the adoption of economic and social \n    reforms necessary to sustain Russian economic growth and to ensure \n    Russia's transition to a fully functioning market economy and \n    membership in the World Trade Organization;\n        (8) to persuade the Government of the Russian Federation to \n    honor its commitments made to the Organization for Security and \n    Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the November 1999 Istanbul \n    Conference, and to conduct a genuine good neighbor policy toward \n    the other independent states of the former Soviet Union in the \n    spirit of internationally accepted principles of regional \n    cooperation; and\n        (9) to encourage the G-8 partners and international financial \n    institutions, including the World Bank, the International Monetary \n    Fund, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to \n    develop financial safeguards and transparency practices in lending \n    to the Russian Federation.\n\nSEC. 4.
