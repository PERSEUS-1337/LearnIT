PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS EXERCISE.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), a \ngovernment shall not substantially burden a person's religious \nexercise--\n            (1) in a program or activity, operated by a government, \n        that receives Federal financial assistance; or\n            (2) in any case in which the substantial burden on the \n        person's religious exercise affects, or in which a removal of \n        that substantial burden would affect, commerce with foreign \n        nations, among the several States, or with Indian tribes;\neven if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.\n    (b) Exception.--A government may substantially burden a person's \nreligious exercise if the government demonstrates that application of \nthe burden to the person--\n            (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental \n        interest; and\n            (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that \n        compelling governmental interest.\n    (c) Limitation.--This Act does not apply if the only basis for \napplying the Act is subsection (a)(2) and if the government \ndemonstrates that all similar religious exercise and all substantial \nburdens on, or the removal of all substantial burdens from, similar \nreligious exercise would not lead in the aggregate to a substantial \neffect on commerce or on activities having a substantial relation to \ncommerce.\n    (d) Remedies of the United States.--Nothing in this section shall \nbe construed to authorize the United States to deny or withhold Federal \nfinancial assistance as a remedy for a violation of this Act. Nothing \nin this subsection shall be construed to deny, impair, or otherwise \naffect any right or authority of the Attorney General, the United \nStates, or any agency, officer, or employee of the United States, under \nlaw other than this subsection, including section 4(d), to institute or \nintervene in any action or proceeding.\n\nSEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.\n\n    (a) Procedure.--If a claimant produces prima facie evidence to \nsupport a claim alleging a violation of the Free Exercise Clause or a \nviolation of a provision of this Act enforcing that clause, the \ngovernment shall bear the burden of persuasion on any element of the \nclaim, except that the claimant shall bear the burden of persuasion on \nwhether the law (including a regulation) or government practice that is \nchallenged by the claim burdens or substantially burdens the claimant's \nexercise of religion.\n    (b) Land Use Regulation.--\n            (1) Limitation on land use regulation.--\n                    (A) Individualized assessments.--If, in applying or \n                implementing any land use regulation (including an \n                exemption), or system of land use regulations \n                (including exemptions), a government has the authority \n                to make individualized assessments of the proposed uses \n                to which real property would be put, the government may \n                not impose a substantial burden on the religious \n                exercise of a religious assembly or institution, or of \n                a person in the person's home, unless the government \n                demonstrates that application of the burden to that \n                assembly, institution, or person--\n                            (i) is in furtherance of a compelling \n                        governmental interest; and\n                            (ii) is narrowly tailored to further that \n                        compelling governmental interest.\n                    (B) Equal terms.--No government shall impose or \n                implement a land use regulation in a manner that does \n                not treat religious assemblies or institutions on equal \n                terms with nonreligious assemblies or institutions.\n                    (C) Nondiscrimination.--No government shall impose \n                or implement a land use regulation that discriminates \n                against any assembly or institution on the basis of \n                religion or religious denomination.\n                    (D) Exclusions and limits.--No government with \n                zoning authority shall unreasonably exclude from the \n                jurisdiction over which that government has authority, \n                or unreasonably limit within that jurisdiction, \nassemblies or institutions principally devoted to religious exercise.\n            (2) Full faith and credit.--Adjudication of a claim of a \n        violation of the Free Exercise Clause or this subsection in a \n        non-Federal forum shall be entitled to full faith and credit in \n        a Federal court only if the claimant had a full and fair \n        adjudication of that claim in the non-Federal forum.\n            (3) Nonpreemption.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n        preempt State law that is equally or more protective of \n        religious exercise.\n\nSEC. 4.

RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) Religious Belief Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued to authorize any government to burden any religious belief.\n    (b) Religious Exercise Not Regulated.--Nothing in this Act shall \ncreate any basis for restricting or burdening religious exercise or for \nclaims against a religious organization, including any religiously \naffiliated school or university, not acting under color of law.\n    (c) Claims to Funding Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall create \nor preclude a right of any religious organization to receive funding or \nother assistance from a government, or of any person to receive \ngovernment funding for a religious activity, but this Act may require \ngovernment to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a \nburden or a substantial burden on religious exercise.\n    (d) Other Authority To Impose Conditions on Funding Unaffected.--\nNothing in this Act shall--\n            (1) authorize a government to regulate or affect, directly \n        or indirectly, the activities or policies of a person other \n        than a government as a condition of receiving funding or other \n        assistance; or\n            (2) restrict any authority that may exist under other law \n        to so regulate or affect, except as provided in this Act.\n    (e) Governmental Discretion in Alleviating Burdens on Religious \nExercise.--A government may avoid the preemptive force of any provision \nof this Act by changing the policy or practice that results in a \nsubstantial burden on religious exercise, by retaining the policy or \npractice and exempting the substantially burdened religious exercise, \nby providing exemptions from the policy or practice for applications \nthat substantially burden religious exercise, or by any other means \nthat eliminates the substantial burden.\n    (f) Effect on Other Law.--With respect to a claim brought to \nenforce section 2(a)(2), proof that a substantial burden on a person's \nreligious exercise, or removal of that burden, affects or would affect \ncommerce shall not establish any inference or presumption that Congress \nintends that any religious exercise is, or is not, subject to any law \nother than this Act.\n    (g) Broad Construction.--This Act shall be construed in favor of a \nbroad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted \nby the terms of this Act and the Constitution.\n    (h) Severability.--If any provision of this Act or of an amendment \nmade by this Act, or any application of such provision to any person or \ncircumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this \nAct, the amendments made by this Act, and the application of the \nprovision to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\nSEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE UNAFFECTED.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect, interpret, or in \nany way address that portion of the first amendment to the Constitution \nprohibiting laws respecting an establishment of religion (referred to \nin this section as the ``Establishment Clause''). Granting government \nfunding, benefits, or exemptions, to the extent permissible under the \nEstablishment Clause, shall not constitute a violation of this Act. As \nused in this section, the term ``granting'', used with respect to \ngovernment funding, benefits, or exemptions, does not include the \ndenial of government funding, benefits, or exemptions.\n\nSEC. 7.
