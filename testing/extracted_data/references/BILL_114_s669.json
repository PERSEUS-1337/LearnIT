FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The acquisition of a nuclear weapon by the Islamic \n        Republic of Iran would pose a grave and serious threat to \n        international peace and security, including the national \n        security of the United States and its allies.\n            (2) The United States has led the international community \n        in imposing unprecedented and crippling sanctions with respect \n        to the nuclear program of Iran, which have helped to persuade \n        the leadership of Iran to return to the negotiating table.\n            (3) On November 24, 2013, Iran and the P5-plus-1 countries, \n        made up of the 5 permanent members of the United Nations \n        Security Council and Germany, entered into the Joint Plan of \n        Action in order to establish verifiable limits on the nuclear \n        activities of Iran that are of greatest concern with respect to \n        proliferation and to facilitate negotiations toward a final \n        comprehensive arrangement that would prevent Iran from \n        developing a nuclear weapon.\n            (4) On November 24, 2014, the P5-plus-1 countries and Iran \n        extended the Joint Plan of Action to allow negotiations to \n        continue with the goal of achieving a political framework \n        arrangement by the end of March 2015, and full technical \n        details by July 1, 2015.\n            (5) Under the Joint Plan of Action, the Government of Iran \n        has, among other steps, ceased enrichment of uranium to near-20 \n        percent fissile U-235, neutralized its stockpile of 20-percent \n        enriched uranium gas, halted major construction on its heavy \n        water reactor at Arak, halted the installation of additional \n        centrifuges and not operated its more advanced centrifuge \n        machines to accumulate enriched uranium, allowed more frequent \n        and intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy \n        Agency, and allowed managed access to centrifuge production-\n        related facilities and uranium mines and mills.\n            (6) The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported, \n        including in a January 20, 2015, report, that Iran has complied \n        with its obligations under the Joint Plan of Action.\n            (7) Iran has a history of deceit when it comes to its \n        nuclear program and any final comprehensive arrangement must be \n        airtight and verifiable to ensure that Iran will live up to its \n        commitments.\n            (8) The United States reserves the option to impose or \n        reimpose certain sanctions in the event that Iran violates the \n        Joint Plan of Action or any successor arrangement agreed to by \n        the P5-plus-1 countries and Iran.\n            (9) In his State of the Union address on January 20, 2015, \n        President Barack Obama said, ``[We have a chance to negotiate a \n        comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, \n        secures America and our allies--including Israel, while \n        avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no \n        guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all \n        options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
