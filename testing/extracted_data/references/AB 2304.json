    "title": "An act to add Chapter 7.5 (commencing with Section 485) to Division 1 of the Water Code, relating to water.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) A more efficient water transfer process and a more accessible water market can play important roles in reducing uncertainty and water shortage impacts on the state\u2019s economy now and in the future.\n(b)\nThe California Water Action Plan calls for making improvements to the water transfer process as part of a comprehensive, long-term water management policy.\n(c)\nWhile numerous water agencies and water users currently participate in the water market, water transfer processes are complex and water market information may not be readily available to the public and all potential sellers and buyers.\n(d)\nProviding greater transparency in and access to water marketing will provide a needed tool to increase water supplies by leveraging significant local and regional investments made over the past two decades to increase water supply reliability.\n(e)\nAn enhanced water market, used in conjunction with investments in conveyance, water use efficiency, including water conservation and water recycling, surface and groundwater storage, desalination, and other strategies, will add to the water supplies that are available to help the state weather multiple years of drought and protect economic and environmental uses of water.\n(f)\nVoluntary water transfers are a proven and effective way to help meet California\u2019s water needs, as evidenced by the landmark 1991 Governor\u2019s Emergency Drought Water Bank and numerous subsequent water banks, exchanges, and short- and long-term water transfers.\n(g)\nWater markets can improve water use efficiency and pricing, which in turn can contribute to increased water supply for consumptive uses, enhanced stream flows, and more water for wetlands and other environmental resources. This benefit would be of particular importance during prolonged drought.\n(h)\nImproving the water transfer process and enhancing access to water markets can accomplish all of the following:\n(1) Protect existing local and regional investments.\n(2)\nImprove coordination among water agencies.\n(3)\nIncentivize significant investments in water use efficiency projects and programs.\n(4)\nIncrease water supply and water supply reliability for urban and agricultural water users.\n(5)\nIncrease the quantities or improve the timing of water available for transfers by providing information to sellers and buyers who might not otherwise have sufficient information to participate in water markets.\n(6)\nBenefit the environment by enhancing the state\u2019s water supplies and increasing the amount or improving the timing of water available for environmental uses.\n(7)\nBenefit communities by bolstering water supplies and reducing reliance on groundwater resources.\nSEC. 2.\nChapter 7.5 (commencing with Section 485) is added to Division 1 of the Water Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  7.5. California Water Market Clearinghouse\n485.\nThis chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the California Water Market Clearinghouse Act of 2016.\n486.\nIt is the intent of the Legislature to create the California Water Market Clearinghouse to do all of the following:\n(a) Advance water sustainability, resiliency, and adaptability to drought and climate change by promoting efficient water markets.\n(b) Provide important benefits and opportunities for disadvantaged communities and environmental resources.\n(c) Increase agency coordination, transparency, and decisionmaking capacity.\n(d) Facilitate water transfers and water user access to exchanges by the establishment of a centralized market information platform and better coordinated review and approval processes, thereby streamlining the process. This can be achieved without a significant increase in the overall transaction costs or regulatory burdens associated with water transfer processes.\n(e) Enable and encourage public and private investments in water use efficiency and other water-saving measures through participation in water transfers and exchanges.\n(f) Promote and enable water transfers and exchanges as effective mechanisms for management of sustainable surface and groundwater resources in the state.\n(g) Protect environmental resources, including groundwater, consistent with the requirements of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Part 2.74 (commencing with Section 10720) of Division 6).\n(h) Protect drinking water supplies in areas of origin from cumulative impacts of multiple or long-term water transfers and exchanges.\n487.\n(a) On and after July 1, 2018, the California Water Market Clearinghouse shall operate as an independent office within the Natural Resources Agency.
