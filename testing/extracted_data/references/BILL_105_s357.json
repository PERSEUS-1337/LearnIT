FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante \n        National Monument applies only to Federal land within the \n        boundary of the Monument;\n            (2) multiple use has been and continues to be the guiding \n        principle in the management of public land;\n            (3) in accordance with Proclamation 6920, issued by the \n        President on September 18, 1996 (61 Fed. Reg. 50223 (1996), \n        Federal land within the Monument should remain open for \n        multiple uses;\n            (4) the United States should not lay claim to Federal water \n        rights in lands within the Monument except in accordance with \n        the substantive and procedural requirements of the State of \n        Utah, and designation of the Monument and enactment of this Act \n        should not impair exercise of water rights by the State of \n        Utah;\n            (5) mining revenues from Federal and State School and \n        Institutional Trust Lands have generated considerable revenues \n        for Utah schools;\n            (6) an estimated 176,000 acres of surface land containing \n        significant coal and other resources managed by the School and \n        Institutional Trust Lands Administration for the benefit of \n        Utah's school children are located within the boundary of the \n        Monument;\n            (7) the creation of the Monument must not come at the \n        expense of Utah's school children;\n            (8) designation of the Monument will produce a considerable \n        loss of future Federal royalties, State royalties, and school \n        trust royalties resulting in significant revenue loss to Utah's \n        school children; and\n            (9) the lack of congressional, State, and local \n        consultation prior to designation of the Monument and the \n        failure of the Proclamation to establish a specific boundary \n        for the Monument are certain to give rise to disputes that will \n        require boundary adjustments.\n\nSEC. 3.
