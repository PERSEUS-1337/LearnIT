FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Increased deployment and adoption of broadband, \n        including high-bandwidth uses of broadband, is key to allow \n        broadband stimulus funds to produce maximal economic recovery \n        and growth, and is key to the network effects of economic \n        benefit associated with the Internet.\n            (2) No volume usage service plan for broadband Internet \n        access can be just and reasonable unless charges are fairly \n        based on the cost of the usage.\n            (3) Volume usage charges for broadband Internet access that \n        are substantially above cost in a market without sufficient \n        competition constitute an unfair and unconscionable practice, \n        as substantially above-cost pricing has anti-competitive and \n        anti-consumer effects on Internet use, including in particular \n        Internet use for online video delivery.\n            (4) The market for video delivery is effectively controlled \n        by companies operating both traditional cable delivery and \n        broadband Internet access services, increasing incentives to \n        raise prices for Internet use in high volumes, to discourage \n        consumers who may wish no longer to subscribe to traditional \n        cable services.\n            (5) The Federal Trade Commission Act authorizes the Federal \n        Trade Commission to investigate and remedy consumer pricing \n        practices that it determines to be unfair or anti-competitive, \n        including pricing practices by Internet service providers, as \n        Internet services are not provided on a common carrier basis \n        and therefore are not subject to the common carrier limitation \n        on Federal Trade Commission jurisdiction.\n\nSEC. 3. UNJUST, UNREASONABLE, OR UNREASONABLY DISCRIMINATORY VOLUME \n              USAGE SERVICE PLANS.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for major broadband Internet \nservice providers to offer volume usage service plans imposing rates, \nterms, and conditions that are unjust, unreasonable, or unreasonably \ndiscriminatory.\n    (b) Service Plan Analysis Filing Required.--Major broadband \nInternet service providers offering, or proposing to offer, volume \nusage service plans to any portion of their service territory are \nrequired to file with the Federal Trade Commission a service plan \nanalysis that--\n            (1) identifies the different service tiers of broadband \n        Internet service to be offered on the basis of different data \n        transmission volumes;\n            (2) specifies the different rates, terms, and conditions to \n        be imposed for such tiers;\n            (3) provides an analysis of the economic reasonableness and \n        necessity for imposing such tiers--\n                    (A) based on assigning the capital costs of \n                deploying the facilities needed to provide such \n                different service tiers;\n                    (B) based on assigning different operating costs, \n                if any, that are attributable to the provision of \n                different service tiers; or\n                    (C) based on other factors and costs specified by \n                the provider as a justification for the proposed volume \n                usage service plan;\n            (4) assess the impact of such service tiers on the ability \n        of residential consumers to access widely used Internet \n        services, including uses for agricultural, medical, \n        educational, environmental, library, and nonprofit purposes; \n        and\n            (5) specifies the basis upon which the different rates of \n        charges under the service plan will be revised over the \n        following 3 years, and inflation factors or other variables \n        that will be used to calculate or limit such revisions.\n\nSEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Enforcement by FTC.--The Commission shall, in consultation with \nthe Federal Communications Commission, review each service plan \nanalysis submitted under section 3(b) in order to determine whether the \nvolume usage service plan is in violation of section 3(a). A violation \nof section 3(a) shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an \nunfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under section \n18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n57(a)(1)(B)). The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce this Act in \nthe same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction as \nthough all applicable terms and provision of the Federal Trade \nCommission Act were incorporated into and made a part of this Act.\n    (b) Review and Remediation.--After an initial review of any service \nplan analysis submitted under section 3(b), if the Commission \nidentifies any elements of such plan that appear to constitute a \nviolation of section 3(a), the Commission shall notify the provider \nsubmitting such plan of such elements and of the steps the provider may \ntake to correct such violations. The Commission shall, prior to \ninitiating any action under subsection (e), review the steps taken by \nthe provider to correct such violations.\n    (c) Factors Considered.--In determining whether a major broadband \nInternet service provider has violated section 3(a), the Commission, in \nconsultation with the Federal Communications Commission, shall take \ninto account, among other factors--\n            (1) whether the service plan analysis filed with the \n        Commission does not properly assign operating costs to each of \n        the service tiers within the volume usage service plan;\n            (2) whether the rates, terms, and conditions are not \n        justified by the costs of deploying or operating the facilities \n        required to provide and maintain the service tiers within the \n        volume usage service plan;\n            (3) whether the volume usage service plan imposes unjust, \n        unreasonable, or unreasonably discriminatory charges on \n        residential consumers;\n            (4) whether the volume usage service plan deters or \n        impedes--\n                    (A) the deployment of and access to widely used \n                Internet applications and services; or\n                    (B) the participation of residential consumers in \n                the growth and development of regional, national, and \n                international economies;\n            (5) whether the volume usage service plan unfairly \n        penalizes consumers choosing to use high bandwidth Internet \n        applications and services, including those used for one-way or \n        two-way video;\n            (6) whether the volume usage service plan has anti-\n        competitive effects on the market for video delivery or the \n        markets for Internet applications or services;\n            (7) whether the volume usage service plan imposes anti-\n        consumer rates, terms, or conditions that reflect insufficient \n        competition in the local market for broadband Internet \n        services; or\n            (8) whether the volume usage service plan fails to comply \n        with such other factors as the Commission, in consultation with \n        the Federal Communications Commission, determines to be \n        appropriate as set forth in the rules prescribed under section \n        5.\n    (d) Hearings.--As a component of its review of each plan submitted \nunder subsection (a), the Commission shall, after the provider \nsubmitting such plan has had an opportunity to take steps under \nsubsection (b) to correct any violations identified by the Commission \nin its notice to the provider under such subsection, provide for the \nconduct of a public hearing by a Commissioner or other designated \nemployee of the Commission, and for the collection of public comment \nand testimony with respect to such plan. Such hearing shall be \nconducted in a such a community or communities in such State or States \nas the Commission determines are most directly affected by the volume \nusage service plan.\n    (e) Civil Penalties.--\n            (1) Notwithstanding the penalties set forth under the \n        Federal Trade Commission Act, any major broadband Internet \n        service provider who violates section 3(a) shall be subject to \n        injunctive relief requiring the broadband Internet service \n        provider proposing or offering such plan to suspend, terminate, \n        or revise such plan.\n            (2) In addition to injunctive relief, any major broadband \n        Internet service provider who violates section 3(a) may be \n        subject to a fine of not more than $1,000,000, as the \n        Commission determines is required to ensure ongoing compliance \n        with this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. COMMISSION RULEMAKING REQUIRED.\n\n    Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nCommission shall, by rule prescribed in accordance with section 553 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, establish procedures for the review of \nvolume usage service plans and for the conduct of public hearings \npursuant to the requirements of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the authority of \nthe Commission to bring enforcement actions or take other measures \nunder the Federal Trade Commission Act or any other provision of law.\n\nSEC. 7.
