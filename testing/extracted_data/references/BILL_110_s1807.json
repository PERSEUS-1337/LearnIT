PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to develop and implement a \ncomprehensive and coordinated national weather mitigation policy and a \nnational cooperative Federal and State program of weather mitigation \nresearch and development.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to a 2003 report by the National Research \n        Council, ``people in drought- and hail-prone areas willingly \n        spend significant resources on weather mitigation programs, and \n        in 2001 there were at least 66 operational programs being \n        conducted in 10 States across the United States. At the same \n        time, less than a handful of weather mitigation research \n        programs are underway worldwide, and related research in the \n        United States has dropped to less than $500,000 per year from a \n        high of $20,000,000 in the late 1970s.'' The NRC report \n        entitled ``Critical Issues in Weather Modification Research'' \n        also states that ``a coordinated national program of weather \n        modification research is needed''. Such a program is supported \n        by States that need a scientific means of evaluating current \n        programs and increasing their effectiveness through applied \n        research.\n            (2) Droughts in the United States result in an average \n        economic loss between $6,000,000,000 and $8,000,000,000 \n        annually, while severe hail producing storms result in up to \n        $2,300,000,000 damage to crops and over $2,000,000,000 in \n        property loss annually. Snowpack, rain enhancement, and hail \n        suppression weather mitigation projects help reduce these \n        losses, and additional research in these areas will make \n        existing programs even more effective and permit them to better \n        quantify their impacts. Recent droughts in the Western United \n        States have produced low lake levels at Lake Powell and Lake \n        Mead and have led the Seven Colorado River Basin States to \n        create cooperative agreements. A separate cooperative agreement \n        is in place for wintertime snowfall enhancement programs in the \n        States of Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming to pursue water \n        augmentation to benefit the entire Colorado River System.\n            (3) Past and recent evaluations of the potential for \n        snowpack augmentation by cloud seeding in the Colorado River \n        Basin indicate a significant yield in runoff can be attained \n        through properly designed projects. A 2006 evaluation by the \n        Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior \n        indicates the potential for 800,000 additional acre-feet of \n        water.\n            (4) The impacts of possible climate change and the human \n        impact on weather are not well understood. Weather mitigation \n        research could provide data on what, if any, impact pollution \n        may have on the precipitation processes in cloud systems. \n        Research into inadvertent and planned weather mitigation may \n        increase our understanding and knowledge of any potential \n        impacts.\n            (5) The recent Weather Damage Modification Program \n        conducted by the Bureau of Reclamation employed a successful \n        model for combining local, State, and Federal resources in \n        providing a means for scientific evaluation of operational \n        cloud-seeding projects (rainfall and snowfall enhancement and \n        hail suppression) in North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, \n        Utah, Nevada, and California.\n\nSEC. 4.
