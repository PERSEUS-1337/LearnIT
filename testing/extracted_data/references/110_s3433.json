FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On November 26, 2007, President George W. Bush and \n        Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki signed the Declaration \n        of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and \n        Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States \n        of America (in this Act referred to as the ``Declaration of \n        Principles''), with the goal of concluding a final agreement or \n        agreements between the United States and Iraq by July 31, 2008, \n        ``with respect to the political, cultural, economic, and \n        security spheres.''\n            (2) The Declaration of Principles contemplates the United \n        States ``providing security assurances and commitments to the \n        Republic of Iraq to deter foreign aggression.''\n            (3) In 1992, pursuant to section 1457 of the National \n        Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (50 U.S.C. \n        404c), the executive branch submitted a report to Congress on \n        then-existing security commitments and arrangements.\n            (4) The report described in paragraph (3) defined a \n        ``security commitment'' as an ``obligation, binding under \n        international law, of the United States to act in the common \n        defense in the event of an armed attack on that country.'' The \n        report noted that all current security commitments of the \n        United States are ``embodied in treaties which receive the \n        advice and consent of the Senate.''\n            (5) The report defined a ``security arrangement'' as a \n        ``pledge by the United States to take some action in the event \n        of a threat to that country's security. Security arrangements \n        typically oblige the United States to consult with a country in \n        the event of a threat to its security. They may appear in \n        legally-binding agreements, such as treaties or executive \n        agreements, or in political documents, such as policy \n        declarations by the President, Secretary of State or Secretary \n        of Defense.''\n            (6) The United States Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, has \n        stated that the agreements to be concluded as anticipated by \n        the Declaration of Principles will ``deal with the status of \n        U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq past 2008'' and ``set the \n        broad parameters of the overall bilateral relationship in every \n        field''.\n            (7) On November 26, 2007, Assistant to the President and \n        Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan, \n        Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, stated, ``We don't anticipate \n        now that these negotiations [under the Declaration of \n        Principles] will lead to . . . formal inputs from Congress.''\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) any agreement that sets forth the ``broad parameters of \n        the overall bilateral relationship [as between the United \n        States and the Republic of Iraq] in every field,'' particularly \n        one that includes a security commitment or arrangement provided \n        to the Republic of Iraq by the United States, would result in \n        serious military, political, and economic obligations for the \n        United States, and thus, consistent with past practice, should \n        involve a joint decision by the executive and legislative \n        branches; and\n            (2) a short-term extension of the mandate of the Multi-\n        National Force in Iraq (currently provided by United Nations \n        Security Council Resolution 1790 (2007)), would, in concert \n        with Iraqi law, provide United States forces with the \n        authorities, privileges, and immunities necessary for those \n        forces to carry out their mission in Iraq.\n\nSEC. 4.
