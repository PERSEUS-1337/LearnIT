FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) law enforcement officials, including members of the \n        International Association of Chiefs of Police recognize that \n        violent crime represents the greatest threat to the safety and \n        security of citizens and that dedicated, ethical law \n        enforcement professionals and lawful community initiatives with \n        participation by members of the community represent the best \n        hope of responding to the challenges of violent crime;\n            (2) the International Association of Chiefs of Police \n        acknowledges that a few officers choose to violate the public \n        trust by abusing their authority or by breaking the law. Such \n        officers should not be able to seek police employment in \n        another state or jurisdiction with the expectation that they \n        will be able to conceal their history of misconduct;\n            (3) there have been numerous documented cases of officers \n        who have obtained officer employment and certification in a \n        state after revocation of officer certification or dishonorable \n        discharge in another state;\n            (4) a national clearinghouse of officer employment \n        histories would enable each criminal justice agency to conduct \n        thorough background checks on officer applicants and to assure \n        that only honest ethical officers are permitted to serve; and\n            (5) Federal legislation is needed that would require \n        Federal registration of employment termination data of law \n        enforcement officers and correctional officers.\n\nSEC. 3. REGISTRATION.\n\n    Subpart 1 of part E of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3781 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthereof the following:\n\n ``registration of employment data of law enforcement and correctional \n                               officers.\n\n    ``Sec. 509a. a(1) The Governor of each State, or chief executive of \neach territory of the United States, the District of Columbia or a \nNative American Indian tribe or band that receives funds under section \n506 in a fiscal year shall designate the state peace officer standards \nboard or its equivalent which shall submit a list, maintained \nelectronically, of all law enforcement and correctional officers who \nheld such office in such State or territory, the District of Columbia \nor a Native American Indian tribe or band on or since January 1, 1994, \nin accordance with paragraph (2). The list shall be submitted to an \nofficer or agency designated by the Attorney General of the United \nStates. The head of each department, agency, or other entity in the \nexecutive branch of the United States Government that employs law \nenforcement or correctional officers shall submit a list of all such \npersonnel employed on or after January 1, 1994. Such list shall be \nupdated and supplemented by agencies or officials responsible for \nsubmission of employment data in accordance with subsection (b).\n    ``(2) Such list shall include the names (and any former names), \ndates of birth, social security numbers, Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation fingerprint identification numbers if known, the dates of \nappointment as officers if known, the names and addresses or National \nCrime Information Center numbers of the appointing or employing \nagencies, and if applicable, the dates such service ended for such \nofficers.\n    ``(b) The agency or official responsible for submission of such \nemployment data shall, not later than 90 days after an officer's \nemployment, appointment, or separation from employment or appointment, \nnotify the agency or officer designated by the Attorney General of the \nUnited States to receive such employment data, that a law enforcement \nofficer or correctional officer has been appointed or employed as an \nofficer, or that a registered officer is no longer empowered or \nemployed as such.
