FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Each year more than 2,000,000 poisonings are reported to \n    poison control centers throughout the United States. More than 90 \n    percent of these poisonings happen in the home. Fifty-three percent \n    of poisoning victims are children younger than 6 years of age.\n        (2) Poison control centers are a valuable national resource \n    that provide life-saving and cost-effective public health services. \n    For every dollar spent on poison control centers, $7 in medical \n    costs are saved. The average cost of a poisoning exposure call is \n    $32, while the average cost if other parts of the medical system \n    are involved is $932. Over the last 2 decades, the instability and \n    lack of funding has resulted in a steady decline in the number of \n    poison control centers in the United States. Within just the last \n    year, 2 poison control centers have been forced to close because of \n    funding problems. A third poison control center is scheduled to \n    close in April 1999. Currently, there are 73 such centers.\n        (3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing \n    accessibility to poison control centers will increase the number of \n    United States residents who have access to a certified poison \n    control center, and reduce the inappropriate use of emergency \n    medical services and other more costly health care services.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services.\n\nSEC. 4.
