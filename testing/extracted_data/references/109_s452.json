    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Tsunami Early Warning and Relief Act \nof 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A tremendous undersea earthquake near Sumatra, \n        Indonesia, created a tsunami whose devastation spread \n        throughout South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Africa, leading \n        to the death of more than 160,000 people on December 26, 2004. \n        As of February 4, 2005, more than 140,000 people are still \n        missing. The tsunami-affected countries include Indonesia, Sri \n        Lanka, India, Thailand, Maldives, Seychelles, Bangladesh, \n        Burma, Malaysia, Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania.\n            (2) The tsunami resulted in massive destruction affecting \n        millions of people who now require a great amount of short-term \n        survival assistance and long-term rehabilitation and \n        reconstruction assistance.\n            (3) Compared to past disasters, the Indian Ocean earthquake \n        and tsunami led to historic destruction of the social service \n        infrastructure, businesses, and livelihoods. The devastation \n        caused by the tsunami has resulted in many separated families \n        and countless unaccompanied and orphaned children.\n            (4) An effective global tsunami warning system is critical \n        for preventing future humanitarian disasters and for protecting \n        national security, since tsunamis occurring anywhere around the \n        globe could impact the United States at home and United States \n        national interests abroad.\n            (5) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has \n        already built a system of tsunami buoys in the Pacific Ocean \n        which has been proven to provide critical information and \n        enhance the Nation's response to tsunamis. The National Oceanic \n        and Atmospheric Administration has the technical capability to \n        upgrade and expand this system so that it covers the entire \n        globe and is integrated into larger ocean observing efforts.\n            (6) Consistent funding and international cooperation would \n        be needed to deploy a broader global tsunami warning system.\n            (7) Effective local emergency management capabilities are \n        needed to relay tsunami warning information to coastal \n        communities and their residents.\n\n                    TITLE I--TSUNAMI WARNING SYSTEMS\n\nSEC. 101. GLOBAL PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Commerce shall establish a \nGlobal Tsunami Disaster Reduction Program within the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration for the establishment of a tsunami \nwarning system to protect vulnerable areas around the world, including \nAtlantic Ocean, Carribean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Indian Ocean, \nMediterranean Sea, and European areas.\n    (b) International Cooperation.--The Secretary of State, in \nconsultation with the Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, shall work with foreign countries that would benefit \nfrom the warning system described in subsection (a), and through \ninternational organizations, for the purposes of--\n            (1) sharing costs;\n            (2) sharing relevant data;\n            (3) sharing technical advice for the implementation of \n        dissemination and evacuation plans; and\n            (4) ensuring that the Global Earth Observation System of \n        Systems program has access to and shares openly all relevant \n        information worldwide.\n\nSEC. 102. EXPANSION OF UNITED STATES TSUNAMI READY PROGRAM.\n\n    The Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nshall work with coastal communities throughout the United States to \nbuild upon local coastal and ocean observing capabilities, improve \nabilities to disseminate tsunami information and prepare evacuation \nplans according to the requirements of the Tsunami Ready program of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and encourage more \ncommunities to participate in the program.\n\nSEC. 103. SEISMIC ACTIVITY MONITORING.\n\n    The Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nshall coordinate with the United States Geological Survey and the \nDepartment of State to work with other countries to enhance the \nmonitoring, through the Global Seismic Network (GSN), of seismic \nactivities that could lead to tsunamis, to support the programs \ndescribed in sections 101 and 102.\n\nSEC. 104. ANNUAL REPORT.\n\n    The Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nshall transmit an annual report to Congress on progress in carrying out \nthis title.\n\nSEC. 105.
