FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) a vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n        to creating jobs in a dynamic economy;\n            (2) uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n        in many instances have imposed on small business concerns and \n        other small entities unnecessary and disproportionately \n        burdensome demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting \n        costs;\n            (3) since 1980, under chapter 6 of title 5, United States \n        Code (commonly known as the ``Regulatory Flexibility Act''), \n        Federal agencies have been required to recognize and take \n        account of the differences in the scale and resources of \n        regulated entities, but have failed to do so;\n            (4) a recent report prepared for the Office of Advocacy of \n        the Small Business Administration found that in 2004, the per-\n        employee cost of Federal regulations for firms with fewer than \n        20 employees was $7,647, 44.8 percent more than the $5,282 per-\n        employee cost faced by businesses with 500 or more workers;\n            (5) Federal agencies have failed to analyze and uncover \n        less costly alternative regulatory approaches, despite the fact \n        that the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires them to do so; and\n            (6) the regulatory playing field for small business \n        concerns should be leveled, making it easier for them to comply \n        with complex regulations.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Board'' means the Public Company Accounting \n        Oversight Board established under section 101 of the Sarbanes-\n        Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7211);\n            (2) the term ``Commission'' means the Securities and \n        Exchange Commission; and\n            (3) the term ``small business concern'' has the same \n        meaning as in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n        632).\n\nSEC. 4. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS REQUIRED.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, before the Commission \napproves any final rule of the Board in accordance with section 107(b) \nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7217(b)), the Commission \nshall conduct and complete an analysis of such rule in accordance with \nsection 604 of title 5, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 5. SMALL BUSINESS COMPLIANCE GUIDE REQUIRED.\n\n    The Commission shall publish the small business compliance guide, \nas required by section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note) on the same date as the date \nof publication of the final rule (or as soon as possible after that \ndate) issued to carry out section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 \n(15 U.S.C. 7262).\n\nSEC. 6. STUDY AND REPORT ON EFFECTS ON SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.\n\n    (a) Assessment of Effects on Small Business.--\n            (1) In general.--Two years after the date on which final \n        rules are published by the Board to carry out section 404 of \n        the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7262), the \n        Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct an \n        assessment of the impact on small business concerns of such \n        rules and prepare a report on such assessment.\n            (2) Content.--The assessment and report required by this \n        section shall--\n                    (A) quantify how both the regulatory requirements \n                of the Commission and the auditing requirements of the \n                Board are affecting small business concerns;\n                    (B) be modeled on the investigation of the Advisory \n                Committee on Smaller Public Companies of the Commission \n                into the regulatory burdens posed by the rules of the \n                Commission;\n                    (C) include an assessment of the costs and time \n                commitments imposed on small business concerns by the \n                requirements of the Commission and the Board, and an \n                estimate of whether or not such costs of compliance are \n                expected to decrease or increase in the future;\n                    (D) document how the Commission and the Board \n                worked together, since issuing the final compliance \n                guide described in section 5, to help small business \n                concerns comply with their regulatory requirements; and\n                    (E) include recommendations and regulatory \n                alternatives on how to simplify or improve the process \n                of compliance with Commission and Board requirements \n                for small business concerns.\n    (b) Availability of Report.--Upon completion of the report required \nby this section, such report shall be--\n            (1) submitted to the Committee on Small Business and \n        Entrepreneurship of the Senate, the Committee on Small Business \n        of the House of Representatives, and the Small Business \n        Administration; and\n            (2) made available to the public."
