VENEMAN.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1998, a lawsuit was filed against the Department of \n        Agriculture (referred to in this subsection as the ``USDA''), \n        the second largest agency of the Federal Government, alleging \n        that the USDA had violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 \n        U.S.C. 1691 et seq.) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 \n        U.S.C. 551 et seq.) by maintaining a pattern and practice of \n        discrimination against African-American farmers. Such pattern \n        and practice delayed, denied, or otherwise frustrated the \n        efforts of African-American farmers to obtain loan assistance \n        and to engage in the vocation of farming.\n            (2) In January 1999, the United States District Court of \n        the District of Columbia approved the largest civil rights \n        settlement in the history of the United States. Following the \n        settlement, the African-American farmers and the USDA entered \n        into a five-year consent decree.\n            (3) In April 1999, the court approved the settlement and \n        assigned four entities to facilitate implementation of the \n        consent decree.\n            (4) According to a USDA Inspector General report, many \n        discrimination complaints were never processed, investigated, \n        or otherwise resolved, and the discrimination complaint process \n        at the Farm Services Agency lacked ``integrity, direction, and \n        accountability''.\n            (5) Delays in processing the discrimination claims of many \n        African-American farmers resulted in numerous farmers losing \n        their right to file claims.\n            (6) As of July 14, 2000, the statute of limitations \n        provided under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act has run on many \n        of the claims.\n            (7) On November 18, 2004, the Subcommittee on the \n        Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n        Representatives received sworn testimony that alleged serious \n        violations of the right to notice as it applied to the consent \n        decree and to all those who had viable claims of discrimination \n        against the USDA.\n            (8) Such testimony further alleged that although the \n        consent decree notice campaign was deemed to be effective by \n        the court, that campaign proved deficient because approximately \n        66,000 potential class members submitted their claims in an \n        untimely fashion.\n            (9) Approximately 73,800 petitions were filed before the \n        September 15, 2000, late filing deadline, of which only 2,131 \n        were approved.\n            (10) Of the approximately 21,000 timely requests for \n        reconsideration, 10,745 of those requests have been decided, \n        but only 140 have been approved.\n    (b) De Novo Review of Certain Claims Filed in Pigford V. Veneman.--\nA person who submitted a petition for redress in the settlement of the \nrelevant case before the date of the enactment of this Act may obtain \nde novo consideration of the petition before an adjudicator assigned by \nthe facilitator of the consent decree of such case if--\n            (1) the petition was denied on the grounds of untimely \n        filing;\n            (2) not later than one year after the date of the enactment \n        of this Act, such person submits a subsequent petition for \n        redress in such settlement; and\n            (3) such person submits an affidavit to the adjudicator \n        asserting that such person did not receive effective notice of \n        the filing deadline in such consent decree.\n    (c) Notice to USDA.--Not later than 30 days after a person submits \na petition pursuant to subsection (b)(2), the facilitator of the \nconsent decree of the relevant case shall provide notice to the \nSecretary of Agriculture of such petition.\n    (d) Loan Data.--\n            (1) Report to person submitting petition.--Not later than \n        60 days after the Secretary of Agriculture receives notice \n        pursuant to subsection (c) of a petition filed pursuant to \n        subsection (b)(2), the Secretary shall provide to the person \n        that filed such petition a report on farm credit loans made \n        within the claimant's State by the Department during the period \n        beginning on January 1, 1992, and ending on the date of the \n        enactment of this Act.
