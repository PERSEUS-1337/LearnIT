    "content": "Established in 1953, the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) origins can be traced to the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II, when concerns about unemployment and war production were paramount. The SBA assumed some of the functions of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which had been created by the federal government in 1932 to provide funding for businesses of all sizes during the Depression and later financed war production. During the early 1950s, the RFC was disbanded following charges of political favoritism in the granting of loans and contracts. In 1953, Congress passed the Small Business Act (P.L. 83-163), which authorized the SBA. The act specifies that the SBA's mission is to promote the interests of small businesses to enhance competition in the private marketplace: It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation. The SBA currently administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. Congressional interest in these programs has increased in recent years, primarily because small businesses are viewed as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. Many Members of Congress also regularly receive constituent inquiries about the SBA's programs. This report provides an overview of the SBA's programs and funding. It also references other CRS reports that examine the SBA's programs in greater detail. The SBA's FY2020 congressional budget justification document includes funding and program costs for the following programs and offices: 1. entrepreneurial development programs (including Small Business Development Centers, Women's Business Centers, SCORE, Entrepreneurial Education, Native American Outreach, PRIME, the State Trade Expansion Program, and veterans' programs); 2. disaster assistance; 3. capital access programs (including the 7(a) loan guaranty program, the 504/Certified Development Company [CDC] loan guaranty program, the Microloan program, International Trade and Export Promotion programs, and lender oversight); 4. contracting programs (including the 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance program, the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development program, the Historically Underutilized Business Zones [HUBZones] program, the Prime Contract Assistance program, the Women's Business program, the Subcontracting program, and the Surety Bond Guarantee program); 5. regional and district offices (counseling, training, and outreach services); 6. the Office of Inspector General (OIG); 7. capital investment programs (including the Small Business Investment Company [SBIC] program, the New Market Venture Capital program, the Small Business Innovation Research [SBIR] program, the Small Business Technology Transfer program [STTR], and growth accelerators); 8. the Office of Advocacy; and 9. executive direction programs (the National Women's Business Council, Office of Ombudsman, and Faith-Based Initiatives).  Table 1 shows the SBA's estimated costs in FY2019 for these program areas. Program costs often differ from new budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts because the SBA has specified authority to carry over appropriations from previous fiscal years. The SBA also has limited, specified authority to shift appropriations among various programs. SBA disaster assistance is provided in the form of loans, not grants, which must be repaid to the federal government. The SBA's disaster loans are unique in two respects: they are the only loans made by the SBA that (1) go directly to the ultimate borrower and (2) are not limited to small businesses. SBA disaster loans are available to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations in declared disaster areas. About 80% of the SBA's direct disaster loans are issued to individuals and households (renters and property owners) to repair and replace homes and personal property. In recent years, the SBA Disaster Loan Program has been the subject of regular congressional and media attention because of concerns expressed about the time it takes the SBA to process disaster loan applications. The SBA disbursed $401 million in disaster loans in FY2016, $889 million in FY2017, and $3.59 billion in FY2018. The SBA Disaster Loan Program includes the following categories of loans for disaster-related losses: home disaster loans, business physical disaster loans, and economic injury disaster loans. Homeowners, renters, and personal property owners located in a declared disaster area (and in contiguous counties) may apply to the SBA for loans to help recover losses from a declared disaster. Only victims located in a declared disaster area (and contiguous counties) are eligible to apply for disaster loans. Disaster declarations are \"official notices recognizing that specific geographic areas have been damaged by floods and other acts of nature, riots, civil disorders, or industrial accidents such as oil spills.\" Five categories of declarations put the SBA Disaster Loan Program into effect. These include two types of presidential major disaster declarations as authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) and three types of SBA declarations. The SBA's Home Disaster Loan Program falls into two categories: personal property loans and real property loans. These loans are limited to uninsured losses. The maximum term for SBA disaster loans is 30 years, but the law restricts businesses with credit available elsewhere to a maximum 7-year term. The SBA sets the installment payment amount and corresponding maturity based upon each borrower's ability to repay. A personal property loan provides a creditworthy homeowner or renter with up to $40,000 to repair or replace personal property items, such as furniture, clothing, or automobiles, damaged or lost in a disaster. These loans cover only uninsured or underinsured property and primary residences and cannot be used to replace extraordinarily expensive or irreplaceable items, such as antiques or recreational vehicles. Interest rates vary depending on whether applicants are able to obtain credit elsewhere. For applicants who can obtain credit without SBA assistance, the interest rate may not exceed 8% per year. For applicants who cannot obtain credit without SBA assistance, the interest rate may not exceed 4% per year. A creditworthy homeowner may apply for a real property loan of up to $200,000 to repair or restore his or her primary residence to its predisaster condition. The loans may not be used to upgrade homes or build additions, unless upgrades or changes are required by city or county building codes. The interest rate for real property loans is determined in the same way as it is determined for personal property loans.  Several types of loans, discussed below, are available to businesses and nonprofit organizations located in counties covered by a presidential disaster declaration. In certain circumstances, the SBA will also make these loans available when a governor, the Secretary of Agriculture, or the Secretary of Commerce makes a disaster declaration. Physical disaster loans are available to almost any nonprofit organization or business. Other business disaster loans are limited to small businesses. Any business or nonprofit organization, regardless of size, can apply for a physical disaster business loan of up to $2 million for repairs and replacements to real property, machinery, equipment, fixtures, inventory, and leasehold improvements that are not covered by insurance. Physical disaster loans for businesses may use up to 20% of the verified loss amount for mitigation measures in an effort to prevent loss from a similar disaster in the future. Nonprofit organizations that are rejected or approved by the SBA for less than the requested amount for a physical disaster loan are, in some circumstances, eligible for grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). For applicants that can obtain credit without SBA assistance, the interest rate may not exceed 8% per year. For applicants that cannot obtain credit without SBA assistance, the interest rate may not exceed 4% per year. Economic injury disaster loans (EIDLs) are limited to small businesses as defined by the SBA's size regulations, which vary from industry to industry. If the Secretary of Agriculture designates an agriculture production disaster, small farms and small cooperatives are eligible. EIDLs are available in the counties included in a presidential disaster declaration and contiguous counties. The loans are designed to provide small businesses with operating funds until those businesses recover. The maximum loan is $2 million, and the terms are the same as personal and physical disaster business loans. The loan can have a maturity of up to 30 years and has an interest rate of 4% or less. The SBA's entrepreneurial development (ED) noncredit programs provide a variety of management and training services to small businesses. Initially, the SBA provided its own management and technical assistance training programs. Over time, the SBA has come to rely increasingly on third parties to provide that training.  The SBA receives appropriations for seven ED programs and two ED initiatives: Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs); the Microloan Technical Assistance Program; Women Business Centers (WBCs); SCORE; the Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs (PRIME); Veterans Programs (including Veterans Business Outreach Centers, Boots to Business, Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship [VWISE], Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities, and Boots to Business: Reboot); the Native American Outreach Program (NAO); the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative (Regional Innovation Clusters); and the Entrepreneurship Education Initiative. FY2019 appropriations for these programs are $131 million for SBDCs, $31 million for the Microloan Technical Assistance Program, $18.5 million for WBCs, $11.7 million for SCORE, $5 million for PRIME, $12.7 million for Veterans Programs, $2 million for NAO, $5 million for the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative (Regional Innovation Clusters), and $3.5 million for the Entrepreneurship Education Initiative. Four additional programs are provided recommended funding in appropriations acts under ED programs, but are discussed in other sections of this report because of the nature of their assistance: (1) the SBA's Growth Accelerators Initiative ($2 million in FY2019) is a capital investment program and is discussed in the capital access programs section; (2) the SBA's 7(j) Technical Assistance Program ($2.8 million in FY2019) provides contacting assistance and is discussed in the contracting programs section; (3) the National Women's Business Council ($1.5 million in FY2019) is a bipartisan federal advisory council and is discussed in the executive direction programs section; and (4) the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP, $18 million in FY2019) provides grants to states to support export programs that assist small business concerns. STEP is discussed in the capital access programs' international trade and export promotion programs subsection. The SBA reports that over 1 million aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners receive training from an SBA-supported resource partner each year. Some of this training is free, and some is offered at low cost. SBDCs provide free or low-cost assistance to small businesses using programs customized to local conditions. SBDCs support small business in marketing and business strategy, finance, technology transfer, government contracting, management, manufacturing, engineering, sales, accounting, exporting, and other topics. SBDCs are funded by grants from the SBA and matching funds. There are 63 lead SBDC service centers, one located in each state (four in Texas and six in California), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. These lead SBDC service centers manage more than 900 SBDC outreach locations. The SBA's Microloan Technical Assistance program is part of the SBA's Microloan program but receives a separate appropriation. It provides grants to Microloan intermediaries to offer management and technical training assistance to Microloan program borrowers and prospective borrowers. There are currently 147 active Microloan intermediaries serving 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  WBCs are similar to SBDCs, except they concentrate on assisting women entrepreneurs. There are currently 121 WBCs, with at least one WBC in most states and territories. SCORE was established on October 5, 1964, by then-SBA Administrator Eugene P. Foley as a national, volunteer organization, uniting more than 50 independent nonprofit organizations into a single, national nonprofit organization. SCORE's 320 chapters and more than 800 branch offices are located throughout the United States and partner with more than 11,000 volunteer counselors, who are working or retired business owners, executives, and corporate leaders, to provide management and training assistance to small businesses. PRIME provides SBA grants to nonprofit microenterprise development organizations or programs that have \"a demonstrated record of delivering microenterprise services to disadvantaged entrepreneurs; an intermediary; a microenterprise development organization or program that is accountable to a local community, working in conjunction with a state or local government or Indian tribe; or an Indian tribe acting on its own, if the Indian tribe can certify that no private organization or program referred to in this paragraph exists within its jurisdiction.\" The SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development (OVBD) administers several management and training programs to assist veteran-owned businesses, including 22 Veterans Business Outreach Centers which provide \"entrepreneurial development services such as business training, counseling and resource partner referrals to transitioning service members,\u00a0veterans,\u00a0National Guard & Reserve members and military spouses interested in starting or growing a small business.\" The SBA's Office of Native American Affairs provides management and technical educational assistance to Native Americans (American Indians, Alaska natives, native Hawaiians, and the indigenous people of Guam and American Samoa) to start and expand small businesses. The SBA reports that \"regional innovation clusters are on-the-ground collaborations between business, research, education, financing and government institutions that work to develop and grow the supply chain of a particular industry or related set of industries in a geographic region.\" The SBA has supported the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative (Regional Innovation Clusters) since FY2009, and the initiative has received recommended appropriations from Congress since FY2010. The SBA's Entrepreneurship Education initiative provides assistance to high-growth small businesses in underserved communities through the Emerging Leaders initiative and the SBA Learning Center. The Emerging Leaders initiative is a seven\u2010month executive leader education series consisting of \"more than 100 hours of specialized training, technical support, access to a professional network, and other resources to strengthen their businesses and promote economic development.\" At the conclusion of the training, \"participants produce a three\u2010year strategic growth action plan with benchmarks and performance targets that help them access the necessary support and resources to move forward for the next stage of business growth.\" The Learning Center is the SBA's primary online training service, which offers free online courses on business planning, marketing, government contracting, accounting, and social media, providing learners an \"opportunity to access entrepreneurship education resources through toolkits, fact sheets, infographic tip sheets, instructor guides, and audio content.\" The SBA has authority to make direct loans but, with the exception of disaster loans and loans to Microloan program intermediaries, has not exercised that authority since 1998. The SBA indicated that it stopped issuing direct business loans primarily because the subsidy rate was \"10 to 15 times higher\" than the subsidy rate for its loan guaranty programs. Instead of making direct loans, the SBA guarantees loans issued by approved lenders to encourage those lenders to provide loans to small businesses \"that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions.\" With few exceptions, to qualify for SBA assistance, an organization must be both a business and small. To participate in any of the SBA programs, a business must meet the Small Business Act's definition of small business . This is a business that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the United States; operates primarily within the United States or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor; is independently owned and operated; is not dominant in its field on a national basis; and does not exceed size standards established, and updated periodically, by the SBA.  The business may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal form. The SBA uses two measures to determine if a business is small: SBA-derived industry specific size standards or a combination of the business's net worth and net income. For example, businesses participating in the SBA's 7(a) loan guaranty program are deemed small if they either meet the SBA's industry-specific size standards for firms in 1,047 industrial classifications in 18 subindustry activities described in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) or do not have more than $15 million in tangible net worth and not more than $5 million in average net income after federal taxes (excluding any carryover losses) for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application. All of the company's subsidiaries, parent companies, and affiliates are considered in determining if it meets the size standard. The SBA's industry size standards vary by industry, and they are based on one of the following four measures: the firm's (1) average annual receipts in the previous three years, (2) number of employees, (3) asset size, or (4) for refineries, a combination of number of employees and barrel per day refining capacity. Historically, the SBA has used the number of employees to determine if manufacturing and mining companies are small and average annual receipts for most other industries. The SBA's size standards are designed to encourage competition within each industry; they are derived through an assessment of the following four economic factors: \"average firm size, average assets size as a proxy of start-up costs and entry barriers, the 4-firm concentration ratio as a measure of industry competition, and size distribution of firms.\" The SBA also considers the ability of small businesses to compete for federal contracting opportunities and, when necessary, several secondary factors \"as they are relevant to the industries and the interests of small businesses, including technological change, competition among industries, industry growth trends, and impacts of size standard revisions on small businesses.\"  The SBA provides loan guarantees for small businesses that cannot obtain credit elsewhere. Its largest loan guaranty programs are the 7(a) loan guaranty program, the 504/CDC loan guaranty program, international trade and export promotion programs, and the Microloan program. The SBA's loan guaranty programs require personal guarantees from borrowers and share the risk of default with lenders by making the guaranty less than 100%. In the event of a default, the borrower owes the amount contracted less the value of any collateral liquidated. The SBA can attempt to recover the unpaid debt through administrative offset, salary offset, or IRS tax refund offset. Most types of businesses are eligible for loan guarantees, but a few are not. A list of ineligible businesses (such as insurance companies, real estate investment firms, firms involved in financial speculation or pyramid sales, and businesses involved in illegal activities) is contained in 13 C.F.R. Section 120.110. With one exception, nonprofit and charitable organizations are also ineligible. As shown in the following tables, most of these programs charge fees to help offset program costs, including costs related to loan defaults. In most instances, the fees are set in statute. For example, for 7(a) loans with a maturity exceeding 12 months, the SBA is authorized to charge lenders an up-front guaranty fee of up to 2% for the SBA guaranteed portion of loans of $150,000 or less, up to 3% for the SBA guaranteed portion of loans exceeding $150,000 but not more than $700,000, and up to 3.5% for the SBA guaranteed portion of loans exceeding $700,000. Lenders with a 7(a) loan that has a SBA guaranteed portion in excess of $1 million can be charged an additional fee not to exceed 0.25% of the guaranteed amount in excess of $1 million.  7(a) loans are also subject to an ongoing servicing fee not to exceed 0.55% of the outstanding balance of the guaranteed portion of the loan. In addition, lenders are authorized to collect fees from borrowers to offset their administrative expenses. In an effort to assist small business owners, in FY2019, the SBA is waiving the annual service fee for 7(a) loans of $150,000 or less made to small businesses located in a rural area or a HUBZone and reducing the up-front one-time guaranty fee for these loans from 2.0% to 0.6667% of the guaranteed portion of the loan in FY2019; and pursuant to P.L. 114-38 , the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, the up-front, one-time guaranty fee on all veteran loans under the 7(a) SBAExpress program (up to and including $350,000). The SBA's goal is to achieve a zero subsidy rate, meaning that the appropriation of budget authority for new loan guaranties is not required.  As shown in Table 2 , the SBA's fees and proceeds from loan liquidations do not always generate sufficient revenue to cover loan losses, resulting in the need for additional appropriations to account for the shortfall. However, \"due to the continued improvement in performance in the loan portfolio,\" the SBA did not request funding for credit subsidies for the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs in FY2016-FY2019.  The 7(a) loan guaranty program is named after the section of the Small Business Act that authorizes it. These are loans made by SBA lending partners (mostly banks but also some other financial institutions) and partially guaranteed by the SBA. In FY2018, the SBA approved 60,353 7(a) loans totaling nearly $25.4 billion. In FY2018, there were 1,810 active lending partners providing 7(a) loans. The 7(a) program's current guaranty rate is 85% for loans of $150,000 or less and 75% for loans greater than $150,000 (up to a maximum guaranty of $3.75 million\u201475% of $5 million). Although the SBA's offer to guarantee a loan provides an incentive for lenders to make the loan, lenders are not required to do so. Lenders are permitted to charge borrowers fees to recoup specified expenses and are allowed to charge borrowers \"a reasonable fixed interest rate\" or, with the SBA's approval, a variable interest rate. The SBA uses a multistep formula to determine the maximum allowable fixed interest rate for all 7(a) loans (with the exception of the Export Working Capital Program and Community Advantage loans) and periodically publishes that rate and the maximum allowable variable interest rate in the Federal Register . Maximum interest rates allowed on variable-rate 7(a) loans are pegged to either the prime rate, the 30-day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 3%, or the SBA optional peg rate, which is a weighted average of rates that the federal government pays for loans with maturities similar to the guaranteed loan. The allowed spread over the prime rate, LIBOR base rate, or SBA optional peg rate depends on the loan amount and the loan's maturity (under seven years or seven years or more). The adjustment period can be no more than monthly and cannot change over the life of the loan.  Table 3 provides information on the 7(a) program's key features, including its eligible uses, maximum loan amount, loan maturity, fixed interest rates, and guarantee fees. The 7(a) program has several specialized programs that offer streamlined and expedited loan procedures for particular groups of borrowers, including the SBAExpress program (for loans of $350,000 or less), the Export Express program (for loans of up to $500,000 for entering or expanding an existing export market), and the Community Advantage pilot program (for loans of $250,000 or less). The SBA also has a Small Loan Advantage program (for loans of $350,000 or less), but it is currently being used as the 7(a) program's model for processing loans of $350,000 or less and exists as a separate, specialized program in name only. The SBAExpress program was established as a pilot program by the SBA on February 27, 1995, and made permanent through legislation, subject to reauthorization, in 2004 ( P.L. 108-447 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005). The program is designed to increase the availability of credit to small businesses by permitting lenders to use their existing documentation and procedures in return for receiving a reduced SBA guarantee on loans. It provides a 50% loan guarantee on loan amounts of $350,000 or less. The loan proceeds can be used for the same purposes as the 7(a) program, except participant debt restructuring cannot exceed 50% of the project and may be used for revolving credit. The program's fees and loan terms are the same as the 7(a) program, except the term for a revolving line of credit cannot exceed seven years.  The Community Advantage pilot program began operations on February 15, 2011, and is limited to mission-focused lenders targeting underserved markets. Originally scheduled to cease operations on March 15, 2014, the program has been extended several times and is currently scheduled to operate through September 30, 2022. As of September 12, 2018, there were 113 approved CA lenders, 99 of which were actively making and servicing CA loans. The SBA placed a moratorium, effective October 1, 2018, on accepting new CA lender applications, primarily as a means to mitigate the risk of future loan defaults. Lenders must receive SBA approval to participate in these 7(a) specialized programs. In addition to the 7(a) loan guaranty program, the SBA has special purpose loan guaranty programs for small businesses adjusting to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to support Employee Stock Ownership Program trusts, pollution control facilities, and working capital. Community Adjustment and Investment Program. The Community Adjustment and Investment Program (CAIP) uses federal funds to pay the fees on 7(a) and 504/CDC loans to businesses located in communities that have been adversely affected by NAFTA. Employee Trusts. The SBA will guarantee loans to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) that are used either to lend money to the employer or to purchase control from the owner. ESOPs must meet regulations established by the IRS, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Labor. These are 7(a) loans. Pollution Control. In 1976, the SBA was provided authorization to guarantee the payment of rentals or other amounts due under qualified contracts for pollution control facilities. P.L. 100-590 , the Small Business Reauthorization and Amendment Act of 1988, eliminated the revolving fund for pollution control guaranteed loans and transferred its remaining funds to the SBA's business loan and investment revolving fund. Since 1989, loans for pollution control have been guaranteed under the 7(a) loan guaranty program. CAPLines. CAPLines are five special 7(a) loan guaranty programs designed to meet the requirements of small businesses for short-term or cyclical working capital. The maximum term is five years. The 504/CDC loan guaranty program uses Certified Development Companies (CDCs), which are private, nonprofit corporations established to contribute to economic development within their communities. Each CDC has its own geographic territory. The program provides long-term, fixed-rate loans for major fixed assets such as land, structures, machinery, and equipment. Program loans cannot be used for working capital, inventory, or repaying debt. A commercial lender provides up to 50% of the financing package, which is secured by a senior lien. The CDC's loan of up to 40% is secured by a junior lien. The SBA backs the CDC with a guaranteed debenture. The small business must contribute at least 10% as equity. To participate in the program, small businesses cannot exceed $15 million in tangible net worth and cannot have average net income of more than $5 million for two full fiscal years before the date of application. Also, CDCs must intend to create or retain one job for every $75,000 of the debenture ($120,000 for small manufacturers) or meet an alternative job creation standard if they meet any one of 15 community or public policy goals. In FY2018, the SBA approved 5,874 504/CDC loans totaling nearly $4.8 billion.   Table 4 summarizes the 504/CDC loan guaranty program's key features. Although any of SBA's loan guaranty programs can be used by firms looking to begin exporting or expanding their current exporting operations, the SBA has three loan programs that specifically focus on trade and export promotion: 1. Export Express loan program provides working capital or fixed asset financing for firms that will begin or expand exporting. It offers a 90% guaranty on loans of $350,000 or less and a 75% guaranty on loans of $350,001 to $500,000. 2. Export Working Capital loan program provides financing to support export orders or the export transaction cycle, from purchase order to final payment. It offers a 90% guaranty of loans up to $5 million. 3. International Trade loan program provides long-term financing to support firms that are expanding because of growing export sales or have been adversely affected by imports and need to modernize to meet foreign competition. It offers a 90% guaranty on loans up to $5 million. In many ways, the SBA's trade and export promotion loan programs share similar characteristics with other SBA loan guaranty programs. For example, the Export Express program resembles the SBAExpress program. The SBAExpress program shares several characteristics with the standard 7(a) loan guarantee program except that the SBAExpress program has an expedited approval process, a lower maximum loan amount, and a smaller percentage of the loan guaranteed. Similarly, the Export Express program shares several of the characteristics of the standard International Trade loan program, such as an expedited approval process in exchange for a lower maximum loan amount ($500,000 compared with $5 million) and a lower percentage of guaranty. In addition, the SBA administers grants through the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP), which are awarded to states to execute export programs that assist small business concerns (such as a trade show exhibition, training workshops, or a foreign trade mission). Initially, the STEP program was authorized for three years and appropriated $30 million annually in FY2011 and FY2012. Congress approved $8 million in appropriations for STEP in FY2014, $17.4 million in FY2015, and $18 million annually since FY2016.  The Microloan program provides direct loans to qualified nonprofit intermediary Microloan lenders that, in turn, provide \"microloans\" of up to $50,000 to small businesses and nonprofit child care centers. Microloan lenders also provide marketing, management, and technical assistance to Microloan borrowers and potential borrowers. The program was authorized in 1991 as a five-year demonstration project and became operational in 1992. It was made permanent, subject to reauthorization, by P.L. 105-135 , the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. Although the program is open to all small businesses, it targets new and early stage businesses in underserved markets, including borrowers with little to no credit history, low-income borrowers, and women and minority entrepreneurs in both rural and urban areas who generally do not qualify for conventional loans or other, larger SBA guaranteed loans.  In FY2018, 5,459 small businesses received a Microloan, totaling $76.8 million. The average Microloan was $14,071 and the average interest rate was 7.6%.  Table 5 summarizes the Microloan program's key features. Several SBA programs assist small businesses in obtaining and performing federal contracts and subcontracts. These include various prime contracting programs; subcontracting programs; and other assistance (e.g., contracting technical training assistance, the federal goaling program, federal Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, and the Surety Bond Guarantee program). Several contracting programs allow small businesses to compete only with similar firms for government contracts or receive sole-source awards in circumstances in which such awards could not be made to other firms. These programs, which give small businesses a chance to win government contracts without having to compete against larger and more experienced companies, include the following:  8(a) Program. The 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program (named for the section of the Small Business Act from which it derives its authority) is for businesses owned by persons who are socially and economically disadvantaged. In addition, an individual's net worth, excluding ownership interest in the 8(a) firm and equity in his or her primary personal residence, must be less than $250,000 at the time of application to the 8(a) Program, and less than $750,000 thereafter. A firm certified by the SBA as an 8(a) firm is eligible for set-aside and sole-source contracts. The SBA also provides technical assistance and training to 8(a) firms. Firms may participate in the 8(a) Program for no more than nine years. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $27.2 billion to 8(a) firms. About $16.4 billion of that amount was awarded with an 8(a) preference ($8 billion through an 8(a) set-aside and $8.4 billion through an 8(a) sole-source award). About $4.8 billion was awarded to an 8(a) firm in open competition with other firms. The remaining $6 billion was awarded with another small business preference (e.g., set aside and sole source awards for small business generally and for HUBZone firms, women-owned small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses). Historically Underutilized Business Zone Program. This program assists small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones) through set-asides, sole-s ource awards, and price evaluation preferences in full and open competitions. The determination of whether an area is a HUBZone is based upon criteria specified in 13 C.F.R. Section 126.103. To be certified as a HUBZone small business, at least 35% of the small business's employees must generally reside in a HUBZone. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $7.53 billion to HUBZone-certified small businesses. About $1.90 billion of that amount was awarded with a HUBZone preference ($1.49 billion through a HUBZone set-aside, $65.3 million through a HUBZone sole-source award, and $346.9 million through a HUBZone price-evaluation preference). About $1.53 billion was awarded to HUBZone-certified small businesses in open competition with other firms. The remaining $4.10 billion was awarded with another small business preference (e.g., set aside and sole source awards for small business generally and for 8(a), women-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses). Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program. This program assists service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses through set-asides and sole-source awards. For purposes of this program, veterans and service-related disabilities are defined as they are under the statutes governing veterans affairs. In FY2017, the federal government awarded $18.2 billion to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. About $6.8 billion of that amount was awarded through a service-disabled veteran-owned small business set aside award. About $4.3 billion of that amount was awarded to a service-disabled veteran-owned small business in open competition with other firms. The remaining $7.1 billion was awarded with another small business preference (e.g., set aside and sole source awards for small business generally and for HUBZone firms, 8(a) firms, and women-owned small businesses). Women-Owned Small Business Program. Under this program, contracts may be set aside for economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses in industries in which women are underrepresented and women-owned small businesses in industries in which women are substantially underrepresented. Also, federal agencies may award sole-source contracts to women-owned small businesses so long as the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price, and the anticipated value of the contract is below $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts). In FY2017, the federal government awarded $21.3 billion to women owned small businesses. About $648.9 million of that amount was awarded with a women owned small business preference ($580.5 million through a women owned small business set-aside and $68.4 million through a women owned small business sole-source award). About $7.0 billion of that amount was awarded to a women owned small business in open competition with other firms. The remaining $13.7 billion was awarded with another small business preference (e.g., set aside and sole source awards for small business generally and for HUBZone firms, 8(a) firms, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses). Other small businesses. Agencies may also set aside contracts or make sole-source awards to small businesses not participating in any other program under certain conditions. Other federal programs promote subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). SDBs include 8(a) participants and other small businesses that are at least 51% unconditionally owned and controlled by socially or economically disadvantaged individuals or groups. Individuals owning and controlling non-8(a) SDBs may have net worth of up to $750,000 (excluding ownership interests in the SDB firm and equity in their primary personal residence). Otherwise, however, SDBs must generally satisfy the same eligibility requirements as 8(a) firms, although they do not apply to the SBA to be designated SDBs in the same way that 8(a) firms do.  Federal agencies must negotiate \"subcontracting plans\" with the apparently successful bidder or offeror on eligible prime contracts prior to awarding the contract. Subcontracting plans set goals for the percentage of subcontract dollars to be awarded to SDBs, among others, and describe efforts that will be made to ensure that SDBs \"have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts.\" Federal agencies may also consider the extent of subcontracting with SDBs in determining to whom to award a contract or give contractors \"monetary incentives\" to subcontract with SDBs.  As of March 25, 2019, the SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search database included 2,338 SBA-certified SDBs and 122,281 self-certified SDBs. The SBA's 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance program provides \"a wide variety of management and technical assistance to eligible individuals or concerns to meet their specific needs, including: (a) counseling and training in the areas of financing, management, accounting, bookkeeping, marketing, and operation of small business concerns; and (b) the identification and development of new business opportunities.\" Eligible individuals and businesses include \"8(a) certified firms, small disadvantaged businesses, businesses operating in areas of high unemployment, or low income or firms owned by low income individuals.\"  In FY2018, the 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance program assisted 6,483 small businesses. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee program is designed to increase small businesses' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracts, by guaranteeing bid, performance, and payment bonds for small businesses that cannot obtain surety bonds through regular commercial channels. The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA's guarantee ranges from not to exceed 80% to not to exceed 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (someone who agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the terms and conditions of a contract. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. The surety bond reduces the risk associated with contracting. Surety bonds are viewed as a means to encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and are considered to be at greater risk of failing to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. Since 1978, federal agency heads have been required to establish federal procurement contracting goals, in consultation with the SBA, \"that realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns\" to participate in federal procurement. Each agency is required, at the conclusion of each fiscal year, to report its progress in meeting these goals to the SBA. In 1988, Congress authorized the President to annually establish government-wide minimum participation goals for procurement contracts awarded to small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Congress required the government-wide minimum participation goal for small businesses to be \"not less than 20% of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year\" and \"not less than 5% of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year\" for small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Each federal agency was also directed to \"have an annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate in the performance of contracts let by such agency.\" The SBA was required to report to the President annually on the attainment of these goals and to include this information in an annual report to Congress. The SBA negotiates the goals with each federal agency and establishes a \"small business eligible\" baseline for evaluating the agency's performance. The small business eligible baseline excludes certain contracts that the SBA has determined do not realistically reflect the potential for small business participation in federal procurement (such as those awarded to mandatory and directed sources), contracts funded predominately from agency-generated sources (i.e., nonappropriated funds), contracts not covered by Federal Acquisition Regulations, acquisitions on behalf of foreign governments, and contracts not reported in the Federal Procurement Data System (such as contracts valued below $10,000 and government procurement card purchases). These exclusions typically account for 18% to 20% of all federal prime contracts each year. The SBA then evaluates the agencies' performance against their negotiated goals annually, using data from the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation, managed by the U.S. General Services Administration, to generate the small business eligible baseline. This information is compiled into the official Small Business Goaling Report, which the SBA releases annually. Over the years, federal government-wide procurement contracting goals have been established for small businesses generally ( P.L. 100-656 , the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988, and P.L. 105-135 , the HUBZone Act of 1997\u2014Title VI of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997), small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals ( P.L. 100-656 , the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988), women ( P.L. 103-355 , the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994), small businesses located within a HUBZone ( P.L. 105-135 , the HUBZone Act of 1997\u2014Title VI of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997), and small businesses owned and controlled by a service disabled veteran ( P.L. 106-50 , the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999).  The current federal small business contracting goals are at least 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards to small businesses for each fiscal year, 5% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards and subcontract awards to small disadvantaged businesses for each fiscal year, 5% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards and subcontract awards to women-owned small businesses, 3% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards and subcontract awards to HUBZone small businesses, and 3% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards and subcontract awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Although there are no punitive consequences for not meeting the small business procurement goals, the SBA's Small Business Goaling Report is distributed widely, receives media attention, and serves to heighten public awareness of the issue of small business contracting. For example, agency performance as reported in the SBA's Small Business Goaling Report is often cited by Members during their questioning of federal agency witnesses during congressional hearings. As shown in Table 6 , the FY201 7 Small Business Goaling Report , using data in the Federal Procurement Data System, indicates that federal agencies met the federal contracting goal for small businesses generally, small disadvantaged businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses in FY2017.  Federal agencies awarded 23.88% of the value of their small business eligible contracts ($442.5 billion) to small businesses ($105.7 billion), 9.10% to small disadvantaged businesses ($40.2 billion), 4.71% to women-owned small businesses ($20.8 billion), 1.65% to HUBZone small businesses ($7.3 billion), and 4.05% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses ($17.9 billion).  The percentage of total reported federal contracts (without exclusions) awarded to those small businesses in FY2017 is also provided in the table for comparative purposes.  Government agencies with procurement authority have an Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) to advocate within the agency for small businesses, as well as assist small businesses in their dealings with federal agencies (e.g., obtaining payment). As mentioned previously, the SBA provides funding to third parties, such as SBDCs, to provide management and training services to small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs. The SBA also provides management, training, and outreach services to small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs through its 68 district offices. These offices are overseen by the SBA Office of Field Operations and 10 regional offices. SBA district offices conduct more than 20,000 outreach events annually with stakeholders and resource partners that include \"lender training, government contracting, marketing events in emerging areas, and events targeted to high-growth entrepreneurial markets, such as exporting.\" SBA district offices focus \"on core SBA programs concerning contracting, capital, technical assistance, and exporting.\" They also perform annual program eligibility and compliance reviews on 100% of the 8(a) business development firms in the SBA's portfolio and each year conduct on-site examinations of about 10% of all HUBZone certified firms (529 in FY2018) to validate compliance with the HUBZone program's geographic requirement for principal offices. The Office of Inspector General's (OIG's) mission is \"to improve SBA management and effectiveness, and to detect and deter fraud in the Agency's programs.\" It serves as \"an independent and objective oversight office created within the SBA by the Inspector General Act of 1978 [P.L. 95-452], as amended.\" The Inspector General, who is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, directs the office. The Inspector General Act provides the OIG with the following responsibilities: \"promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the management of SBA programs and supporting operations; conduct and supervise audits, investigations, and reviews relating to the SBA's programs and support operations; detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse; review existing and proposed legislation and regulations and make appropriate recommendations; maintain effective working relationships with other Federal, State and local governmental agencies, and nongovernmental entities, regarding the mandated duties of the Inspector General; keep the SBA Administrator and Congress informed of serious problems and recommend corrective actions and implementation measures; comply with the audit standards of the Comptroller General; avoid duplication of Government Accountability Office (GAO) activities; and report violations of Federal criminal law to the Attorney General.\" The SBA has several programs to improve small business access to capital markets, including the Small Business Investment Company program, the New Market Venture Capital Program (now inactive), two special high technology contracting programs (the Small Business Innovative Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs), and the growth accelerators initiative. The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program enhances small business access to venture capital by stimulating and supplementing \"the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization, and which are not available in adequate supply.\"  The SBA works with 305 privately owned and managed SBICs licensed by the SBA to provide financing to small businesses with private capital the SBIC has raised and with funds the SBIC borrows at favorable rates because the SBA guarantees the debenture (loan obligation).  SBICs provide equity capital to small businesses in various ways, including by purchasing small business equity securities (e.g., stock, stock options, warrants, limited partnership interests, membership interests in a limited liability company, or joint venture interests); making loans to small businesses, either independently or in cooperation with other private or public lenders, that have a maturity of no more than 20 years; purchasing debt securities from small businesses, which may be convertible into, or have rights to purchase, equity in the small business; and subject to limitations, providing small businesses a guarantee of their monetary obligations to creditors not associated with the SBIC. The SBIC program currently has invested or committed about $30.1 billion in small businesses, with the SBA's share of capital at risk about $14.3 billion. In FY2018, the SBA committed to guarantee $2.52 billion in SBIC small business investments. SBICs invested another $2.98 billion from private capital for a total of $5.50 billion in financing for 1,151 small businesses. The now inactive New Market Venture Capital (NMVC) program encourages equity investments in small businesses in low-income areas that meet specific statistical criteria established by regulation. The program operates through public-private partnerships between the SBA and newly formed NMVC investment companies and existing Specialized Small Business Investment Companies (SSBICs) that operate under the Small Business Investment Company program. The NMVC program's objective is to serve the unmet equity needs of local entrepreneurs in low-income areas by providing developmental venture capital investments and technical assistance, helping to create quality employment opportunities for low-income area residents, and building wealth within those areas. The SBA's role is essentially the same as with the SBIC program. The SBA selects participants for the NMVC program, provides funding for their investments and operational assistance activities, and regulates their operations to ensure public policy objectives are being met. The SBA requires the companies to provide regular performance reports and have annual financial examinations by the SBA.  The NMVC program was appropriated $21.952 million in FY2001 to support up to $150 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures and $30 million to fund operational assistance grants for FY2001 through FY2006. The funds were provided in a lump sum in FY2001 and were to remain available until expended. In 2003, the unobligated balances of $10.5 million for the NMVC debenture subsidies and $13.75 million for operational assistance grants were rescinded. The program continued to operate, with the number and amount of financing declining as the program's initial investments expired and NMVC companies increasingly engaged only in additional follow-on financings with the small businesses in their portfolios. The NMVC program's active unpaid principal balance (which is composed of the SBA guaranteed portion and the unguaranteed portion of the NMVC companies' active unpaid principal balance) peaked at $698 million in FY2008, and then fell each year thereafter until reaching $0 in FY2018. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is designed to increase the participation of small, high technology firms in federal research and development (R&D) endeavors, provide additional opportunities for the involvement of minority and disadvantaged individuals in the R&D process, and result in the expanded commercialization of the results of federally funded R&D. Current law requires that every federal department with an R&D budget of $100 million or more establish and operate a SBIR program. Currently, 11 federal agencies participate in the SBIR program. A set percentage of that agency's applicable extramural R&D budget\u2014originally set at not less than 0.2% in FY1983 and currently not less than 3.2%\u2014is to be used to support mission-related work in small businesses. Agency SBIR efforts involve a three-phase process. During Phase I, awards of up to $163,952 for six months are made to evaluate a concept's scientific or technical merit and feasibility. The project must be of interest to and coincide with the mission of the supporting organization. Projects that demonstrate potential after the initial endeavor may compete for Phase II awards of up to $1.09 million, lasting one to two years. Phase II awards are for the performance of the principal R&D by the small business. Phase III funding, directed at the commercialization of the product or process, is expected to be generated in the private sector. Federal dollars may be used if the government perceives that the final technology or technique will meet public needs. Eight departments and three other federal agencies currently have SBIR programs, including the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Each agency's SBIR activity reflects that organization's management style. Individual departments select R&D interests, administer program operations, and control financial support. Funding can be disbursed in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements. Separate agency solicitations are issued at established times. The SBA is responsible for establishing the broad policy and guidelines under which individual departments operate their SBIR programs. The SBA monitors and reports to Congress on the conduct of the separate departmental activities. The Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR) provides funding for research proposals that are developed and executed cooperatively between a small firm and a scientist in a nonprofit research organization and meet the mission requirements of the federal funding agency. Up to $163,952 in Phase I financing is available for approximately one year to fund the exploration of the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of an idea or technology. Phase II awards of up to $1.09 million may be made for two years, during which time the developer performs R&D work and begins to consider commercial potential. Agencies may issue an award exceeding these award guidelines by no more than 50%. Only Phase I award winners are considered for Phase II. Phase III funding, directed at the commercialization of the product or process, is expected to be generated in the private sector. The small business must find funding in the private sector or other non-STTR federal agency. The STTR program is funded by a set-aside, initially set at not less than 0.05% in FY1994 and now at not less than 0.45%, of the extramural R&D budget of departments that spend more than $1 billion per year on this effort. The Departments of Energy, Defense, and Health and Human Services participate in the STTR program, as do NASA and NSF. The SBA is responsible for establishing the broad policy and guidelines under which individual departments operate their STTR programs. The SBA monitors and reports to Congress on the conduct of the separate departmental activities. The SBA describes growth accelerators as \"organizations that help entrepreneurs start and scale their businesses.\" Growth accelerators are typically run by experienced entrepreneurs and help small businesses access seed capital and mentors. The SBA claims that growth accelerators \"help accelerate a startup company's path towards success with targeted advice on revenue growth, job, and sourcing outside funding.\"  The SBA's Growth Accelerator Initiative began in FY2014 when Congress recommended in its appropriations report that the initiative be provided $2.5 million. Congress subsequently recommended that it receive $4 million in FY2015, $1 million in FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018, and $2 million in FY2019. The Growth Accelerator Initiative provides $50,000 matching grants each year to universities and private sector accelerators \"to support the development of accelerators and their support of startups in parts of the country where there are fewer conventional sources of access to capital (i.e., venture capital and other investors).\" The SBA's Office of Advocacy is \"an independent voice for small business within the federal government.\" The Chief Counsel for Advocacy, who is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, directs the office. The Office of Advocacy's mission is to \"encourage policies that support the development and growth of American small businesses\" by  intervening early in federal agencies' regulatory development process on proposals that affect small businesses and providing Regulatory Flexibility Act compliance training to federal agency policymakers and regulatory development officials; producing research to inform policymakers and other stakeholders on the impact of federal regulatory burdens on small businesses, to document the vital role of small businesses in the economy, and to explore and explain the wide variety of issues of concern to the small business community; and fostering a two-way communication between federal agencies and the small business community. The SBA's executive direction programs consist of the National Women's Business Council, the Office of Ombudsman, and Faith-Based Initiatives. The National Women's Business Council is a bipartisan federal advisory council created to serve as an independent source of advice and counsel to the President, Congress, and the SBA on economic issues of importance to women business owners. The council's mission \"is to promote bold initiatives, policies, and programs designed to support women's business enterprises at all stages of development in the public and private sector marketplaces\u2014from start-up to success to significance.\" The National Ombudsman's mission \"is to assist small businesses when they experience excessive or unfair federal regulatory enforcement actions, such as repetitive audits or investigations, excessive fines, penalties, threats, retaliation or other unfair enforcement action by a federal agency.\" The Office of Ombudsman works with federal agencies that have regulatory authority over small businesses to provide a means for entrepreneurs to comment about enforcement activities and encourage agencies to address those concerns promptly. It also receives comments from small businesses about unfair federal compliance or enforcement activities and refers those comments to the Inspector General of the affected agency in appropriate circumstances. In addition, the National Ombudsman files an annual report with Congress and affected federal agencies that rates federal agencies based on substantiated comments received from small business owners. Affected agencies are provided an opportunity to comment on the draft version of the annual report to Congress before it is submitted. The SBA sponsors several faith-based initiatives For example, the SBA, in cooperation with the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders (NAGGL), created the Business Smart Toolkit, \"a ready-to-use workshop toolkit that equips faith-based and community organizations to help new and aspiring entrepreneurs launch and build businesses that are credit ready.\" During the 111 th Congress P.L. 111-5 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provided the SBA an additional $730 million in temporary funding, including $375 million to subsidize fees for the SBA's 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs and to increase the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans through September 30, 2010, or when appropriated funding for the subsidies and loan modification was exhausted. P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses (about $4.0 billion was issued) and a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs. The act also provided the SBA an additional $697.5 million; including $510 million to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. P.L. 111-322 , the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue its fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted, which occurred on January 3, 2011.  During the 112 th Congress, the SBA's statutory authorization expired (on July 31, 2011). Since then, the SBA has been operating under authority provided by annual appropriations acts. Prior to July 31, 2011, the SBA's authorization had been temporarily extended 15 times since 2006. P.L. 112-239 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, increased the SBA's surety bond limit from $2 million to $6.5 million (and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary); required the SBA to oversee and establish standards for most federal mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs and establish a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program for all small business concerns; required the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy to enter into a contract with an appropriate entity to conduct an independent assessment of the small business procurement goals, including an assessment of which contracts should be subject to the goals; and addressed the SBA's recent practice of combining size standards within industrial groups as a means to reduce the complexity of its size standards by requiring the SBA to make available a justification when establishing or approving a size standard that the size standard is appropriate for each individual industry classification. During the 113 th Congress, P.L. 113-76 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, increased the SBA's SBIC program's annual authorization amount to $4 billion from $3 billion.  During the 114 th Congress P.L. 114-38 , the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, authorized and made permanent the SBA's administrative decision to waive the SBAExpress loan program's one time, up-front loan guaranty fee for veterans (and their spouse). The act also increased the 7(a) loan program's FY2015 authorization limit from $18.75 billion to $23.5 billion (later increased to $26.5 billion). P.L. 114-88 , the Recovery Improvements for Small Entities After Disaster Act of 2015 (RISE After Disaster Act of 2015), includes several provisions designed to assist individuals and small businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and, among other things, authorizes the SBA to provide up to two years of additional financial assistance, on a competitive basis, to SBDCs, WBCs, SCORE, or any proposed consortium of such individuals or entities to assist small businesses located in a presidentially declared major disaster area; authorizes SBDCs to provide assistance to small businesses outside the SBDC's state, without regard to geographical proximity to the SBDC, if the small business is in a presidentially declared major disaster area; and temporarily increases, for three years, the minimum disaster loan amount for which the SBA may require collateral, from $14,000 to $25,000 (or, as under existing law, any higher amount the SBA determines appropriate in the event of a disaster). P.L. 114-92 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, includes a provision that expands the definition of a Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC) military base closure area under the HUBZone program to include the lands within the external boundaries of the closed base and the census tract or nonmetropolitan county in which the lands of the closed base are wholly contained, intersect it, or are contiguous to it. This change is designed to make it easier for businesses located in those areas to meet the HUBZone program's requirement that at least 35% of its employees reside in a HUBZone area. The act also extends BRAC base closure area HUBZone eligibility from five years to not less than eight years, provides HUBZone eligibility to qualified disaster areas, and adds Native Hawaiian Organizations to the list of HUBZone eligible small business concerns. Starting one year from enactment (effective November 25, 2016), the act also adds requirements concerning the pledge of assets by individual sureties participating in the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program and increases the guaranty rate from not less than 70% to not less than 90% for preferred sureties participating in that program. P.L. 114-113 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, expands the projects eligible for refinancing under the 504/CDC loan guaranty program in any fiscal year in which the refinancing program and the 504/CDC program as a whole do not have credit subsidy costs, generally limits refinancing under this provision to no more than 50% of the dollars loaned under the 504/CDC program during the previous fiscal year, and increases the SBIC program's family of funds limit (the amount of outstanding leverage allowed for two or more SBIC licenses under common control) to $350 million from $225 million. The act also provided the 7(a) loan program a FY2016 authorization limit of $26.5 billion. P.L. 114-125 , the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, renamed the \"State Trade and Export Promotion\" grant initiative to the \"State Trade Expansion Program.\" P.L. 114-125 also reformed some of the program's procedures and provided $30 million in annual authorization for STEP grants from FY2016 through FY2020. In terms of program administration, P.L. 114-125 allows the SBA's Associate Administrator (AA) for International Trade to give priority to STEP proposals from states that have a relatively small share of small businesses that export or would assist rural, women-owned, and socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses and small business concerns. P.L. 114-328 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, authorizes the SBA to establish different size standards for various types of agricultural enterprises (previously statutorily set at not more than $750,000 in annual receipts), standardizes definitions used by the SBA and the Department of Veterans Affairs concerning service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, requires the SBA to track companies that outgrow or no longer qualify for SBA assistance due to the receipt of a federal contract or being purchased by another entity after an initial federal contract is awarded, and, among other provisions, clarifies the duties of the Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Utilization within federal agencies.  During the 115 th Congress P.L. 115-31 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $27.5 billion in FY2017 from $26.5 billion in FY2016. P.L. 115-56 , the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017, provided the SBA an additional $450 million for disaster assistance. P.L. 115-123 , the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, provided the SBA an additional $1.652 billion for disaster assistance and $7.0 million to the SBA's OIG for disaster assistance oversight. P.L. 115-141 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $29.0 billion in FY2018. The act also relaxed requirements on Microloan intermediaries that prohibited them from spending more than 25% of their technical assistance grant funds on prospective borrowers and more than 25% of those grant funds on contracts with third parties to provide that technical assistance by increasing those percentages to 50%. P.L. 115-189 , the Small Business 7(a) Lending Oversight Reform Act of 2018, among other provisions, codified the SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management; required that office to annually undertake and report the findings of a risk analysis of the 7(a) program's loan portfolio; created a lender oversight committee within the SBA; authorized the Director of the Office of Credit Risk Management to undertake informal and formal enforcement actions against 7(a) lenders under specified conditions; redefined the credit elsewhere requirement; and authorized the SBA Administrator to increase the amount of 7(a) loans not more than once during any fiscal year to not more than 115% of the 7(a) program's authorization limit. The SBA is required to provide at least 30 days' notice of its intent to exceed the 7(a) loan program's authorization limit to the House and Senate Committees on Small Business and the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations' Subcommittees on Financial Services and General Government and may exercise this option only once per fiscal year. P.L. 115-232 , the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, included provisions originally in H.R. 5236 , the Main Street Employee Ownership Act of 2018, to make 7(a) loans more accessible to employee-owned small businesses (ESOPs) and cooperatives. The act clarifies that 7(a) loans to ESOPs may be made under the Preferred Lenders Program; allows the seller to remain involved as an officer, director, or key employee when the ESOP or cooperative has acquired 100% ownership of the small business; and authorizes the SBA to finance transition costs to employee ownership and waive any mandatory equity injection by the ESOP or cooperative to help finance the change of ownership.
