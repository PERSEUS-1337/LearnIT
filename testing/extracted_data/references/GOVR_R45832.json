    "content": "The federal government is the largest energy consumer in the United States. Within the federal government, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) consumes more energy than any other agency. In FY2017, DOD consumed 707.9 trillion British thermal units (Btu) of energy\u00e2\u0080\u0094roughly 16 times that of the second largest consumer in the federal government, the U.S. Postal Service ( Figure 1 ). In FY2017, DOD spent approximately $11.9 billion on energy, roughly 76% of the entire federal government's energy expenditures, and roughly 2% of DOD's FY2017 budget.  Energy efficiency\u00e2\u0080\u0094providing the same or an improved level of service with less energy\u00e2\u0080\u0094over time can lead to a reduction in agency expenses. DOD uses energy for a variety of purposes across the various services of the military. For example, DOD's efficient management of energy can also lead to less refueling and fewer fuel convoys. Reducing the frequency and duration of fueling in combat zones could reduce exposure and risk which could save lives. This report provides an introduction to federal energy management rules applicable to DOD. The report includes an overview of federal statutes and executive orders that govern DOD energy management, and presents data on the status and trends for DOD energy use. Further, the scope of this report excludes nuclear energy for the propulsion of aircraft carriers, submarines, and energy used for military space operations. The report also references agency level guiding documents that provide the basis for how DOD implements these policies. Finally, this report identifies selected considerations for Congress.  Federal energy management requirements include reductions in fossil fuel consumption, increases in renewable energy use, and energy efficiency targets for government fleets and buildings. In addition to the energy management requirements that apply to federal agencies, DOD's energy policy is designed to ensure the readiness of U.S. armed forces through energy security and resilience. DOD, through statute (e.g., 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72922e), has authority to suspend certain requirements to meet established operational military demands.  In the 1970s, Congress began mandating energy use reductions for federal agencies, directing agencies to improve the efficiency of buildings and facilities and reduce fossil fuel dependence. Legislation aimed at reducing federal agency energy consumption can be traced back to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA, P.L. 94-163 ) as shown in Table 1 . Among other provisions, EPCA directed the President to implement a 10-year plan for energy conservation and efficiency standards for government procurement. In 1977, Congress passed into law an act establishing the Department of Energy ( P.L. 95-91 ). The following year, Congress enacted the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA, P.L. 95-619 ), which, among other actions, established a program to retrofit federal buildings to improve energy efficiency.  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct92, P.L. 102-486 ) amended NECPA and authorized alternative financing methods for federal energy projects, including energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) and utility energy service contracts (UESCs), among other provisions. Since NECPA and EPAct92, two laws contain provisions that set energy management requirements for all federal agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05, P.L. 109-58 ) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140 ). EPAct05 and EISA amended and addressed additional energy management targets for the federal government, among other things.  Federal agencies report energy consumption annually to the Department of Energy's (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). EISA Section 527 (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a717143), requires federal agencies to report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the status and implementation of energy efficiency improvements, energy reduction costs, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Subsequently, EISA Section 528 (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a717144) directs OMB to provide a summary of this information and an evaluation of progress for the federal government to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. The Director of OMB compiles the compliance status of the EISA requirements and description of each into an agency scorecard. Appendix B contains a selected compilation of federal energy management requirements for all agencies. The annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has included provisions related to DOD energy management and authorities. For example, Congress, by enacting the Department of Defense Authorization Act for FY1985 ( P.L. 98-525 ), granted the Secretary of Defense waiver authority for the acquisition of petroleum. NDAA for FY2000 Section 803 ( P.L. 106-65 ) amended this waiver authority to extend beyond petroleum to \"a defined fuel source.\" This authority permits the Secretary of Defense to waive any provision that would otherwise prescribe terms and conditions of a defined fuel purchase contract if market conditions have affected or will adversely affect the acquisition of the fuel source; and if the waiver will expedite acquisition for government needs (10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72922e). With one exception, the NDAA for FY2018 ( P.L. 115-91 ), every NDAA since 1993 contains a section on \"authorized energy conservation projects.\" For instance, NDAA for FY2007 ( P.L. 109-364 ) added a section regarding renewable energy production or procurement goals to 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72911. As amended by several NDAAs, this DOD specific goal requires DOD to consume 25% of total facility energy from renewable sources by FY2025 ( Appendix A ). Further, NDAAs have contributed to a number of internal DOD energy management protocols. For instance, the NDAA for FY2011 Section 2832 ( P.L. 111-383 ) directs the Secretary of Defense to develop an Energy Performance Master Plan (including metrics for measurement, use of a baseline standard, separate plans for each branch, etc.) to achieve performance goals set by law, executive orders, and DOD policies. The NDAA for FY2015 requires an annual report that certifies whether or not the President's budget is adequate to meet objectives of the Operational Energy Strategy as outlined in 10 U.S.C. 2926. NDAAs continue to address energy security and resilience for DOD. In 2018, for example, Congress enacted the NDAA for FY2019 ( P.L. 115-232 ), authorizing appropriations of $193 million for energy resilience and conservation investment programs. Multiple statutes, in addition to those above, establish the legislative authority for DOD energy management. Selected sections of the U.S. Code applicable to DOD energy management are delineated in Appendix A . Over several administrations, Presidents have issued executive orders to establish energy management guidelines and targets for the federal government. Executive orders applied specifically to government vehicles, buildings, and computer equipment. Since 1991, 12 executive orders have been issued on federal energy management ( Appendix C ). Only Executive Order 13834, \"Efficient Federal Operations\" (E.O. 13834), is currently in effect. All the others have been revoked by subsequent orders.  On May 17, 2018, President Trump issued E.O. 13834, revoking E.O. 13693 and its specific targets for federal agencies. E.O. 13834 directs the heads of agencies to meet \"statutory requirements in a manner that increases efficiency, optimizes performance, eliminates unnecessary use of resources, and protects the environment,\" but contains no specific targets. The White House Council on Environmental Quality Office of Federal Sustainability issued implementing instructions for E.O. 13834 in April 2019.  The Office of Federal Sustainability's website provides resources, guidance documents, and reported energy performance data across federal agencies to support implementation of E.O. 13834. The Office of Federal Sustainability also lists other relevant U.S. code provisions, public laws, and other resources that federal agencies are required to follow. DOD issues directives, memorandums, manuals, and guidance instructions to military departments and agencies on complying with statues and executive orders. For instance, DOD Instruction (DODI) 4170.11, Installation Energy Management, and DOD Directive (DODD) 4180.01, DOD Energy Policy , provide guidance for energy planning, use, implementation and management. These and other guidance documents outline best practices to meet federal goals within the context of the agency's mission, while giving flexibility to military departments for achieving goals.  Military departments within DOD are tasked with following agency policies and procedures to issue internal energy strategies to meet the specific needs of their mission. The Energy Performance Master Plan tasks each military department and defense agency to develop their own master plans toward meeting federal requirements. Military departments can have their own goals and guiding documents within the parameters of statute and executive order (e.g., the Army's Energy Security and Sustainability Strategy or the Secretary of the Navy's Energy Goals).  Further, 10 U.S.C. 2925 mandates DOD to submit to Congress two annual reports on the progress of meeting federal and executive energy targets: the Operational Energy Annual Report and the Annual Energy Management and Resilience Report (AEMRR), which includes the Energy Performance Master Plan. These reports compile energy use information from the various DOD departments on their progress toward meeting federal requirements. For federal-wide requirements, implementing instructions and guidance documents are often issued by DOE. For instance, EPAct05 has a renewable electricity consumption requirement of 7.5% for the federal government by FY2013. The President, acting through the Secretary of DOE, under Section 203 of EPAct05, is to ensure that the federal government meets the requirement. In order to ensure this, DOE issued guidance to federal agencies on how to meet the requirement.  DOD categorizes energy as either \"installation\" or \"operational.\" Installation energy refers to \"energy needed to power fixed installations and enduring locations as well as non-tactical vehicles (NTVs).\" Installation energy historically represents roughly 30% of DOD total energy and is subject to federal energy efficiency and conservation requirements, as reported to Congress in the AEMRR. In FY2017, DOD spent $3.48 billion on installation energy and NTV fuels. Operational energy (e.g., jet fuel) is \"the energy required for training, moving, and sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations and training\u00e2\u0080\u0094including energy used by tactical power systems and generators at non-enduring locations.\" Federal energy management requirements outlined in Appendix A and Appendix B do not apply to operational energy. However, under 10 U.S.C. 2926, DOD does have an operational energy policy to promote readiness of military missions. From FY2003 to FY2017 the federal government reduced total site-delivered energy use by 19.2% compared to the FY2003 baseline in all sectors. During the same time period, DOD reduced site-delivered energy use by 20.9%. While overall, DOD has reduced energy use, its energy use has not necessarily been consistent from one year to the next. For example, during the War in Iraq (FY2003 to FY2004), energy use increased from 895 trillion Btu to 960 trillion Btu, as shown in Figure 2 .  Representing roughly 30% of DOD total energy use, installation energy is subject to federal energy management requirements. Federal energy management requirements include energy efficiency targets for government buildings, renewable energy use goals, and fossil fuel reductions for the NTV fleet. According to the AEMRR FY2017, energy and cost savings compared to an FY2005 baseline resulted in $5.67 billion in total savings through FY2017. The AEMRR also notes that the DOD increased installation energy consumption levels by 0.3% from FY2016 to FY2017. 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a78253(a) requires federal agencies to achieve a 30% reduction from FY2003 levels in energy consumption per gross square foot (GSF) for goal federal buildings by FY2015 ( Appendix B ). Goal buildings are federal buildings subject to federal energy performance requirements. DOD examples of goal buildings include the Army's Holston Ammunition Plant in Tennessee and the Navy's Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. Excluded facilities are federal buildings not required to meet the federal building energy performance requirement for the fiscal year according to the criteria under Section 543(c)(3) of NECPA. Federal agencies may typically exclude buildings that have a dedicated energy process that overwhelms other building consumption, such as one designed for a national security function or for the storage of historical artifacts.  DOD manages nearly 300,000 buildings, most of which are subject to federal energy management. In FY2015, DOD did not meet the 30% reduction target, as DOD reduced building energy intensity by 16.5% relative to FY2003 levels. In FY2017, DOD consumed 91,709 Btu/GSF, a 21.8% decrease from baseline FY2003.  Increasing building efficiencies and reducing energy intensity can be supported through alternative funding mechanisms (e.g., ESPCs, UESCs, power purchase agreements). In FY2017, the Army, for example, awarded $289.3 million in ESPC and UESC projects estimated to save 1,132 billion Btu annually. According to the AEMRR FY2017, these projects could avoid costs of $17.2 million annually from the project savings.  In addition to the energy efficiency requirement, EISA Section 433 requires federal agencies to reduce fossil fuel consumption in new or majorly renovated buildings ( Table B-1 ) by specified amounts. By FY2020, these buildings are supposed to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 80% relative to a similar building's consumption levels in FY2003. DOE proposed a rulemaking for comment on this legislation on October 15, 2010. However, the rulemaking was not finalized, and no further action has been taken since December 2014 when the comment period closed. DOD has not reported on this requirement.  EPAct05 requires federal agencies to reach 7.5% total renewable electricity consumption by FY2013. According to implementing instructions to comply with EPAct05, agencies must maintain ownership of renewable energy credits (RECs). If DOD sells a REC to meet state requirements, and it is not replaced with another REC, then the renewable electricity DOD produced does not receive credit toward the EPAct05 goal. Within these reporting requirements, in FY2013, DOD reached 5% renewable electricity consumption, and in FY2017, DOD reached nearly 6% of total electricity consumption from renewables. Solar photovoltaic sources contributed to this increase reaching 627,783 megawatt-hours (MWh) up from 396,268 MWh in FY2016.  RECs are created when a renewable source of energy generates a megawatt-hour of electricity. Each REC has a unique identification number and provides data (e.g., the resource type, service date, location, etc.) that is traceable and certifiable. RECs can be traded and have monetary value. They are used by utilities to comply with state renewable electricity standards. Thus, RECs can help improve the return on investment for renewable projects. The ownership of these credits is often a contract stipulation associated with the project for the developer. State and/or local renewable requirements play a role in determining the contract stipulations for the credit ownership.  In addition to EPAct05 goal of 7.5% renewable electricity by FY2013, DOD in accordance with 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72911(g) is required to \"produce or procure\" 25% renewable energy (electrical and non-electrical) by FY2025. The purchasing of RECs is not mandatory for DOD to comply with this goal. DOD's 2011 Energy Performance Master Plan set an interim goal of 15% renewable energy consumption by FY2018. Under \u00c2\u00a72911(g), in FY2017 DOD's renewable energy consumption reached approximately 8.7% of total facility energy use.  In FY2017, DOD consumed around 8,764 billion Btu of NTV fuel, roughly 4.3% of DOD installation energy. EISA requires federal vehicle fleets to reduce petroleum consumption from the FY2005 baseline by 20% no later than October 1, 2015 ( Appendix B ). In FY2015, DOD complied with the EISA target with a reduction in NTV fleet petroleum consumption of 27% compared to FY2005 baseline. DOD has continued to reduce installation vehicle fleet petroleum consumption and reached a 34.5% reduction in FY2017. At the branch level, the FY2017 AEMRR states that the Air Force experienced an increase of 9.3% in consumption compared to the FY2005 baseline. Despite this increase, the Air Force, according to the AEMRR, does continue to implement programs to reduce consumption and increase alternative fuel use in research and development.  In addition to the petroleum consumption reduction goal, federal agencies under EISA are to increase alternative fuel consumption by 10% compared to a FY2005 baseline no later than October 1, 2015 ( Appendix B ). According to the Office of Federal Sustainability, DOD met the alternative fuel consumption target in FY2015 reaching 10.6% of total fuel consumption. However, in FY2017, DOD's alternative fuel consumption decreased to 9.4% of the total installation fleet fuel consumed. These requirements apply only to installation energy and do not apply to operational energy. Operational energy constitutes roughly 70% of DOD's total energy use. In FY2017, DOD spent $8.2 billion on operational energy expenditures. The largest portion of this came from jet fuel at nearly 394 trillion Btu or roughly 56% of total DOD energy consumption for FY2017. DOD depends on jet fuel and other petroleum products to perform mission operations. According to DOD's FY2017 Operational Energy Annual Report , from FY2013 to FY2017, total operational energy demand remained relatively stable, around 87 million barrels of fuel per year (roughly 500 trillion Btu), while the price of crude oil fluctuated. The price of oil declined by roughly 60% in 2014, which contributed to a decrease in fuel expenditures from $14.8 billion in FY2013 to $8.2 billion in FY2017, around a 45% reduction.  DOD's efficient management of fuel can also lead fewer fuel convoys. Reducing the frequency and duration of fueling in combat zones could reduce exposure and risk which could save lives. According to a 2009 report by the Army Environmental Policy Institute, for every 24 fuel-related convoys in Afghanistan there was roughly one casualty. A challenge is balancing mission operations (i.e., increasing weapons systems and combat performance) while also increasing efficiency. Some questions Congress may be interested in considering include: What kind of federal energy efficiency requirements should DOD have for operational energy, if any? To what extent do federal energy management targets need to be updated? What role is there for Congress to clarify or provide oversight on implementing federal energy management goals? How are alternative financing mechanisms supporting DOD's attainment of federal energy management goals? To what extent should Congress support these mechanisms? As noted, existing statutory energy management goals do not apply to operational energy, but DOD's operational energy policy is mandated by 10 U.S.C. 2926. As part of the operational energy policy, DOD establishes a strategy including plans and performance metrics. Further, DOD is mandated to submit to Congress both a report on the strategy (Operational Energy Strategy) and a report certifying that the proposed Presidential budget supports the implementation of the strategy (Operational Energy Budget Certification Report).  Operational energy comprises 70% of energy use within DOD, much of which consists of petroleum-based fuels. Federal energy management goals do not apply to most of DOD's energy use. Congress may consider setting mission priorities for DOD. Congress could also consider mandating whether or not DOD should prioritize energy access over energy conservation, or vice versa. While making operational equipment more fuel efficient could increase range and decrease refueling convoys, the challenge is how to prioritize maintaining combat readiness and mission operations. Congress may consider legislation addressing operational energy, such as setting a standard fuel efficiency target or a requirement for alternative fuel use.  Congress may also consider continuing to leave operational energy efficiency goals to be determined by DOD or each military branch. While this option could provide more flexibility, it could also lead to some challenges. For instance, in 2009, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced plans for the Navy to consume half of all fuel from alternative sources by 2020 (see textbox on Secretary of the Navy Energy Goals). The announcement also included a 2016 goal to deploy a carrier strike group using alternative fuels (e.g., nuclear power, biofuels) and energy conservation measures, an initiative known as the Great Green Fleet. The Great Green Fleet deployed in 2016 and conducted operations using alternative fuels and energy-efficient technologies and operating procedures. Some critics of the Navy energy goals noted that the Navy implemented these energy targets based on limited analysis. For instance, a House Armed Services Committee hearing in March 2012 inquired how the Navy determined the 50% goal for biofuel use, how it was determined that 50% was the amount the Navy should have, whether it could be attained by 2020, and what metrics were used to make this determination. A 2011 study by Logistics Management Institute (LMI) was referenced as a source that outlined the attainability of the goal; however, it had been released two years after the announcement of the energy plan.  Supporters of the Navy's energy goals noted the benefits of a more diverse fuel supply and utilizing domestically produced biofuels. DOD is subject to oil price volatility, as such a more diverse fuel supply could potentially reduce dependence on the volatile market (see textbox on Department of Defense Fuel Procurement). According to Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Energy, Installations, and Environment Jackalyne Pfannenstiel's 2012 testimony, \"without more domestically produced fuels, the [Navy] will continue to be subjected to fuel price volatility and be compelled to trade training, facility sustainment, and needed programs to pay for unplanned bills.\"  If Congress were to set a target, reporting data and status updates could also be included in legislation to provide increased accountability of these programs. According to a 2016 naval announcement, the alternative fuel used for the Great Green Fleet was cost competitive and was made from 10% beef tallow and 90% marine diesel.  In many cases, federal energy management goals in statute or executive order established targets for FY2015 (e.g., EISA petroleum and alternative fuel consumption targets were due no later than October 1, 2015). Several agencies, including DOD, did not reach the targeted goals. Congress may consider establishing new targets. Alternatively, Congress may instead remove statutory targets altogether, instead directing heads of federal agencies to establish protocols that foster efficiency and cost reductions that serve the mission of the agency. If given the flexibility, agencies may opt to set more easily attainable targets based on budget and mission needs, which may not have as much of an impact on total federal energy use. In March 2015, then-Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz convened a Task Force of members from the private sector, universities, and nonprofit organizations to review various components of E.O. 13693, including target setting. The Task Force argued that setting energy goals across all agencies \"may drive some agencies to over-invest in the targeted area of energy-performance improvement to the detriment of other operational priorities. Conversely, uniform energy goals may understate the potential for cost-effective investments in energy efficiency for other agencies.\" Primary agency concerns may include their potential cost and mission impact. Congress and agencies may have different perspectives regarding these concerns. Successful attainment of established targets have varied from agency to agency. Some agencies may inherently be more energy intensive than others and as such may face challenges financing projects to reach certain targets. Leaving targets to agencies may provide some flexibility, as not all agencies have the same energy needs. Agencies might choose to set ambitious targets that some may consider too costly and may not be based on consistent data. In some cases, meeting targets could come at a high cost, particularly in the early stages of development. Some may argue that the high cost for early research and development (R&D) may be acceptable, especially if in the long term it drives costs down. If Congress were to direct DOD to set a standard, DOD may set a goal that could require additional R&D to develop equipment that meets the standard, but also does not diminish combat readiness. For instance, a test of the Great Green Fleet in the summer of 2012 reportedly cost the Navy nearly $27 a gallon for 450,000 gallons of biofuel. By 2016, the Navy achieved competitive prices with conventional fuels with a 90% diesel blend with 10% biofuel. The Navy reportedly contracted with a California firm to purchase 77 million gallons of biofuel from beef fat at $2.05, including a 15 cent per gallon subsidy. The 2016 DOE Task Force report also noted the historical role of the federal government as an adopter of new technologies, providing a faster pathway toward commercial viability. While this may not always be the most economic approach, it could provide a greater benefit to a technology's deployment into the commercial market.  Further, Congress may consider readjusting the baselines, as some argue that the baselines may not have been properly informed using consistent data. For instance, according to a 2014 DOE report, \"goals must be based on well-informed estimates of savings potential.\" The 2014 DOE report recommended that several criteria should be taken into consideration when establishing a baseline, such as weather, data quality and availability, consistency of agency mission operations, and varying degrees of savings. The report also noted that perhaps a three-year average should be taken to set a baseline, as this helps reduce abnormal factors experienced in any particular year. If Congress establishes a new baseline, agency reporting data and perceived progress could be affected. For example, the DOE report explains, \"using a more recent baseline year\u00e2\u0080\u0094and setting a lower percent reduction goal\u00e2\u0080\u0094may give the impression that the federal government is not doing enough to reduce energy use, when in fact significant reductions have already been made.\"  In regards to EISA Section 433, federal agencies are mandated to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 80% by FY2020, with an ultimate goal of 100% by FY2030. As noted, the rulemaking for this legislation has not been finalized. Without a finalized rule it is difficult to track and evaluate the progress toward this goal. DOD has not included this metric in annual reports. Congress may consider in its oversight role directing DOE to finalize this rule. Alternatively, Congress may consider updating the legislation, perhaps by either adjusting the targets, or removing the requirement entirely.  While tracking energy management compliance may come at a cost (e.g., labor, data collecting, etc.), the data can be used to indicate progress toward greater efficiency and could demonstrate whether or not a program has proven effective and provided cost savings. The 2016 DOE Task Force report notes that one of the major challenges in evaluating the energy efficiency of projects in the federal government is the lack of data concerning, \"building profiles, energy usage, and energy spending over time.\"  Additionally, Congress may consider clarifying REC ownership in legislation, instead of directing DOE to issue guidance on qualifications to meet federal targets. For instance, DOE's implementation guidance for EPAct05 requires DOD and all federal agencies to retain ownership of RECs to count toward the 7.5% renewable electricity consumption goal. However, 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72911(g), a 25% renewable energy production goal for DOD, does not make purchasing RECs mandatory.  Further, according to a 2016 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, DOD project documentation of renewable energy goals was not always clear, especially when determining whether or not a project contributed toward a particular goal. If Congress opts to require DOD to maintain ownership of RECs to meet all relevant energy goals, proper data and measurement collection may be a factor to consider. Additionally, if Congress were to require agency ownership of RECs, DOD's progress toward 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72911(g) may decline. For instance, the 2016 GAO report reviewed documentation of 17 DOD renewable energy projects. All 17 projects contributed to 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72911(g), but 8 of those projects did not contribute to EPAct05.  In practice, military services may not necessarily retain ownership of RECs associated with all projects. Some DOD services may find that relinquishing REC ownership is within the best interest of the service and the particular contract, despite not qualifying for the EPAct05 requirement. The Navy, for instance, has had difficulty meeting renewable energy consumption targets under EPAct05, noting in the FY2017 AEMRR : \"The Navy's performance regarding the renewable electricity goal is a function of the strategic decision to allow other parties to monetize the value of RECs associated with its financed energy projects.\" In certain projects, military services might decide to relinquish REC ownership. In some instances of ESPC/UESC contracts, RECs can be leveraged to finance additional project improvements.  DOD has steadily decreased its buildings' energy intensity in response to mandated energy reduction goals through investment in energy conservation projects. One of the challenges DOD faces in meeting these targets is implementing appropriate financing mechanisms. ESPCs have become a preferred means of making energy efficiency improvements because, in part, funds do not have to be directly appropriated (or programmed). However, as Energy Savings Contractors (ESCOs) assume a certain risk in guaranteeing savings through ESPCs, the risk is factored into their cost. DOD has been increasing reliance on UESCs and ESPCs. With $2.9 billion awarded in FY2017, these contracts can assist with increasing efficiency and meeting renewable energy management goals without up-front appropriated funds for the investment. Congress may consider options to increase the effectiveness of these mechanisms in attaining federal energy management goals.  One option may be to increase training and awareness of UESCs and ESPCs. A Senate Committee on Armed Services report ( S.Rept. 115-125 ) accompanying NDAA FY2018 ( S. 1519 ) directed the Secretary of Defense to assess ESPCs and the potential savings through increased training. DOD disagreed with the need for more training, noting in the AEMRR FY2017, \"the financial risk is too high to implement these training improvements based on assumptions about future savings and therefore [DOD] will not commit limited resources to an assessment that would draw from efforts focused on energy resilience and mission assurance.\" Further, DOD has stated that training improvements do not necessarily guarantee behavioral changes that would contribute to energy and costs savings.  It is difficult to determine project savings if data is not being collected appropriately and consistently. Eight reports since 2013 by GAO, DOD Inspector General (DOD IG), and U.S. Army Audit Agency evaluated challenges with DOD utilizing ESPCs. The recommendations highlighted a lack of developed guidance for ESPC training, data management, and contract administration. According to a summary DOD IG report in February 2019, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installation, and Environment, as well as Navy, Air Force, and DLA ESPC program managers, did not collect ESPC project data due to decentralization and not requesting performance and savings data, despite DOD instruction. Five reports noted that base contracting officials were not complying with the measurement and verification requirements under Section 432 of EISA for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness of the requirements. Training and guidance for utilizing ESPCs and UESCs is provided to all federal agencies through FEMP. However, challenges remain. During a December 2018 House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Energy hearing, Leslie Nicholls, Strategic Director for FEMP, noted that measurement and verification is \"not necessarily consistently applied and utilized throughout the federal government.\" She further noted that FEMP would like to continue training both at the technical level and for contracting officers. As noted in the February 2019 DOD IG report, DOD branches were implementing the IG recommendations regarding ESPC guidance. Congress may consider the value of training and guidance for proper measurement and data verification, and whether better data would demonstrate accurate cost savings of ESPCs and USECs relative to the cost of training.

Energy P olicy of the Department of Defense (a) General Energy Policy: directs the Secretary of Defense to \"ensure the readiness of the armed forces for their military missions by pursuing energy security and energy resilience.\"  (b) Authorities: permits the Secretary of Defense to establish metrics and standards for measuring energy resilience; authorizes the selection of facility energy projects using renewables, as well as \"giving favorable consideration to projects that provide power directly to a military facility or into the installation electrical distribution network.\" (c) Energy Performance Goals: directs the Secretary of Defense to \"submit to congressional defense committees energy performance goals\" for DOD annually. (d) Energy Performance Master Plan: directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan annually (including metrics for measurement, use of a baseline standard, separate plans for each branch, etc.) to achieve the performance goals set by law, executive orders, and DOD policies. (e) Special Considerations: directs the Secretary of Defense to consider a set of specified factors (e.g., energy resilience, economies of scale, conservation measures) when developing the Performance Goals and Master Plan. (f) Selection of Energy Conservation Measures: the energy conservation measures are to be limited to ones that \"are readily available; demonstrate an economic return on the investment; are consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance master plan for the Department; and are supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c).\" (g) Goal Reg arding Use of Renewable Energy t o Meet Facility Energy Needs : \"to produce or procure not less than 25 percent of the total quantity of facility energy it consumes within its facilities during fiscal year 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter from renewable energy sources.\" \u00c2\u00a7 2913. Energy Savings Contracts and Activities (a) Shared Energy Savings Contracts: directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a simple method to accelerate contracts for shared energy savings services.  \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a72922 -2922h. Energy-Related Procurement : outlines contracting and procurement specifications for various energy types (e.g., natural gas, renewables, fuel derived from coal). \u00c2\u00a7 2922e. Acquisition of C ertain F uel S ources: A uthority to W aive C ontract P rocedures; A cquisition by E xchange; S ales A uthority : permits the Secretary of Defense to waive any provision that would otherwise prescribe terms and conditions of a fuel purchase contract if market conditions have affected or will adversely affect the acquisition of the fuel source; and if the waiver will expedite the acquisition for government needs. \u00c2\u00a7 2 926 Operational Energy Activities: provides DOD with an operational energy policy; delineates authorities for operational energy procurement; establishes the role for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASD EI&E); requires the ASD EI&E to establish an operational energy strategy and to review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on budgetary operational energy matters, as well as grants access to records and studies on military initiatives related to operational energy. Appendix B. Summary of Federal Energy Goals and Contracting Authority in 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 6374e. Federal Fleet Conservation R equirements : each federal agency is directed to increase alternative fuel use and decrease petroleum fuel consumption for federal fleets, with the goal of achieving a 10% increase in annual alternative fuels and a 20% reduction in annual petroleum consumption as compared to a FY2005 baseline by October 1, 2015. \u00c2\u00a7 6834 . Federal Building Energy Efficiency Standards : starting August 2006, if cost-effective over the life cycle, new federal buildings must be designed to achieve energy consumption levels at least 30% below ASHRAE Standard 90.1 (for commercial buildings) or the International Energy Conservation Code (for residential buildings). In addition, starting December 2008, new federal buildings and those undergoing major renovations are to be designed so that fossil fuel consumption is reduced by 80% in 2020 compared to a similar building in FY2003, and 100% by 2030, as specified in Table B-1 . \u00c2\u00a7 8253. Energy Management R equirements: directs federal agencies to reduce building energy consumption per square foot by 30% compared to the FY2003 baseline by FY2015.  \u00c2\u00a7 8256(c) Utility Incentive Program: authorizes and encourages agency participation in programs (Utility Energy Savings Contracts, or UESCs) to \"increase energy efficiency and for water conservation or the management of electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities.\" \u00c2\u00a7 8287. Authority to Enter into Contracts: authorizes the head of a federal agency to enter Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs). Each contract may be for a period not to exceed 25 years. The contract directs the contractor to incur the costs of energy savings measures, in exchange for a share of the savings resulting from the measures taken. \u00c2\u00a7 13212. Minimum Federal Fleet Requirement : the total percentage of alternative-fueled or \"low greenhouse gas emitting\" light-duty vehicles acquired by a federal fleet annually are 75% in FY1999 and thereafter. \u00c2\u00a7 15852 . Federal Purchase Requirement : the President, acting through the Secretary of Energy, is directed to \"ensure that, to the extent economically feasible and technically practicable, of the total amount of electric energy the Federal Government consumes during any fiscal year\" not less than 7.5% is renewable energy in FY2013 and each fiscal year thereafter. \u00c2\u00a7 16122. Federal and State P rocurement of Fuel Cell V ehicles and Hydrogen E nergy S ystems : requires the federal government to adopt fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen energy systems as soon as practicable.
