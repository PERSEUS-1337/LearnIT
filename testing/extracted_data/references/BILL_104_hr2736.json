SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Washita Battlefield National \nHistoric Site Act of 1995.''.\n\nSEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Battle of the Washita, November 27, 1868, was one \n        of the largest engagements between Plains tribes and the United \n        States Army on the Southern Great Plains. The site is a \n        registered National Historic Landmark;\n            (2) Lt. Colonel George A. Custer, leading the 7th United \n        States Calvary, attacked the sleeping Cheyenne village of peace \n        chief Black Kettle. Custer's attack resulted in more than 150 \n        Indian casualties, many of them women and children;\n            (3) the Battle of the Washita symbolizes the struggle of \n        the Southern Great Plains tribes to maintain their traditional \n        lifeways and not to submit to reservation confinement; and\n            (4) the Washita battle site possesses a high degree of \n        integrity and the cultural landscape is essentially intact. The \n        Cheyenne village site has not been altered substantially except \n        by periodic flooding of the Washita River.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n            (1) recognize the importance of the Battle of the Washita \n        as a nationally significant element of frontier military \n        history and as a symbol of the struggles of the Southern Great \n        Plains tribes to maintain control of their traditional use \n        areas; and\n            (2) establish the site of the Battle of the Washita as a \n        national historic site and provide opportunities for American \n        Indian groups including the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribe to be \n        involved in the formulation of plans and educational programs \n        for the national historic site.\n\nSEC. 203.
