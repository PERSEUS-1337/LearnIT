FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) No statutory health care program existed for members of \n        the uniformed services who entered service prior to June 7, \n        1956, and retired after serving a minimum of 20 years or by \n        reason of a service-connected disability.\n            (2) Recruiters for the uniformed services are agents of the \n        United States Government and employed recruiting tactics that \n        allowed members who entered the uniformed services prior to \n        June 7, 1956, to believe they would be entitled to fully-paid \n        lifetime health care upon retirement.\n            (3) Statutes enacted in 1956 entitled those who entered \n        service on or after June 7, 1956, and retired after serving a \n        minimum of 20 years or by reason of a service-connected \n        disability, to medical and dental care in any facility of the \n        uniformed services, subject to the availability of space and \n        facilities and the capabilities of the medical and dental \n        staff.\n            (4) After 4 rounds of base closures between 1988 and 1995 \n        and further drawdowns of remaining military medical treatment \n        facilities, access to ``space available'' health care in a \n        military medical treatment facility is virtually nonexistent \n        for many military retirees.\n            (5) The military health care benefit of ``space available'' \n        services and medicare is no longer a fair and equitable benefit \n        as compared to benefits for other retired Federal employees.\n            (6) The failure to provide adequate health care upon \n        retirement is preventing the retired members of the uniformed \n        services from recommending, without reservation, that young men \n        and women make a career of any military service.\n            (7) Although provisions enacted in the Floyd D. Spence \n        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public \n        Law 106-398) extended coverage under the TRICARE program to \n        medicare eligible military retirees age 65 and older, those \n        provisions did not address the health care needs of military \n        retirees under the age of 65.\n            (8) The United States should establish health care that is \n        fully paid by the sponsoring agency under the Federal Employees \n        Health Benefits program for members who entered active duty on \n        or prior to June 7, 1956, and who subsequently earned \n        retirement.\n            (9) The United States should reestablish adequate health \n        care for all retired members of the uniformed services that is \n        at least equivalent to that provided to other retired Federal \n        employees by extending to such retired members of the uniformed \n        services the option of coverage under the Federal Employees \n        Health Benefits program.\n\nSEC. 3. COVERAGE OF MILITARY RETIREES UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES \n              HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Earned Coverage for Certain Retirees and Dependents.--Chapter \n89 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in section 8905, by adding at the end the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(i) For purposes of this section, the term `employee' includes a \nretired member of the uniformed services (as defined in section \n101(a)(5) of title 10) who began service before June 7, 1956. A \nsurviving widow or widower of such a retired member may also enroll in \nan approved health benefits plan described by section 8903 or 8903a of \nthis title as an individual.''; and\n            (2) in section 8906(b)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraphs (2) \n                and (3)'' and inserting ``paragraphs (2) through (5)''; \n                and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following new \n                paragraph:\n    ``(5) In the case of an employee described in section 8905(i) or \nthe surviving widow or widower of such an employee, the Government \ncontribution for health benefits shall be 100 percent, payable by the \ndepartment from which the employee retired.''.\n    (b) Coverage for Other Retirees and Dependents.--(1) Section 1108 \nof title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n``Sec. 1108.
