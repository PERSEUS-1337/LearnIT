SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Morrill Acts enacted in 1862 and 1890 brought about \n        a significant change in the system of education in the United \n        States by providing for the sale of public lands in the West \n        and the dedication of the proceeds of those sales to funding \n        the establishment of practical, accessible land grant colleges \n        and universities in States across the Nation.\n            (2) The land grant colleges and universities have a focus \n        on research, teaching, and outreach, and continue to this day \n        to be leaders in higher education by providing affordable \n        access to high-quality postsecondary education.\n            (3) The land grant colleges and universities also have \n        emerged as one of the greatest sources of advanced research \n        that leverages the United States economy and powers the United \n        States global competitiveness.\n            (4) The land grant colleges and universities, in \n        conjunction with the Cooperative State Research, Education, and \n        Extension Service, serve to disseminate information learned \n        from research and link research activities to larger societal \n        needs.\n            (5) The potential of advanced Internet, digital spectrum, \n        and other telecommunications technologies to increase the \n        quality and reach of educational resources has barely been \n        tapped.\n            (6) Numerous local and regional educational and community \n        organizations are repositories of knowledge, information, and \n        educational resources and programs that, in terms of \n        accessibility to the potential beneficiaries, are fragmented \n        and uncoordinated.\n            (7) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Balanced \n        Budget Act of 1997 established a framework for the transition \n        from analog to digital television and for the auction of \n        publicly-owned analog spectrum.\n            (8) The auction of the analog spectrum is expected to yield \n        over $6,000,000,000 in revenues for the Treasury of the United \n        States.\n            (9) The analog spectrum, as a valuable, publicly-owned \n        asset, is today's equivalent of the public lands of the western \n        frontier of a century ago.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, following \nthe principle of the Morrill Acts that public assets be used for \nbroadening public education, the resources available through the \nauction of the analog spectrum should be tapped to fund the development \nof a new educational and cultural infrastructure that utilizes today's \ntechnologies to expand the reach and impact of existing high-quality \ncommunity educational resources.\n\nSEC. 3.
