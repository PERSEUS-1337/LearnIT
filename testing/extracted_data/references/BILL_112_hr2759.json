SHORT TITLE, ETC.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Business \nTransparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 2010, the Department of Labor identified 128 goods \n        from 70 countries around the world made by forced labor and \n        child labor;\n            (2) the United States is the world's largest importer, and \n        in the twenty-first century, investors, consumers, and broader \n        civil society increasingly demand information about the human \n        rights impact of products in the United States market;\n            (3) in 2010, California enacted the first State law \n        requiring manufacturers and retail companies to publicly \n        disclose their policies to eradicate slavery, forced labor, and \n        human trafficking within their supply chains;\n            (4) the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which prohibits \n        importation of goods made with forced labor or convict labor, \n        has a broad exception for goods that cannot be produced in the \n        United States in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of \n        American consumers;\n            (5) courts have also ruled that consumers do not have \n        standing to bring a civil action in United States courts for \n        enforcement of this provision of the Tariff Act, because the \n        legislative intent was to protect American manufacturers from \n        unfairly priced goods, not to protect consumers from tainted \n        goods, consequently, there are fewer than 40 enforcement \n        actions on record in the past 80 years; and\n            (6) other mechanisms related to slavery and trafficking in \n        the stream of commerce suffer from similar problems of limited \n        scope, broad exceptions, and inability to provide information \n        about specific suppliers whose goods are tainted.\n    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) forced labor, slavery, human trafficking and the worst \n        forms of child labor are among the most egregious forms of \n        abuse that humans commit against each other, in the name of \n        commercial profit;\n            (2) the legislative and regulatory framework to prevent \n        goods produced through forced labor, slavery, human \n        trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor from passing \n        into the stream of commerce in the United States is gravely \n        inadequate; and\n            (3) legislation is necessary to provide the information \n        that the public demands, recognizing that businesses can be \n        part of the solution to these problems when they transparently \n        provide information to consumers and investors, and \n        subsequently respond to consumer and investor demands for \n        business reasons, rather than solely reacting to governmental \n        prescriptions on how to conduct their business.\n\nSEC. 2. DISCLOSURE TO SEC RELATING TO SLAVERY CONDITIONS WITHIN PRODUCT \n              SUPPLY CHAINS.\n\n    Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m), \nis amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(r) Disclosures Relating to Slavery Conditions Within Product \nSupply Chains.--\n            ``(1) Regulations.--Not later than 270 days after the date \n        of the enactment of this subsection, the Commission shall \n        promulgate regulations requiring any person required to file \n        reports with the Commission under this section to include \n        annually in such reports, beginning with the person's first \n        full fiscal year that begins after the date of promulgation of \n        such regulations, a disclosure of any measures such person has \n        taken during the year for which such reporting is required to \n        identify and address conditions of forced labor, slavery, human \n        trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor within such \n        person's supply chains.
