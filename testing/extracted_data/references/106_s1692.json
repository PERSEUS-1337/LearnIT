WADE AND PARTIAL BIRTH \n              ABORTION BANS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n        protected medical procedure throughout the United States since \n        the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 \n        (1973)); and\n            (2) no partial birth abortion ban shall apply to a partial-\n        birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother \n        whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or \n        injury.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that \npartial birth abortions are horrific and gruesome procedures that \nshould be banned.\n\nSEC. 4.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING ROE V. WADE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) reproductive rights are central to the ability of women \n        to exercise their full rights under Federal and State law;\n            (2) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n        protected medical procedure throughout the United States since \n        the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 \n        (1973));\n            (3) the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade \n        established constitutionally based limits on the power of \n        States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to terminate \n        a pregnancy; and\n            (4) women should not be forced into illegal and dangerous \n        abortions as they often were prior to the Roe v. Wade decision.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and secures an \n        important constitutional right; and\n            (2) such decision should not be overturned.\n\n            Passed the Senate October 21, 1999.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                             Secretary.\n106th CONGRESS\n\n  1st Session\n\n                                S. 1692\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                                 AN ACT\n\n To amend title 18, United States Code, to ban partial-birth abortions."
