    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Commute patterns throughout northern California, and in particular through the Altamont Pass corridor, traverse the boundaries of traditional metropolitan planning agencies. The Altamont Pass corridor, located in the center of northern California\u2019s megaregion, is the gateway to the Tri\u2014Valley\u2014a vital node in the bay area\u2019s economic ecosystem and a key bay area transportation route. Strategic and planned interregional mobility is essential to sustained economic vitality.\n(b) Connecting the Bay Area Rapid Transit District\u2019s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in Livermore, as recommended by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission\u2019s regional rail plan, would increase interregional mobility, providing much-needed highway capacity for expanded goods movement to the bay area\u2019s five seaports. It would also relieve pressure on Interstate 580 and other transportation systems, given the exponential population growth in the central valley.\n(c) The Bay Area Rapid Transit District has stated its priority is to operate and maintain its existing core commuter rail system; expansion is not a priority for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Recent rail expansions in other parts of the state have been successfully implemented by single purpose agencies such as the Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority.\n(d) The Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority is needed to connect the Bay Area Rapid Transit District\u2019s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in Tri-Valley and would be responsive to local needs and issues by including local stakeholders in land use and transit planning decisions.\n(e) Consistent with the Bay Area Regional Rail Plan adopted by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (Resolution 3826), the heavy rail connection between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District\u2019s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express is a matter of state interest, and all planning, analysis, alternatives, and mitigations for projects undertaken by the Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority should be consistent with that state interest.\nSEC. 2.\nIt is the intent of the Legislature to establish the Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority to plan and deliver a cost effective and responsive rail extension that connects the Bay Area Rapid Transit District\u2019s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in the Tri-Valley, within the City of Livermore, to address regional economic and transportation challenges.\nSEC. 3.\nChapter 8 (commencing with Section 132651) is added to Division 12.7 of the Public Utilities Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  8. Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority\n132651.\nAs used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:\n(a) \u201cAuthority\u201d means the Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority created under this chapter.\n(b) \u201cBay Area Rapid Transit\u201d means the Bay Area Rapid Transit District\u2019s rapid transit system.\n(c) \u201cBoard\u201d means the governing board of the authority.\n(d) \u201cConnection\u201d means an interregional rail connection between Bay Area Rapid Transit and the Altamont Corridor Express in the Tri-Valley, within the City of Livermore.\n(e) \u201cPhase 1 Project\u201d means the first phase of the connection, which will extend Bay Area Rapid Transit along Interstate 580 to a new station in the vicinity of the Isabel Avenue interchange in the City of Livermore.\n132652.\nThe authority is hereby established for purposes of planning and delivering a cost-effective and responsive connection that meets the goals and objectives of the community.\n132653.\nBy December 1, 2017, the board shall publish a detailed management, finance, and implementation plan relating to the connection.\n132655.\nThe governing board of the authority shall be composed of one representative from each of the following entities to be appointed by the governing board, mayor, or supervisor of each entity:\n(a) The Altamont Corridor Express.\n(b) The Bay Area Rapid Transit District.\n(c) The City of Dublin.\n(d) The City of Livermore.\n(e) The City of Pleasanton.\n(f) The City of Tracy.\n(g) The County of Alameda.\n(h) The County of San Joaquin.\n(i) The East Bay Leadership Council.\n(j) Innovation Tri-Valley.\n(k) The Livermore Amador Valley Transit Authority.\n(l) San Joaquin Partnership.\n132660.\n(a) The board may appoint an executive director to serve at the pleasure of the board.\n(b) The executive director is exempt from all civil service laws and shall be paid a salary established by the board.\n(c) The executive director may appoint staff or retain consultants as necessary to carry out the duties of the authority.\n(d) All contracts approved and awarded by the executive director shall be awarded in accordance with state and federal laws relating to procurement.
