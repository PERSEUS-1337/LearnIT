    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Voting Restoration Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The right to vote is guaranteed in the United States \n        Constitution for all citizens. The right to vote in all \n        governmental elections shall not be abridged or denied on the \n        basis of race, sex, color, or previous conditions of servitude. \n        Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, \n        and this authority has been upheld by the United States Supreme \n        Court on numerous occasions.\n            (2) There is no uniform eligibility standard for \n        participating in Federal elections. Different States have \n        different rules regarding the voting eligibility of ex-felons. \n        While 48 States and the District of Columbia prohibit the \n        voting participation of inmates while serving their sentences, \n        13 States disenfranchise some or all ex-offenders who have \n        completed their sentences. Even in States that allow ex-\n        offenders to vote, the process by which they regain that right \n        makes it difficult for them to vote again. For example, in 8 \n        States, a pardon or order from the Governor is required. In 2 \n        States, the parole or pardon board must act. In addition, in 16 \n        States Federal offenders are not able to regain their right to \n        vote via the State procedure. Instead, those offenders must \n        obtain a Presidential pardon.\n            (3) An estimated 3,900,000 Americans, or approximately 2 \n        percent of the adult population, currently are ineligible to \n        vote as a result of felony conviction. Three-fourths of the \n        disqualified voters are on probation or parole, or are ex-\n        offenders.\n            (4) In recent years, the number of incarcerated individuals \n        has grown exponentially, due in part to onerous drug policies \n        enacted by this body. Current studies point to the fact that 1 \n        in 4 prison inmates in 1998 was incarcerated for a drug offense \n        (compared to 1 in 10 in 1983), and that drug offenders \n        constituted 58 percent of 1998 Federal prison inmates in 1998. \n        The harsh drug laws are not just affecting our men; more than \n        one-third of the women in prison are incarcerated for a drug \n        offense. Overwhelmingly, these drug offenses are nonviolent. \n        Moreover, the racially disparate sentencing laws regarding \n        crack and powder cocaine have resulted in African-Americans \n        being 31 percent of those convicted for Federal drug charges, \n        even though they are only 12 percent of the United States \n        population and 15 percent of drug users.\n            (5) Minorities are disproportionately impacted by laws that \n        remove a felon or ex-felon's right to vote. Currently \n        1,400,000, or 13 percent, of African-American men are barred \n        from participating in Federal elections as a result of a felony \n        conviction.\n            (6) Congress should address these discrepancies and the \n        impact they are having on minority communities. All Americans \n        should be afforded the right to vote in Federal election, under \n        basic principles of fundamental fairness and equal protection.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to restore the \neligibility to vote and register to vote in Federal elections to \nindividuals who have completed sentences for criminal offenses and \npromote the participation of such individuals in the civic life of \ntheir communities.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF RIGHT TO VOTE AND REGISTER TO VOTE IN FEDERAL \n              ELECTIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The right of any individual to vote in an election \nfor Federal office or to register to vote in such an election may not \nbe denied or abridged on the grounds that the individual has been \nconvicted of a felony, except that a State may restrict the right of \nsuch an individual to vote or register to vote in such an election \nduring any period in which the individual remains under the custody or \nsupervision of the State or local jurisdiction (including supervision \nthrough parole or probation).\n    (b) Enforcement.--\n            (1) Private right of action.--\n                    (A) Declaratory or injunctive relief.--(i) A person \n                who is aggrieved by a violation of this Act may provide \n                written notice of the violation to the chief election \n                official of the State involved.\n                    (ii) If the violation is not corrected within 90 \n                days after receipt of a notice under clause (i), or \n                within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the \n                violation occurred during the 120-day period which ends \n                on the date of an election for Federal office, the \n                aggrieved person may bring a civil action in an \n                appropriate district court for declaratory or \n                injunctive relief with respect to the violation.\n                    (iii) If the violation occurred during the 30-day \n                period which ends on the date of an election for \n                Federal office, the aggrieved person shall not be \n                required to provide notice to the chief election \n                official under clause (i) as a condition of bringing a \n                civil action under clause (ii).\n                    (B) Compensatory damages.--If a violation of this \n                Act occurs during the 3-day period which ends on the \n                date of an election for Federal office, a civil action \n                brought under subparagraph (A)(ii) may include a \n                request for compensatory damages with respect to the \n                violation.\n            (2) Action by attorney general.--The Attorney General may \n        bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for such \n        declaratory or injunctive relief as may be necessary to remedy \n        a violation of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM TO ASSIST STATES IN PROTECTING RIGHTS OF EX-\n              FELONS TO VOTE AND REGISTER TO VOTE IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Program.--\n            (1) In general.--There is hereby established a program \n        under which the Attorney General shall award grants to eligible \n        States during each of the first 5 fiscal years which begin \n

elections \n        for Federal office in the State by--\n                    (A) providing information to individuals convicted \n                of felonies regarding their eligibility (or lack \n

paragraph (1); and\n                    (B) such other information and assurances as the \n                Attorney General may require.\n            (3) Amount of grant.--The amount of a grant awarded to a \n        State under this section for a fiscal year shall be equal to \n        the product of--\n                    (A) the total amount appropriated for the year for \n                grants under this section; and\n                    (B) the amount (expressed as a percentage) equal \n                to--\n                            (i) the number of individuals residing in \n                        the State who have been convicted of felonies \n                        (based on the most recent information \n                        available); and\n
