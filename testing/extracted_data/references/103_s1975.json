DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For the purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``historically black colleges and \n        universities'' has the same meaning given the term ``part B \n        institution'' in section 322(2) of the Higher Education Act of \n        1965 (20 U.S.C. 1061(2)); and\n            (2) the term ``historic building and structures'' means a \n        building or structure that is listed on the National Register \n        of Historic Places or is designated as a National Historic \n        Landmark.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Nation's historically black colleges and \n        universities have contributed significantly to the effort to \n        attain equal opportunity through postsecondary education for \n        African-American, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged \n        Americans;\n            (2) over the course of our Nation's history, the Federal \n        Government and the States have discriminated in the allocation \n        of land and financial resources to support the institutions, \n        forcing them to rely on the generous support of private \n        individuals and other charitable organizations;\n            (3) the development of private and charitable financial \n        support for historically black colleges and universities has \n        resulted in structures and buildings of historic importance and \n        architecturally unique design on the campuses of these \n        institutions; and\n            (4) many of the structures and buildings at historically \n        black colleges and universities are national treasures worthy \n        of preservation and restoration for future generations of all \n        Americans and for the students and faculty of the institutions.\n\nSEC. 4.
