FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since its founding, the United States has greatly \n        benefitted from the contributions of women.\n            (2) Historical accounts, monuments, memorials, and museums \n        disproportionately represent men's achievements and \n        contributions and often neglect those of women. For example--\n                    (A) a study of 18 American history textbooks \n                concluded that 10 percent of the material documented \n                contributions of women;\n                    (B) 9 statues out of 91 in the United States \n                Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection depict \n                women; and\n                    (C) only 1 of the 44 monuments operated by the \n                National Park Service specifically honors the \n                achievements of women after the 2016 designation of the \n                Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument.\n            (3) There exists no national museum in the United States \n        that is devoted to the documentation of women's contributions \n        throughout the Nation's history.\n            (4) On December 19, 2014, Congress created a Congressional \n        Commission to study the potential for an American museum of \n        women's history. The bipartisan Commission unanimously \n        concluded that the United States needs and deserves a physical \n        national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical \n        experiences and impact of women in the United States.\n            (5) Establishing a comprehensive women's history museum \n        representing a diverse range of viewpoints, experience, and \n        backgrounds is necessary to more accurately depict the history \n        of the United States and would add value to the Smithsonian \n        Institution.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF MUSEUM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established within the Smithsonian \nInstitution a comprehensive American women's history museum, to be \nnamed by the Board of Regents in consultation with the council \nestablished under section 4.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the museum established under this \nsection shall be to provide for--\n            (1) the collection, study, and establishment of programs \n        relating to women's contributions to various fields and \n        throughout different periods of history that have influenced \n        the direction of the United States;\n            (2) collaboration with other Smithsonian Institution \n        museums and facilities, outside museums, and educational \n        institutions; and\n            (3) the creation of exhibitions and programs that recognize \n        diverse perspectives on women's history and contributions.\n\nSEC. 4.
