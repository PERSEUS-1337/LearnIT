The rate of obesity \n        among Medicare patients doubled from 1987 to 2002, and Medicare \n        spending on obese individuals during that time more than \n        doubled.\n            (4) Men and women with obesity at age 65 have decreased \n        life expectancy of 1.6 years for men and 1.4 years for women.\n            (5) The direct and indirect cost of obesity is more than \n        $450 billion annually.\n            (6) On average, a Medicare beneficiary with obesity costs \n        $1,964 more than a normal-weight beneficiary.\n            (7) The prevalence of obesity among older individuals in \n        the United States is growing at a linear rate and, if nothing \n        changes, nearly half of the elderly population of the United \n        States will have obesity in 2030 according to a Congressional \n        Research Report on obesity.\n\nSEC. 3.
