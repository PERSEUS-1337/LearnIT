FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The knowledge and skills of the United States workforce \n        are fundamental to the economic competitiveness of the Nation \n        today and in the future, however, the United States does not \n        currently possess a comprehensive, effective, and efficient \n        system of workforce preparation and development.\n            (2) Due to global competition, emerging technologies in the \n        workplace, the emergence of quality managing, corporate \n        realignments, and the loss of many low-skilled jobs, United \n        States workers will increasingly need to enhance their skills \n        on a continuing, lifelong basis through such a workforce \n        preparation and development system.\n            (3) Reports from the Comptroller General of the United \n        States have identified 154 different Federal programs, totaling \n        $24,000,000,000, and administered by 14 different Federal \n        agencies, that offer some form of education, job training, or \n        employment assistance to youths and adults.\n            (4) Such reports point to the many problems of duplication \n        and fragmentation that exist within the varied Federal \n        workforce preparation and development programs, including--\n                    (A) the additional costs of administering \n                overlapping workforce preparation and development \n                programs at the Federal, State, and local levels which \n                divert scarce resources that could be better used to \n                assist all individuals in preparing for and entering \n                the workforce; and\n                    (B) conflicting eligibility requirements, annual \n                budgeting and operating cycles, planning and reporting \n                requirements, and performance measurement systems which \n                serve as barriers to the integration of Federal \n                workforce preparation and development programs and \n                result in an inefficient use of resources.\n            (5) Major goals of any reform of the Federal workforce \n        preparation and development system must be--\n                    (A) to streamline and consolidate individual \n                workforce preparation and development programs, \n                eliminating unnecessary duplication and fragmentation \n                in such programs;\n                    (B) to provide maximum authority and responsibility \n                to States and local communities for operation of State \n                and local workforce preparation and development \n                programs;\n                    (C) to stress private sector partnerships and \n                encourage increased leadership and responsibility on \n                the part of the private sector through the use of \n                creative incentives for investment in workforce \n                training (which may include reduced regulatory burdens, \ntax incentives, and employer loans for the training of incumbent \nworkers);\n                    (D) to establish a system which is market-driven, \n                accountable, provides customer choice and easy access \n                to services, and reinforces individual responsibility;\n                    (E) to improve education, literacy, job training \n                and employment assistance programs in the United \n                States, encouraging lifelong learning and skills \n                upgrading through a seamless system connecting \n                elementary, secondary, postsecondary, adult, and work-\n                based training and education; and\n                    (F) to establish a comprehensive, integrated labor \n                market information system to ensure that workforce \n                preparation and development programs are related to the \n                demand for particular skills in local labor markets, \n                and to ensure that information about the employment and \n                earnings of the local workforce, occupations in demand, \n                skill requirements for such occupations, and the \n                performance of education and training providers, are \n                available to job seekers, employers, teachers, \n                students, and decision-makers.\n            (6) Early exposure to career opportunities can enrich the \n        education experience and provide incentives for students to \n        stay in school and achieve higher levels of learning.\n            (7) Millions of families in the United States are trapped \n        in a cycle of poverty, dependency, and undereducation that is \n        linked to illiteracy and low educational achievement, for which \n        adult education and family literacy programs have been shown to \n        be successful in improving the educational attainment and job \n        skills of parents and their children, contributing to \n        reductions in crime, welfare dependency, and enhancing \n        employment opportunities for such individuals.\n            (8) In recent years, a number of innovative States and \n        local communities have begun successful efforts to integrate \n        Federal workforce preparation and development programs through \n        one-stop service delivery systems, however, without exception, \n        such States and communities have experienced numerous Federal \n        barriers to such program integration.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to begin the \ntransformation of the vast array of Federal workforce preparation and \ndevelopment programs from a collection of fragmented and duplicative \ncategorical programs into a streamlined, comprehensive, coherent, high-\nquality, cost-effective, and accountable Federal workforce preparation \nand development system that is designed to meet the education, \nemployment, and training needs of the workforce of the United States, \nboth today and in the future.\n\nSEC. 3.
