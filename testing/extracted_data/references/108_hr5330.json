FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) Areas surrounding the Colorado River in Grand County, \n        Utah, Dinosaur National Monument in Uintah County, Utah, and \n        the Book Cliffs area of Uintah County, Utah, contain nationally \n        recognized scenic values, significant archaeological and \n        historic resources, valuable wildlife habitat, and outstanding \n        opportunities for public recreation that are enjoyed by \n        hundreds of thousands of people annually.\n            (2) In these areas, the State of Utah owns multiple parcels \n        of lands granted by Congress to the State pursuant to the Utah \n        Enabling Act of 1894 (chapter 138; 23 Stat. 107), to be held in \n        trust for the benefit of the State's public school system and \n        other public institutions. The lands are largely scattered in \n        checkerboard fashion amid the Federal lands comprising the \n        remainder of the Colorado River corridor, Dinosaur National \n        Monument and Book Cliffs areas.\n            (3) These State trust lands were granted for the purpose of \n        generating financial support for Utah's public schools through \n        sale or development of natural resources, and the lands are \n        held in trust under State and Federal law for the benefit of \n        the public school system of the State and other beneficiary \n        institutions.\n            (4) State trust lands in the Colorado River corridor, \n        Dinosaur National Monument, and Book Cliffs areas contain \n        significant natural and recreational values, including portions \n        of Westwater Canyon of the Colorado River, the nationally-\n        recognized Kokopelli and Slickrock trails, several of the \n        largest natural rock arches in the United States, multiple \n        wilderness study areas and proposed wilderness areas, and \n        viewsheds for Arches National Park and Dinosaur National \n        Monument.\n            (5) The large presence of State trust lands located within \n        the Colorado River corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and \n        Book Cliffs areas make land and resource management in the \n        areas more difficult, costly, and controversial for both the \n        State of Utah and the United States.\n            (6) Development of Utah State trust lands in these areas in \n        accordance with the purpose for which the lands were granted \n        could be incompatible with management of such areas for \n        recreational, natural, and scenic values.\n            (7) The United States owns lands and interests in lands \n        elsewhere in Utah that can be transferred to the State of Utah \n        in exchange without jeopardizing Federal management objectives \n        or needs.\n            (8) It is in the public interest to enact legislation \n        authorizing an exchange of other federally owned lands in Utah \n        for the Utah State trust lands located within the Colorado \n        River corridor, Dinosaur National Monument and Book Cliffs \n        areas, on terms fair to the State of Utah and the United \n        States.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize, direct, \nfacilitate and expedite the land exchange described herein in order to \nfurther the public interest by disposing of Federal lands with limited \nrecreational and conservation values and acquiring in exchange \ntherefore State trust lands with important recreational, scenic, and \nconservation values for permanent public management and use.\n\nSEC. 3.
