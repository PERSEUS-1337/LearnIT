    "content": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), previously named the Veterans Administration, has been providing veterans educational assistance (GI Bill \u00ae ) benefits since 1944. The benefits have been intended, at various times, to compensate for compulsory service, encourage voluntary service, prevent unemployment, provide equitable benefits to all who served, and promote military retention. In general, the benefits provide grant aid to eligible individuals enrolled in approved educational and training programs. The newest GI Bill was enacted on June 30, 2008, as the Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill), Title V of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-252 ). Although the VA still provides benefits under several older GI Bills, participation and spending for the Post-9/11 GI Bill has represented approximately 80% or more of total GI Bill participation and spending in each year since FY2013. In FY2018, the program is estimated to benefit almost 800,000 individuals and expend over $12 billion. The Post-9/11 GI Bill was enacted in response to findings that \"service on active duty in the Armed Forces [had] been especially arduous for the members of the Armed Forces since September 11, 2001,\" and that there was a need for an educational assistance program that provided \"enhanced educational assistance benefits \u2026 worthy of such service.\" The benefits were designed to meet four main objectives:  1. provide reservists benefits equivalent to members of the regular Armed Forces for equivalent, though often not continuous, active duty service; 2. ensure comprehensive educational benefits; 3. meet military recruiting goals; and 4. improve military retention through transferability of benefits.  It was recognized that veterans and servicemembers would be eligible for U.S. Department of Education (ED) student financial aid benefits such as Pell Grants and Stafford Loans; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) educational assistance; and various state, local, and other federal benefits in addition to the basic Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Many Members of Congress hoped that a benefit that exceeded amounts available under the other active GI Bills would ameliorate the military recruiting challenges and higher unemployment rate among veterans compared with non-veterans of the same age group that existed in 2008.  There was some discussion about whether increasing the monthly benefit might result in lower retention in the Armed Forces. Some DOD research suggested that education is not a very important factor in the decision to stay in or leave the military, while other evidence suggested that very high education benefits would encourage discharge. DOD considered the ability to transfer benefits to dependents critical to retention. The Administration was interested in transferability as well, and President George W. Bush advocated for transferability in a State of the Union address. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is codified under Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 33. The stated purpose is to reward members of the Armed Forces for service on active duty since September 11, 2001; maintain a history of offering educational assistance to veterans; respond to the needs of the Armed Forces when not at peace; demonstrate the high esteem with which military service is held; recognize the difficult challenges involved in readjusting to civilian life after serving; and enhance the educational assistance benefits to those who serve on active duty after September 10, 2001. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides aid payments to or on behalf of participants pursuing approved programs of education for tuition and fees, housing, books and supplies, and other education-related expenditures. The program became effective August 1, 2009. The program is permanently authorized and supported through mandatory funds. Following enactment, concerns were raised about several aspects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and calls were made for the program to be amended. Several laws have been enacted to amend programmatic aspects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 111-32 ), enacted on June 24, 2009, created the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship. The Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010 (Improvements Act; P.L. 111-377 ), enacted on January 4, 2011, made several amendments to the Post-9/11 GI Bill and other veterans' educational assistance programs. The Restoring GI Bill Fairness Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-26 ), enacted on August 3, 2011, temporarily reverses one amendment of the Improvements Act for some individuals attending private institutions of higher learning (IHLs) in seven states. The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-154 ), enacted on August 6, 2012, requires annual reports to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance program (DEA; 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35). The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 ( P.L. 112-239 ), enacted on January 2, 2013, expands eligibility to certain members of the Coast Guard Reserve. The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 (Veterans' Access to Care Act; P.L. 113-146 ), enacted on August 7, 2014, expands eligibility and reduced tuition and fee charges for some participants. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 ( P.L. 114-92 ), enacted on November 25, 2015, prohibits concurrent receipt of unemployment insurance and Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefits. The Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-315 ), enacted on December 16, 2016, extends benefit availability for some individuals and streamlined claim processing. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-48 ), also known as the Forever GI Bill, enacted on August 16, 2017, eliminates the time limitation on use of benefits, expanded eligibility, and modified benefit amounts. The amendments will be noted in this report, as applicable.  This report provides a detailed description of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The first section describes participant eligibility criteria. The second section indicates a participant's entitlement to benefits and the period during which the benefits must be used. The third section describes the eligible programs of education. The subsequent section explains the eligible benefit payments. The final sections illustrate key links to other programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and current data on obligations and participation. The following subsections describe the general eligibility criteria for servicemembers and veterans, the eligibility mechanisms for their dependents, and two unique aspects of eligibility. The first describes the need for individuals to make an irrevocable election to receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. The second describes limited authority for individuals formerly eligible for Reserves Educational Assistance Program (REAP; 10 U.S.C., Chapter 1607) to achieve eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, veterans and servicemembers of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, including the reserve components, and commissioned officers of the Public Health Service (PHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), may be eligible. Individuals must serve an aggregate minimum of 90 days on active duty after September 10, 2001, be discharged or released for a service-connected disability after serving a minimum of 30 continuous days on active duty after September 10, 2001, or be awarded the Purple Heart for service occurring after September 10, 2001.  For reservists, qualifying active duty means a call or order to active duty under Title 10 U.S.C. Sections 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12301(h), 12302, 12304, 12304a, and 12304b; and Title 14 U.S.C. Section 712. For National Guard members, qualifying active duty is the same as for reservists but also includes full-time service in the National Guard for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the National Guard; and full-time service in the National Guard under Title 32 U.S.C. Section 502(f) when authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by federal funds. The active duty service period includes service on active duty in entry-level and skill training if the total active duty service period is at least 24 months. The Post-9/11 GI Bill qualifying active duty service period excludes time assigned to a civilian institution for an education or training program similar to those offered to civilians, excludes time spent as a cadet or midshipman at one of the service academies, excludes other active duty service periods required to meet a service academy or Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) obligation, excludes service that is terminated because of a defective enlistment and induction, and excludes active duty service periods required to meet a student loan repayment obligation (10 U.S.C., Chapter 109).  Once the active duty service period is met, individuals must either continue on active duty or be discharged or released from active duty in one of the following manners: with an honorable discharge; with active duty characterized as honorable service and placement on the retired list, transfer to the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, or placement on the temporary disability retired list; with active duty characterized as honorable service and further service in a reserve component; or with active duty characterized as honorable service as a result of a medical condition which preceded active duty and is not service-connected, a hardship, or a physical or mental condition that was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own willful misconduct but did interfere with the individual's performance of duty. The Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship Program (Fry Scholarship) authorizes the spouse and children of individuals who, on or after September 11, 2001, die in the line of duty while serving on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces to be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The Armed Forces include the Reserves and National Guard, but exclude the Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Children may be unmarried or married. Children include children born outside of marriage and acknowledged, legally adopted children, and stepchildren who are members of the households of eligible individuals.  Subject to certain service requirements, servicemembers eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill (qualifying individuals) may transfer their benefits to certain family members. Statutory provisions establish framework requirements for transferability and require DOD to regulate the eligibility criteria for qualifying individuals and the transfer processes. Under Post-9/11 GI Bill statutory provisions, qualifying individuals must have completed at least six years of service (active duty or Selected Reserve) when requesting a transfer of benefits and agree to serve four additional years. Effective July 12, 2019, DOD policy will further require that at the time of the request to transfer benefits, qualifying individuals must not have completed more than 16 years of service and must not be precluded from serving four additional years. Generally, in order to designate to whom qualifying individuals want to transfer benefits, qualifying individuals must be current members of the Armed Forces (active duty or Selected Reserve) or active duty members of the Commissioned Corps of the PHS and NOAA. In other words, qualifying individuals who have retired or been separated are generally ineligible to designate a transferee. In addition, individuals who retired or were separated before August 1, 2009, the effective date of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, did not have the option to transfer benefits. P.L. 115-48 provides two exceptions allowing transfers for qualifying individuals who are no longer members of the Armed Forces a qualifying individual may transfer the remaining entitlement from a deceased transferee to another dependent; and a transferee may transfer the remaining entitlement to another dependent following the death of the qualifying individual. Qualifying individuals can transfer benefits to their child, their spouse, or some combination of children and spouse. The family members must be enrolled in the DOD Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS) and be eligible for DOD benefits at the time the transfer is designated. The qualifying individual may revoke the transfer designation at any time. Many Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible individuals are also eligible for another veterans' educational assistance program or the Post-9/11 GI Bill through a different mechanism. Other veterans' educational assistance programs are REAP, DEA, the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD; 38 U.S.C., Chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR; 10 U.S.C., Chapter 1606), or Chapter 107 of Title 10 U.S.C. (professional military education). Individuals with a single qualifying active duty service period must make an irrevocable election to give up benefits under one other program to receive benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The individuals must be otherwise eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals who are eligible for both the Fry Scholarship and DEA based on the death of a spouse or a single parent must elect the program from which to receive benefits. These decisions are generally irrevocable.  Beginning January 1, 2017, the VA may make an irrevocable election decision on behalf of an individual who fails to do so and may change an election it deems to be contrary to the individual's interests. After notification of the VA's election, individuals will have 30 days to change such an alternative election. In addition to the individuals described above, some individuals who lost REAP eligibility as a result of its November 25, 2015 sunset date may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. In accordance with VA procedures, REAP-qualifying active duty service may be credited toward Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides eligible persons an entitlement to educational assistance. This entitlement is measured in time\u2014months and days. For qualifying individuals, the entitlement period is 36 months (or its equivalent in part-time educational assistance). Generally, receipt of educational assistance payments for one day of full-time pursuit reduces the entitlement period by one day or a proportional percentage of a day for less-than-full-time pursuit. However, certain educational assistance payments reduce the entitlement period depending on the amount of the payment, as highlighted in the section on benefit payments.  The entitlement of a transferee may be less than or equal to 36 months. The qualifying individual's 36 months of entitlement may be variously distributed to himself, a child, a spouse, or some combination of himself, a child, and a spouse. Further, the qualifying individual can modify the number of months of transferred entitlement or revoke the designation at any time. As dependents use the transferred benefit, the remaining entitlement periods of both the dependents and qualifying individual are reduced. In some instances, the entitlement period may be extended or modified.  Any entitlement that was charged for an incomplete course or program for which the individual is unable to receive credit or lost training time as a result of an educational institution closing is restored. The same applies to an entitlement initially charged for a course or program if a necessary course is disapproved by a subsequently established or modified policy, regulation, or law. In addition, an entitlement is not charged for the interim (through the end of the academic term but no more than 120 days) housing allowance paid following either a closure or disapproval. The entitlement period is not reduced for individuals who must discontinue a course(s) and fail to receive credit or training time as a result of certain service obligations. For reservists, a call to active duty under Section 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304 of Title 10 U.S.C. qualifies. For active duty servicemembers, assignment to a new duty location or an increased amount of work qualifies. In general, once the entitlement period is exhausted, veterans and servicemembers may continue receiving educational assistance through the end of the academic term if more than halfway through, or a 12-week period if not on an academic term schedule.  Some individuals are subject to a delimiting date after which no Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits may be earned or paid. For individuals whose last discharge or release from active duty was before January 1, 2013, no benefits may be paid 15 years or more after discharge or release from active duty. Spouses using benefits transferred from qualifying individuals who were last discharged or released from active duty service before January 1, 2013, must use the benefits within 15 years of the qualifying individuals' last discharge or release. Children using transferred benefits must use the benefit before reaching 26 years of age. For Fry Scholarship recipients, the benefit is available  for children who first became eligible before January 1, 2013, until age 33, and for spouses who first became eligible before January 1, 2013, during the 15-year period following the spouse first becoming eligible.  All other individuals are not subject to a delimiting date. For individuals whose last discharge or release from active duty was on or after January 1, 2013, there is no delimiting date. Spouses using benefits transferred from qualifying individuals who were last discharged or released from active duty service on or after January 1, 2013, may use the benefits until the entitlement is exhausted. For Fry Scholarship recipients who first became eligible on or after January 1, 2013, the benefit is available until the entitlement is exhausted. There are limitations on when family members may begin using their benefits. A spouse can begin using transferred benefits after the servicemember completes at least six years of service. Spouses who subsequently divorce Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible individuals are still eligible to use the transferred benefits unless the qualifying individuals revoke the transfer. Children using transferred benefits have to achieve a high school diploma, achieve the equivalent of a high school diploma, or reach 18 years of age before using a transferred benefit. In addition, the qualifying individual has to complete at least 10 years of service before a designated child can use the transferred benefit. Fry Scholarship recipients may begin using the benefits once eligible, except that children must be at least 18 years of age. Like most veterans' educational assistance benefits, Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits can be used to support students pursuing approved programs of education at a variety of training establishments and educational institutions, including institutions of higher learning (IHLs). The eligible programs may include the following: The eligible programs of education must be approved by a state approving agency (SAA) or the VA, or must be deemed approved by statutory provisions. SAAs are federally authorized state entities that approve programs of education for the GI Bills. Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, several types of benefit payments are available, including payments for tuition and fees, the Yellow Ribbon program, housing, books and supplies, tutorial assistance, test fees, and relocation and travel assistance. The following describes the various payments and the criteria for determining the amount of each payment for which participants may be eligible. For individuals using transferred benefits, children receive payments as if not on active duty, whereas spouses receive payments according to the current status of the qualifying individuals. Covered Post-9/11 GI Bill participants must be charged no more than in-state tuition and fees. Covered participants are members of the Armed Forces on active duty for a period of more than 30 days in the state in which the public institution of higher education is located, and such members' spouse and dependent children. In addition, covered participants attending public IHLs are  qualifying individuals who were discharged or released from an active duty service period of not fewer than 90 days within three years of the date of enrollment; individuals using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits transferred from an individual described above; Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship recipients; and individuals using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits transferred from a member of the uniformed services who is serving on active duty. The public IHL may require the covered participant to demonstrate intent to establish residency, by a means other than physical presence, in order to qualify for in-state tuition. As long as a covered participant remains continuously enrolled at the institution, the participant remains eligible for in-state tuition and fee charges. The maximum payment levels for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies are summarized in Table 1 by program of education. The housing allowance is based on the DOD-determined monthly basic allowance for housing (BAH) for a member of the Armed Forces with dependents in pay grade E-5 (hereinafter referred to as the \"E-5 with dependents BAH\"). Many individuals will receive payments that are lower than these maximum payments as a result of the length of their qualifying active duty service or other eligibility characteristics (see Table 2 ), their enrollment rate or rate of pursuit, actual charges, active duty status, being enrolled exclusively through distance learning, and receipt of DOD Tuition Assistance (TA). Through TA, military service branches pay a certain amount of tuition and expenses for education and training to servicemembers. Eligible individuals who are not on active duty, are pursuing a program of education in residence or online leading to a degree at an IHL, and are enrolled more than half-time may receive the following payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies: Tuition and fees . Individuals attending public IHLs in programs of education leading to a degree are eligible to receive payments equal to the \"actual net cost for in-state tuition and fees\" for the program of education, reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ) and less certain waivers, reductions, scholarships, and assistance. Individuals attending private or foreign IHLs in programs of education leading to a degree are eligible to receive the lesser of the private school maximum ( Table 1 ), reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ), or the \"actual net cost for tuition and fees\" for the program of education less certain waivers, reductions, scholarships, and assistance and reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ). The applicable scholarships and sources of assistance used to offset the \"actual net cost for tuition and fees\" are those provided directly to the IHL for the sole purpose of defraying tuition and fees. The applicable scholarships and assistance specifically exclude loans and Pell Grants. The tuition and fees benefit is paid directly to the IHL for each academic term. Housing Allowance . The housing allowance is paid directly to eligible individuals monthly. For individuals not enrolled exclusively through distance learning, the monthly housing allowance equals the E-5 with dependents BAH in the military housing area of the IHL (or the campus of the IHL where the individual physically participates in a majority of classes for initial enrollments on or after August 1, 2018). The housing allowance is reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ) and the individual's enrollment rate (rounded to the nearest multiple of 10). For example, an individual enrolled in 10 credit hours, assuming 12 credit hours as full-time, receives 80% of the E-5 with dependents BAH where the IHL is located, reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ). For attendance at foreign institutions, the monthly housing allowance equals the national average of the E-5 with dependents BAH. For individuals enrolled exclusively through distance learning, the monthly housing allowance is 50% of the national average of the E-5 with dependents BAH, reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ) and the individual's enrollment rate. Books and Supplies Stipend . Individuals also receive a maximum stipend of $1,000 per year for books and required educational expenses. The stipend is paid monthly directly to eligible individuals based on the number of credit hours, or their equivalent, in which individuals are enrolled each term. Each credit hour, or its equivalent, is worth $41.67, reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ). This stipend does not reduce the entitlement period and does not reduce other benefit payments. Individuals serving on active duty, including Fry Scholarship recipients who are serving on active duty, while enrolled more than half-time in programs of education leading to a degree may receive the following payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies: Tuition and fees . The tuition and fees benefit is paid directly to the IHL on behalf of eligible individuals for each academic term. The benefit amount is at a public IHL, the \"actual net cost for in-state tuition and fees\" for the program of education, reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ) and less certain waivers, reductions, scholarships, and assistance; at a private or foreign IHL, the lesser of the private school maximum ( Table 1 ), reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ), or the \"actual net cost for tuition and fees\" for the program of education, reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ) and less certain waivers, reductions, scholarships, and assistance; or the amount allowable under the Tuition Assistance \"Top-Up\" Program (see \" Tuition Assistance \"Top-Up\" Program \"). Housing Allowance . Individuals who are in programs of education leading to a degree and serving on active duty are ineligible to receive a Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance. Books and Supplies Stipend . Individuals enrolled more than half-time in programs of education leading to a degree while on active duty receive for each academic term a lump sum stipend for books and supplies in the amount of $1,000, reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ) and according to the proportion of a complete academic year that such academic term constitutes.  Individuals pursuing apprenticeship or on-the-job training more than half-time may receive the following payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies: Tuition and fees . Individuals pursuing apprenticeship or on-the-job training more than half-time are ineligible to receive a tuition and fees benefit. Housing Allowance . Individuals pursuing apprenticeship or on-the-job training more than half-time receive a monthly housing allowance equal to 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of the E-5 with dependents BAH where the employer is located for the first six months, second six months, third six months, fourth six months, and thereafter, respectively. The housing allowance is further reduced depending on the length of time served on qualifying active duty ( Table 2 ) and by the proportion of working/training hours completed each month that is below 120. Books and Supplies Stipend . Individuals pursuing apprenticeship or on-the-job training more than half-time receive a books-and-supplies stipend each academic term in the amount of $83 per month, reduced according to the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ). Individuals enrolled more than half-time in programs of education consisting of flight training that is not at an IHL and that does not lead to a degree may receive the following payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies: Tuition and fees . Individuals enrolled more than half-time in flight training receive a tuition and fees benefit equal to the lesser of the flight training maximum ( Table 1 ), reduced according to the length of time served on qualifying active duty (see Table 2 ), or the \"actual net cost for in-state tuition and fees\" for the program of education, less certain waivers, reductions, scholarships, and assistance. The tuition and fees benefit is paid to the educational institution after individuals complete the training. Housing Allowance . Individuals pursuing flight training are ineligible to receive a housing allowance. Books and Supplies Stipend . Individuals pursuing flight training are ineligible to receive a books and supplies stipend. Correspondence training differs from distance learning or online education in that individuals in correspondence training usually receive lessons in the mail and have a certain amount of time to complete and return them for a grade. Individuals enrolled more than half-time exclusively in correspondence training programs, regardless of the type of institution, may receive the following payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies: Tuition and fees . Individuals enrolled exclusively in correspondence training more than half-time receive a tuition and fees benefit equal to the lesser of the correspondence training maximum ( Table 1 ), reduced according to the length of time served on qualifying active duty (see Table 2 ), or the \"actual net cost for tuition and fees\" for the program of education less certain waivers, reductions, scholarships, and assistance. The tuition and fees benefit is paid to the educational institution after the individuals complete the training. Housing Allowance . Individuals pursuing correspondence training exclusively are ineligible to receive a housing allowance. Books and Supplies Stipend . Individuals pursuing correspondence training exclusively are ineligible to receive a books and supplies stipend. Active duty and non-active duty individuals who are enrolled more than half-time at a non-college degree granting institution, referred to by statute as a certificate or non-college degree program at an institution or establishment other than an IHL that is not on-the-job, apprenticeship, flight, or correspondence training, may receive the following payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies: Tuition and fees . Individuals enrolled more than half-time in programs of education not leading to a degree receive a tuition and fees benefit equal to the lesser of the private school maximum ( Table 1 ), reduced according to the length of time served on qualifying active duty (see Table 2 ), or the \"actual net cost for in-state tuition and fees\" less certain waivers, reductions, scholarships, and assistance. The tuition and fees benefit is paid to the educational institution each academic term. Housing Allowance . For individuals pursuing a program of education in-residence, the monthly housing allowance is equal to the E-5 with dependents BAH where the educational institution is located, reduced according to the length of time served on qualifying active duty (see Table 2 ) and in proportion to the enrollment rate. Individuals pursuing a program of education through distance learning receive 50% of the amount received by individuals pursuing a program of education in-residence. Books - and - Supplies Stipend . Individuals enrolled more than half-time in programs of education not leading to a degree receive a books-and-supplies stipend in the amount of $83 per month paid to the individuals for each academic term, reduced according to the length of time served on qualifying active duty (see Table 2 ).  Individuals enrolled half-time or less in any program of education and regardless of the active duty status may receive the following payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies: Tuition and fees . Individuals enrolled half-time or less are eligible for a tuition and fees benefit of the \"actual net cost for in-state tuition and fees\" assessed by the IHL less certain waivers, reductions, scholarships, and assistance, but not more than the amount for which the individuals would have been eligible if enrolled more than half-time in a program of education leading to a degree at an IHL. Housing Allowance . Individuals enrolled half-time or less are ineligible to receive a housing allowance. Books - and - Supplies Stipend . Individuals enrolled half-time or less may receive a books-and-supplies stipend that is a percentage of the maximum stipend of $1,000 per year, reduced in proportion to their enrollment rate. The percentage of the stipend is determined by the length of time served on active duty ( Table 2 ). In cases in which an IHL's tuition and fees are not fully covered by the tuition and fees payment benefits, the IHL may voluntarily enter into a Yellow Ribbon Program agreement with the VA to match an equal percentage of some portion of the remaining tuition and fees. Yellow Ribbon Program agreements benefit participants enrolled in private IHLs and charged as out-of-state students at public IHLs. The Yellow Ribbon Program covers a portion of the tuition and fees that exceed the base Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fees benefit. The Yellow Ribbon Program payment is paid equally by the IHL and the VA. The program allows IHLs to enter into agreements with the VA to match a certain amount of the tuition and fees not already covered by the basic Post-9/11 GI Bill. Each IHL must establish the number of eligible individuals it is willing to support and how much it is willing to contribute for each individual. VA regulations allow IHLs to specify their support by each sub-element: college or professional school; and by student status: undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral. Several IHLs have variously agreed to support between one and an unlimited number of eligible students for an amount from $50 per semester to the maximum amount needed by the student (see box below for an example of how the Yellow Ribbon program works). The program is only available to participants who are at the 100% benefit level, including Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship recipients and Purple Heart recipients. As long as the IHL remains in the Yellow Ribbon Program, individuals admitted under the program who maintain satisfactory progress will continue to be supported under the program.  Individuals are entitled to payment, not to exceed $100 monthly and up to a maximum of $1,200 over the course of the entitlement period, for tutorial assistance provided the IHL certifies that the individuals need tutoring to pass a course(s) required for the approved program of education. The maximum tutorial assistance is not reduced depending on the length of qualifying active duty service. Tutorial assistance does not reduce the entitlement period and does not reduce other benefit payments. A fee of up to $2,000 may be reimbursed for each approved licensing or certification test as long as the payment does not exceed the individual's remaining Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement. The benefit is available regardless of whether individuals pass the test. For AY2017-2018 and earlier, the entitlement charge is one month (rounded to the nearest whole non-zero month) for each payment that equals the monthly rate of $1,902.61. Therefore, for AY2017-2018 and earlier, each test reduces an individual's entitlement by a minimum of one month. For tests taken in AY2018-2019 and beyond, the entitlement charge is prorated based on the amount of the test fee in relation to the monthly rate ($1,974.91 in AY2018-2019). Neither the benefit nor the entitlement charge depends on the length of qualifying active duty service. Individuals may receive reimbursement for a national test for admission to an IHL, a national test providing an opportunity for course credit at an IHL, and a national test that evaluates prior learning and knowledge and that provides an opportunity for course credit at an IHL. The maximum benefit for a test will be the individual's remaining Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement. For AY2017-2018 and earlier, the entitlement charge is one month (rounded to the nearest whole non-zero month) for each payment that equals the monthly rate of $1,902.61. Therefore for AY2017-2018 and earlier, each test reduces an individual's entitlement by a minimum of one month. For tests taken in AY2018-2019 and beyond, the entitlement charge is prorated based on the amount of the test fee in relation to the monthly rate ($1,974.91 in AY2018-2019). Individuals who reside in rural counties and who either relocate a distance of at least 500 miles to pursue a program of education or must travel by air to attend an IHL are entitled to a single payment of up to $500. The relocation assistance does not reduce the entitlement period, does not reduce other benefit payments, and is not reduced depending on the length of qualifying active duty service. An advance payment is the first partial and first full month of the housing allowance and is available to individuals who are planning to enroll more than half-time and who have not received educational assistance benefits in 30 days or more. Advance payments are sent to the educational institution for disbursal to the student within 30 days of the start of the academic term. Although regulations clarify the eligibility requirements for advance payments of the monthly housing allowance, VA guidance and policy documents indicate that advance payments are not available under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  Military service branches may provide various incentives to recruit and retain high quality individuals in the Armed Forces. Eligible recruits and servicemembers may be given a choice of one of several incentives such as cash bonuses. Enlistment kickers, affiliation kickers, and reenlistment kickers are based on the criticality of skill and/or unit or the length of service commitment and are realized when the individuals use their GI Bill benefit. The expected benefit amount is deposited into the DOD Educational Benefits Trust Fund until the individuals take advantage of the benefit, at which time the benefit amount is transferred to the VA for payment. The additional assistance, $150\u2013$950, is added to the individuals' monthly housing allowance. As a result, individuals who enroll half-time or less or who are serving on active duty are not eligible because they are not eligible to receive a housing allowance. The amount may be reduced depending on the individuals' time served on active duty and, for individuals who make an irrevocable election to receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits in lieu of benefits under the MGIB-AD or MGIB-SR, in proportion to the enrollment rate.  The Tuition Assistance (TA) \"Top-Up\" program was established under the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 ( P.L. 106-398 ) to promote retention. Under Tuition Assistance Top-Up, Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible servicemembers receiving TA benefits on active duty may elect to receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to pay tuition and fees charges above the amount paid by TA. Individuals may not receive more Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits than the individuals would have otherwise been eligible. The amount of Top-Up is not reduced by the length of time served on qualifying active duty. Entitlement is charged one month for each month enrolled full-time and proportionally reduced based on the enrollment rate. Individuals are generally required to make a $1,200 contribution to be eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD) benefits. For individuals who make an irrevocable election to receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits in lieu of MGIB-AD benefits, their unused MGIB-AD contributions are refunded as an addition to the last Post-9/11 GI Bill monthly housing allowance once the entitlement period is exhausted. If individuals are not eligible for the monthly housing allowance or fail to exhaust the entitlement period, the unused MGIB-AD contributions are not refunded.  Under the MGIB-AD $600 Buy-Up program, servicemembers may contribute up to $600 to the military service branch in multiples of $20 and receive for every $20 contributed up to an additional $5 every month (up to $5,400 total) during which the individuals receive MGIB-AD benefits. Individuals in the Post-9/11 GI Bill forfeit any contributions to the $600 MGIB-AD Buy Up program. Under the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship, the VA is authorized to grant up to an additional nine months of limited entitlement to selected Post-9/11 GI Bill participants. The scholarship is intended to provide selected individuals extra time to achieve their educational objective in qualifying science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.  To be eligible for selection, the Post-9/11 GI Bill participant must have exhausted or almost (within 180 days) exhausted his or her Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement. Individuals using transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (see the section entitled \" Transferees \") are not eligible. In addition, to be eligible the individual must be enrolled in a qualifying STEM program that leads to either  a bachelor's degree requiring more than 128 semester (or 192 quarter) credit hours once the individual has completed at least 60 semester (or 90 quarter) credit hours toward the degree, or a teaching certification following completion of a qualifying STEM bachelor's degree requiring more than 128 semester (or 192 quarter) credit hours.  The qualifying STEM fields are listed in statutory provisions and may be augmented by the Secretary. The Secretary's selection of eligible individuals must give priority to individuals who require the most credit hours and individuals at the 100% benefit level. Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholars receive payments of up to $30,000 for tuition and fees, the housing allowance, and the books and supplies stipend during the additional entitlement period. An individual may be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon program but may not receive the VA match. They are not eligible for tutorial assistance, test fees, and relocation and travel assistance. Finally, the aggregate Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship payments to all selected individuals are limited to $0 in FY2018; $25 million in FY2019, starting on August 1, 2019; $75 million in each of FY2020 through FY2022; and $100 million in each fiscal year thereafter. Many individuals are eligible for more than one veterans' educational assistance program. Individuals who served on active duty after June 30, 1985, may be eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD; 38 U.S.C., Chapter 30); and reservists who served on active duty during the period between September 10, 2001, and November 25, 2015, may be eligible for the Reserves Educational Assistance Program (REAP; 10 U.S.C., Chapter 1607). Individuals who are serving in the Selected Reserve may be eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR; 10 U.S.C., Chapter 1606). Individuals who have served in the Armed Forces and who are or were the dependents of servicemembers who were disabled, delayed, or died as a result of military service may be eligible for the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance program (DEA; 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35). Statutory provisions govern how and to what extent benefits from different programs may be used. With a few exceptions, veterans and servicemembers with more than one qualifying active duty service period or event can generally combine benefit programs administered by the VA to receive no more than 48 months of educational benefits. Individuals eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on their service and eligible for transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are not subject to the 48-month limit. Effective October 1, 2013, DEA-eligible individuals who are also eligible for another GI Bill program may combine benefit programs to receive up to 81 months of entitlement.  If individuals make an irrevocable election for the Post-9/11 GI Bill after using some entitlement under the MGIB-AD, MGIB-SR, or REAP, the Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement is equal to the remaining months of entitlement under the other program. However, an individual who exhausts benefits under one program may make an irrevocable election to use the same period of qualifying active duty service (for service before August 1, 2011) to receive an additional 12 months of benefits (up to 48 aggregate months) under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. However, benefits cannot be received concurrently under more than one program. Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible individuals who receive benefits from the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program (VR&E) program are eligible for an alternative subsistence allowance. VR&E is an entitlement program that provides job training and related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities. VR&E participants receive a subsistence allowance based on the number of dependents, type of education or training pursued, and rate of attendance. Effective October 1, 2015, the regular subsistence allowance for full-time training at an IHL is $885.00 monthly for individuals with two dependents. Individuals eligible for both VR&E and the Post-9/11 GI Bill may choose to receive the regular subsistence allowance or the E-5 with dependents BAH for the zip code in which the rehabilitation program is located. Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible individuals may also be eligible to receive Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX), which provides income support to former active duty military personnel or reservists who were recently released from active duty while they search for work. Individuals may not establish Post-9/11 GI Bill and UCX eligibility based on the same period of service. Individuals receiving a Post-9/11 GI Bill allowance are prohibited from receiving UCX, unless the individuals are otherwise entitled to UCX; are receiving Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits based on their own service or through the Fry Scholarship; are not receiving Title 10 retired pay; and were discharged from the Armed Forces or Commissioned Corps of NOAA under honorable conditions, but did not voluntarily separate. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is an appropriated entitlement program, meaning the entitlement spending is funded in annual appropriations acts. While the funding is provided in the annual appropriations acts, the level of spending for appropriated entitlements is not controlled through the annual appropriations process. Instead, the level of spending for appropriated entitlements is based on the benefit and eligibility criteria established in law, and the amount provided in appropriations acts is based on meeting this projected level. Obligations for the Post-9/11 GI Bill have increased from $5.5 billion in FY2010, the first full year of implementation, to an estimated $12.2 billion in FY2019 ( Table 3 ). Participation has more than doubled from over 350,000 in FY2010 to an estimate of almost 800,000 in FY2019. On average in FY2010, participants received almost $14,500 each in benefits, and participants in FY2019 are estimated to receive almost $15,900 each. Participation data by program of education are not currently available. "
