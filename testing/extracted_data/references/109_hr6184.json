    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Academic Anesthesiology and \nCRNA Payment Improvement Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since 1991, the Medicare program has reduced \n        reimbursements for anesthesia services provided to Medicare \n        beneficiaries by 50 percent in certain instances when education \n        of student nurse anesthetists or anesthesiology medical \n        residents is involved, imposing financial disincentives against \n        anesthesia education. These Medicare payment policies are known \n        as anesthesia teaching rules.\n            (2) In 2002, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n        (CMS) authorized an alternative payment system for certain \n        cases involving nurse anesthesia education and subsequently for \n        anesthesiology resident education, in which the agency allowed \n        reimbursement for base units plus discontinuous time. However, \n        the alternative has not propagated in the marketplace and CMS \n        has declined to reform the anesthesia teaching rules further \n        without an Act of Congress.\n            (3) To ensure the access of patients to safe, high quality \n        anesthesia care, society has a strong interest in providing for \n        high quality anesthesia educational institutions. The \n        population of the United States is aging, resulting in an \n        increase in demand for health care requiring anesthesia and \n        pain management services provided by anesthesiologists and \n        certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs).\n            (4) Though the Institute of Medicine in 2000 found the \n        provision of anesthesia in such year to be 50 times safer than \n        the provision of anesthesia during the 20 years previous to \n        such year, continued evaluation, innovation, and quality \n        improvements in anesthesia are required to further enhance \n        patient safety.\n            (5) As of August 2006, there are 130 anesthesiology \n        residency programs and 102 programs accredited by the Council \n        on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs in \n        the United States. Under the current payment rules under the \n        Medicare program, both anesthesiology residency and nurse \n        anesthesia educational programs report challenges recruiting \n        and retaining faculty.\n            (6) Since part B under the Medicare program provides for \n        reimbursement for the services of anesthesiologists and the \n        services of CRNAs, reforms to the anesthesia teaching rules \n        under the Medicare program should treat teaching \n        anesthesiologists and teaching CRNAs similarly with respect to \n        anesthesiology medical residents and student registered nurse \n        anesthetists, respectively, and should not favor one provider \n        over another.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to ensure financial stability of nurse \nanesthesia and anesthesiology educational programs to provide \nsufficient opportunities for student nurse anesthetists and medical \nresidents to pursue the specialty of anesthesia so that patients \ncontinue to have access to quality health care.\n\nSEC. 4. SPECIAL PAYMENT RULE FOR TEACHING ANESTHESIOLOGISTS AND \n              TEACHING CERTIFIED REGISTERED NURSE ANESTHETISTS.\n\n    (a) For Physicians' Services.--Section 1848(a) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (4)(A), by inserting ``except as provided \n        in paragraph (5)(A)'' after ``anesthesia cases,'';
