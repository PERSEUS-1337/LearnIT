FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Remote patient monitoring can make chronic disease \n        management more effective and efficient for patients and the \n        health care system.\n            (2) By collecting, analyzing, and transmitting clinical \n        health information to a health care practitioner, remote \n        monitoring technologies allow patients and physicians to manage \n        the patient's condition in a consistent and real-time fashion.\n            (3) Utilization of these technologies not only improves the \n        quality of care given to patients, it also reduces the need for \n        frequent physician office appointments, costly emergency room \n        visits, and unnecessary hospitalizations.\n            (4) Monitoring a patient's disease from the home reduces \n        the need for face-to-face physician interactions, thereby \n        minimizing unnecessary travel and missed work and providing \n        particular value to individuals residing in rural or \n        underserved communities who would otherwise face potentially \n        significant access barriers to receiving needed care.\n            (5) Four major areas in which remote management \n        technologies are emerging in health care are the treatment of \n        congestive heart failure, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia, and \n        sleep apnea (sleep disordered breathing). Prompt transmission \n        of clinical data on each of these conditions, to the physician \n        or the patient as appropriate, are essential to providing \n        timely and appropriate therapeutic interventions which can then \n        reduce expensive hospitalizations.\n            (6) Despite these innovations, remote management \n        technologies have failed to diffuse rapidly. A significant \n        barrier to wider adoption is the relative lack of payment \n        mechanisms in fee-for-service Medicare to reimburse for remote, \n        non-face-to-face management.\n            (7) This Act will eliminate this barrier to new \n        technologies by requiring Medicare to reimburse doctors for \n        time spent analyzing data transmitted to them by remote patient \n        management technologies.\n            (8) This Act also promotes high quality care by requiring \n        the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consult with \n        physician groups to create a standard of care and a quality \n        standard for remote patient management services for the covered \n        chronic conditions.\n\nSEC. 3. COVERAGE OF REMOTE PATIENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR CHRONIC CARE \n              CONDITIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1861(s)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395x(s)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (Z), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n            (2) by adding ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (AA); and\n            (3) by adding after subparagraph (AA) the following new \n        subparagraph:\n            ``(BB) remote patient management services (as defined in \n        subsection (ccc)).''.\n    (b) Services Described.--Section 1861 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n\n      ``Remote Patient Management Services for Chronic Conditions\n\n    ``(ccc)(1) The term ``remote patient management services'' means \nthe remote monitoring and management of an individual with a covered \nchronic health condition (as defined in paragraph (2)) or through the \nutilization of a system of technology that allows a remote interface to \ncollect and transmit clinical data between the individual and the \nresponsible physician or supplier for the purposes of clinical review \nor response by the physician or supplier.\n    ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term `covered chronic \nhealth condition' includes--\n            ``(A) heart failure;\n            ``(B) diabetes;\n            ``(C) cardiac arrhythmia;\n            ``(D) sleep apnea; and\n            ``(E) any other chronic condition determined by the \n        Secretary to be appropriate for treatment through remote \n        patient management services.\n    ``(3)(A) The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate physician \ngroups, may develop guidelines on the frequency of billing for remote \npatient management services.
