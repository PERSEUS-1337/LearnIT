FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) Caregiving is an essential element of family life and a \n        vital service for children, the ill, the disabled, and the \n        elderly.\n            (2) The establishment of a caregiver credit would bolster \n        the economic prospects of unpaid caregivers and would provide \n        them with vital retirement security.\n            (3) The 2018 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the \n        Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability \n        Insurance Trust Funds concluded that the combined Trust Funds \n        will be able to pay scheduled benefits in full until 2034.\n            (4) While there is no immediate crisis, policy options \n        should be considered to extend OASDI solvency, including by \n        eradicating the gender wage gap, increasing overall employment, \n        or increasing the minimum wage.\n\nSEC. 3.
