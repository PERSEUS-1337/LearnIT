FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The year 2005 marks the 175th anniversary of a \n        courageous vote on the floors of Congress by David Crockett.\n            (2) In 1830, during the 21st Congress, Representative David \n        Crockett rose to speak out in opposition to a bill for the \n        funding of the removal of Southeastern Native American tribes \n        to the west of the Mississippi River.\n            (3) He was the only Member of Congress from his State to \n        oppose the bill, was fully aware that the majority of his \n        constituents favored the bill, and understood that he was \n        providing his political foes with an issue that they could--and \n        did--use to attack him.\n            (4) Undaunted by threats of political retaliation, he \n        refused to support a bill designed to remove what he called \n        ``the poor remnants of a once powerful people'' from their \n        ancestral homes, claiming instead that he would ``sooner be \n        honestly and politically damned, than hypocritically \n        immortalized''.\n            (5) The year 2005 also marks the 50th anniversary of the \n        release of a feature-length motion picture that returned David \n        Crockett to the position he had enjoyed 125 years earlier as \n        the classic image of the American frontier and the best \n        reflection of the frontier spirit.\n            (6) As ``Davy'' Crockett, he was popularized in movies and \n        television, and he became a cultural icon of the 1950s.\n            (7) David Crockett first appeared on the national scene as \n        the representative of a new, proud, and irreverent American \n        character and culture, unique and apart from European customs \n        and mores.\n            (8) As a young man from the backwoods of East Tennessee, \n        David Crockett mastered the skills necessary for life on the \n        American frontier, including marksmanship and hunting.\n            (9) The first rifle he owned, with which he developed those \n        skills, is included in the collection at the East Tennessee \n        Historical Society and will be featured prominently when the \n        Historical Society opens its expanded museum exhibit in 2005.\n            (10) His quick wit and natural leadership abilities allowed \n        him to move from the humblest of settings to the halls of \n        Congress.\n            (11) David Crockett was a committed public servant serving \n        2 terms in the Tennessee General Assembly and 3 terms in the \n        United States House of Representatives.\n            (12) During the last 3 months of his life, he fought with \n        others to secure independence for the Republic of Texas before \n        he died a hero's death at the Alamo at the age of 49.\n            (13) His life was chronicled during and immediately after \n        his lifetime through theatrical productions, biographies, and \n        in a series of almanacs from 1835-1856, galvanizing his persona \n        as a true American folk hero.\n            (14) He has been the subject of at least 17 motion pictures \n        and 12 television programs during the 20th century.\n            (15) David Crockett personified the spirit of independence, \n        individualism, and justice in his opposition to the Indian \n        removal bill, a position that was opposed by powerful political \n        opponents, unpopular with a majority of his own constituents, \n        but dedicated to principle.\n            (16) He was guided in this, as he was throughout his life, \n        by his best-known maxim: ``Be always sure you are right, then \n        go ahead.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
