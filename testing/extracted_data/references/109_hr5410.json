    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``No Taxation Without Representation \nAct of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The residents of the District of Columbia are the only \n        Americans who pay Federal income taxes and who have fought and \n        died in every American war but are denied voting representation \n        in the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n            (2) The residents of the District of Columbia suffer the \n        very injustice against which our Founding Fathers fought, \n        because they do not have voting representation as other \n        taxpaying Americans do and are nevertheless required to pay \n        Federal income taxes unlike the Americans who live in the \n        territories.\n            (3) The principle of one person, one vote requires that \n        residents of the District of Columbia are afforded full voting \n        representation in the House and the Senate.\n            (4) Despite the denial of voting representation, Americans \n        in the Nation's Capital are third among residents of all States \n        in per capita income taxes paid to the Federal Government.\n            (5) Unequal voting representation in our representative \n        democracy is inconsistent with the founding principles of the \n        Nation and the strongly held principles of the American people \n        today.\n\nSEC. 3. REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the District of \nColumbia shall be treated as a State for the purposes of representation \nin the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nSEC. 4. ELECTIONS.\n\n    (a) First Elections.--\n            (1) Proclamation.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Mayor of the District of Columbia \n        shall issue a proclamation for elections to be held to fill the \n        2 Senate seats and the seat in the House of Representatives to \n        represent the District of Columbia in Congress.\n            (2) Manner of elections.--The proclamation of the Mayor of \n        the District of Columbia required by paragraph (1) shall \n        provide for the holding of a primary election and a general \n        election and at such elections the officers to be elected shall \n        be chosen by a popular vote of the residents of the District of \n        Columbia. The manner in which such elections shall be held and \n        the qualification of voters shall be the same as those for \n        local elections, as prescribed by the District of Columbia.\n            (3) Classification of senators.--In the first election of \n        Senators from the District of Columbia, the 2 senatorial \n        offices shall be separately identified and designated, and no \n        person may be a candidate for both offices. No such \n        identification or designation of either of the 2 senatorial \n        offices shall refer to or be taken to refer to the terms of \n        such offices, or in any way impair the privilege of the Senate \n        to determine the class to which each of the Senators elected \n        shall be assigned.\n    (b) Certification of Election.--The results of an election for the \nSenators and Representative from the District of Columbia shall be \ncertified by the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the manner \nrequired by law and the Senators and Representative shall be entitled \nto be admitted to seats in Congress and to all the rights and \nprivileges of Senators and Representatives of the States in the \nCongress of the United States.\n\nSEC. 5. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MEMBERSHIP.\n\n    (a) In General.--Upon the date of enactment of this Act, the \nDistrict of Columbia shall be entitled to 1 Representative until the \ntaking effect of the next reapportionment. Such Representative shall be \nin addition to the membership of the House of Representatives as now \nprescribed by law.\n    (b) Increase in Membership of House of Representatives.--Upon the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the permanent membership of the House of \nRepresentatives shall increase by 1 seat for the purpose of future \nreapportionment of Representatives.\n    (c) Reapportionment.--Upon reapportionment, the District of \nColumbia shall be entitled to as many seats in the House of \nRepresentatives as a similarly populous State would be entitled to \nunder the law.\n\nSEC. 6.
