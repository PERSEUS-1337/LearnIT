FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the $69,246,000,000 unified budget surplus achieved in \n        fiscal year 1998 was entirely due to surpluses generated by the \n        social security trust funds and the cumulative unified budget \n        surpluses projected for subsequent fiscal years are primarily \n        due to surpluses generated by the social security trust funds;\n            (2) Congress and the President should balance the budget \n        excluding the surpluses generated by the social security trust \n        funds;\n            (3) according to the Congressional Budget Office, balancing \n        the budget excluding the surpluses generated by the social \n        security trust funds will reduce the debt held by the public by \n        a total of $1,723,000,000,000 by the end of fiscal year 2009; \n        and\n            (4) social security surpluses should be used to enhance \n        retirement security or to reduce the debt held by the public \n        and should not be spent on other programs.\n\nSEC. 3.
