    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Preservation Matching Grant \nAct of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) more than 55,300 affordable housing dwelling units in \n        the United States have been lost through termination of low \n        income affordability requirements, which usually involves the \n        prepayment of the outstanding principal balance under the \n        mortgage on the project in which such units are located;\n            (2) more than 265,000 affordable housing dwelling units in \n        the United States are currently at risk of prepayment;\n            (3) the loss of the privately owned, federally assisted \n        affordable housing, which is occurring during a period when \n        rents for unassisted housing are increasing and few units of \n        additional affordable housing are being developed, will cause \n        unacceptable harm on current tenants of affordable housing and \n        will precipitate a national crisis in the supply of housing for \n        low-income households;\n            (4) the demand for affordable housing far exceeds the \n        supply of such housing, as evidenced by studies in 1998 that \n        found that--\n                    (A) 5,300,000 households (one-seventh of all \n                renters in the Nation) have worst-case housing needs; \n                and\n                    (B) the number of families with at least one full-\n                time worker and having worst-case housing needs \n                increased from 1991 to 1995 by 265,000 (24 percent) to \n                almost 1,400,000;\n            (5) the shortage of affordable housing in the United States \n        reached a record high in 1995, when the number of low-income \n        households exceeded the number of low-cost rental dwelling \n        units by 4,400,000;\n            (6) between 1990 and 1995, the shortage of affordable \n        housing in the United States increased by 1,000,000 dwelling \n        units, as the supply of low-cost units decreased by 100,000 and \n        the number of low-income renter households increased by \n        900,000;\n            (7) there are nearly 2 low-income renters in the United \n        States for every low-cost rental dwelling unit;\n            (8) 2 of every 3 low-income renters receive no housing \n        assistance and about 2,000,000 low-income households remain on \n        waiting lists for affordable housing;\n            (9) the shortage of affordable housing dwelling units \n        results in low-income households that are not able to acquire \n        low-cost rental units paying large proportions of their incomes \n        for rent; and\n            (10) in 1995, 82 percent of low-income renter households \n        were paying more than 30 percent of their incomes for rent and \n        utilities.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to promote the preservation of affordable housing units \n        by providing matching grants to States that have developed and \n        funded programs for the preservation of privately owned housing \n        that is affordable to low-income families and persons and was \n        produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;\n            (2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants who \n        are currently residing in such housing, many of whom are \n        elderly or disabled persons; and\n            (3) to continue the partnerships among the Federal \n        Government, State and local governments, and the private sector \n        in operating and assisting housing that is affordable to low-\n        income Americans.\n\nSEC. 3.
