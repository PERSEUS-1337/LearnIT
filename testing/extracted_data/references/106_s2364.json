EXPANSION OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT STATEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1143(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1320b-13(a)(2)) is amended by striking ``and'' at the end of \nsubparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (D) \nand inserting a semicolon, and by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(E) a statement providing information that--\n                    ``(i) while the old age, survivors, and disability \n                insurance program currently collects more in employer, \n                employee, and self-employment contributions than such \n                program pays out in retirement, disability, survivor, \n                and auxiliary benefits each year, such program will \n                begin to run cash flow deficits in 2015, thereafter \n                necessitating the allocation of general tax revenues in \n                order to finance promised benefits; and\n                    ``(ii) the trust funds for such program contain \n                claims on future Government resources sufficient to \n                cover the deficit through 2037, but after that date, \n                the trust funds would collect sufficient revenues to \n                pay 72 percent of benefits; and\n            ``(F) a statement explaining the nature of the Federal old \n        age, survivors, and disability insurance trust funds, including \n        the following: `Social Security Trust Fund balances are \n        available to finance future benefit payments and other Trust \n        Fund responsibilities only in a bookkeeping sense.

Instead, such balances are claims on \n        the United States Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be \n        financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or \n        reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large \n        Social Security Trust Fund balances, therefore, does not, by \n        itself, have any impact on the Federal Government's ability to \n        pay benefits.'.\nFor purposes of subparagraph (E), the dates and percentages described \nin such subparagraph shall be adjusted annually based on the \nAlternative II (Intermediate) findings of the Office of the Chief \nActuary contained in the most recent report of the Board of \nTrustees.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \napply with respect to statements provided after the date of enactment \nof this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.

For purposes of \n                this paragraph, annual cash income of the Trust Funds \n                shall be determined by including payroll and benefit \n                tax revenues, but not intragovernmental transfers or \n                interest income.\n                    ``(B) The annual excess of such projected annual \n                outlays from the Trust Funds over the annual cash \n                income of the Trust Funds in each year, beginning with \n                the first year identified in subparagraph (A) and \n                extending through the year of projected program \n                insolvency.\n                    ``(C) The aggregate amount of the annual excesses \n                identified in subparagraph (B) for the 75-year \n                projection period included in the report and the change \nin such amount from the previous year's report.\n                    ``(D) The amount of deficit or surplus that the \n                old-age, survivor, and disability insurance program \n                will run in the last year in the 75-year projection \n                period included in the report and the aggregate assets \n                and unfunded obligations contained in the Trust Funds \n                in that final projected year.\n                    ``(E) The amount that payroll taxes would have to \n                be raised or benefits be reduced (both in percentage \n                terms) in order to keep the old-age, survivor, and \n                disability insurance program in annual financial \n                balance after any cumulative balances in the Trust \n                Funds are exhausted.
