FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 8,000,000 children, representing 21 percent \n        of all public school children in the United States, attend \n        public schools in rural areas.\n            (2) There are 24,123 public schools in rural areas of the \n        United States, representing 31 percent of all public schools.\n            (3) More than 400,000 educators, or 31 percent of all \n        public school teachers, teach in rural schools.\n            (4) Rural school teachers earn approximately 14 percent \n        less than their counterparts in other regions.\n            (5) Despite lower salaries, rural school teachers typically \n        teach multiple subjects and perform their jobs with fewer \n        resources than their counterparts in other regions.\n            (6) One of the most critical challenges facing rural school \n        districts is in attracting and retaining qualified teachers.\n            (7) Rural school districts tend to have higher teacher \n        turnover rates than school districts in other regions.\n            (8) High teacher turnover has a negative impact on student \n        performance, school district performance, and the ability of \n        teachers to become highly qualified.\n\nSEC. 3.
