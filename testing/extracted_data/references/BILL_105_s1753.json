FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many States and school districts will need to build new \n        schools to accommodate increasing student enrollments; the \n        Department of Education has predicted that the Nation will need \n        6,000 more schools by the year 2006.\n            (2) In response to reduced class mandates enforced by State \n        governments and increased enrollment, many school districts \n        have been forced to utilize temporary classrooms and other \n        structures to accommodate increased school populations, along \n        with resorting to year-round schedules for students.\n            (3) Research has proven a direct correlation between the \n        condition of school facilities and student achievement. \n        Recently, researchers found that the test scores of students \n        assigned to schools in poor condition can be expected to fall \n        10.9 percentage points behind the test scores of students in \n        buildings in excellent condition. Similar studies have \n        demonstrated up to a 20 percent improvement in test scores when \n        students were moved from a school with poor facilities to a new \n        facility.\n            (4) While school construction and maintenance are primarily \n        a State and local concern, States and communities have not, on \n        their own, met the increasing burden of providing acceptable \n        school facilities, and the poorest communities have had the \n        greatest difficulty meeting this need.\n            (5) Many local educational agencies have difficulties \n        securing financing for school facility construction and \n        renovation, especially in States that require a \\2/3\\ majority \n        of voter approval for the passage of local bond initiatives.\n            (6) The Federal Government, by providing interest subsidies \n        and similar types of support, can lower the costs of State and \n        local school infrastructure investment, creating an incentive \n        for businesses to support local school infrastructure \n        improvement efforts.\n            (7) The United States competitive position within the world \n        economy is vulnerable if America's future workforce continues \n        to be educated in schools not equipped for the 21st century. \n        America must do everything in its power to properly educate its \n        people to compete in the global marketplace.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to help local educational agencies bring \nall public school facilities up to an acceptable standard and build the \nadditional classrooms needed to educate the growing number of students \nwho will enroll in the next decade.\n\nSEC. 4. CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BONDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to business-related \ncredits) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 45D.
