FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n        in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n        enforcement officer in the United States had the protection of \n        an armor vest;\n            (2) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, 709 law \n        enforcement officers in the United States were feloniously \n        killed in the line of duty;\n            (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n        risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not wearing \n        an armor vest is 14 times higher than for officers wearing an \n        armor vest;\n            (4) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, bullet-\n        resistant materials helped save the lives of more than 2,000 \n        law enforcement officers in the United States; and\n            (5) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n        Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n        country has risen sharply, despite a decrease in the national \n        crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n        crisis in Indian country''.\n\nSEC. 3.
