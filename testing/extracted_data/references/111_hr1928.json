    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Home Healthcare Nurse Promotion Act \nof 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There is a significant shortage of home healthcare \n        nurses, which is harming individuals' access to cost-effective \n        home healthcare, particularly among underserved and high-risk \n        populations. A recent survey found that 59 percent of visiting \n        nurse associations indicated they must decline patient \n        referrals on a weekly basis.\n            (2) The increasing aging population, prevalence of chronic \n        disease, and strong preference by individuals to live \n        independently at home as long as possible will create an \n        unprecedented demand for home-based care during the next \n        several decades. By 2020, home health utilization is projected \n        to increase by 36 percent.\n            (3) The demand for home healthcare nurses is projected to \n        increase by 109 percent by 2020, compared to 37 percent for \n        hospital nurses.\n            (4) An estimated 1,000,000 new registered nurses will be \n        needed by 2016 to fill new demand for nurses and replace \n        retirees.\n            (5) Visiting nurse associations have been shown to lower \n        costs for high-cost patient populations. Yet because they \n        provide a substantial amount of uncompensated care, they are \n        increasingly unable to compete for nurses in a national nursing \n        shortage environment.\n            (6) A recent survey by the Visiting Nurses Association of \n        America found that--\n                    (A) staff nursing rate shortages average around 10 \n                percent;\n                    (B) 81 percent of visiting nurse associations \n                indicate that salary limitations are the number one \n                barrier to recruitment; and\n                    (C) 22 percent of visiting nurse associations \n                indicate that their local hospital offers salaries \n                $10,000 greater than they are able to offer.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to increase home health \ncare services, particularly for underserved and at-risk populations, \nby--\n            (1) assisting visiting nurse associations and other non-\n        profit home health agencies to improve training and workforce \n        development for home healthcare nurses;\n            (2) promoting and facilitating academic-practice \n        collaborations; and\n            (3) improving recruitment and retention of home healthcare \n        nurses.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINING VISITING NURSE ASSOCIATION.\n\n    Section 801 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296) is \namended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(16) Visiting nurse association.--The term `visiting \n        nurse association' means a home health agency that--\n                    ``(A) has a participation agreement in effect under \n                section 1866 of the Social Security Act;\n                    ``(B) is a nonprofit entity exempt from taxation \n                under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n                1986;\n                    ``(C) is organized and participating under title \n                XVIII of the Social Security Act as a provider of \n                services separately from any other provider of services \n                under such title; and\n                    ``(D) is governed by a board of directors and all \n                members of the board (excluding the head of the agency \n                in any case in which the head of the agency is a board \n                member) serve on such board on an exclusively volunteer \n                basis.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
