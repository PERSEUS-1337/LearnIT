LOWER RIO GRANDE WATER CONSERVATION AND IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary, acting pursuant to the Reclamation \nAct of 1902 (Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388) and Acts amendatory \nthereof and supplementary thereto, shall undertake a program in \ncooperation with the State, water users in the program area, and other \nnon-Federal entities, to investigate and identify opportunities to \nimprove the supply of water for the program area as provided in this \nAct. The program shall include the review of studies or planning \nreports (or both) prepared by any competent engineering entity for \nprojects designed to conserve and transport raw water in the program \narea. As part of the program, the Secretary shall evaluate alternatives \nin the program area that could be used to improve water supplies, \nincluding the following:\n        (1) Lining irrigation canals.\n        (2) Increasing the use of pipelines, flow control structures, \n    meters, and associated appurtenances of water supply facilities.\n    (b) Program Development.--Within 6 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the State, \nshall develop and publish criteria to determine which projects would \nqualify and have the highest priority for financing under this Act. \nSuch criteria shall address, at a minimum--\n        (1) how the project relates to the near- and long-term water \n    demands and supplies in the study area, including how the project \n    would affect the need for development of new or expanded water \n    supplies;\n        (2) the relative amount of water (acre feet) to be conserved \n    pursuant to the project;\n        (3) whether the project would provide operational efficiency \n    improvements or achieve water, energy, or economic savings (or any \n    combination of the foregoing) at a rate of acre feet of water or \n    kilowatt energy saved per dollar expended on the construction of \n    the project; and\n        (4) if the project proponents have met the requirements \n    specified in subsection (c).\n    (c) Project Requirements.--A project sponsor seeking Federal \nfunding under this program shall--\n        (1) provide a report, prepared by the Bureau of Reclamation or \n    prepared by any competent engineering entity and reviewed by the \n    Bureau of Reclamation, that includes, among other matters--\n            (A) the total estimated project cost;\n            (B) an analysis showing how the project would reduce, \n        postpone, or eliminate development of new or expanded water \n        supplies;\n            (C) a description of conservation measures to be taken \n        pursuant to the project plans;\n            (D) the near- and long-term water demands and supplies in \n        the study area; and\n            (E) engineering plans and designs that demonstrate that the \n        project would provide operational efficiency improvements or \n        achieve water, energy, or economic savings (or any combination \n        of the foregoing) at a rate of acre feet of water or kilowatt \n        energy saved per dollar expended on the construction of the \n        project;\n        (2) provide a project plan, including a general map showing the \n    location of the proposed physical features, conceptual engineering \n    drawings of structures, and general standards for design; and\n        (3) sign a cost-sharing agreement with the Secretary that \n    commits the non-Federal project sponsor to funding its \n    proportionate share of the project's construction costs on an \n    annual basis.\n    (d) Financial Capability.--Before providing funding for a project \nto the non-Federal project sponsor, the Secretary shall determine that \nthe non-Federal project sponsor is financially capable of funding the \nproject's non-Federal share of the project's costs.\n    (e) Review Period.--Within 1 year after the date a project is \nsubmitted to the Secretary for approval, the Secretary, subject to the \navailability of appropriations, shall determine whether the project \nmeets the criteria established pursuant to this section.\n    (f) Report Preparation; Reimbursement.--Project sponsors may choose \nto contract with the Secretary to prepare the reports required under \nthis section.
