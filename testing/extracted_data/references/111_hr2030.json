FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 \n        (Public Law 109-121)--\n                    (A) makes access to safe water and sanitation for \n                developing countries a specific policy objective of \n                United States foreign assistance programs;\n                    (B) requires the Secretary of State to--\n                            (i) develop a strategy to elevate the role \n                        of water and sanitation policy; and\n                            (ii) improve the effectiveness of United \n                        States assistance programs undertaken in \n                        support of that strategy;\n                    (C) codifies Target 10 of the United Nations \n                Millennium Development Goals; and\n                    (D) seeks to reduce by half between 1990 (the \n                baseline year) and 2015--\n                            (i) the proportion of people who are unable \n                        to reach or afford safe drinking water; and\n                            (ii) the proportion of people without \n                        access to basic sanitation.\n            (2) On December 20, 2006, the United Nations General \n        Assembly, in GA Resolution 61/192, declared 2008 as the \n        International Year of Sanitation, in recognition of the impact \n        of sanitation on public health, poverty reduction, economic and \n        social development, and the environment.\n            (3) On August 1, 2008, Congress passed H. Con. Res. 318, \n        which--\n                    (A) supports the goals and ideals of the \n                International Year of Sanitation; and\n                    (B) recognizes the importance of sanitation on \n                public health, poverty reduction, economic and social \n                development, and the environment.\n            (4) While progress is being made on safe water and \n        sanitation efforts--\n                    (A) more than 884,000,000 people throughout the \n                world lack access to safe drinking water; and\n                    (B) 2 of every 5 people in the world do not have \n                access to basic sanitation services.\n            (5) The health consequences of unsafe drinking water and \n        poor sanitation are significant, accounting for--\n                    (A) nearly 10 percent of the global burden of \n                disease; and\n                    (B) more than 2,000,000 deaths each year.\n            (6) The effects of climate change are expected to produce \n        severe consequences for water availability and resource \n        management in the future, with 2,800,000,000 people in more \n        than 48 countries expected to face severe and chronic water \n        shortages by 2025.\n            (7) According to the November 2008 report entitled, \n        ``Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World'', the National \n        Intelligence Council expects rapid urbanization and future \n        population growth to exacerbate already limited access to \n        water, particularly in agriculture-based economies.\n            (8) A 2009 report published in the Proceedings of the \n        National Academy of Sciences projects that the effects of \n        climate change will produce long-term droughts and raise sea \n        levels for the next 1,000 years, regardless of future efforts \n        to combat climate change.\n            (9) According to the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n        commissioned by the United Nations, more than \\1/5\\ of the \n        world population relies on freshwater that is either polluted \n        or excessively withdrawn.\n            (10) The impact of water scarcity on conflict and \n        instability is evident in many parts of the world, including \n        the Darfur region of Sudan, where demand for water resources \n        has contributed to armed conflict between nomadic ethnic groups \n        and local farming communities.\n            (11) In order to further the United States contribution to \n        safe water and sanitation efforts, it is necessary to--\n                    (A) expand foreign assistance capacity to address \n                the challenges described in this section; and\n                    (B) represent issues related to water and \n                sanitation at the highest levels of United States \n                foreign assistance and diplomatic deliberations, \n                including those related to issues of global health, \n                food security, the environment, global warming, and \n                maternal and child mortality.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the United States should lead a \nglobal effort to bring sustainable access to clean water and sanitation \nto poor people throughout the world.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is--\n            (1) to provide first-time access to safe water and \n        sanitation, on a sustainable basis, for 100,000,000 people in \n        high priority countries (as designated under section 6(f) of \n        the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (22 \n        U.S.C. 2152h note)) by 2015; and\n            (2) to enhance the capacity of the United States Government \n        to fully implement the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor \n        Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-121).\n\nSEC. 5.
