FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One-third of minority youth are unemployed.\n            (2) The labor force participation rate for persons without \n        a high school diploma is 20 percentage points lower than the \n        labor force participation rate for high school graduates.\n            (3) Nationally, approximately 70 percent of all students \n        graduate from high school, but African-American and Hispanic \n        students have a 55 percent or lower chance of graduating from \n        high school.\n            (4) High school dropouts from the class of 2004 will cost \n        the Nation more than $325,000,000,000 in lost wages, taxes, and \n        productivity over their lifetimes.\n            (5) Only 52 percent of students in the 50 largest cities in \n        the United States graduate from high school. That rate is below \n        the national high school graduation rate of 70 percent, and \n        also falls short of the average high school graduation rate of \n        60 percent for urban districts across the Nation.\n            (6) Over a lifetime, a high school dropout earns, on \n        average, about $260,000 less than a high school graduate, and \n        about $1,000,000 less than a college graduate.\n            (7) Approximately 75 percent of State prison inmates and 59 \n        percent of Federal prison inmates have not completed high \n        school. Increasing the high school completion rate by 1 percent \n        for all men ages 20 to 60 would save the United States \n        $1,400,000,000 annually in reduced costs associated with crime.\n            (8) According to a recent study, a 10-percent increase in \n        the male high school graduation rate would reduce arrest rates \n        for murder and assault by about 20 percent, motor vehicle theft \n        by 13 percent, and arson by 8 percent.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide adequate \nresources for national nonprofit organizations to prevent and reduce \nthe disproportionate incarceration of eligible youth, especially \nminority youth, and to prepare eligible youth for entry into \nemployment, or education leading to employment, that places \nparticipants on a path to economic self-sufficiency and provides \nopportunities for advancement, by providing a comprehensive set of \nservices that includes job training, education, and support services.\n\nSEC. 3. URBAN JOBS PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle D of title I of the Workforce Investment \nAct of 1998 is amended by inserting after section 173A (29 U.S.C. \n2918a) the following:\n\n``SEC. 173B.
