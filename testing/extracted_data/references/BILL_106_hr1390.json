FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Working people provide about 65 percent of Federal \n        revenue through social security taxes on their earnings and \n        through income taxes on their earnings and employment-related \n        retirement income.\n            (2) By contrast, income taxes on unearned income produce \n        only about 11 percent of total Federal revenue.\n            (3) Practically all wage and salary income is required to \n        be reported on personal income tax returns and, except for \n        those receiving earned income credits, is generally fully taxed \n        at regular income tax rates.\n            (4) By contrast, unearned income (such as capital gains, \n        dividends, interest, and rental income) is favored by a large \n        number of special tax provisions, so that (A) some unearned \n        income is taxed at lower rates, (B) some unearned income is \n        tax-deferred and the income taxes need not be paid until many \n        years after the income is accrued, and (C) large amounts of \n        unearned income will never be taxed at all under present law.\n            (5) Working people are subject to social security taxes as \n        well as income taxes, and for over 90 percent of the population \n        the combined tax on earned income--30.3 percent or 43.3 \n        percent--is higher than the income tax rates of 15 percent and \n        28 percent that apply to unearned income.\n            (6) The market value of all stocks traded on the New York \n        Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) was \n        about 3 trillion dollars in early 1989. In early 1999 it is \n        more than 13 trillion dollars. Thus there appears to be roughly \n        10 trillion dollars of realized and unrealized capital gains on \n        these stocks, plus additional large amounts of capital gains on \n        foreign stocks, real estate, and other assets.\n            (7) Large amounts of capital gains will never be taxed \n        under present law, because (A) capital gains are not taxed \n        until the asset is sold or transferred, and (B) unrealized \n        capital gains are never taxed if the owner holds the asset for \n        life and bequeaths it to his or her heirs, even if the heirs \n        sell it immediately after death.\n            (8) Owners of nonresidential real estate are allowed \n        depreciation deductions for the full cost of buildings over 39 \n        years, even though the buildings when built are intended to \n        stand, and usually do stand, for 100 years or more.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION IN INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each of the tables contained in subsections (a), \n(b), (c), (d), and (e) of section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``15%'' and inserting ``12%'';\n            (2) by striking ``28%'' and inserting ``25%'';\n            (3) by striking ``31%'' and inserting ``28%'';\n            (4) by striking ``36%'' and inserting ``33%''; and\n            (5) by striking ``39.6%'' and inserting ``36.6%''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999.\n    (c) Section 15 Not To Apply.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \nshall not be treated as a change in the rate of a tax imposed by \nchapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for purposes of section \n15 of such Code.\n\nSEC. 4.
