FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress has established a policy of dedicating revenue \n        from the production and use of nonrenewable resources to \n        reinvest in public land resources for American families and \n        their children through programs such as the Land and Water \n        Conservation Fund.\n            (2) Since its creation by Congress in 1965, the Land and \n        Water Conservation Fund has been responsible for nearly \n        7,000,000 acres of parkland, refuges and open spaces, and the \n        development of more than 37,000 State and local parks and \n        recreation projects. From parks to playgrounds, wilderness to \n        wetlands, open trails to open spaces, the Land and Water \n        Conservation Fund has been an American success story.\n            (3) The need for open spaces and recreation has soared. \n        Combined estimates from the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service, National Park Service, United States Forest Service, \n        and Bureau of Land Management total a $7,000,000,000 backlog to \n        meet current land acquisition needs. This backlog includes \n        lands critical to conserving wetlands, watersheds and \n        wilderness, protecting wildlife refuges and habitat, preserving \n        important historic and cultural sites and providing trails and \n        open spaces for outdoor recreation.\n            (4) Conserving our Nation's most valuable natural and \n        cultural treasures is critical to conserving America's heritage \n        of open space and the great outdoors.\n            (5) Suburban and urban sprawl and the loss of open space \n        have become a primary concern for local communities with State \n        and local revenues inadequate to address these critical needs.\n            (6) The demand for outdoor recreation, and the \n        corresponding need for more parks, open space and recreation \n        infrastructure, has skyrocketed. The National Survey on \n        Recreation and the Environment (NSRE), conducted by the United \n        States Forest Service, shows explosive growth in most outdoor \n        pursuits, including mountain biking, backpacking, kayaking, and \n        birdwatching.\n            (7) The enormous popularity of youth soccer over the past \n        decade has created an unprecedented demand for new playing \n        fields which to date has been unmet.\n            (8) The welcome increase in athletic participation among \n        women and girls is continuing to increase demand for access to \n        local parks and recreation facilities throughout America.\n            (9) Conserving natural resources, protecting open space, \n        and enhancing recreation opportunity will be effective only if \n        undertaken through Federal, State, and local partnership.\n            (10) The American legacy of conservation and open space is \n        key to ensuring that our Nation's communities are healthy, \n        safe, and secure, and that they are places where American \n        families and their children can enjoy the quality of life that \n        they deserve.\n            (11) The findings of the 1995 National Biological Service \n        study ``Endangered Ecosystems of the United States: A \n        Preliminary Assessment of Loss and Degradation'' demonstrate \n        the need to escalate conservation measures that protect our \n        Nation's wildlands and habitats.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a secure source \nof funds available for Federal land acquisition and to revitalize the \nState, local, and urban needs outlined in the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act of 1965 and the Urban Park and Recreation \nRecovery Act of 1978 by providing matching grants for State, local, and \nurban conservation and recreation needs.\n\nSEC. 3. SECURE FUNDING.\n\n    Section 3 of the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. \n4601-5(c)(1)) is amended as follows:\n            (1) By striking ``Moneys'' the first place it appears and \n        inserting ``Except as provided by subsection (b), moneys''.\n            (2) By inserting ``(a)'' after ``3''.\n            (3) By adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(b)(1) Special Rule.--For any fiscal year beginning after \nSeptember 30, 1998, and ending before October 1, 2015, from amounts \ncovered into the Fund in the preceding fiscal year, there is \nappropriated for purposes of this Act $900,000,000.

Such sum shall be \n        apportioned among the States pursuant to section 6 (in this Act \n        referred to as the `State share'). No less than 50 percent of \n        the State share for each State for each such fiscal year shall \n        be directed by the State to local governments to provide \n        natural areas, open space, parklands, or recreational areas.\n            ``(C) $150,000,000 shall be available to the Secretary of \n        the Interior for grants to local governments through the Urban \n        Parks and Recreation Recovery Program (16 U.S.C. 2501-2514).\n            ``(D) $50,000,000 shall be available to the Secretary of \n        the Interior through and including fiscal year 2004, for grants \n        for land acquisition in connection with the American \n        Battlefield Protection Program. For fiscal years 2004 through \n        and including 2014, $50,000,000 shall be available to the \n        Secretary of the Interior for the restoration and acquisition \n        of historical and cultural sites found within the National Park \n        Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management \n        and the National Forest Service.\n    ``(2) The President shall, in his annual budget submission for the \nfiscal year concerned, specify the specific purposes for which the \nfunds referred to in subparagraphs (A), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) \nare to be used by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture. Such funds shall be used by the Secretary concerned for \nthe purposes specified by the President in such annual budget \nsubmission unless the Congress, in the general appropriation Acts for \nthe Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture for \nsuch fiscal year, specifies that any part of such Federal share is to \nbe used by the Secretary concerned for other puposes.\n    ``(3) For purposes of the budget submission, the President shall \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture \nto prepare Federal priority lists for expenditure of the Federal share. \nSuch lists shall be prepared in consultation with the head of the \naffected bureau or agency, taking into account the best professional \njudgment regarding the land acquisition priorities and policies of each \nbureau or agency. In preparing such priority lists, the Secretaries \nshall consider--\n            ``(A) the potential adverse impacts which might result if \n        the acquisition is not undertaken;\n            ``(B) the availability of land appraisal and other \n        information necessary to complete the acquisition in a timely \n        manner; and\n            ``(C) such other factors as the Secretaries deem \n        appropriate.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

Indian/Alaska Native Village Corporations shall be \n        treated as one State and shall allocate their funds in a manner \n        to be determined by the Secretary of the Interior.''.\n            (2) By amending subsection (e)(1) by striking ``, but not \n        including incidental costs relating to acquisition''.\n            (3) By amending subsection (e)(2) by inserting before the \n        period at the end ``or to enhance public safety.''.\n            (4) By striking the second sentence of subsection (f)(5) \n        and inserting: ``The Secretary shall approve such conversion \n        only if the State demonstrates no prudent or feasible \n        alternative exists with the exception of those properties that \n        are no longer viable as an outdoor conservation and recreation \n        facility due to changes in demographics or that must be \n        abandoned because of environmental contamination which \n        endangers public health and safety. Any conversion must satisfy \n        any conditions the Secretary deems necessary to assure the \nsubstitution of other conservation and recreation properties of at \nleast equal market value and reasonably equivalent usefulness and \nlocation and which are in accord with the existing State Plan for \nConservation and Recreation; except that wetland areas and interests \ntherein as identified in the wetlands provisions of the action agenda \nand proposed to be acquired as suitable replacement property within \nthat same State that is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary shall be \nconsidered to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness with the property \nproposed for conversion.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
