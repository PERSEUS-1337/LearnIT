FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Atlantic menhaden are a key piece of the Atlantic \n        ecosystem, from Florida to Maine.\n            (2) Serving as a vital link in the food chain, Atlantic \n        menhaden are a primary source of food for striped bass, \n        bluefish, weakfish, Spanish mackerel, seals, and whales, and \n        are favored by seabirds like loons and ospreys.\n            (3) Atlantic menhaden help maintain water quality by \n        feeding on plankton and decaying plants. In aggregate in the \n        Chesapeake Bay, these valuable living resources have the \n        ability to filter a volume of water equal to the entire bay in \n        less than one day.\n            (4) The Chesapeake Bay, the biggest estuary in North \n        America, is a prime Atlantic menhaden nursery ground for the \n        whole east coast, yet populations there are at historic lows. \n        Juvenile fish are especially low, which is a key indicator of a \n        dwindling population.\n            (5) The Chesapeake Bay is also a major spawning ground for \n        striped bass, which are popular with anglers. Many striped bass \n        in the bay are suffering from malnutrition and disease, and the \n        declining Atlantic menhaden population may be a big factor.\n            (6) Industrial harvests of Atlantic menhaden for reduction \n        purposes are the primary source of fishing mortality.\n            (7) In 2006, Addendum III to the Interstate Fishery \n        Management Plan for Atlantic menhaden established a \n        precautionary cap on harvesting of Atlantic menhaden. However, \n        there is no scientific basis to establish whether the level of \n        harvest allowed by such plan is sustainable.\n            (8) More research and studies are needed to determine the \n        health of Atlantic menhaden populations, but the danger signs \n        clearly point to the need for protection measures now for what \n        is often called the most important fish in the sea.\n\nSEC. 3.
