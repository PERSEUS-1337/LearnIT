PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage greater \ncooperation between Department of Defense research and production \nfacilities and United States industry in order to enhance their mutual \ntechnological and productive achievements.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Department of Defense research and production \n        facilities possess valuable technological resources that could \n        greatly enhance the innovation and productivity of United \n        States industries.\n            (2) As leadership in the development of advanced technology \n        increasingly shifts away from the defense sector of the United \n        States economy to the commercial sector, the Department of \n        Defense will have to draw on private sector technical expertise \n        to satisfy defense needs.\n            (3) Private industry and the Department of Defense have \n        independently identified many of the same technologies as \n        critical for their respective purposes, thereby creating \n        opportunities for the cooperative development and production of \n        dual-use technologies.\n            (4) Department of Defense production and research \n        facilities currently lack adequate incentives to carry out \n        cooperative development activities with private industry and \n        adequate means of measuring progress toward the goal of \n        developing and producing more dual-use technologies.\n            (5) Private industry must have more opportunities to \n        provide input into Department of Defense research and \n        production facilities in order for such facilities to undertake \n        more research, development, and production relating to dual-use \n        technologies.\n\nSEC. 2. FEDERAL DEFENSE LABORATORY DIVERSIFICATION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Program.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall, \nas soon as practicable after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nestablish a program to be known as the Federal Defense Laboratory \nDiversification Program (in this Act referred to as the ``Program'') \nfor the diversification of Federal defense laboratories.\n    (2) The laboratories covered by the Program shall include all \nDepartment of Defense (including its services and agencies) owned or \noperated laboratories and Department of Defense federally funded \nresearch and development centers that undertake more than $5,000,000 in \nresearch (in this Act referred to as the ``Defense laboratories'').\n    (3) The Program shall be managed by the Director of Defense \nResearch and Engineering.\n    (b) Nature of Diversification Program Goals.--The Program shall \nundertake cooperation between Defense laboratories and private industry \nin order to--\n            (1) promote the development and application of dual-use \n        manufacturing technologies to improve quality and efficiency in \n        manufacture of both civilian and defense-oriented products;\n            (2) promote the development and commercialization of dual-\n        use product technologies;\n            (3) promote the transfer of defense or dual-use \n        technologies from laboratories to the private sector for the \n        purpose of commercialization, through patent, royalty, and \n        license agreements, cooperative research and development \n        agreements, and other cooperative agreements and through \n        symposia, meetings, and other mechanisms; and\n            (4) promote the efficient adoption and adaptation of \n        civilian manufacturing product and process technologies to \n        defense needs in sectors critical to maintaining defense \n        preparedness.\n    (c) Development of Benchmarks for Program.--(1) The Director of \nResearch and Engineering, in cooperation with each Defense laboratory \nand in consultation with private industry, shall develop benchmarks for \neach category of diversification activity described in subsection (b) \nfor each Defense laboratory covered by this Act. The benchmarks \nestablished shall cover fiscal years 1993 through 1995 and include for \neach such fiscal year--\n            (A) the budget resources, manpower, and facilities to be \n        utilized by each laboratory; and\n            (B) the dollar value of patents, royalties, and licenses \n        broken down by product or SIC code to be sought and pursued by \n        each laboratory, in implementing the Program.\n    (2) In establishing the benchmark under paragraph (1)(A) for all \nDefense laboratories covered by the Program, the Director shall \nestablish benchmarks concerning the number and value of cooperative \nresearch and development agreements and other cooperative agreements to \nbe established and undertaken, allocating, as appropriate, a minimum of \ntwo to five percent of budget to such cooperative work within two years \nof the establishment of the Program.\n    (3) Program benchmarks shall be established not later than 180 days \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act. Upon establishment of the \nbenchmarks, each Defense laboratory shall promptly proceed to implement \nsame within its overall budget and utilizing other funds that may be \navailable for implementation of this Act.\n    (4) Benchmarks shall be updated each fiscal year on an ongoing \nbasis.\n    (d) Industry Cooperation Mechanisms.--Each Defense laboratory \nparticipating in the Program shall establish an industry and academic \nadvisory panel to promote cooperation between the laboratory and the \nprivate sector in carrying out the Program. Each laboratory shall \nutilize its panel to oversee the development of each year's research \nplan and the implementation of the Program and its benchmarks and to \nprovide advice on how to enhance the dual-use properties of the \nlaboratory's research work on a project-by-project basis.\n    (e) Reports by Director.--(1) Not later than September 30, 1993, \nthe Director of Research and Engineering shall submit to Congress a \nreport on--\n            (A) the results of a survey undertaken by the Director \n        delineating the nature of the research being undertaken at each \n        laboratory included in the Program, evaluating the potential of \n        each laboratory included in the Program to achieve the elements \n        specified in subsection (b); and\n            (B) recommendations on how each such laboratory might \n        become better oriented to achieving such Program elements.\n    (2) Not later than each of September 30 of 1994, 1995, and 1996, \nthe Director shall submit to Congress a report on--\n            (1) the extent to which each laboratory participating in \n        the Program has effectively implemented the benchmarks \n        established by the Program;\n            (2) the accomplishments under the Program in achieving the \n        elements described in subsection (b); and\n            (3) the steps the Director believes necessary to improve \n        the effectiveness of the Program.\n\nSEC. 3. INDUSTRY EVALUATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director of the Office of Technology \nAssessment shall, subject to the approval of the Technology Assessment \nBoard, undertake, in close consultation with industrial firms that have \ncooperated and worked with Federal laboratories, an evaluation of \npractices and procedures that have proven effective in promoting the \nelements of the Program set forth in section 1(b), both in laboratories \ncovered by the Program and elsewhere.\n    (b) Additional Evaluation.--In addition to the evaluation under \nsubsection (a), the Director shall--\n            (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the Program in achieving \n        optimal cooperation with private industry in meeting the \n        elements set forth in section 1(b); and\n            (2) make recommendations for any improvements in practices \n        and procedures for cooperating with industry that should be \n        implemented.\n    (c) Submittal Date.--The evaluations required under this section \nshall be submitted not later than 24 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act.\n    (d) Utilization of Report Information.--The Director of Research \nand Engineering shall utilize the recommendations and results of such \nstudy in ongoing implementation of the Program."
