This section shall \nnot apply in the case of a trade embargo imposed by the President that \nprohibits all trade with the country subject to the embargo, if the \nCongress passes a law approving of the embargo.\n    (b) Filing of Claim.--To obtain compensation under subsection (a), \na producer shall file a claim with the Secretary of Agriculture \nspecifying the amount of the damages incurred by the producer as a \nresult of an embargo described in subsection (a).\n    (c) Calculation of Damages.--For each agricultural commodity \nproduced in the United States and subject to an embargo described in \nsubsection (a), the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine the \ndifference, if any, between the average price of the agricultural \ncommodity for the 12-month period ending on the date the agricultural \ncommodity became subject to the embargo and the average price of the \nagricultural commodity for the 12-month period immediately after that \ndate. The Secretary shall adjust the amount determined under the \npreceding sentence to reflect only the amount of the price reduction \nresulting from the embargo. Producers shall use the adjusted amount to \ncalculate their damages. If the embargo extends beyond the first year, \nthe Secretary shall redetermine the difference between the average \nprices during each subsequent 12-month period.\n    (d) Payment.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall forward the \nproducer's claim to the Commodity Credit Corporation, which shall pay \nthe producer, from funds available to the Corporation, an amount equal \nto--\n            (1) three times the amount of the damages determined under \n        subsection (c), in the case of an agricultural commodity \n        subject to a trade embargo imposed by the President; or\n            (2) the amount of the damages determined under subsection \n        (c), in the case of an agricultural commodity subject to a \n        retaliatory embargo imposed by a foreign country in response to \n        the President's embargo.\n    (e) Reimbursement.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall reimburse \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation, from funds in the Treasury not \notherwise appropriated, for all payments made by the Corporation under \nsubsection (d).\n    (f) Adjudication of Disputes.--In the case of a dispute arising in \nconnection with a claim under this section, the United States Court of \nFederal Claims shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim and \nenter judgment accordingly. If the Court enters judgment on behalf of \nthe producer, the United States shall be responsible for the costs \nincurred by the producer to pursue the claim.\n    (g) Notification of Congress.--As soon as possible after the \nPresident imposes an embargo described in subsection (a) or is informed \nof a retaliatory embargo, the President shall notify the Congress \nregarding--\n            (1) the agricultural commodities subject to the embargo;\n            (2) the amount of damages to agricultural producers \n        estimated as likely to result from the embargo; and\n            (3) the source of funds to be used to provide compensation \n        to such producers under subsection (a).\n    (h) Assistance Following Embargo.--During the one-year period \nfollowing the lifting of any trade embargo described in subsection (a) \nwith respect to an agricultural commodity, the Secretary of Agriculture \nshall provide assistance to producers of the agricultural commodity in \norder to assist such producers to regain market share lost as a result \nof the embargo. The Secretary shall provide such assistance in such \nmanner and under such terms as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n    (i) Agricultural Commodity Defined.--For purposes of this section, \nthe term ``agricultural commodity'' means--\n            (1) any agricultural commodity planted and produced in the \n        United States by annual tilling of the soil (including tilling \n        by one-trip planters), such as wheat, corn, grain sorghum, \n        barley, oats, rye, cotton, soybeans, peanuts, tobacco, sugar \n        beets, potatoes, and vegetables;\n            (2) sugar cane and rice planted and produced in the United \n        States;\n            (3) milk, fruits, and honey produced in the United States;\n            (4) beef and other livestock, poultry, and aquacultural \n        species raised in the United States; and\n            (5) timber and fiber crops produced in the United States.\nSuch term also includes any integral input into the production of an \nagricultural commodity, such as seed crops, crop nutrients, or crop \nprotection products."
