PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to reduce and prevent the incidence \nof violence involving children through grant programs that encourage \nprevention, intervention, and the rehabilitation of youth offenders. \nThe accomplishment of this larger purpose will be advanced through the \nfollowing short-term goals:\n            (1) Teach children to resolve conflicts peacefully, teach \n        older youth life skills, enhance self-esteem among all \n        children, and make schools safer places to learn.\n            (2) Work with the families of school children through \n        parenting education.\n            (3) Educate teachers and other education professionals in \n        violence prevention techniques, and train such teachers and \n        professionals to identify and assist high-risk children.\n            (4) Create partnerships between local schools and \n        community-based organizations or agencies to develop supportive \n        programs for youth in order to meet the academic as well as \n        after-school and social needs of youth.\n            (5) Assist and rehabilitate youth offenders by providing \n        funds for community-based programs.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) youth are disproportionately represented among the \n        victims of violence, for example--\n                    (A) United States teenagers are more than twice as \n                likely as adults to be victims of violent crime; and\n                    (B) firearm homicide is the second leading cause of \n                death for all youth, aged 15 to 24;\n            (2) child abuse and neglect are increasing at alarming \n        rates, for example--\n                    (A) child abuse fatalities increased nearly 50 \n                percent between 1986 and 1992;\n                    (B) more than one-half of such fatalities resulted \n                from physical abuse; and\n                    (C) child abuse and neglect reports have increased \n                50 percent since 1985; and\n            (3) violence is cyclical, for example--\n                    (A) being abused or neglected as a child increases \n                the likelihood of arrest for violent crime by 38 \n                percent, of juvenile arrest by 53 percent, and of adult \n                arrest by 38 percent;\n                    (B) two-thirds of men who abuse their wives are \n                from violent childhood homes and about one-half of such \n                men were abused as children; and\n                    (C) eighty-four percent of prison inmates were \n                abused as children.\n\nSEC. 4.
