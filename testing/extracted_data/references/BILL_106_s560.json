FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Across the Nation, local communities are bringing \n        rightful legal claims against the gun industry to seek changes \n        in the manner in which the industry conducts business in the \n        civilian market in those communities.\n            (2) Since firearms are the only widely available consumer \n        product designed to kill, firearm manufactures, distributors, \n        and retailers have a special responsibility to take into \n        account the health and safety of the public in marketing \n        firearms.\n            (3) The gun industry has failed in this responsibility by \n        engaging in practices that have contributed directly to the \n        terrible burden of firearm-related violence on society.\n            (4) The gun industry has generally refused to include \n        numerous safety devices with their products, including devices \n        to prevent the unauthorized use of a firearm, indicators that a \n        firearm is loaded, and child safety locks, and the absence of \n        such safety devices has rendered these products unreasonably \n        dangerous.\n            (5) The gun industry has also engaged in distribution \n        practices in which the industry oversupplies certain legal \n        markets with firearms with the knowledge that the excess \n        firearms will be distributed into nearby illegal markets.\n            (6) According to the National Center for Injury Prevention \n        and Control--\n                    (A) at least 80 percent of the economic costs of \n                treating firearms injuries are paid for by taxpayer \n                dollars; and\n                    (B) in 1990, firearm injuries resulted in costs of \n                more than $24,000,000,000 in hospital and other medical \n                care for long-term disability and premature death.\n\nSEC. 3.
