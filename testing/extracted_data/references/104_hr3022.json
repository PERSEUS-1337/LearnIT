FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) A significant increase in the number of individuals \n        trained in lifesaving first aid would save many lives, \n        particularly an increase in the number of individuals trained \n        in responding to cardiac arrest.\n            (2) Each year approximately 350,000 individuals die from \n        cardiac arrest resulting from cardiovascular diseases.\n            (3) Cardiac arrest can arise in other circumstances, \n        including drownings, cases of drug sensitivity or drug \n        toxicity, and cases of electrical shock.\n            (4) More than 65 percent of deaths from cardiac arrest \n        occur before the victims reach hospitals.\n            (5) Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (commonly known \n        as CPR) is an important technique in responding to cardiac \n        arrest, the technique alone cannot terminate ventricular \n        fibrillation in the heart.\n            (6) Ventricular fibrillation often can be terminated \n        through use of an electrical device known as a defibrillator, \n        and one that is automated and is designed for external \n        application is well-suited to responding to instances of \n        cardiac arrest in circumstances in which the victim is not at a \n        hospital.\n            (7) In the typical nonhospital circumstances, the most \n        effective response to cardiac arrest is to recognize the \n        warning signs for an imminent attack and request emergency \n        medical services through the telephone number 911; to use the \n        technique of cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and to apply an \n        automatic external defibrillator.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM REGARDING TRAINING IN LIFESAVING FIRST \n              AID.\n\n    Title XII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300d et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following part:\n\n                     ``Part G--Lifesaving First Aid\n\n``SEC. 1271.
