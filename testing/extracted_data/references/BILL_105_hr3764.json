FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many nations currently possess weapons of mass \n        destruction and related materials and technologies, and such \n        weapons are increasingly available to a variety of sources \n        through legitimate and illegitimate means.\n            (2) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is \n        growing, and will likely continue despite the best efforts of \n        the international community to limit their flow.\n            (3) The increased availability, relative affordability, and \n        ease of use of weapons of mass destruction may make the use of \n        such weapons an increasingly attractive option to potential \n        adversaries who are not otherwise capable of countering United \n        States military superiority.\n            (4) On November 12, 1997, President Clinton issued an \n        Executive Order stating that ``the proliferation of nuclear, \n        biological, and chemical weapons (``weapons of mass \n        destruction'') and the means of delivering such weapons \n        constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \n        security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States'' \n        and declaring a national emergency to deal with that threat.\n            (5) The Quadrennial Defense Review concluded that the \n        threat or use of weapons of mass destruction is a likely \n        condition of future warfare and poses a potential threat to the \n        United States.\n            (6) The United States lacks adequate preparedness at the \n        Federal, State, and local levels to respond to a potential \n        attack on the United States involving weapons of mass \n        destruction.\n            (7) The United States has initiated an effort to enhance \n        the capability of Federal, State, and local governments as well \n        as local emergency response personnel to prevent and respond to \n        a domestic terrorist incident involving weapons of mass \n        destruction.\n            (8) More than 40 Federal departments, agencies, and bureaus \n        are involved in combating terrorism, and many, including the \n        Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the \n        Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, are \n        executing programs to provide civilian personnel at the \n        Federal, State, and local levels with training and assistance \n        to prevent and respond to incidents involving weapons of mass \n        destruction.\n            (9) The Secretary of Defense has called for the \n        establishment of 10 Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection \n        elements, composed of 22 National Guard personnel, to provide \n        timely regional assistance to local emergency responders during \n        an incident involving chemical or biological weapons of mass \n        destruction.\n            (10) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear \n        Emergency Response Team which is available to respond to \n        incidents involving nuclear or radiological emergencies.\n            (11) The Department of Defense has begun to implement a \n        program to train local emergency responders in major cities \n        throughout the United States to prevent and respond to \n        incidents involving weapons of mass destruction.\n            (12) The Department of Justice has initiated a program to \n        direct and coordinate training and exercises to enhance local \n        emergency response to incidents involving weapons of mass \n        destruction, and may be establishing a National Center for \n        Domestic Preparedness.\n            (13) Federal agency initiatives to enhance domestic \n        preparedness to respond to an incident involving weapons of \n        mass destruction are hampered by incomplete interagency \n        coordination and overlapping jurisdiction of agency missions.\n            (14) The Federal Emergency Management Agency, originally \n        designated to lead the coordinated Federal effort to enhance \n        preparedness to respond to incidents involving weapons of mass \n        destruction, has withdrawn from that role, and a successor lead \n        agency has not yet been determined.\n            (15) In order to ensure effective local response \n        capabilities to incidents involving weapons of mass \n        destruction, the Federal Government, in addition to providing \n        training, must concurrently address the need for--\n                    (A) compatible communications capabilities for all \n                Federal, State, and local emergency responders, which \n                often use different radio systems and operate on \n                different radio frequencies;\n                    (B) adequate equipment necessary for response to an \n                incident involving weapons of mass destruction, and a \n                means to ensure that financially lacking localities \n                have access to such equipment;\n                    (C) local and regional preplanning efforts to \n                ensure the effective execution of emergency response in \n                the event of an incident involving a weapon of mass \n                destruction; and\n                    (D) increased planning and training to prepare for \n                emergency response capabilities in port areas and \n                littoral waters.\n\nSEC. 3.
