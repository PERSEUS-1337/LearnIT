    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares as follows:\n(a) More than $40 million of funding for the training of California\u2019s primary care physicians is expiring in 2016.\n(b) Each year in California, only 368 slots are available to the thousands of medical students seeking to train in family medicine. If the funding is not replaced, 158 of those slots will be lost, creating a terrible deficit of primary care physicians in California\u2019s underserved communities.\n(c) Only 36 percent of California\u2019s active patient care physicians practice primary care. Twenty-three of California\u2019s 58 counties fall below the minimum required primary care physician to population ratio.\n(d) As of 2010, California needed an estimated additional 8,243 primary care physicians by 2030 to prevent projected shortages in the state, which is about 412 new primary care physicians per year.\n(e) More than 32 percent of California\u2019s practicing primary care physicians are 60 years of age or older \u2013 only four other states have a larger percentage of soon-to-retire physicians.\n(f) States with higher ratios of primary care physicians to population have better health outcomes, including decreased mortality from cancer, heart disease, and stroke.\n(g) The Song-Brown program provides an existing state infrastructure to support an increase in the number of primary care providers serving California\u2019s underserved populations. By investing in Song-Brown, California will realize an immediate return on investment as each primary care resident provides an average of 600 additional patient visits per physician per year during training alone.\n(h) California\u2019s long-term workforce will also grow significantly as the vast majority of physicians who train in a region stay there to practice. California leads all fifty states in the percentage of residency program graduates who stay in the state in which they are trained.\nSEC. 2.\nNotwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, there is hereby continuously appropriated from the General Fund the sum of three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) to the Director of Statewide Health Planning and Development, for the purpose of funding new and existing graduate medical education physician residency positions, and supporting training faculty, pursuant to the Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Act (Article 1 (commencing with Section 128200) of Chapter 4 of Part 3 of Division 107 of the Health and Safety Code).

Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nThe need to protect individual privacy of donations made by a donor to fund new medical residency positions in underserved areas of the state outweighs the interest in the public disclosure of that information."
