    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Innovation Competitiveness Act of \n2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) If the United States is to dominate the next critically \n        decisive stage of industrial progress, it must be the first to \n        create the technologies and skilled workforce capable of taking \n        advantage of new high technology opportunities.\n            (2) Research, innovation, and human capital are our \n        principal strengths. By sustaining United States investments in \n        research and finding collaborative arrangements to leverage \n        existing resources and funds in a scarce budget environment, we \n        ensure that America remains at the forefront of scientific and \n        technological capability.\n            (3) The United States has begun to confront a new level of \n        global competition.\n            (4) The United States remains a leading attraction for \n        innovating talent and entrepreneurial activity. The United \n        States's research and development system is the best in the \n        world. It comprises the world's largest market and promotes a \n        vibrant entrepreneurial business climate.\n            (5) For the United States to maintain its high standards of \n        living through continued economic prosperity over the long-\n        term, the basic components of the Nation's innovation \n        ecosystems must remain healthy.\n            (6) Technology transfer of publicly funded research is a \n        critical mechanism for optimizing the return on taxpayer \n        investment, particularly where other benefits are not \n        measurable at all or are very long-term.\n            (7) Active marketing and educational campaigns tailored by \n        individual Federal agencies on their respective research and \n        development activities are important where--\n                    (A) inventions have multiple applications and may \n                need to be matched-up with commercial enterprises \n                representing several industries; and\n                    (B) new invention applications may require rapid \n                development and dissemination by companies not \n                otherwise known by the agency.\n            (8) Technology transfer has become a very broad activity, \n        with many stakeholders and users. Aggregating available \n        technology transfer resources into a single location, available \n        in an electronic format, would help--\n                    (A) facilitate the access, administration, \n                education, monitoring, and efficiency of technology \n                transfer activities with the government;\n                    (B) stimulate further interaction and \n                responsiveness from the private sector; and\n                    (C) facilitate the formation of much needed \n                technology transfer databases and provide opportunities \n                to examine and track more refined measurements of \n                technology flows.\n            (9) A 2003 Department of Commerce survey reported that only \n        34 percent of the Federal laboratories surveyed formed \n        laboratory industrial advisory committees. These committees can \n        advocate and promote effective communication between Federal \n        laboratories and the user communities to help facilitate mutual \n        understanding and leverage maximum impact of the research \n        conducted.\n            (10) Because the entire innovation process is continuing to \n        evolve in an arena of increasing global competition, \n        identifying metrics to quantify program effectiveness is of \n        increasing importance. Metrics need to take into account a wide \n        range of steps in a highly complex process, as well as the \n        ultimate product or service, but should not constrain the \n        continued evolution or development of new technology transfer \napproaches. In addition, these metrics need to accommodate.\n                    (A) characteristics unique to varying industries; \n                and\n                    (B) mission differences between the licensing \n                institutions.\n            (11) Local and regional impacts from Federal research and \n        development activities have a direct impact on communities in \n        which they are conducted. Such activities attract new \n        businesses to these areas, thereby stimulating local economies \n        and improving local education.\n            (12) State governments are already active in providing a \n        friendly and complementary research and development \n        environment.\n            (13) Half of all States each receive half a billion or more \n        Federal research and development dollars yearly.\n            (14) Given the importance of Federal research and \n        development investments to the Nation, States, and localities, \n        little information is widely available. There is a need for a \n        data system that can provide detailed information on all of the \n        activities and scope of the Federal research and development \n        enterprise so that State and local officials can use the \n        information to identify new opportunities for State-Federal \n        research collaboration.\n\nSEC. 3.
