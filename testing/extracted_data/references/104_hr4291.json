PRINCIPAL NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    The purposes, policies, and objectives that are applicable with \nrespect to any free-trade area trade agreement negotiated under the \nauthority of such title I in furtherance of the Free Trade Agreement \nfor the Americas, as proposed at the Summit of the Americas that was \nheld in December, 1994, in Miami, Florida with any country in the \nWestern Hemisphere outside North America (hereafter in this Act \nreferred to as the ``FTAA'') include the achievement of the overall and \nprincipal trade negotiating objectives of the United States set forth \nin section 1101 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, \nand the following principal negotiating objectives:\n            (1) Worker rights and standards and protection.--With a \n        view to establishing open, expanding, mutually beneficial trade \n        among the countries of the Western Hemisphere, to spreading the \n        benefits of such trade as widely as possible, to protecting \n        citizens interests, and to enhancing respect for human rights \n        throughout the Western Hemisphere, the principal negotiating \n        objectives of the United States with respect to worker rights \n        and standards, and the protection thereof, in the conduct of \n        international trade, commerce, and finance are--\n                    (A) to ensure freedom of association and to affirm \n                the vital role that free and independent unions play in \n                democratic governance;\n                    (B) to ensure the rights of working people to \n                organize, to bargain collectively, and to strike, and \n                to ensure the right of workers' representatives to \n                legal protection in the free exercise of their duties \n                and fundamental human rights;\n                    (C) to establish a minimum age for the employment \n                of children at 14 years if the employment will not \n                result in the neglect of their education and will not \n                harm their health and well-being;\n                    (D) to ensure the right to health at the workplace \n                and to a healthy working environment, including freedom \n                from exposure to toxic substances;\n                    (E) to guarantee the right of all workers to equal \n                protection, including freedom from discrimination in \n                wages or working conditions, regardless of their \n                nationality, race, religion, age, or sex; and\n                    (F) to guarantee humane standards of wages and \n                hours of work that take into account different levels \n                of national economic development, but provide for \n                improvement concurrently with gains in productivity.\n            (2) Environmental quality and protection.--In recognition \n        of the shared responsibility of the countries of the Western \n        Hemisphere as stewards responsible for, and their common \n        interest in, preserving and sustaining the Western Hemisphere's \n        natural habitat and resources over time, the principal \n        negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to \n        environmental quality and protection are--\n                    (A) the protection of environmental quality and of \n                the integrity of ecosystems, as well as the maintenance \n                of scarce biological and physical resources, in the \n                conduct of international trade, commerce, and finance;\n                    (B) the establishment of a process for the full and \n                public disclosure of the kinds, quantities, and risks \n                associated with toxic chemical and hazardous substance \n                discharges into the air, water, and land;\n                    (C) the prevention of the export of toxic and \n                hazardous substances and products, such as carcinogens \n                and unsafe drugs, that are banned in the country of \n                origin;\n                    (D) the prevention of the export of products \n                (except to the extent of remediation or repatriation \n                contracts that already exist) manufactured, extracted, \n                harvested, or grown under environmental conditions or \n                workplace safety and health conditions that undermine \n                counterpart standards, particularly those applicable to \n                the counterpart industry in the importing country or \n                the counterpart standards, in general, in the importing \n                country; and\n                    (E) to require that industries within their \n                national borders reduce the amount and toxicity of \n                hazardous substances that they use, minimize the amount \n                and toxicity of wastes they generate, and demonstrate \n                publicly their use of best available technology for \n                pollution abatement in their production processes.\n            (3) Unfair trade practices.--In acknowledging different, \n        evolving comparative advantages among trading nations, but with \na view to distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable means of \ncompetition among trading nations, the principal negotiating objectives \nof the United States with respect to unfair trade practices shall \ninclude the adoption, as a principle, and in enforcement action that \nthe systematic denial or practical nullification of the protections \naccorded worker rights and standards and environmental quality (within \nthe context of paragraphs (1) and (2)) as a means for any country or \nits industries to gain competitive advantage in international trade, \ncommerce, and finance is an actionable unfair trade practice.\n            (4) Comprehensive dispute resolution.--The principal \n        negotiating objectives of the United States are to achieve a \n        process for the settlement of disputes that arise between or \n        among the signatories with respect to unfair trade practices, \n        including not only those involving commonly identified unfair \n        trade barriers, but unfair practices, within the context of the \n        negotiating objectives listed in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) \n        involving the systematic denial or practical nullification of \n        worker rights and standards and failure to apply or enforce \n        standards relating to environmental quality or protection, \n        resulting in distortions to international trade, commerce, and \n        finance. Such a process shall include--\n                    (A) notification by each signatory nation to the \n                other signatories regarding changes in law or practice \n                that
