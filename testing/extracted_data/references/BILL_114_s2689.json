SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Reliable and Effective Growth for \nRegenerative Health Options that Improve Wellness'' or the ``REGROW \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. CELLULAR THERAPEUTICS.\n\n    (a) Current Pathways.--Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made \nby this Act, shall be applied or interpreted as restricting or \notherwise modifying any pathway to market which is (as of the day \nimmediately before the date of enactment of this Act) provided under \nregulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration, including \npathways under sections 351 and 361 of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 262 and 264).\n    (b) Approval for Therapies.--Subpart 1 of part F of title III of \nthe Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262 et seq.) is amended by \nadding after section 351A the following:\n\n``SEC. 351B. APPROVAL FOR CELLULAR THERAPIES.\n\n    ``(a) Conditional Approval of Cellular or Tissue Therapeutic.--Not \nlater than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the \nSecretary shall establish a program to conditionally approve a cellular \ntherapeutic product if the sponsor of such product demonstrates \npreliminary clinical evidence of safety, and a reasonable expectation \nof effectiveness, without initiation of phase III investigations.\n    ``(b) Additional Requirements for Conditional Approval.--A \nconditionally approved product under subsection (a) shall, for a 5-year \nconditional use period, be manufactured, introduced into interstate \ncommerce, and used consistent with the regulations in effect at the \ntime of such use, including good manufacturing practices, without the \napproval of an application under section 351(a), if all of the \nfollowing apply:\n            ``(1) Such cells or tissues are adult human cells or \n        tissues.\n            ``(2) Such cells or tissues have been evaluated to examine \n        immunogenicity and do not provoke a significant unintended \n        immune response in the recipient.\n            ``(3) Such cells or tissues are--\n                    ``(A) minimally manipulated for a nonhomologous \n                use; or\n                    ``(B) more-than-minimally manipulated for a \n                homologous or nonhomologous use, but are not \n                genetically modified.\n            ``(4) Such cells or tissues are produced for a specific \n        indication.\n            ``(5) Such cells or tissues are produced exclusively for a \n        use that performs, or helps achieve or restore, the same, or \n        similar, function in the recipient as in the donor.\n            ``(6) Within 5 years of the safety and effectiveness \n        determination described in this section, the sponsor of the \n        conditionally approved new product prepares and submits an \n        application for approval of a biological product under section \n        351(a), demonstrating potency, purity, safety, and efficacy of \n        the use. The Secretary may permit continued use of such product \n        until the Secretary completes the review of the application and \n        makes a determination. Upon a determination by the Secretary \n        not to approve the application, use of the cellular therapeutic \n        shall not be permitted.\n            ``(7) During the conditional approval period, and before \n        approval of an application under section 351(a), the sponsor \n        shall prepare and submit annual reports and adverse event \n        reports to the Secretary containing all the information \n        required for approved biological products.\n            ``(8) The sponsor has submitted an application under \n        section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for \n        the treatment of the patients during the 5-year conditional use \n        period.\n            ``(9) The sponsor has not previously received conditional \n        approval for such product for the same indication.\n    ``(c) Informed Use.--The individual administering a product \napproved under subsection (b) shall inform each individual who uses \nsuch product that the product has been conditionally approved based on \nstudies in a limited population, without proof of efficacy, and that \nthe Secretary is requiring additional studies of the product.\n    ``(d) Stem Cell Banking.--To be eligible to provide cells for the \nuses described under subsection (b), public and private cord blood \nbanks, tissue banks, and bone marrow repositories shall be in full \ncompliance with good tissue practice requirements under part 1271 of \ntitle 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), as \napplicable.''.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVICES USED IN RECOVERY, PROCESSING, AND DELIVERY OF CELLULAR \n              THERAPEUTICS.\n\n    (a) Clearance.--Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``, and'' and inserting \n        ``;'';\n            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and inserting \n        ``; and''; and\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n            ``(3) in the case of a cellular therapeutic described in \n        section 351B(a) of the Public Health Service Act, the general \n        function of the device used for the recovery, isolation, \n        processing, or delivery of such cellular therapeutic.''.\n    (b) Clearance or Approval of Cellular Therapeutics.--Chapter V of \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) is \namended by inserting after section 515A the following:\n\n``SEC. 515B. CLASSIFICATION OF CELLULAR THERAPEUTICS.\n\n    ``Clearance or approval of a device that is a cellular therapeutic \ndescribed in section 351B(a) of the Public Health Service Act shall be \nbased on in vitro performance testing and not in vivo human clinical \ntrials, as appropriate. The Secretary shall classify devices in \naccordance with section 513 used for cell therapy (as described in \nsection 351B(a) of the Public Health Service Act), focusing on the \ngeneral use of such devices for harvesting, delivery, or processing \ncells and sustaining the viability and functions of the cells in vivo. \nThe classification regulation shall not require that such devices be \ncleared under section 510(k) or approved under section 515 for use with \nonly specific types of cells or for specific uses unless unique to the \nintended use of the device. If the Secretary determines that no \npredicate exists, or that a device classified as class III is \nsufficiently low risk to justify a lower classification, the Secretary \nshall apply the procedure outlined in section 513(f)(2) to permit the \nreview and marketing of the device.''.\n    (c) Combination Products.--Section 503(g)(1) of the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 353(g)(1)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``or'';\n            (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period and \n        inserting ``, or''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(D) cellular components, the agency center charged with \n        premarket review of biological products shall have primary \n        jurisdiction.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
