FINDINGS.\n\n    The congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 1st Infantry Division was constituted on May 24, \n        1917, and is the first and oldest permanently established \n        combat division of the United States Army. 2017 is the \n        centennial of the Division.\n            (2) The 1st Infantry Division has been in continuous \n        service since its organization.\n            (3) The 1st Infantry Division has fought with distinction \n        in every major conflict since 1917 except the Korean War, when \n        it was on occupation duty in Germany.\n            (4) In World War I, the then-First Division was the first \n        United States division to arrive in France. It fired the first \n        American shots of the war, suffered the first casualties and \n        secured the first American victory at the Battle of Cantigny in \n        May, 1918. This was also the first modern, combined arms battle \n        in American history. It fought with distinction in all \n        subsequent campaigns and, after occupation duty in Germany, was \n        the last combat division to return home in 1919.\n            (5) Five division soldiers received the Medal of Honor in \n        World War I.\n            (6) In World War II, the 1 ID was the first to deploy to \n        Europe. It fought in North Africa and Sicily in 1942 and 1943. \n        General George S. Patton, Jr., commander of the United States \n        7th Army in the Mediterranean, stated that he would not invade \n        Sicily without the 1 ID as the assault division.\n            (7) The 1 ID was the lead assault division on Omaha beach \n        in Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944. Against frightful odds and \n        despite multiple challenges, it secured a beach head on a day \n        when failure could have altered the outcome of the war.\n            (8) The 1 ID played pivotal roles in the liberation of \n        France and Belgium; the Battle of the Bulge; the crossing of \n        the Rhine River; and the invasion and defeat of Nazi Germany. \n        After the war, the Division supported and secured the \n        International War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremburg, Germany, \n        guarding infamous Nazi officials during the courtroom \n        proceedings.\n            (9) Seventeen division soldiers received the Medal of Honor \n        in World War II.\n            (10) The 1 ID was the only United States combat division in \n        Europe from 1946 to 1951. It returned to the United States and \n        Fort Riley, KS, in 1955.\n            (11) The 1 ID was one of the first 2 combat divisions \n        deployed to Vietnam in 1965. There it defended the vital \n        Highway 13 corridor against enemy infiltration from Cambodia to \n        the capital at Saigon. It fought gallantly in Operation \n        Junction City, the largest operation of the war, in 1967; and \n        in all 3 waves of the Tet Offensive in 1968.\n            (12) Twelve division soldiers received the Medal of Honor \n        in Vietnam.\n            (13) The 1 ID deterred Soviet aggression against NATO \n        Europe from 1970 to 1990 with a brigade in Germany and the rest \n        of the division deploying there annually from Fort Riley in \n        REFORGER exercises that demonstrated United States capability \n        and resolve until the Cold War ended.\n            (14) The 1 ID deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1991 in \n        Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. It attacked to \n        breach the Iraqi defenses, raced across the desert with the \n        United States VIIth Corps, destroying the Iraqi Republican \n        Guard Tawakalna Division.\n            (15) The 1 ID enforced international peace agreements in \n        Bosnia for 31 months between 1996 and 2000; for 4 months in \n        Macedonia (FYROM) in 1999; and for 22 months in Kosovo between \n        1999 and 2003.\n            (16) The 1 ID deployed to Iraq in 2004 to 2005 in OIF II, \n        the initial occupation of Iraq, and helped achieve the first \n        free and fair elections in the history of Iraq. Its brigade \n        combat teams and other elements deployed multiple times to Iraq \n        and Afghanistan between 2003 and 2014.\n            (17) The 1 ID provided the first ``regionally aligned \n        force'' (RAF) to the United States Africa Command and provided \n        military assistance to friendly governments across the \n        continent of Africa.\n            (18) To combat the growing ISIS threat, 1 ID soldiers have \n        deployed to Iraq and Kuwait to assist the Iraqi Security Forces \n        and other friendly countries in that vital and unstable region.\n            (19) The 1 ID will be deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n        Korea in 2016 and 2017, its centennial year.\n            (20) Thirty-six soldiers have been decorated with the Medal \n        of Honor, and countless others have distinguished themselves in \n        combat.\n            (21) The 1st Infantry Division has earned several unit \n        decorations, including 2 Meritorious Unit Commendations, 3 \n        French Croix de Guerre, 1 Belgian Fourragere, Republic of \n        Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm, 1 Republic of Vietnam \n        Civil Action Honor Medal, and was cited twice in the Order of \n        the Day of the Belgian Army.\n            (22) The 1st Infantry Division has served the United States \n        with great valor and distinction since its organization, living \n        up to its motto, ``No mission too difficult, no sacrifice too \n        great--Duty First''.\n\nSEC. 3.
