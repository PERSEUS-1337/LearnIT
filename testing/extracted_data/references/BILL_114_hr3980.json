FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) All veterans who have signed up to put their life on \n        the line for the lives and liberty of the people of the United \n        States deserve the opportunity to seek health care at a \n        facility of their choice, regardless of arbitrary distance and \n        wait-time thresholds.\n            (2) Logistical impediments to veterans receiving health \n        care at medical facilities of the Veterans Health \n        Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including \n        with respect to travel, wait times, and enrollment difficulty, \n        have been found to exist across all demographics of veterans \n        and are widely cited among the most common barriers to \n        receiving the health care the veterans earned.\n            (3) As a result of widespread reporting on such \n        impediments, including regarding the death of 40 veterans who \n        died while waiting for health care at the Phoenix Veterans' \n        Hospital, in 2014 Congress investigated the matter and \n        confirmed that such impediments were pervasive and systemic.\n            (4) As of September 30, 2014, there were approximately \n        867,000 applications by veterans to enroll in the health care \n        system of the Department, and the Inspector General of the \n        Department could not determine how long more than half of the \n        applications had been pending.\n            (5) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has been unable to \n        meet the modest goal of employing one psychiatrist per 1,000 \n        individual mental health patients of the Department.\n            (6) The Inspector General found that approximately 70 \n        percent of the hospitals of the Department in 2014 did not have \n        enough psychiatrists to meet demand.\n            (7) The Inspector General found that a significant \n        proportion of the psychiatrists of the Department saw in excess \n        of 800 to 900 veterans per year and some veterans were only \n        seen once per year because of the demand.\n            (8) A study by the National Institutes of Health identified \n        the lack of available female-specific medical services and wait \n        times as key barriers to female veterans seeking health care at \n        medical facilities of the Department.\n            (9) The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of \n        2014 (Public Law 113-146) made great strides toward providing \n        veterans with more flexibility to seek health care in the \n        setting of choice by the veteran, however, the metrics \n        established by the Act to determine which veterans were \n        eligible for such flexibility are insufficient.\n            (10) Other impediments to veterans receiving health care at \n        medical facilities of the Department can include long commutes \n        on group transport, or having to cross bridges or State lines \n        to receive care.\n            (11) Many veterans like the health care provided by the \n        Department and the hospitals of the Department hold particular \n        expertise in treating ailments of veterans.\n            (12) Veterans should have the option to stay with the \n        Department if the veteran likes the health care system of the \n        Department.\n\nSEC. 3.
