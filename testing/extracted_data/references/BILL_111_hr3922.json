FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Islamic Republic of Iran is a party to the Treaty \n        on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and a member \n        of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n            (2) Since 1987, successive United States administrations \n        have issued executive orders to ban imports of Iranian-origin \n        goods and services, participation of United States persons or \n        entities in the development of Iran's energy sector and \n        investment by and in Iranian banks in order to address the \n        unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, \n        foreign policy and economy of the United States posed by an \n        Iranian nuclear weapons program.\n            (3) On August 5, 1996, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act was \n        signed into law. In 2006, the title of this law was changed to \n        the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA). The ISA notes that ``the efforts \n        of the Government of Iran to acquire weapons of mass \n        destruction and the means to deliver them and its support of \n        acts of international terrorism endanger the national security \n        and foreign policy interests of the United States and those \n        countries with which the United States shares common strategic \n        and foreign policy objectives,'' and therefore requires the \n        President to sanction United States and foreign companies if \n        the President determines that such companies have invested in \n        Iran's petroleum or natural gas sectors.\n            (4) On March 14, 2000, the Iran Nonproliferation Act was \n        signed into law, ``to provide for the application of measures \n        to foreign persons who transfer to Iran certain goods, \n        services, or technology, and for other purposes.''.\n            (5) On September 30, 2006, the Iran Freedom Support Act \n        (IFSA) was signed into law ``to hold the current regime in Iran \n        accountable for its threatening behavior'' and recommended that \n        the President initiate investigations upon the receipt of \n        credible information that a United States or foreign person is \n        investing in Iran's petroleum or natural gas sector in \n        violation of the ISA. The IFSA extended the ISA until December \n        31, 2011.\n            (6) In response to its ``serious concern'' over Iran's \n        nuclear program, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has \n        passed several resolutions calling on Iran to halt its uranium \n        enrichment and reprocessing activities and instituting rounds \n        of sanctions on Iran, taking all necessary measures to prevent \n        the supply of certain goods or technologies that could \n        contribute to Iran's uranium enrichment, reprocessing, or heavy \n        water-related activities, or to the development of a nuclear \n        weapon.\n            (7) Iran is in violation of these UNSC resolutions.\n            (8) Effective November 10, 2008, the Department of the \n        Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) revoked \n        authorization for ``U-turn'' transfers involving Iran. As of \n        that date, United States depository institutions are no longer \n        authorized to process transfers involving Iran that originate \n        and end with non-Iranian foreign banks.\n            (9) According to a June 5, 2009, IAEA report, Iran ``has \n        not suspended its enrichment related activities or its work on \n        heavy water related projects as required by the Security \n        Council,'' nor has Iran ``cooperated with the [IAEA] in \n        connection with the remaining issues which give rise to \n        concerns and which need to be clarified to exclude the \n        possibility of military dimensions to Iran's nuclear \n        programme.''.\n            (10) On September 25, 2009, President Obama, British Prime \n        Minister Brown, and French President Sarkozy revealed that Iran \n        has been covertly enriching uranium in Qom, Iran.\n            (11) Iran had concealed the existence and purpose of the \n        Qom facility, and had not disclosed the Qom enrichment facility \n        to the IAEA until September 21, 2009.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the illicit nuclear activities of the Government of \n        Iran--combined with its development of unconventional weapons \n        and ballistic missiles, and support for international \n        terrorism--represent a serious threat to the security of the \n        United States and United States allies in Europe, the Middle \n        East, and around the world;\n            (2) the United States should continue to support diplomatic \n        efforts in the International Atomic Energy Agency and the \n        United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to end Iran's illicit \n        nuclear activities;\n            (3) the United Nations Security Council should take further \n        measures beyond UNSC Resolutions 1737, 1747, 1803, and 1835 to \n        tighten sanctions on Iran, including preventing new investment \n        in Iran's energy sector, as long as Iran fails to comply with \n        the international community's demand to halt its nuclear \n        enrichment campaign;\n            (4) the United States should take all possible measures to \n        discourage and, if possible, prevent foreign banks from \n        providing export credits to foreign entities seeking to invest \n        in the Iranian energy sector;\n            (5) the United States should encourage foreign governments \n        to direct state-owned entities to cease all investment in \n        Iran's energy sector and all exports of refined petroleum \n        products to Iran and to persuade, and, where possible, require \n        private entities based in their territories to cease all \n        investment in Iran's energy sector and all exports of refined \n        petroleum products to Iran;\n            (6) moderate Arab countries have a vital and perhaps \n        existential interest in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear \n        arms, and therefore such countries, particularly countries with \n        large oil deposits, should use their economic leverage to \n        dissuade other countries, including the Russian Federation and \n        the People's Republic of China, from assisting Iran's nuclear \n        program directly or indirectly and to persuade other countries, \n        including Russia and China, to be more forthcoming in \n        supporting UNSC efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program;\n            (7) with Iran's economy weakened, effective economic \n        measures to isolate the regime may make the difference between \n        a diplomatic resolution and a nuclear standoff;\n            (8) to make a diplomatic solution possible, international \n        firms doing business in Iran should not continue to provide the \n        last crutch of support to the Iranian economy; and\n            (9) this Act seeks to prohibit those entities that do \n        business with the United States from doing business with Iran.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.\n\n    (a) Certification Requirement.--The head of each executive agency \nshall ensure that each contract with a company entered into by such \nexecutive agency for the procurement of goods or services or agreement \nfor the use of Federal funds as part of a grant, loan, or loan \nguarantee to a company, includes a clause that requires the company to \ncertify to the contracting officer that the company does not conduct \nbusiness operations in Iran described in section 7.\n    (b) Remedies.--\n            (1) In general.--The head of an executive agency may impose \n        remedies as provided in this subsection if the head of the \n        executive agency determines that the contractor has submitted a \n        false certification under subsection (a) after the date the \n        Federal Acquisition Regulation is revised pursuant to \n        subsection (e) to implement the requirements of this section.\n            (2) Termination.--The head of an executive agency may \n        terminate a covered contract with a company upon the \n        determination of a false certification under paragraph (1).\n            (3) Suspension and debarment.--The head of an executive \n        agency may debar or suspend a contractor from eligibility for \n        Federal contracts upon the determination of a false \n        certification under paragraph (1).
