FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In order to preserve and defend freedom and \n        civilization, especially in these challenging times, future \n        generations of Americans must be taught to understand their \n        full significance and value, and the threats with which they \n        are faced.\n            (2) Basic knowledge of United States and Western history is \n        essential to full and informed participation in civic life and \n        to the larger vibrancy of the American experiment in self-\n        government, binding together a diverse people into a single \n        Nation with a common purpose.\n            (3) American citizens who lack knowledge of the organizing \n        principles of Western civilization will also lack a true \n        understanding and appreciation of the democratic principles \n        that define and sustain America as a free people, such as \n        liberty, justice, tolerance, government by the consent of the \n        governed, and equality under the law.\n            (4) America's colleges and universities are bellwethers of \n        national priorities and values, setting standards for the whole \n        of the United States education system and sending signals to \n        students, teachers, parents, and public schools about what \n        every educated citizen in a democracy must know.\n            (5) Most of the Nation's colleges and universities no \n        longer require United States history or systematic study of \n        Western civilization as a prerequisite to graduation.\n            (6) Distinguished historians and intellectuals fear that \n        without a common civic memory and a common understanding of the \n        remarkable individuals, events, and ideals that have shaped the \n        Nation, the people in the United States risk losing much of \n        what it means to be an American, as well as the ability to \n        fulfill the fundamental responsibilities of citizens in a \n        democracy.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To establish and strengthen post-secondary education \n        programs emphasizing the nature, history and philosophy of free \n        institutions, the nature of Western civilization, and the \n        nature of the threats to freedom from totalitarianism in all \n        its forms.\n            (2) To develop innovative teacher education programs \n        designed to equip teachers to more effectively impart a \n        knowledge of the nature of free institutions, the threats to \n        free institutions, and the content of Western civilization to \n        elementary, middle and high school teachers.\n\nSEC. 3.
