FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Medications are important to the management of chronic \n        diseases that require long-term or lifelong therapy. \n        Pharmacists are uniquely qualified as medication experts to \n        work with patients to manage their medications and chronic \n        conditions and play a key role in helping patients take their \n        medications as prescribed.\n            (2) Nonadherence with medications is a significant problem. \n        According to a report by the World Health Organization, in \n        developed countries, only 50 percent of patients with chronic \n        diseases adhere to medication therapies. For example, in the \n        United States only 51 percent of patients taking blood pressure \n        medications are adherent; similarly, only 40 to 70 percent of \n        patients taking antidepressant medications adhere to prescribed \n        therapies.\n            (3) Failure to take medications as prescribed costs over \n        $177 billion dollars annually. The problem of nonadherence is \n        particularly important for patients with chronic diseases that \n        require use of medications; poor adherence leads to unnecessary \n        disease progression, reduced functional status, lower quality \n        of life, and premature death.\n            (4) When patients adhere to, or comply with, their \n        medication therapy, it is possible to reduce higher-cost \n        medical attention, such as emergency department visits and \n        catastrophic care, and avoid the preventable human costs that \n        impact patients and those who care for them.\n            (5) Studies have clearly demonstrated that community-based \n        medication therapy management (MTM) services provided by \n        pharmacists improve health care outcomes and reduce spending. \n        For example, the Asheville Project--a diabetes program designed \n        for city employees in Asheville, North Carolina, and delivered \n        by community pharmacists--resulted over a 5-year period in a \n        decrease in total direct medical costs ranging from $1,622 to \n        $3,356 per patient per year, a 50 percent decrease in the use \n        of sick days, and an increase in productivity accounting for an \n        estimated savings of $18,000 annually. Another project \n        involving pharmacist-provided care to patients with high \n        cholesterol increased compliance with medication to 90 percent \n        from a national average of 40 percent. In North Carolina, the \n        ChecKmeds NC program, which offers eligible seniors one-on-one \n        MTM consultations with pharmacists, saved an estimated \n        $10,000,000 in healthcare costs and avoided numerous health \n        problems in the first year of the program for the more than \n        15,000 seniors receiving MTM. Similar results have been \n        achieved in several other demonstrations using community \n        pharmacists.\n            (6) Therefore, enhancement of the MTM benefit under part D \n        of the Medicare program should be a key component of the \n        national health care reform agenda.\n\nSEC. 3.
