SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness in \nTobacco and Nicotine Regulation Act of 1993''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act (other than sections 5(b)(1) \nand 5(b)(2)) an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \namendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference \nshall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use account for \n        approximately 450,000 deaths each year in the United States.\n            (2) Cigarette smoking accounts for approximately $65 \n        billion in lost productivity and health care costs.\n            (3) Environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in \n        nonsmokers.\n            (4) In spite of well established dangers of cigarette \n        smoking and tobacco use, no Federal regulatory agency has the \n        authority to regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution, \n        labeling, and advertising of such products.\n            (5) Tobacco is as addictive as cocaine and heroin.\n            (6) The tobacco industry spends approximately $4 billion \n        each year to promote its products.\n            (7) The tobacco industry's voluntary advertising code which \n        was enacted to prohibit the use of images of sexual attraction, \n        sophistication, and athletic abilities and the making of \n        implied health claims has for the last 30 years not been \n        followed or enforced.\n            (8) Each day 3,000 children try cigarettes for the first \n        time and many become life-long addicted smokers.\n            (9) There is no Federal minimum age of sale of cigarettes \n        and tobacco products.\n            (10) The labeling of tobacco products is inadequate as to \n        provide smokers and nonsmokers alike with full and complete \n        information about tobacco products.\n            (11) The tobacco industry adds chemical additives to their \n        products that are neither disclosed to the public or tested for \n        health and safety in a comparable manner to food.\n            (12) There is no listing of chemical constituents found in \n        mainstream and sidestream smoke (including benzene, arsenic, \n        cyanide, etc.).\n            (13) The Food and Drug Administration is the most qualified \n        Federal agency to comprehensively regulate tobacco products.\n            (14) It is inconsistent for the Food and Drug \n        Administration to regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution, \n        labeling, advertising, and promotion of other nicotine \n        containing products used as substitutes for cigarette smoking \n        and tobacco use and not be able to regulate tobacco products in \n        a comparable manner.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 201 (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end thereof \nthe following new paragraphs:\n    ``(gg) The term `tobacco product' means cigarettes, cigars, little \ncigars, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, and chewing tobacco.\n    ``(hh) The term `tobacco additive' means any substance the intended \nuse of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly \nor indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the \ncharacteristics of any tobacco product.\n    ``(ii) The term `constituent' means any element of cigarette \nmainstream or sidestream smoke which is present in quantities which \nrepresent a potential health hazard or where the health effect is \nunknown.\n    ``(jj) The term `tar' means mainstream total articulate matter \nminus nicotine and water.\n\nSEC. 4.
