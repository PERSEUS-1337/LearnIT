FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the national interest to make greater use of \n        ethanol in transportation fuels;\n            (2) ethanol is a clean, renewable fuel that provides public \n        health benefits in the form of reduced emissions, including \n        reduced greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change;\n            (3) ethanol use provides economic gains to agricultural \n        producers, biofuels producers, and rural areas;\n            (4) ethanol use benefits the national security of the \n        United States by displacing the use of petroleum, much of which \n        is imported from foreign countries that are hostile to the \n        United States;\n            (5) ethanol can reduce prices at the pump for motoring \n        consumers by extending fuel supplies due to the competitive \n        cost of ethanol relative to conventional gasoline;\n            (6) ethanol faces shipping challenges in pipelines that \n        transport other liquid transportation fuels;\n            (7) additional research and development can provide \n        solutions to overcome the barriers of shipping ethanol in \n        pipelines that transport other liquid transportation fuels;\n            (8) currently ethanol is shipped by rail tanker cars, \n        barges, and trucks, all of which could, as ethanol production \n        expands, encounter capacity limits due to competing use demands \n        for the rail tanker cars, barges, and trucks;\n            (9) as the United States ethanol market expands in the \n        coming years there is a need to evaluate the feasibility and \n        value for new construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines to \n        transport ethanol from the Midwest, where ethanol generally is \n        produced, to the Eastern and Western United States;\n            (10) as of the date of enactment of this Act, dedicated \n        ethanol pipelines do not exist in the United States and will be \n        challenging to construct, at least initially;\n            (11) ascertaining solutions to the technical barriers of \n        transporting ethanol in the existing pipeline system is \n        important because of the safety, reliability, and cost savings \n        pipeline transportation provides to the public; and\n            (12) having an ethanol pipeline study completed in the very \n        near term is important because the construction of 1 or more \n        dedicated ethanol pipelines would take at least several years \n        to complete.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SECRETARY.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Energy.\n\nSEC. 4.
