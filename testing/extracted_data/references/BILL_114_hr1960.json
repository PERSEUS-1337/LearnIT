FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Because the United States has the largest Exclusive \n        Economic Zone of all nations, it has a disproportionate \n        economic interest in a healthy ocean.\n            (2) The United States has a strategic interest in healthy \n        fisheries, marine ecosystems, and a strong ocean economy.\n            (3) Solid waste is littering the Nation's waterways, \n        including streams, rivers, and lakes, most notably the Great \n        Lakes, and much of this marine debris is collecting in the \n        oceans.\n            (4) An estimated 80 percent of litter that ends up in the \n        oceans comes from land-based sources, and litter in the \n        Nation's waterways has numerous detrimental effects.\n            (5) Marine debris injures wildlife, sometimes resulting in \n        death, degrades ecosystems, interferes with navigation, \n        threatens public health and safety, and creates additional \n        expenditures for shipping, fishing, tourism, and coastal \n        communities.\n            (6) Only about 46 percent of the Nation's waste is recycled \n        or composted, including through waste-to-energy.\n            (7) Successful solid waste management requires creative use \n        of the entire hierarchy of solid waste management, waste \n        reduction, recycling, waste-to-energy operations, and \n        landfilling.\n            (8) Recycling can play a significant role in reducing \n        municipal waste and marine debris.\n            (9) The failure to recycle and reuse materials is a \n        significant and unnecessary waste of important national energy \n        and material resources.\n            (10) Comprehensive, multi-material recycling programs \n        represent the most cost-effective and efficient method of \n        meeting recycling goals and reducing marine debris.\n            (11) The responsibility to recycle should be shared by all \n        consumers of recyclable goods including individual households, \n        municipalities, and commercial and institutional \n        establishments.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL GOALS FOR WASTE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING.\n\n    (a) Source Reduction.--Congress declares it to be the national goal \nof the United States that there shall be no increase in the generation \nof solid waste sent to landfills above the level of solid waste \ngenerated and sent to landfills in the year of the enactment of this \nAct (as determined by the Administrator).\n    (b) Waste Recycling.--Congress declares it to be the national goal \nof the United States that at least 50 percent of the municipal solid \nwaste stream shall be recycled by the end of 2020, and 65 percent of \nsuch waste stream shall be recycled by the end of 2030 (as determined \nby the Administrator).\n    (c) Marine Debris Reduction.--Congress declares it to be the \nnational goal of the United States that there shall be no increase in \nthe flow of marine debris into the ocean above the level of such flow \nin the year of the enactment of this Act (as determined by the \nAdministrator).\n\nSEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--The Administrator shall report to Congress each \nyear the following:\n            (1) The amount and composition of municipal solid waste \n        generated in the United States.\n            (2) The amount and composition of municipal solid waste \n        generated in the United States that enters the ocean.\n            (3) The methods used to manage such waste.\n            (4) The progress made in achieving the source reduction, \n        recycling, and marine debris reduction goals of this Act, the \n        impediments to the attainment of such goals, and \n        recommendations on the regulatory or legislative initiatives \n        necessary to attain such goals.\n    (b) First Report.--The first report under this section shall be \nsubmitted not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT ON PRIMARY LEAKAGE PATHS OF MARINE DEBRIS INTO THE \n              OCEAN.\n\n    Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Administrator shall provide to Congress a report that includes the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Identification of the pathways through which marine \n        debris reaches the ocean, such as consumer discards, flawed \n        waste management designs, and infrastructural leaks, as \n        determined in consultation with experts, including waste \n        management, consumer goods, and infrastructure experts.\n            (2) Best practices that may be used at the Federal, State, \n        and local level to reduce or eliminate such pathways, including \n        methods to address infrastructural leaks, regulation, or \n        economic incentives.\n\nSEC. 6. PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) List and Recycling Determinations.--\n            (1) Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment \n        of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation with the \n        Secretary of Commerce, shall develop a list of categories of \n        commonly used products and packaging which are discarded into \n        the municipal solid waste stream. With respect to each category \n        on the list, the Administrator shall determine the following:\n                    (A) The percentage of recovered materials used in \n                the manufacture of products or packaging in each \n                category.\n                    (B) The source reduction and recovery efficiency of \n                products or packaging in each category.\n                    (C) The percentage of products or packaging in each \n                category that is recycled upon discard.\n                    (D) The percentage of products or packaging in each \n                category that enters the ocean upon discard or is \n                otherwise littered.\n                    (E) The life cycle environmental effects associated \n                with the products or packaging in each category \n                compared to product or packaging alternatives, using \n                standard life cycle assessment methodologies and \n                categories of environmental impacts, including climate \n                change, human health, eutrophication, acidification, \n                water use, land use, and ecosystems toxicity.\n            (2) Upon completion of the list and determinations required \n        under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall identify \n        categories of products or packaging that shall be targeted for \n        regulatory action under subsection (b). The Administrator shall \n        target a category based upon high overall life cycle impact of \n        the product or package compared to the alternatives, \n        considering categories of environmental impacts, recovered \n        material content, recyclability, and high volume in the waste \n        stream.\n    (b) Regulatory Action.--With respect to each category of product or \npackaging identified under subsection (a)(2), the Administrator may \ntake the following actions:\n            (1) The Administrator may promulgate regulations to require \n        the manufacturer of the product or packaging to use recovered \n        materials of that or another category in the product or \n        packaging. In promulgating regulations under this paragraph, \n        the Administrator shall, to the extent practicable, consider \n        the potential life cycle impacts of requiring recovered \n        material content in a product or packaging on increasing \n        greenhouse gases and water usage, current regulations regarding \n        the use of recovered materials, and potential market \n        disruptions to recovered materials.\n            (2) The Administrator may phase in any of the actions taken \n        under paragraph (1) if the Administrator determines it to be \n        necessary for economic reasons.\n\nSEC. 7. PACKAGING STANDARDS.\n\n    The Administrator and the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation \nwith affected industries, experts in package design and marketing, \ncompanies engaged in collecting and processing products and packages, \nand environmental organizations, shall develop a voluntary system of \npackaging standards with respect to materials contained within the \npackaging and the recyclability of the packaging upon discard, which \nmay include implementation of an existing labeling standard where \nappropriate. The standards shall provide that packaging that meets the \nstandards shall be eligible to use a label indicating compliance with \nthe standards for promotion and educational purposes.\n\nSEC. 8. REPORT ON LANDFILL CLOSURES.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nthe Administrator shall submit to Congress a report analyzing the costs \nand difficulties encountered by States and local communities in closing \nlandfills. The report shall include recommendations on the types and \nlevels of Federal assistance (including technical guidance and funds) \nthat should be provided to States and local communities for such \npurpose.\n\nSEC. 9.
