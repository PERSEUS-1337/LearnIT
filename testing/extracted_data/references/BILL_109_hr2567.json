ADDITION OF BITTERING AGENT IN ANTIFREEZE REQUIRED.\n\n    The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.) is \namended by adding after section 24 (15 U.S.C. 1278) the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 25. ADDITION OF BITTERING AGENT IN ANTIFREEZE REQUIRED.\n\n    ``(a) Bittering Agent.--\n            ``(1) Environmental evaluation required.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n                date of enactment of this section, the Consumer Product \n                Safety Commission shall commence an evaluation, in \n                cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency \n                and appropriate State health and environmental \n                officials in those States that, as of the date of \n                enactment of this section, have enacted laws requiring \n                a bittering agent in engine coolant or antifreeze, to \n                determine whether there is evidence that the use of the \n                bittering agent denatonium benzoate in engine coolant \n                or antifreeze has an unreasonable adverse effect on the \n                environment.\n                    ``(B) Certain tests prohibited.--The evaluation \n                required under subparagraph (A) may not include any new \n                animal or human testing.\n                    ``(C) Required date of completion.--The Commission \n                shall complete the evaluation within 180 days after the \n                date of enactment of this section and publish its \n                findings in the Federal Register.\n            ``(2) Use of bittering agent.--\n                    ``(A) General requirement.--Unless the Commission, \n                in its evaluation under paragraph (1), finds there is \n                evidence of an unreasonable adverse effect on the \n                environment, any engine coolant or antifreeze that is \n                manufactured on or after the date that is 180 days \n                after the date of publication of the Commission's \n                finding in the Federal Register pursuant to paragraph \n                (1)(C), and that contains more than 10 percent ethylene \n                glycol, shall include not less than 30 parts per \n                million, and not more than 50 parts per million, \n                denatonium benzoate as a bittering agent in order to \n                render the coolant or antifreeze unpalatable.\n                    ``(B) Alternative agent.--If the inclusion of \n                denatonium benzoate in engine coolant or antifreeze is \n                required under subparagraph (A) and the Commission \n                finds that--\n                            ``(i) an alternative bittering agent is as \n                        effective as denatonium benzoate in rendering \n                        coolant or antifreeze unpalatable in terms of \n                        both its bittering capacity and its \n                        compatibility with motor vehicle engine coolant \n                        and antifreeze, and\n                            ``(ii) in

has an unreasonable adverse \n                        effect on the environment,\n                the Commission may initiate a rulemaking to permit the \n                use of the alternative bittering agent in lieu of \n                denatonium benzoate.\n            ``(3) Unreasonable adverse effect on the environment \n        defined.--As used in this subsection, the term `unreasonable \n        adverse effect on the environment' means an unreasonable risk \n        to human health or the environment, taking into account the \n        economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits.\n            ``(4) Failure to comply.--Any engine coolant or antifreeze \n        that is required to contain a bittering agent under paragraph \n        (2) that is not in compliance with that paragraph shall be \n        considered to be a banned hazardous substance within the \n        meaning of section 2(q) (15 U.S.C. 1261(q)), and shall be \n        subject to the penalties provided for in section 5 (15 U.S.C. \n        1264).\n    ``(b) Record Keeping.--\n            ``(1) Name and active ingredient.--A manufacturer of an \n        engine coolant or antifreeze that is required to contain a \n        bittering agent under subsection (a) shall maintain a record of \n        the trade name, scientific name, and any active ingredients of \n        a bittering agent used in compliance with such subsection.\n            ``(2) Availability to the public.--Any record maintained \n        under paragraph (1) shall be made available to the public on \n        receipt by the manufacturer of a request from any person.\n    ``(c) Limitation of Liability.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), a \n        manufacturer, processor, distributor, recycler, or seller of an \n        engine coolant or antifreeze that is required to contain a \n        bittering agent under subsection (a) shall not be liable to a \n        person for any personal injury, death, property damage, damage \n        to the environment (including natural resources), or economic \n        loss that results from the inclusion in the engine coolant or \n        antifreeze of the bittering agent, provided that the bittering \n        agent is present in concentrations mandated by subsection \n        (a)(2)(A) or permitted pursuant to a rulemaking under

Nothing \n        in this subsection shall be construed to exempt any \n        manufacturer or distributor of denatonium benzoate, or an \n        alternative bittering agent the use of which is required or \n        permitted under subsection (a)(2), from any liability related \n        to denatonium benzoate or the alternative bittering agent.\n    ``(d) Preemption.--No State or political subdivision of a State \nshall establish or continue to enforce with respect to retail \ncontainers containing less than 55 gallons of engine coolant or \nantifreeze any prohibition, limitation, standard or other requirement \nrelating to the inclusion of a bittering agent in engine coolant or \nantifreeze that is different from, or in addition to, the requirements \nof this section.\n    ``(e) Exemption.--This section shall not be construed to apply to--\n            ``(1) the sale of a motor vehicle that contains engine \n        coolant or antifreeze; or\n            ``(2) a wholesale container of engine coolant or antifreeze \n        that contains 55 gallons or more of engine coolant or \n        antifreeze.''.\n                                                 "
