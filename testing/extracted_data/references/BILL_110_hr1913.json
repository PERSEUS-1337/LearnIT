FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many wild populations of felids, once considered common \n        are in decline, and many have declined to the point that their \n        long-term survival in the wild is in serious jeopardy.\n            (2) Of the 37 wild felid species worldwide, all are \n        currently recognized as species in need of protection under the \n        IUCN Red List, the lists of species in CITES appendices, or the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n            (3) In addition to their intrinsic value, felids are \n        important aesthetic, economic, and ecological global resources \n        that need to be conserved.\n            (4) Large felids are considered indicator species. Healthy \n        populations of these species act as an important indicator of \n        the integrity of entire ecosystems. Measures taken to benefit \n        these keystone species will ultimately benefit a great number \n        of other species.\n            (5) Endangered felids face an array of threats, including \n        loss of habitat, intentional and unintentional takings by \n        humans, disease transmission, and a vast number of other \n        threats. These threats need to be addressed in a coordinated \n        fashion.\n            (6) Conservation of endangered felid populations requires \n        global commitment. Adequate funding for conservation is sorely \n        lacking, and many range countries do not have adequate \n        infrastructure to protect these species.\n            (7) Although some protections exist to conserve endangered \n        felid populations and their habitat, those efforts can be \n        significantly enhanced by the infusion of targeted funding.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to provide financial resources and to \nfoster international cooperation--\n            (1) to restore and perpetuate healthy populations of great \n        cats in the wild; and\n            (2) to assist in the conservation of great cat populations \n        worldwide.\n\nSEC. 4.
