FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The rapid advances in biotechnology and biomedical \n        research capabilities are creating a wide range of ethical, \n        legal, economic, environmental, international and social \n        issues, including concerns about the patenting of life forms, \n        eugenics, genetic discrimination, conflicts of interest for \n        biomedical researchers, and genetic privacy considerations in \n        insurance and employment.\n            (2) Prominent members of the scientific community are \n        discussing the possibility of the permanent alteration of the \n        genetic code of human beings (referred to as ``germ-line \n        research''), yet Congress has not yet addressed the ethical, \n        legal, economic, environmental, evolutionary, international and \n        social implications of such experimentation.\n            (3) The National Institutes of Health has already proposed \n        patenting over 2,000 human gene sequences, an issue which \n        raises unique and unprecedented ethical, legal, economic and \n        social questions.\n            (4) Prior to the Patent and Trademark Office policy of \n        patenting animals, established on April 7, 1987, no animal had \n        ever been patented under the patent laws of the United States.\n            (5) Over 150 animal patents are presently pending and three \n        more were granted by the Patent and Trademark Office of the \n        Department of Commerce in December of 1992, in spite of the \n        undetermined ethical implications of such patents.\n            (6) Congress may act to significantly restrict or alter the \n        Patent and Trademark Office policy of patenting animals and \n        human genes.\n            (7) The Office of Technology Assessment will complete a \n        comprehensive review of these issues, and the Congress is \n        prepared to schedule hearings and debate on this issue in the \n        spring of 1993.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 10 of part II of title 35, United States \nCode, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new \nsection:\n``Sec. 106. Prohibition on Patentability of Certain Biomedical \n              Inventions or Processes\n    ``(a) In General.--No human being, human organ, organ subpart \n(genetically engineered or otherwise) or genetically engineered animal \nshall be considered patentable subject matter under this title.\n    ``(b) Suspension.--Except as otherwise provided in section, during \nthe 2-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this section, \nno--\n            ``(1) human tissue, fluid, cell, gene or gene sequence \n        (genetically engineered or otherwise); or\n            ``(2) animal or animal organism (genetically engineered or \n        otherwise);\nshall be considered patentable subject matter under this title. The \nprohibition under this section may continue after such 2-year period \npursuant to section 381(f) of the Public Health Service Act.\n    ``(c) Exception.--Subsection (b) shall not apply to patents issued \nprior to the date of enactment of this section.\n    ``(d) Patent Status of Others.--Notwithstanding any other provision \nof law, with respect to those individuals who have applied or will \napply for a patent to which this section applies, this section shall \nnot be construed to detrimentally affect the rights of such \nindividuals, but rather to maintain such rights until the expiration of \nthe 2-year period described in subsection (b).\n    ``(e) Definitions.--As used in this section, the term `genetically \nengineered' means the formation of new combinations of genetic material \nby the insertion of nucleic acid molecules into the host organism's \nsomatic or germ-line cells so as to allow the incorporation of the new \ngenetic material into the genetic material of the host organism.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 10 of \npart II of title 35, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \nend thereof the following:\n\n``106. Prohibition on patentability of certain biomedical inventions or \n                            processes.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) mindful of the dangers inherent in the uncontrolled \n        patenting and proliferation of genetic material, including \n        problems in the areas of patenting of life, eugenics, genetic \n        discrimination, unexpected and reproducible mutations, \n        conflicts of interest for biomedical researchers, and genetic \n        privacy considerations in insurance and employment, but aware \n        of the urgent need of humanity to reap the benefits of \n        responsibly-conducted research and innovation, legislation \n        addressing the implications of genetic research should be \n        thoroughly studied, considered, debated and passed by the \n        Congress as soon as reasonably possible; and\n            (2) the Department of Commerce, the National Institutes of \n        Health and the Department of State should work with the \n        international community to develop international standards \n        relating to the patenting of genetic information and access to \n        such information."
