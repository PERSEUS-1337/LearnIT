The transfers shall be made to such States based on the \nshare of funds of each such State under subsection (a)(2), except that, \nfor purposes of this subparagraph, the ratio under subsection (a)(2) \nshall be adjusted by excluding the wages attributable to the States \nfailing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph.\n    ``(B)(i) For December 31, 2001, the solvency target shall be an \naverage high cost multiple of 1.0. For purposes of this subparagraph, \nthe average high cost multiple represents the number of years a State \ncould pay unemployment compensation (based on the reserve ratio of such \nState) if the State paid such compensation at a rate equivalent to the \naverage benefit cost rate such State paid in the three calendar years \nduring the preceding 20 calendar years (or, if longer, during the \nperiod consisting of the preceding three recessions as determined by \nthe National Bureau of Economic Research) that the benefit cost rates \nwere the highest. For purposes of making this determination--\n            ``(I) the term `reserve ratio' means the ratio determined \n        by dividing the balance in the State account at the end of the \n        calendar year by the total covered wages in the State for such \n        year;\n            ``(II) the term `benefit cost rate' means the rate \n        determined by dividing the unemployment compensation paid \n        during a calendar year by the total covered wages in the State \n        for such year; and\n            ``(III) the ratio and rates determined under subclauses (I) \n        and (II) shall exclude the wages and unemployment compensation \n        paid by employers covered under section 3309 of the Internal \n        Revenue Code of 1986.\n    ``(ii) For December 31, 2001, acceptable progress towards achieving \nthe solvency target shall mean that a State has reduced any difference \nbetween 1.0 and the average high cost multiple of such State (if such \nmultiple is less than 1.0) that the Secretary found to exist as of \nDecember 31, 1998, by an amount equal to or exceeding 5 percent of such \ndifference.\n    ``(iii) The Secretary may adjust the solvency target specified in \nclause (i), or the criteria for determining whether there is acceptable \nprogress towards achieving the solvency target specified in clause \n(ii), for States that experience significant increases in unemployment \nduring the period between December 31, 1998, and December 31, 2001. The \nSecretary shall establish objective criteria for making such \nadjustments.\n    ``(iv) A State shall include, as part of the annual State plan \nrelating to the administration of grants under this title, such \ninformation as the Secretary may request relating to the manner in \nwhich the State intends to achieve the solvency target established \npursuant to this paragraph.\n    ``(C) The requirements of subparagraph (A) shall apply to excess \n(referred to in subsection (a)(1)) remaining in the employment security \naccount at the close of fiscal year 2002 that are equal to or less than \n$2,900,000,000. Such requirements shall not apply to any such excess \namounts that are greater than $2,900,000,000.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
