FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In their 2006-2007 survey of 722 schools of nursing \n        with baccalaureate and graduate programs, the American \n        Association of Colleges of Nursing found that U.S. nursing \n        schools turned away 42,866 qualified applicants. The National \n        League for Nursing (NLN) released a preliminary report on \n        December 9, 2005 which estimated that schools of nursing with \n        entry-level baccalaureate, associate, and diploma programs were \n        forced to reject more than 147,000 qualified applications for \n        2005.   This was an 18 percent increase over last year's \n        figures.\n            (2) In 2006, the mean ages of doctorally prepared nurse \n        faculty holding the ranks of professor, associate professor, \n        and assistant professor are 58.6, 55.8, and 51.6 respectively. \n        For master's degree-prepared nurse faculty, the average ages \n        for professors, associate professors, and assistant professors \n        were 56.5, 54.8, and 50.1 years, respectively.\n            (3) The average age at retirement of nurse faculty is 62.5 \n        years and it is expected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared \n        faculty will be eligible for retirement each year from 2007 \n        through 2012 just as more than 1 million replacement nurses \n        will be needed.\n            (4) The current faculty shortage will be greatly compounded \n        in the next few years by the retirement of many of the current \n        nurse faculty in the United States. Without sufficient nurse \n        faculty, schools of nursing cannot expand enrollments, and the \n        nursing shortage will continue to cripple our nation's health \n        care delivery system.\n            (5) Nursing salaries for faculty are not competitive when \n        compared to similarly educated nurses in clinical or \n        administrative positions, as the average salary of a master's \n        prepared nurse faculty member in 2005 was $66,925 compared to \n        $84,835 for a master's prepared nurse practitioner working in \n        an emergency department.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n    Title VII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1133 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new part:\n\n                 ``PART E--NURSE FACULTY PILOT PROJECT\n\n``SEC. 771.
