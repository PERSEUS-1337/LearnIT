    "content": "SECTION 1. KOREA VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) travel and tourism play a major role in reducing the \n        United States unfavorable balance of trade;\n            (2) the characteristics of the Korean travel market do not \n        permit long-term planning for longer trips;\n            (3) applications for United States visas cannot now be \n        processed in a reasonable period of time;\n            (4) the Secretary of State has attempted to solve the \n        problem by adding additional staff to the consular section at \n        the United States Embassy in Seoul;\n            (5) unfortunately, these additions have not resulted in any \n        discernable improvement in reducing visa processing delays;\n            (6) further, it is unlikely, given the current fiscal \n        environment, to expect funding to be available for further \n        staff additions in sufficient numbers to effect any significant \n        improvement in the time required to process visa applications;\n            (7) most of the nations of the South Pacific, Europe, and \n        Canada do not currently require Koreans entering their \n        countries to have a visa, thus providing them with a serious \n        competitive advantage in the tourism industry;\n            (8) the United States territory of Guam has been permitted \n        by the United States Government to eliminate visa requirements \n        for Koreans visiting Guam, with resultant impressive increases \n        in travel and tourism from citizens of the Republic of Korea;\n            (9) any application under existing procedures to add the \n        Republic of Korea, or any other nation to the group of favored \n        nations exempted from United States visa regulations, would \n        require many years during which time the United States could \n        well lose its competitive advantages in attracting travel and \n        tourism from the Republic of Korea;\n            (10) the Republic of Korea, as a gesture of goodwill, has \n        already unilaterally exempted United States tourists who seek \n        to enter the Republic of Korea from the requirement of \n        obtaining a visa; and\n            (11) growth in Korean travel to the United States has not \n        kept pace with growth in travel to non-United States \n        destinations, and cumbersome and time-consuming visa processing \n        procedures are widely recognized as the cause of this loss of \n        market share and competitiveness with alternative destinations.\n    (b) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of State and the Attorney General \njointly shall establish a pilot project (in this section referred to as \nthe ``pilot program'') within six months of the date of the enactment \nof this Act under which the requirement of paragraph (7)(B)(i)(II) of \nsection 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(II)) is waived during the pilot program period in the \ncase of any alien who meets the following requirements:\n            (1) National of pilot program country.--The alien is a \n        national of, and presents a passport issued by, the Republic of \n        Korea. The Republic of Korea is urged to provide machine \n        readable passports to its citizens in the near future.\n            (2) Seeking entry as tourist.--The alien is applying for \n        admission to the United States during the pilot program period \n        as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure (as described in section \n        101(a)(15)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n        1101(a)(15)(B))), as part of a group tour to the United States.\n            (3) Period of stay.--The alien seeks to stay in the United \n        States for a period of not more than 15 days.\n            (4) Executes immigration forms.--The alien before the time \n        of such admission completes such immigration form as the \n        Attorney General shall establish.\n            (5) Entry into the united states.--If arriving by sea or \n        air, the alien arrives at the port of entry into the United \nStates on a carrier which has entered into an agreement with the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to guarantee transport of the \nalien out of the United States if the alien is found inadmissible or \ndeportable by an immigration officer.\n            (6) Not a safety threat.--The alien has been determined not \n        to represent a threat to the welfare, health, safety, or \n        security of the United States.\n            (7) No previous violation.--If the alien previously was \n        admitted without a visa under this section, the alien must not \n        have failed to comply with the conditions of any previous \n        admission as such a nonimmigrant.\n            (8) Round-trip ticket.--The alien is in possession of a \n        round-trip transportation ticket (unless this requirement is \n        waived by the Attorney General under regulations).\n    (c) Waiver of Rights.--An alien may not be provided a waiver under \nthe pilot program unless the alien has waived any right--\n            (1) to review or appeal under this Act of an immigration \n        officer's determination as to the admissibility of the alien at \n        the port of entry into the United States, or\n            (2) to contest, other than on the basis of an application \n        for asylum, any action for deportation against the alien.\n    (d) Termination of Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision \nof this section, the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, \nacting jointly, may terminate the pilot program under this section on \nor after a date which is one year after the date of the establishment \nof the pilot program if--\n            (1) during the preceding fiscal year, the overstay rate for \n        nationals of the Republic of Korea entering the United States \n        under the pilot program exceeds the overstay rate of such \n        nationals entering the United States with valid visas; and\n            (2) the Attorney General and the Secretary of State have \n        jointly determined that the pilot program is leading to a \n        significant increase in the number of overstays by such \n        nationals.\n    (e) Special Bond and Notification Requirements for Tour \nOperators.--\n            (1) In general.--Nationals of the Republic of Korea may not \n        enter the United States under the terms of this section unless \n        they are accompanied for the duration of their authorized \n        admission period by a tour operator who has fulfilled the \n        following requirements:\n                    (A) The tour operator has posted a bond of $200,000 \n                with the Secretary of State.\n                    (B) The Secretary of State, under such regulations \n                as the Secretary may prescribe, has approved an \n                application by the tour operator to escort tour groups \n                to the United States.\n                    (C) The tour operator provides the name, address, \n                birthdate, passport number, and citizenship of all \n                prospective tour group members to the Secretary of \n                State no less than one business day prior to the \n                departure date of the group, under such regulations as \n                he may prescribe, in order to determine that the \n                prospective travelers do not represent a threat to the \n                welfare, health, safety, and security of the United \n                States.\n                    (D) The tour operator excludes from the tour group \n                any person whom the Secretary of State denies \n                permission to travel to the United States.\n                    (E) The tour operator provides written \n                certification or other such evidence prescribed by the \n                Secretary of State and Attorney General which documents \nthe return to Korea of each tour group member.\n            (2) Forfeiture of bonds.--Bonds posted in accordance with \n        this subsection shall be forfeited in whole or in part and a \n        tour operator's authorization to escort tours to the United \n        States may be suspended or revoked if the Secretary of State \n        finds that the tour operator--\n                    (A) has failed to disclose a material fact in \n                connection with the application required under \n                paragraph (1)(B);\n                    (B) fails to comply with the advance notification \n                and refusal requirements of paragraphs (1)(C) and \n                (1)(D);\n                    (C) has failed to take adequate steps to ensure \n                that visitors who are being escorted to the United \n                States under the terms of an approved application \n                return to their country of residence;
