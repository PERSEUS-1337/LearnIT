SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fire Safe \nCigarette Act of 1999''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) cigarette ignited fires are the leading cause of fire \n        deaths in the United States;\n            (2) in 1996 cigarette ignited fires caused--\n                    (A) 1,083 deaths;\n                    (B) 2,809 civilian injuries; and\n                    (C) $420,000,000 in property damage;\n            (3) each year, more than 100 children are killed from \n        cigarette-related fires;\n            (4) the technical work necessary to achieve a cigarette \n        fire safety standard has been accomplished under the Cigarette \n        Safety Act of 1984 (15 U.S.C. 2054 note) and the Fire Safe \n        Cigarette Act of 1990 (15 U.S.C. 2054 note);\n            (5) it is appropriate for Congress to require the \n        establishment of a cigarette fire safety standard for the \n        manufacture and importation of cigarettes;\n            (6) the most recent study by the Consumer Product Safety \n        Commission found that the cost of the loss of human life and \n        personal property from the absence of a cigarette fire safety \n        standard is $6,000,000,000 a year; and\n            (7) it is appropriate that the regulatory expertise of the \n        Consumer Product Safety Commission be used to implement a \n        cigarette fire safety standard.\n\nSEC. 2.
