FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The illegal importation of 3,4-\n        methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly referred to as ``MDMA'' \n        or ``Ecstasy'', and paramethoxyamphetamine, commonly referred \n        to as ``PMA'', have increased in recent years, as evidenced by \n        the fact that club drug seizures by the United States Customs \n        Service have risen from less than 500,000 tablets during fiscal \n        year 1997 to more than 4,000,000 tablets during the first 5 \n        months of fiscal year 2000.\n            (2) Use of club drugs can cause long-lasting, and perhaps \n        permanent, damage to the serotonin system of the brain, which \n        is fundamental to the integration of information and emotion, \n        and this damage can cause long-term problems with learning and \n        memory.\n            (3) Due to the popularity and marketability of club drugs, \n        there are numerous Internet websites with information on its \n        effects, production, and the locations of use, often referred \n        to as ``raves''. The availability of this information targets \n        the primary users of club drugs, who are most often college \n        students, young professionals, and other young people from \n        middle- to high-income families.\n            (4) Greater emphasis needs to be placed on--\n                    (A) penalties associated with the manufacture, \n                distribution, and use of club drugs;\n                    (B) the education of young people on the negative \n                health effects of club drugs, since the reputation of \n                club drugs as ``safe'' drugs is its most dangerous \n                component;\n                    (C) the education of State and local law \n                enforcement agencies regarding the growing problem of \n                club drug trafficking across the United States;\n                    (D) reducing the number of deaths caused by club \n                drug use and its combined use with alcohol; and\n                    (E) adequate funding for research by the National \n                Institute on Drug Abuse to--\n                            (i) identify those most vulnerable to using \n                        club drugs and develop science-based prevention \n                        approaches tailored to the specific needs of \n                        individuals at high risk;\n                            (ii) understand how club drugs produce its \n                        toxic effects and how to reverse neurotoxic \n                        damage;\n                            (iii) develop treatments, including new \n                        medications and behavioral treatment \n                        approaches;\n                            (iv) better understand the effects that \n                        club drugs have on the developing children and \n                        adolescents; and\n                            (v) translate research findings into useful \n                        tools and ensure their effective dissemination.\n\nSEC. 3.
