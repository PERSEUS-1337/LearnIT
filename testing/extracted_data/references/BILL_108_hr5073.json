FINDINGS AND POLICY RELATING TO DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION \n              UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Public access to information held by the Federal \n        Government is vitally important to the functioning of a \n        democratic society.\n            (2) The Freedom of Information Act was enacted to ensure \n        such public access to information.\n            (3) The Freedom of Information Act specifies limited \n        exemptions to the general requirement for disclosure, where \n        disclosure could potentially threaten other important public \n        policy goals.\n            (4) In establishing the categories of exempt information \n        under the Freedom of Information Act, Congress allowed agencies \n        to withhold information in those categories, but did not in any \n        way mandate or encourage such withholding.\n    (b) Policy.--The policy of the Federal Government is to release \ninformation to the public in response to a request under the Freedom of \nInformation Act--\n            (1) if such release is required by law; or\n            (2) if such release is allowed by law and the agency \n        concerned does not reasonably foresee that disclosure would be \n        harmful to an interest protected by an applicable exemption.\n    (c) Guidance.--All guidance provided to Federal Government \nemployees responsible for carrying out the Freedom of Information Act \nshall be consistent with the policy set forth in subsection (b).\n\nSEC. 103.
