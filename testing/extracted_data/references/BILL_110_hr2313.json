FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has a critical national interest in \n        developing clean, domestic, renewable sources of energy in \n        order to reduce environmental impacts of energy production, \n        increase national security, improve public health, and bolster \n        economic stability.\n            (2) Marine renewable energy technologies are a nonemitting \n        source of power production.\n            (3) Marine renewable energy may serve as an alternative to \n        fossil fuels and create thousands of new jobs within the United \n        States.\n            (4) Europe has already successfully delivered electricity \n        to the grid through the deployment of wave and tidal energy \n        devices off the coast of Scotland.\n            (5) Recent studies from the Electric Power Research \n        Institute, in conjunction with the Department of Energy's \n        National Renewable Energy Laboratory, have identified an \n        abundance of viable sites within the United States with ample \n        wave and tidal resources to be harnessed by marine power \n        technologies.\n            (6) Sustained and expanded research, development, \n        demonstration, and commercial application programs are needed \n        to locate and characterize marine renewable energy resources, \n        and to develop the technologies that will enable their \n        widespread commercial development.\n            (7) Federal support is critical to reduce the financial \n        risk associated with developing new marine renewable energy \n        technologies, thereby encouraging the private sector investment \n        necessary to make marine renewable energy resources \n        commercially viable as a source of electric power and for other \n        applications.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) Marine renewable energy.--The term ``Marine Renewable \n        Energy'' means energy derived from one or more of the following \n        sources:\n                    (A) Waves.\n                    (B) Tidal flows.\n                    (C) Ocean currents.\n                    (D) Ocean thermal energy conversion.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n\nSEC. 4. MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary, in conjunction with other \nappropriate agencies, shall support programs of research, development, \ndemonstration, and commercial application to expand marine renewable \nenergy production, including programs to--\n            (1) study and compare existing marine renewable energy \n        extraction technologies;\n            (2) research, develop, and demonstrate advanced marine \n        renewable energy systems and technologies;\n            (3) reduce the manufacturing and operation costs of marine \n        renewable energy technologies;\n            (4) investigate efficient and reliable integration with the \n        utility grid and intermittency issues;\n            (5) advance wave forecasting technologies;\n            (6) conduct experimental and numerical modeling for \n        optimization of marine energy conversion devices and arrays;\n            (7) increase the reliability and survivability of marine \n        renewable energy technologies, including development of \n        corrosive-resistant materials;\n            (8) study, in conjunction with the Assistant Administrator \n        for Research and Development of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency, the Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and \n        Atmosphere, and other Federal agencies as appropriate, the \n        environmental impacts of marine renewable energy technologies \n        and ways to address adverse impacts, and provide public \n        information concerning technologies and other means available \n        for monitoring and determining environmental impacts;\n            (9) establish protocols, in conjunction with the National \n        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for how the ocean \n        community may best interact with marine renewable energy \n        devices;\n            (10) develop power measurement standards for marine \n        renewable energy;\n            (11) develop identification standards for marine renewable \n        energy devices;\n            (12) address standards development, demonstration, and \n        technology transfer for advanced systems engineering and system \n        integration methods to identify critical interfaces; and\n            (13) utilize marine resources in the Gulf of Mexico, the \n        Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.\n    (b) Siting Criteria.--The Secretary, in conjunction with other \nappropriate Federal agencies, shall develop, prior to installation of \nany technologies under this section, siting criteria for marine \nrenewable energy generation demonstration and commercial application \nprojects funded under this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
