FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) for national security purposes, the United States \n        requires steady and secure sources of oil as well as other \n        sources of energy;\n            (2) while protecting the oil-producing capabilities of the \n        United States is important, it is also important to protect the \n        environment from which the oil is drawn;\n            (3) following the discharge of oil from the T/V EXXON \n        VALDEZ on March 23 and 24, 1989, when the vessel went aground \n        on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, a settlement was \n        reached;\n            (4) under the terms of the Agreement and Consent Decree (as \n        described in section 207 of Public Law 102-229) that the \n        Federal Government and the State of Alaska entered into with \n        the Exxon Corporation, Exxon will pay a total sum of \n        $900,000,000 over a period of 10 years for damages and \n        environmental restoration to the Federal Government and the \n        State of Alaska (referred to in this section as ``settlement \n        funds'');\n            (5) the placement of a portion of the settlement funds in a \n        Stewardship Endowment Fund would create a stream of income over \n        and above the initial settlement funds that could be used to \n        meet the needs of environmental restoration over a period that \n        extends beyond the 10-year period specified in paragraph (4);\n            (6)(A) catastrophic failures with respect to salmon \n        fisheries in Prince William Sound, and other biological events, \n        indicate an urgent need to carry out long-term \n        multidisciplinary research efforts to enable the full \n        implementation of an effective restoration and enhancement \n        program; and\n            (B) the research should fully examine all possible causes \n        of, and solutions to, the problems described in subparagraph \n        (A);\n            (7) similar failures with respect to other salmon fisheries \n        and changes in the populations and ratios of other species \n        further indicate that a broad approach to scientific \n        investigation may be necessary to determine whether events in \n        Prince William Sound concerning salmon fisheries may be caused \n        by, or affected by, events in other geographic areas;\n            (8) a stable source of research funding is needed in order \n        to provide for long-term research necessary for the successful \n        restoration and enhancement of Prince William Sound; and\n            (9) the Endowment Fund referred to in paragraph (5) would \n        facilitate the administration of the settlement funds by the \n        Trustees designated by the President and the Governor of the \n        State of Alaska to act, for the purposes of the Comprehensive \n        Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 \n        (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution \n        Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as trustees of natural \n        resources injured, lost, or destroyed as a result of the \n        discharge of oil from the T/V EXXON VALDEZ;\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish in the \nTreasury of the United States a Stewardship Endowment Fund in order to \ncreate a stream of income that will carry out the purposes specified in \nthe Memorandum of Agreement and Consent Decree that the United States \nand the State of Alaska entered into on August 28, 1991, for a period \nthat extends beyond the payment period referred to in subsection \n(a)(4).\n    (c) Intent of Congress.--It is the intent of Congress that the \nconservative use of settlement funds and earnings from the settlement \nfunds should be encouraged in order to provide for the maintenance of \nrestoration and enhancement activities for Prince William Sound \n(including providing for long-term scientific studies and ecosystem \nresearch necessary to support restoration and enhancement activities).\n\nSEC. 3.
