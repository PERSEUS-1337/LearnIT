FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) crane populations in many countries have experienced \n        serious decline in recent decades, a trend that, if continued \n        at the current rate, threatens the long-term survival of the \n        species in the wild in Africa, Asia, and Europe;\n            (2) 5 species of Asian crane are listed as endangered \n        species under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n        (16 U.S.C. 1533) and appendix I of the Convention, which \n        species are--\n                    (A) the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus);\n                    (B) the red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis);\n                    (C) the white-naped crane (Grus vipio);\n                    (D) the black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis); and\n                    (E) the hooded crane (Grus monacha);\n            (3) the Crane Action Plan of the International Union for \n        the Conservation of Nature considers 4 species of cranes from \n        Africa and 1 additional species of crane from Asia to be \n        seriously threatened, which species are--\n                    (A) the wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus);\n                    (B) the blue crane (Anthropoides paradisea);\n                    (C) the grey-crowned crane (Balearica regulorum);\n                    (D) the black-crowned crane (Balearica pavonina); \n                and\n                    (E) the sarus crane (Grus antigone);\n            (4)(A) the whooping crane (Grus americana) and the \n        Mississippi sandhill crane (Grus canadensis pulla) are listed \n        as endangered species under section 4 of the Endangered Species \n        Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533); and\n            (B) with fewer than 200 whooping cranes in the only self-\n        sustaining flock that migrates between Canada and the United \n        States, and approximately 100 Mississippi sandhill cranes in \n        the wild, both species remain vulnerable to extinction;\n            (5) conservation resources have not been sufficient to cope \n        with the continued diminution of crane populations from causes \n        that include hunting and the continued loss of habitat;\n            (6)(A) cranes are flagship species for the conservation of \n        wetland, grassland, and agricultural landscapes that border \n        wetland and grassland; and\n            (B) the establishment of crane conservation programs would \n        result in the provision of conservation benefits to numerous \n        other species of plants and animals, including many endangered \n        species;\n            (7) other threats to cranes include--\n                    (A) the collection of eggs and juveniles;\n                    (B) poisoning from insecticides applied to crops;\n                    (C) collisions with power lines;\n                    (D) disturbance from warfare and human settlement; \n                and\n                    (E) the trapping of live birds for sale;\n            (8) to reduce, remove, and otherwise effectively address \n        those threats to cranes in the wild, the joint commitment and \n        effort of countries in Africa, Asia, and North America, other \n        countries, and the private sector, are required;\n            (9) cranes are excellent ambassadors to promote goodwill \n        among countries because they are well known and migrate across \n        continents;\n            (10) because the threats facing cranes and habitats of \n        cranes are similar on all 5 continents on which cranes occur, \n        conservation successes and methods developed in 1 region have \n        wide applicability in other regions; and\n            (11) conservationists in the United States have much to \n        teach and much to learn from colleagues working in other \n        countries in which, as in the United States, government and \n        private agencies cooperate to conserve threatened cranes.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes;\n            (2) to assist in the conservation and protection of cranes \n        by supporting--\n                    (A) conservation programs in countries in which \n                endangered and threatened cranes occur; and\n                    (B) the efforts of private organizations committed \n                to helping cranes; and\n            (3) to provide financial resources for those programs and \n        efforts.\n\nSEC. 4.
