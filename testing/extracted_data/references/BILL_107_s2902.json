PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) upgrade the status and stature of mathematics and \n        science teaching as a profession by encouraging institutions of \n        higher education to assume greater responsibility for improving \n        mathematics and science teacher education through the \n        establishment of a comprehensive, integrated system of \n        recruiting and advising such teachers;\n            (2) focus on the education of mathematics and science \n        teachers as a career-long process that should continuously \n        stimulate teachers' intellectual growth and upgrade teachers' \n        knowledge and skills;\n            (3) bring together mathematics and science teachers in \n        elementary schools and secondary schools with scientists, \n        mathematicians, and engineers to increase teacher content \n        knowledge and improve teaching skills through the use of more \n        sophisticated laboratory space and equipment, computing \n        facilities, libraries, and other resources that colleges and \n        universities are more able to provide;\n            (4) develop more rigorous mathematics and science curricula \n        that are aligned with challenging State academic content \n        standards and intended to prepare students for postsecondary \n        study in mathematics and science; and\n            (5) conduct and evaluate research related to the science of \n        learning and teaching in order to develop ways in which the \n        results of such research can be applied, duplicated, and scaled \n        up for use in low-performing elementary schools and secondary \n        schools to improve the teaching and student achievement levels \n        in mathematics and science.\n\nSEC. 3.
