FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause approximately \n        450,000 deaths each year in the United States.\n            (2) Cigarette smoking accounts for approximately \n        $65,000,000,000 in lost productivity and health care costs.\n            (3) In spite of the well-established dangers of cigarette \n        smoking and tobacco use, there is no Federal agency that has \n        any authority to regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution, \n        and use of tobacco products.\n            (4) The tobacco industry spends approximately \n        $4,000,000,000 each year to promote tobacco products.\n            (5) Each day 3,000 children try cigarettes for the first \n        time, many of whom become lifelong addicted smokers.\n            (6) There is no minimum age requirement in Federal law that \n        an individual must reach to legally buy cigarettes and other \n        tobacco products.\n            (7) The Food and Drug Administration is the most qualified \n        Federal agency to regulate tobacco products.\n            (8) It is inconsistent for the Food and Drug Administration \n        to regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of other \n        nicotine-containing products used as substitutes for cigarette \n        smoking and tobacco use and not be able to regulate tobacco \n        products in a comparable manner.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n321) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(kk) The term `tobacco product' means cigarettes, cigars, little \ncigars, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, and chewing tobacco.\n    ``(ll) The term `tobacco additive' means any substance the intended \nuse of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly \nor indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the \ncharacteristics of any tobacco product.\n    ``(mm) The term `constituent' means any element of cigarette \nmainstream or sidestream smoke which is present in quantities which \nrepresent a potential health hazard or where the health effect is \nunknown.\n    ``(nn) The term `tar' means mainstream total articulate matter \nminus nicotine and water.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
