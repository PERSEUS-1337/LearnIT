FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) from 1880 through 2014, global temperatures have \n        increased by about 0.9 degrees Celsius;\n            (2) the vast majority of global warming that has occurred \n        over the past 50 years was due to human activities, primarily \n        the burning of fossil fuels;\n            (3) emissions of greenhouse gases and atmospheric \n        concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise, which \n        results in a continued warming trend;\n            (4) global warming already has a significant impact on the \n        economy, including the farming, fishing, forestry, and \n        recreation industries;\n            (5) the significant impacts of global warming that are \n        already occurring will be amplified by a global temperature \n        increase of 2 degrees Celsius, which will lead to increased \n        droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions, heat waves, \n        desertification, wildfires, acidifying oceans, significant \n        economic disruption, and security threats;\n            (6) to avoid exceeding 2 degrees Celsius warming, at least \n        80 percent of carbon from proven fossil fuel reserves must be \n        kept in the ground;\n            (7) the potential emissions resulting from extracting and \n        burning all fossil fuels on Federal land and waters amounts to \n        a significant percentage of the greenhouse gas emissions limit; \n        and\n            (8) ending new leases for fossil fuels will prevent the \n        release of 90 percent of the potential emissions from Federal \n        fossil fuels.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nthat--\n            (1) Federal land and waters should be managed for the \n        benefit of the people of the United States--\n                    (A) to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate \n                change; and\n                    (B) to promote a rapid transition to a clean energy \n                economy by keeping fossil fuels in the ground; and\n            (2) the Federal Government should pursue management of \n        Federal land and waters for the benefit of the people of the \n        United States by not issuing any new lease or renewing any \n        nonproducing lease for coal, oil, or natural gas in any Federal \n        land or waters.\n\nSEC. 3.
