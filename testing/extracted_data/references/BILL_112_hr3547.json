Health care personnel shall discuss treatment \n                options, the importance of adherence to antiretroviral \n                therapy, and the side effects of medications with \n                inmates receiving treatment.\n                    (C) Health care personnel and pharmacy personnel \n                shall ensure that the facility formulary contains all \n                Food and Drug Administration-approved medications \n                necessary to provide comprehensive treatment for \n                inmates living with HIV/AIDS, and that the facility \n                maintains adequate supplies of such medications to meet \n                inmates' medical needs.

(Inmates \n                who are already known to be infected need not be tested \n                again.) This requirement may be waived if an inmate's \n                release occurs without sufficient notice to the Bureau \n                to allow health care personnel to perform a routine HIV \n                test and notify the inmate of the results.\n                    (B) All HIV tests under this paragraph shall comply \n                with the opt-out provision.\n                    (C) To all inmates who test positive for HIV and \n                all inmates who already are known to have HIV/AIDS, \n                health care personnel shall provide--\n                            (i) confidential prerelease counseling on \n                        managing their medical condition in the \n                        community, accessing appropriate treatment and \n                        services in the community, and preventing the \n                        transmission of their condition to family \n                        members and other persons in the community;\n                            (ii) referrals to appropriate health care \n                        providers and social service agencies in the \n                        community that meet the inmate's individual \n                        needs, including voluntary partner notification \n                        services and prevention counseling services for \n                        people living with HIV/AIDS; and\n                            (iii) a 30-day supply of any medically \n                        necessary medications the inmate is currently \n                        receiving.\n            (9) Opt-out provision.--Inmates shall have the right to \n        refuse routine HIV testing.

Oral and written \n        disclosure of this right may be included with other general \n        health information and counseling provided to inmates by health \n        care personnel. If an inmate refuses a routine test for HIV, \n        health care personnel shall make a note of the inmate's refusal \n        in the inmate's confidential medical records. However, the \n        inmate's refusal shall not be considered a violation of prison \n        rules or result in disciplinary action. Any reference in this \n        section to the ``opt-out provision'' shall be deemed a \n        reference to the requirement of this paragraph.\n            (10) Exclusion of tests performed under section 4014(b) \n        from the definition of routine hiv testing.--HIV testing of an \n        inmate under section 4014(b) of title 18, United States Code, \n        is not routine HIV testing for the purposes of the opt-out \n        provision. Health care personnel shall document the reason for \n        testing under section 4014(b) of title 18, United States Code, \n        in the inmate's confidential medical records.\n            (11) Timely notification of test results.--Health care \n        personnel shall provide timely notification to inmates of the \n        results of HIV tests.\n\nSEC. 4.

The Attorney General shall also cause such \n        individual to be so tested before release unless the individual \n        declines.''.\n    (b) Inadmissibility of HIV Test Results in Civil and Criminal \nProceedings.--Section 4014(d) of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by inserting ``or under the Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2011'' \nafter ``under this section''.\n    (c) Screening as Part of Routine Screening.--Section 4014(e) of \ntitle 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing: ``Such rules shall also provide that the initial test under \nthis section be performed as part of the routine health screening \nconducted at intake.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
