FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Short-range theater ballistic missiles threaten United \n        States Armed Forces wherever engaged abroad. Therefore, the \n        expeditious deployment of theater missile defenses to intercept \n        ballistic missiles at greater ranges and higher altitudes is \n        the highest priority among all ballistic missile defense \n        programs.\n            (2) The United States is developing defensive systems to \n        protect the United States against the threat of limited \n        ballistic missile attacks. Ground-based defensive systems are \n        attainable, compliant with the ABM Treaty, more affordable than \n        spaced-based interceptors or space-based lasers, and can \n        protect all of the United States from limited ballistic missile \n        attack.\n            (3) Defending against ballistic missile attacks upon our \n        national territory requires not only missile defenses but arms \n        control agreements and nonproliferation measures that lower the \n        threat and curb the spread of ballistic missile technology.\n            (4) The massive retaliatory capability of the United States \n        deterred the Soviet Union, and any other nation, from launching \n        an attack by intercontinental ballistic missiles throughout the \n        Cold War. The Nuclear Posture Review conducted by the \n        Department of Defense affirms the effectiveness of deterrence \n        now and into the future. While the threat of intentional attack \n        upon the United States has receded, the risk of an accidental \n        or unauthorized attack by Russia or China remains but is \n        remote.\n            (5) United States arms control agreements (notably the \n        START I Treaty and the START II Treaty, once implemented) will \n        lower the threat to the United States from large-scale nuclear \n        attack. The START I Treaty, when fully implemented, will reduce \n        deployed warheads by over 40 percent below 1990 levels. By the \n        end of 1996, only Russia, among the states of the former Soviet \n        Union, will deploy nuclear weapons. The START II Treaty, if \n        implemented, will reduce warheads deployed in Russia by 66 \n        percent below their levels before the Start I Treaty.\n            (6) As strategic offensive weapons are reduced, the \n        efficacy and affordability of defensive systems increases, \n        raising the possibility of deterrence based upon effective \n        defenses rather than deterrence based solely upon threat of \n        massive retaliation.\n            (7) Countries hostile to the United States (such as Iraq, \n        Iran, North Korea, and Libya) have manifested an interest in \n        developing ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United \n        States. These countries may accelerate the development of long-\nrange missiles if they receive external support, but in the absence of \noutside assistance, newly emerging threats may take as long as 15 years \nto mature, according to recent intelligence estimates.\n            (8) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Missile \n        Technology Control Regime, the Biological and Chemical Weapons \n        Convention, and continuing United States efforts to enforce \n        export controls will prevent or delay external assistance \n        needed by those countries to develop intercontinental ballistic \n        missiles and weapons of mass destruction.\n            (9) The ABM Treaty has added to strategic stability by \n        restraining the requirement on both sides for strategic \n        weapons. At the summit in May 1995, the President of the United \n        States and the President of Russia each reaffirmed his \n        country's commitment to the ABM Treaty.\n            (10) Abrogating the ABM Treaty to deploy a noncompliant \n        system will not add to strategic stability if it impedes \n        implementation of the START I or START II Treaty. Without the \n        removal of strategic weapons scheduled by both treaties, the \n        consequences and risks of unauthorized or accidental launches \n        will remain undiminished, as will the potential threat of a \n        large-scale attack capable of overwhelming any defenses \n        deployed.\n            (11) If the nuclear arsenal of the United States must be \n        maintained at START I levels, significant unbudgeted costs will \n        be incurred, encroaching on funds for ballistic missile \n        defenses and other defense requirements.\n            (12) Should arms control, nonproliferation efforts, and \n        deterrence fail, the United States must be able to defend \n        itself against limited ballistic missile attack.\n            (13) Missile defense systems consistent with the ABM Treaty \n        are capable of defending against limited ballistic missile \n        attack. Should a national missile defense system require \n        modification of the ABM Treaty, the treaty establishes the \n        means for the parties to amend the treaty, which the parties \n        have used in the past.\n\nSEC. 3.
