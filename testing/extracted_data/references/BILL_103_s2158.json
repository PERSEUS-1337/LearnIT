FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) advances in technology have made United States currency \n        particularly susceptible to counterfeiting;\n            (2) international organizations hostile to the United \n        States have produced counterfeits of the United States $100 \n        bill that are extremely difficult to detect;\n            (3) the ability to counterfeit currency allows terrorist \n        organizations or other organizations hostile to the United \n        States to undermine the stability of the United States \n        currency;\n            (4) the ability to counterfeit currency provides terrorist \n        organizations or other organizations hostile to the United \n        States a ready source of negotiable foreign currency with which \n        such organizations can fund activities opposed to the interests \n        of the United States;\n            (5) as shown by counterfeit-resistant currencies of other \n        countries, current technologies exist to make a $100 \n        denomination currency that is substantially more difficult to \n        counterfeit, without being unduly expensive to produce;\n            (6) implementing a new, counterfeit-resistant currency \n        would substantially impair terrorist organizations or other \n        organizations hostile to the United States in efforts to \n        undermine the stability of the United States currency and would \n        eliminate a source of negotiable foreign currency with which \n        such organizations could fund activities opposed to the \n        interests of the United States;\n            (7) an essential aspect of the business of international \n        drug trafficking is the ability to launder large sums of hard \n        currency quickly and inexpensively;\n            (8) without the ability to convert large sums of hard \n        currency with near impunity into readily transferable accounts \n        in financial institutions, international drug traffickers would \n        be severely impeded in their operations; and\n            (9) forcing international narcotics traffickers to exchange \n        all of their hard currency held in United States $100 bills \n        within a specified period of time for a new, counterfeit-\n        resistant currency would significantly increase the cost of \n        money laundering to drug cartels, thereby reducing their \n        profits.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide for new, counterfeit-resistant $100 \n        currencies for use in the United States and abroad to prevent \n        counterfeiting by terrorist and other hostile organizations; \n        and\n            (2) to issue the new currency in a manner that deters money \n        laundering efforts of narcotics traffickers.\n\nSEC. 3.
