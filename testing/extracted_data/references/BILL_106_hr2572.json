FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On July 20, 1969, Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. \n        ``Buzz'' Aldrin Jr., became the first humans to set foot on \n        another celestial body, during the Apollo 11 mission, \n        accompanied in lunar orbit by Michael Collins.\n            (2) Between 1969 and 1972, ten other Americans courageously \n        completed the first human exploration of the lunar surface, \n        accompanied by five command module pilots:\n                    (A) Apollo 12--Charles J. ``Pete'' Conrad Jr., Alan \n                L. Bean, and Richard F. Gordon Jr.\n                    (B) Apollo 14--Alan B. Shepard Jr., Edgar D. \n                Mitchell, and Stuart A. Roosa.\n                    (C) Apollo 15--David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and \n                Alfred M. Worden.\n                    (D) Apollo 16--John W. Young, Charles M. Duke Jr., \n                and Thomas K. Mattingly II.\n                    (E) Apollo 17--Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, \n                and Harrison H. Schmitt.\n            (3) In April 1970, James A. Lovell Jr., John L. Swigert \n        Jr., and Fred W. Haise Jr., valiantly made a safe return from \n        the Moon on the Apollo 13 mission, after their command module \n        was disabled by an explosion.\n            (4) The enormous successes of the Apollo lunar landing \n        missions were only possible due to the pioneering work of the \n        previous Apollo missions, which performed critical testing of \n        the spacecraft and methods, and conducted the first human \n        travel to the Moon:\n                    (A) Apollo 7--Walter M. Schirra Jr., Donn F. \n                Eisele, and R. Walter Cunningham.\n                    (B) Apollo 8--Frank Borman, James A. Lovell Jr., \n                and William A. Anders.\n                    (C) Apollo 9--James A. McDivitt, David R. Scott, \n                and Russell L. Schweickart.\n                    (D) Apollo 10--Thomas P. Stafford, John W. Young, \n                and Eugene A. Cernan.\n            (5) In January 1967, astronauts Virgil I. Grissom, Edward \n        H. White, and Roger B. Chaffee lost their lives in a tragic \n        fire in the command module while testing the spacecraft which \n        would have carried them on the first manned Apollo mission.\n            (6) Since the time of the Apollo program, the program's \n        astronauts have promoted space exploration and human endeavor \n        by sharing their experiences with the American people and the \n        world, stimulating the imagination and the belief that any goal \n        can be achieved.\n            (7) Sadly, astronauts John L. Swigert Jr., Donn F. Eisele, \n        Ronald E. Evans, James B. Irwin, Stuart A. Roosa, Alan B. \n        Shepard Jr., and Charles J. ``Pete'' Conrad Jr., have died \n        since completing their missions.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the American people should \nprovide a fitting and tangible tribute to each of the astronauts of the \nApollo program, to recognize and commemorate their bravery, substantial \nscientific and technical accomplishments, and unique contributions to \nAmerican and world history.\n\nSEC. 4.
