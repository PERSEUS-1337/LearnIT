FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Diamonds are being used by rebels and dictators to \n        finance military activities, overthrow legitimate governments, \n        subvert international efforts to promote peace and stability, \n        and commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians. \n        During the past decade, more than 6,500,000 people from Sierra \n        Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have \n        been driven from their homes by wars waged in large part for \n        control of diamond mining areas. A million of these are \n        refugees eking out a miserable existence in neighboring \n        countries, and tens of thousands have fled to the United \n        States. Approximately 2,400,000 people have died in the \n        fighting.\n            (2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to \n        nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart \n        not only by fighting, but by the thousands of children forced \n        to become soldiers, by the tens of thousands of women and girls \n        raped and forced into sexual slavery, and by a campaign of \n        forced amputations that has maimed and killed even more men, \n        women, and children.\n            (3) In the past decade, the United States Government has \n        sent more than $2,000,000,000 in humanitarian aid to the people \n        caught up in the wars. Over the same period, approximately \n        $10,000,000,000 in diamonds were smuggled out of these same \n        countries. Much of this money was used to continue and spread \n        the wars.\n            (4) The United States Government and human rights advocates \n        recently began working to block the trade in conflict diamonds. \n        Their efforts have helped to build a consensus that action is \n        urgently needed, and they have persuaded the legitimate diamond \n        industry that its own interests demand a comprehensive effort \n        to end the diamond smuggling that fuels these conflicts.\n            (5) The United Nations Security Council, acting under \n        chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, has \n        prohibited all states from importing diamonds from, and \n        exporting weapons to, certain countries affected by diamond-\n        related conflicts. Unfortunately, diamond smugglers continue \n        funding rebel movements, and the sanctions have not been \n        sufficiently effective to achieve their goals. In turn, this \n        illicit trade has facilitated trade in narcotics, arms \n        proliferation, regional destabilization, money laundering, and \n        other criminal enterprises. This has severely hampered efforts \n        by the United States to safeguard its citizens from drugs, \n        terrorism, and other threats to the security of the American \n        people.\n            (6) Without effective action to prohibit trade in conflict \n        diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat of \n        a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of \n        countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and \n        penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they \n        employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 20 other \n        countries are involved in working, through the ``Kimberley \n        Process'', toward devising a solution to this problem. As the \n        consumer of two-thirds of the world's supply of diamonds, the \n        United States has an obligation to help sever the link between \n        diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an \n        effective solution.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTATION OF DIAMONDS.\n\n    (a) Restrictions.--\n            (1) Requirements for imported diamonds.--Diamonds may not \n        be imported into the United States unless the country exporting \n        the diamonds to the United States is implementing a system of \n        controls on the export and import of rough diamonds that meets \n        the requirements of paragraph (2), consistent with United \n        Nations General Assembly Resolution 55/56 adopted on December \n        1, 2000, or a future international agreement which implements \n        such controls and to which the United States is a signatory.\n            (2) Requirements for system of controls.--The system of \n        controls referred to in paragraph (1) shall include the \n        following:\n                    (A) Rough diamonds, when exported from the country \n                in which they were extracted, shall be sealed in a \n                secure, transparent container or bag by appropriate \n                government officials of that country.\n                    (B) The sealed container or bag described in \n                subparagraph (A) shall include a fully visible document \n                that--\n                            (i) certifies the country from which the \n                        rough diamonds were extracted;\n                            (ii) records a unique export registration \n                        number for, and the total carat weight and \n                        number of, the rough diamonds in the container \n                        or bag; and\n                            (iii) is issued by the government of that \n                        country.\n                    (C) The country from whose territory the rough \n                diamonds are exported shall establish a database \ncontaining at least the information on exports of rough diamonds \ndescribed in subparagraph (B).\n                    (D) Any country into whose territory the rough \n                diamonds are first imported prior to polishing or other \n                processing--\n                            (i) shall permit importation of the rough \n                        diamonds only in a container or bag described \n                        in subparagraphs (A) and (B); and\n                            (ii) can verify, on the basis of \n                        documentation provided to it by electronic or \n                        other reliable means, the legitimacy of the \n                        export document included in the sealed \n                        container or bag in which the rough diamonds \n                        were shipped, using the database maintained in \n                        the country of export.\n                    (E) Appropriate government authorities shall \n                conduct physical inspections of the sealed containers \n                and bags of rough diamonds to ensure compliance with \n                the requirements of this paragraph.\n    (b) Monitoring.--The President shall ensure that the system of \ncontrols described in subsection (a) is monitored by appropriate \nagencies of the United States.\n    (c) Presidential Advisory Commission.--\n            (1) Purposes.--The President shall appoint an advisory \n        commission, the purposes of which shall be--\n                    (A) to make recommendations to the President on the \n                effectiveness of the monitoring under subsection (b), \n                and on ways to improve such monitoring; and\n                    (B) to develop a labeling system, that could be \n                used by diamond and jewelry vendors, that would certify \n                to consumers that a diamond imported into the United \n                States has been subject to a system of controls on \n                rough diamonds described in subsection (a).\n            (2) Membership.--The advisory commission shall be composed \n        of 11 members, 3 of whom shall be representatives of private \n        voluntary organizations, and 2 of whom shall be representatives \n        of the diamond industry.

NEGOTIATION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the President should take the \nnecessary steps to negotiate an international agreement, working in \nconcert with the Kimberley Process referred to in section 2(6), to \neliminate the trade in diamonds used to support conflict in the country \nor regions in which the diamonds are extracted.
