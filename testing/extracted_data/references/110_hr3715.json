FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds:\n            (1) In 2007, the price of gasoline has risen to record \n        levels in many areas of the United States.\n            (2) Rising gas prices present significant challenges to \n        commuters dependent on cars or other automobiles for \n        transportation to and from their places of employment.\n            (3) Residents of rural areas are particularly affected by \n        increasing gasoline prices given their limited access to public \n        transportation and longer distances between homes and places of \n        employment.\n            (4) The health of economies in many rural areas is \n        particularly susceptible to harm from the increasing price of \n        gasoline.\n            (5) The documented incidence of poverty is higher outside \n        of metropolitan areas than within such areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
