FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the primary duties of government is to protect \n        its citizens from armed violent criminals. America's cherished \n        liberty and the social and economic prosperity of its \n        communities are dependent upon government's ability to maintain \n        public safety.\n            (2) The fulfillment of government's responsibility is not \n        achieved by gun control laws. Criminals, by definition, operate \n        outside the law and routinely acquire firearms when they so \n        desire.\n            (3) The only true effect of gun control laws is to disarm \n        citizens who have no intention of harming others except in the \n        course of self-defense. These laws also have the effect of \n        criminalizing the mere possession of certain types of guns even \n        when such possession is for entirely lawful purposes.\n            (4) The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n        States guarantees citizens the right to possess firearms. This \n        right is grounded in the need for self-defense.\n            (5) People in the United States frequently use firearms to \n        defend themselves because police cannot always protect, and are \n        not legally liable for failing to protect, individual citizens.\n\nSEC. 3. MANDATORY PRISON TERMS FOR POSSESSING, BRANDISHING, OR \n              DISCHARGING A FIREARM OR DESTRUCTIVE DEVICE DURING A \n              STATE CRIME THAT IS A SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONY OR SERIOUS \n              DRUG OFFENSE.\n\n    Section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs \n        (5) and (6), respectively;\n            (2) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n    ``(1) A person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence \nor drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or serious \ndrug trafficking crime which provides for an enhanced punishment if \ncommitted by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for \nwhich the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States--\n            ``(A) possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the \n        sentence imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking \n        crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years;\n            ``(B) brandishes a firearm, shall, in addition to the \n        sentence imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking \n        crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years; or\n            ``(C) discharges a firearm with the intent to injure \n        another person, shall, in addition to the sentence imposed for \n        the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced \n        to imprisonment for 20 years;\nexcept that if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle or short-barreled \nshotgun, such additional sentence shall be imprisonment for 5 years \nmore than the term of imprisonment that would otherwise be imposed \nunder this paragraph, and if the firearm is a machinegun or destructive \ndevice or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, such \nadditional sentence shall be imprisonment for 30 years.\n    ``(2)(A) A person who, during and in relation to a serious violent \nfelony or serious drug offense (including a serious violent felony or \nserious drug offense that provides for an enhanced punishment if \ncommitted by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for \nwhich the person may be prosecuted in a court of any State--\n            ``(i) possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the \n        sentence imposed for the serious violent felony or serious drug \n        offense, be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 5 \n        years;\n            ``(ii) brandishes a firearm, shall, in addition to the \n        sentence imposed for the serious violent felony or serious drug \n        offense, be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 10 \n        years; or\n            ``(iii) discharges a firearm with the intent to injure \n        another person, shall, in addition to the sentence imposed for \n        the serious violent felony or serious drug offense, be \n        sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 20 years;\nexcept that if the firearm is a machinegun or destructive device or is \nequipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, such additional \nsentence shall be imprisonment for not less than 30 years.\n    ``(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the conduct of a person \nin defense of person or property during the course of a crime committed \nby another person (including the arrest or attempted arrest of such \nother person during or immediately after the commission of the crime), \nunless the person engaged in or participated in criminal conduct that \ngave rise to the criminal conduct of such other person.\n    ``(C) It is the intent of the Congress that--\n            ``(i) this paragraph shall be used to supplement but not \n        supplant the efforts of State and local prosecutors in \n        prosecuting serious violent felonies and serious drug offenses \n        that could be prosecuted under State law; and\n            ``(ii) the Attorney General shall give due deference to the \n        interest that a State or local prosecutor has in prosecuting a \n        person under State law.\n    ``(3) In the case of the second or subsequent conviction of a \nperson under this subsection--\n            ``(A) if the person possessed a firearm during and in \n        relation to such second or subsequent crime of violence, drug \n        trafficking crime, serious violent felony, or serious drug \n        offense, the person shall, in addition to the sentence imposed \n        for such second or subsequent offense, be sentenced to \n        imprisonment for not less than 20 years;\n            ``(B) if the person brandished a firearm during and in \n        relation to such second or subsequent crime of violence, drug \n        trafficking crime, serious violent felony, or serious drug \n        offense, the person shall, in addition to the sentence imposed \n        for such second or subsequent offense, be sentenced to \n        imprisonment for not less than 25 years;

and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(7) For purposes of this subsection, the term `serious violent \nfelony' shall have the meaning given such term by section \n3559(c)(2)(F)(i).\n    ``(8) For purposes of this subsection, the term `serious drug \noffense' means an offense under State law that, had the offense been \nprosecuted in a court of the United States, would have been punishable \nunder section 401(b)(1)(B) or section 408 of the Controlled Substances \nAct (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(B), 848), or section 1010(b)(2) of the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960(b)(2)).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
