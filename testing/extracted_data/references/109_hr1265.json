SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Abandoned Hardrock \nMines Reclamation Funding Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Through various laws and policies, including the Act of \n        May 10, 1872 (commonly known as the General Mining Law of 1872; \n        30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), the Federal Government has encouraged \n        the development of gold, silver, and other mineral resources, \n        especially in the western States, and development of these \n        resources has helped create a strong economy and provided \n        needed materials for many critical products and services.\n            (2) However, historically mining activities have occurred \n        in recurrent cycles of ``boom'' followed by ``bust'', with many \n        mines left inactive or abandoned at the end of each cycle.\n            (3) As a result of this history, the United States has been \n        left an unwelcome legacy of inactive or abandoned mines, \n        including thousands of such mines in the western States.\n            (4) Many of these inactive or abandoned mines pose safety \n        hazards to the public, and the drainage and runoff from such \n        mines has damaged thousands of stream miles to the detriment of \n        water quality, particularly in several western States.\n            (5) The environmental cleanup of these inactive or \n        abandoned mines is hampered by lack of funding. Federal and \n        State agencies and Indian tribes are often unable to afford to \n        make cleanup of these mine sites a high priority.\n            (6) It is in the national interest to facilitate the \n        cleanup of inactive or abandoned mines through appropriate \n        legislation that reduces this obstacle.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate cleanup of \ninactive and abandoned mine sites by establishing a source of funding \nfor that purpose.\n\nSEC. 2.
