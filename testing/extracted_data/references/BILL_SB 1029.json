It is in the interest of the people that state and local agencies utilize technological opportunities to provide transparency to the public.\n(c) State and local agencies should adopt comprehensive written debt management policies pursuant to the recommendation of the Government Finance Officers Association, a professional organization of over 18,000 public officials united to enhance and promote the professional management of governmental financial resources. These policies should reflect local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n(d) It is the intent of the Legislature that all debt issuance of state and of local governments be published in a single, transparent online database that allows the citizens of California to analyze, interpret, and understand how debt authorized by the public is utilized to finance facilities and services at the state and local level.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 8855 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n8855.\n(a) There is created the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission, consisting of nine members, selected as follows:\n(1) The Treasurer, or his or her designee.\n(2) The Governor or the Director of Finance.\n(3) The Controller, or his or her designee.\n(4) Two local government finance officers appointed by the Treasurer, one each from among persons employed by a county and by a city or a city and county of this state, experienced in the issuance and sale of municipal bonds and nominated by associations affiliated with these agencies.\n(5) Two Members of the Assembly appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly.\n(6) Two Members of the Senate appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules.\n(b) (1) The term of office of an appointed member is four years, but appointed members serve at the pleasure of the appointing power.
