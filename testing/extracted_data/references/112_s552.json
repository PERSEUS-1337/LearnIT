    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Deficit Reduction Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate finds the following:\n            (1) At a time when our Nation has a $14.2 trillion national \n        debt and a $1.6 trillion annual deficit, moving aggressively \n        toward deficit reduction means that we must include not only \n        well-targeted budget cuts, but revenue raised in a fair and \n        economically just way. Questions every Member of Congress \n        should be asking are the following:\n                    (A) Do we ask the highest paid executives on Wall \n                Street to give up a $1 million a year tax break, or do \n                we ask senior citizens to go cold in the winter by \n                cutting the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program?\n                    (B) Do we ask Exxon Mobil and other big oil \n                companies to give up their tax breaks, or do we ask \n                over 9 million college students to go further into debt \n                by cutting Pell Grants by $5.7 billion?\n                    (C) Do we stop cutting taxes for the richest 400 \n                American families, who earned an average of $345 \n                million in 2007, or do we delay Social Security \n                benefits to 500,000 Americans by a $1.7 billion cut in \n                the Social Security Administration?\n                    (D) Do we establish an emergency deficit reduction \n                surtax on millionaires and billionaires, or do we deny \n                over 200,000 little children the opportunity to enroll \n                in Head Start by cutting this program by $1.1 billion?\n                    (E) Do we finally tax hedge fund managers who make \n                at least $1 billion at a higher rate than police \n                officers, teachers, firefighters, and nurses, or will \n                11 million Americans be denied access to quality \n                primary healthcare by a $1.3 billion cut in community \n                health centers?\n            (2) At a time when the wealthiest people in this country \n        are doing phenomenally well, when the effective Federal tax \n        rates for the richest Americans are the lowest on record, and \n        when the top 2 percent of taxpayers have received hundreds of \n        billions of dollars in tax breaks in recent years, it would be \n        morally wrong for the United States Congress to move towards a \n        balanced budget on the backs of the middle class, the elderly, \n        the sick, and the most vulnerable people in our society while \n        asking nothing of the highest income earners and most \n        profitable corporations.\n            (3) Creating an emergency deficit reduction surtax on \n        income over $1 million will reduce the deficit in a fair and \n        economically just way by increasing revenue from those who can \n        afford it the most.\n            (4) From 2000 to 2010, the 5 largest oil companies in the \n        United States made nearly $1 trillion in profits, yet some of \n        them paid nothing in Federal income taxes in recent years. \n        Ending outdated and unnecessary tax credits, deductions, and \n        subsidies for big oil companies is a fair and economically just \n        way to raise revenue and reduce the deficit.\n            (5) In the midst of the worst recession since the Great \n        Depression, America's middle class and working families have \n        already paid a very heavy price in terms of lost jobs, lost \n        homes, lost wages, and lost opportunity. The time has come to \n        ask the wealthiest in our society and the most profitable \n        corporations in America to help our Nation address its deficit \n        crisis. Any deficit reduction package must include raising \n        revenue from the wealthy and eliminating tax breaks for big oil \n        companies.\n\nSEC. 3.
