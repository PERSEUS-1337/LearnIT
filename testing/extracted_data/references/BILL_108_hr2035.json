FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the crime of identity theft has become one of the major \n        law enforcement challenges of the new economy, as vast \n        quantities of sensitive, personal information are now \n        vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;\n            (2) according to the Attorney General, ``in addition to the \n        credit card and financial fraud crimes often committed, \n        identity theft is a major facilitator of international \n        terrorism'';\n            (3) a number of indicators reveal that, despite increased \n        public awareness of the crime, the incidents of identity theft \n        continue to rise;\n            (4) 1,000,000 consumers annually call the Fraud Victim \n        Assistance Department of one national consumer reporting \n        agency, a number that almost doubled from 1997 to 2001;\n            (5) between January and December of 2002, the complaint \n        database operated by the Federal Trade Commission received \n        380,103 consumer fraud and identity theft complaints, with \n        reported losses from fraud of more than $343,000,000;\n            (6) allegations of identity theft reported to the fraud \n        hotline of the Social Security Administration increased from \n        11,058 in fiscal year 1998 to 46,480 in fiscal year 2000;\n            (7) in its fiscal year 2000 annual report, the Postal \n        Inspection Service noted that identity theft is a growing trend \n        and the agency's investigations of such crimes has ``increased \n        by 67 percent since last year'';\n            (8) an integral part of many identity crimes involves the \n        interception of personal financial data or the fraudulent \n        acquisition of credit cards and other financial products in \n        another person's name;\n            (9) identity theft is an act that violates the privacy of \n        our citizens and ruins their good names, victims can suffer \n        restricted access to credit and diminished employment \n        opportunities, and may spend years repairing damage to credit \n        histories;\n            (10) the resources available to identity theft victims are \n        inadequate, and both private sector and Federal agencies should \n        provide better and more sympathetic assistance to such victims; \n        and\n            (11) credit reporting agencies and issuers of credit should \n        have uniform reporting requirements and effective fraud alerts \n        to assist identity theft victims in repairing and protecting \n        their credit.\n\nSEC. 3.
