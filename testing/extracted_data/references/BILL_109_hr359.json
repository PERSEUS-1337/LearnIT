TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS IMPORT \n              TERMINALS.\n\n    (a) Exportation or Importation of Natural Gas.--Section 3 of the \nNatural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) is amended to read as follows:\n\n              ``exportation or importation of natural gas\n\n    ``Sec. 3. (a) Authorization Order.--No person shall export any \nnatural gas from the United States to a foreign country or import any \nnatural gas from a foreign country without first having secured an \norder of the Secretary of Energy authorizing such person to do so.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall issue such order \nupon application, unless, after opportunity for hearing, it finds that \nthe proposed siting, construction, expansion, or operation will not be \nconsistent with the public interest. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission may by its order grant such application, in whole or in \npart, with such modification and upon such terms and conditions as the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission may find necessary or appropriate.\n    ``(2) An order issued pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not be \nconditioned on--\n            ``(A) a requirement that the liquefied natural gas import \n        terminal offer service to persons other than the person \n        securing the order;\n            ``(B) any regulation of the liquefied natural gas import \n        terminal's rates, charges, terms, or conditions of service; or\n            ``(C) a requirement to file with the Federal Energy \n        Regulatory Commission schedules or contracts related to the \n        liquefied natural gas import terminal's rates, charges, terms, \n        or conditions of service.\n    ``(3) Except as otherwise provided by Federal law, no State or \nlocal government may require a permit, license, concurrence, approval, \ncertificate, or other form of authorization with respect to the siting, \nconstruction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import \nterminal.\n    ``(4) Any decision made or action taken by a Federal administrative \nagency or officer (or State administrative agency or officer acting \nunder delegated Federal authority) with respect to the siting, \nconstruction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import \nterminal must be consistent with any authorization provided by the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to this subsection with \nrespect to the liquefied natural gas import terminal, and shall not \nprohibit or unreasonably delay the siting, construction, expansion, or \noperation.\n    ``(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to repeal or \nmodify the authority under this section to authorize a person to import \nor export natural gas or to authorize facilities for the import or \nexport of natural gas other than liquefied natural gas import \nterminals.\n    ``(e) Schedule and Administrative Record.--(1) The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission shall approve or deny any application to site, \nconstruct, expand, or operate a liquefied natural gas import terminal \nunder subsection (d) not later than 1 year after the application is \ncomplete.\n    ``(2) With respect to each application under subsection (d), the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission shall establish a schedule for all \nFederal and State administrative proceedings commenced under authority \nof Federal law, the completion of which is required before a person may \nsite, construct, expand, or operate the liquefied natural gas import \nterminal, in order to ensure expeditious progress toward such siting, \nconstruction, expansion, or operation. The schedule shall also include \nall Federal and State administrative proceedings authorized by Federal \nlaw for the siting, construction, expansion, and operation of natural \ngas pipelines and facilities related to the transportation of liquefied \nnatural gas or natural gas from the liquefied natural gas import \nterminal. In establishing the schedule, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission shall, to the extent practicable, accommodate the applicable \nschedules established by Federal law for such proceedings. If a Federal \nor State administrative agency or officer fails to complete a \nproceeding in accordance with the schedule established by the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, the action of the Federal or State \nadministrative agency or officer that is required before a person may \nsite, construct, expand, or operate the liquefied natural gas import \nterminal shall be conclusively presumed and the siting, construction, \nexpansion, or operation shall proceed without condition.\n    ``(3) With respect to the siting, construction, expansion, or \noperation of a liquefied natural gas import terminal, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission shall compile a single administrative \nrecord which shall consolidate the records of the proceedings referred \nto in paragraph (2).\n    ``(4) Any Federal administrative proceeding that is an appeal or \nreview of a decision made or action taken by a Federal administrative \nagency or officer (or State administrative agency or officer acting \nunder delegated Federal authority) with respect to the siting, \nconstruction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import \nterminal shall use as its exclusive record for all purposes the \nadministrative record compiled by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission under paragraph (3).\n    ``(f) Judicial Review.--(1) Except for review by the Supreme Court \nof the United States on writ of certiorari, the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall have original and \nexclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil action for \nreview of a decision made or action taken by a Federal administrative \nagency or officer (or State administrative agency or officer acting \nunder delegated Federal authority) with respect to the siting, \nconstruction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import \nterminal. The civil action shall be filed not later than 60 days after \nthe decision or action described in this paragraph.\n    ``(2) If a civil action referred to in paragraph (1) is filed, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission shall file in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit the single \nadministrative record compiled under subsection (e)(3) with respect to \nthe liquefied natural gas import terminal named in the civil action.\n    ``(g) Lead Agency.--With respect to the siting, construction, \nexpansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas import terminal, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission shall be the lead Federal agency \nfor purposes of complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of \n1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).''.\n    (b) Definition.--Section 2 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717a) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(11) `Liquefied natural gas import terminal' includes all \n        facilities located onshore or in State waters that are used to \n        receive, unload, store, transport, gasify, or process liquefied \n        natural gas that is imported to the United States from a \n        foreign country, but does not include the tankers used to \n        deliver liquefied natural gas to such facilities.''."
