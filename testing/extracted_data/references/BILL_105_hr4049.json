FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal regulations advance many important goals, \n        including protecting the environment and the health and safety \n        of all Americans.\n            (2) For regulations to effectively protect the public and \n        promote the public interest, the fact of their existence and \n        what they mean must be available to the persons and entities \n        willing to investigate what the law and regulations require.\n            (3) Fairness also requires that a person should be able to \n        learn of regulations and of their meanings before they can be \n        sanctioned for violating them.\n            (4) Fairness also should prevent a person from being \n        sanctioned for violating a regulation if an official has \n        mislead the person as to what the regulation prohibits or \n        requires and the person has reasonably relied upon such \n        misleading information.\n            (5) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment gives \n        Americans a right to have access to regulations and the \n        opportunity to learn their meanings before such regulations can \n        be the basis for depriving them of life, liberty, or property.\n            (6) Effective procedures for protecting this right can \n        improve the effectiveness of regulation, foster the sense that \n        regulations are fairly enforced, and ensure that the right to \n        due process actually benefits Americans.\n            (7) Ensuring that agencies give Americans access to \n        regulations and the opportunity to learn their meanings and \n        accurate information about them before any sanction can be \n        imposed will encourage agencies to make regulatory requirements \n        clearly known, will encourage people and entities to learn what \n        regulations require of them, and will foster legality, \n        fairness, and justice in the enforcement of Federal \n        regulations.\n\nSEC. 3.
