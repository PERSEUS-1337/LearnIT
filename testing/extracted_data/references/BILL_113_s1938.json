FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the President's Council of Advisors on Science and \n        Technology recommends that the United States develop a \n        Governmentwide Federal energy policy and update the policy \n        regularly with strategic Quadrennial Energy Reviews similar to \n        the reviews conducted by the Department of Defense;\n            (2) as the lead agency in support of energy science and \n        technology innovation, the Department of Energy has conducted a \n        Quadrennial Technology Review of the energy technology policies \n        and programs of the Department;\n            (3) the Quadrennial Technology Review of the Department of \n        Energy serves as the basis for coordination with other agencies \n        and on other programs for which the Department has a key role;\n            (4) a Quadrennial Energy Review would--\n                    (A) establish integrated, Governmentwide national \n                energy objectives in the context of economic, \n                environmental, and security priorities;\n                    (B) coordinate actions across Federal agencies;\n                    (C) identify the resources needed for the \n                invention, adoption, and diffusion of energy \n                technologies; and\n                    (D) provide a strong analytical base for Federal \n                energy policy decisions;\n            (5) a Quadrennial Energy Review should be established \n        taking into account estimated Federal budgetary resources;\n            (6) the development of an energy policy resulting from a \n        Quadrennial Energy Review would--\n                    (A) enhance the energy security of the United \n                States;\n                    (B) create jobs; and\n                    (C) mitigate environmental harm; and\n            (7) while a Quadrennial Energy Review will be a product of \n        the executive branch, the review will have substantial input \n        from--\n                    (A) Congress;\n                    (B) the energy industry;\n                    (C) academia;\n                    (D) nongovernmental organizations; and\n                    (E) the public.\n\nSEC. 3.
