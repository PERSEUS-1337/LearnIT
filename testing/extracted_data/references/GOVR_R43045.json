    "content": "The ADEA prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee or applicant for employment because the individual has opposed any practice made unlawful by section 4 of the ADEA or because the individual has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under the ADEA. The ADEA also prohibits such actions when committed by an employment agency against any individual, and by a labor organization against a member or applicant for membership. An individual who believes that he or she has been discriminated against in violation of the ADEA's anti-retaliation provisions may file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred. Upon receiving the charge, the EEOC will seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practices by informal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion. Yes. If the EEOC does not commence an action to enforce the rights of the aggrieved person, such individual may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of the ADEA. A court may award such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the ADEA, including without limitation judgments compelling employment, reinstatement, or promotion, or enforcing the liability for amounts deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation. Adopted 1967. ARRA prohibits a non-federal employer that receives covered funds from discharging or otherwise discriminating against an employee who discloses to the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (Board), an inspector general, a Member of Congress, or specified others, information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of (1) gross mismanagement of an agency contract or grant related to covered funds; (2) a gross waste of covered funds; (3) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety related to the implementation or use of covered funds; (4) an abuse of authority related to the implementation or use of covered funds; or (5) a violation of law, rule, or regulation involving an agency contract or grant related to covered funds. A person who believes that he or she has been subject to a reprisal prohibited by ARRA's whistleblower provisions may submit a complaint to the appropriate inspector general (IG). Although the IG retains discretion to not investigate complaints, it appears that an inspection will be conducted unless the IG determines that the complaint is frivolous, does not relate to covered funds, or another federal or state judicial or administrative proceeding has been invoked to resolve the complaint. Upon completion of the investigation, the IG will submit findings to the complainant, the employer, the head of the appropriate agency, and the Board. Within 30 days of receiving the findings, the head of the agency concerned will determine whether there is sufficient basis to conclude that the non-federal employer has subjected the complainant to a prohibited reprisal. The agency head will either issue an order denying relief, or take one or more of the following actions: (1) order the employer to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal; (2) order reinstatement with back pay; (3) order the employer to pay an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses that were reasonably incurred by the complainant. Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order may obtain review in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in which the reprisal is alleged to have occurred. Yes. If the head of an agency issues an order denying relief, has not issued an order within 210 days after the submission of a complaint, or the IG decides not to investigate or discontinues an investigation, and there is no showing that the delay or decision is because of the bad faith of the complainant, the complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against the employer in the appropriate federal district court. In a de novo action, a prevailing employee may be awarded compensatory damages, as well as reinstatement with back pay and an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses that were reasonably incurred. Adopted 2009. See P.L. 111-5 , \u00a71553, 123 Stat. 297 (2009). Sponsor: Representative David R. Obey Cosponsors: 9 House: Conference report agreed to in House.

Record Vote Number: 64 . The ADA prohibits discrimination against any individual because he or she has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by the ADA or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the ADA. A person alleging discrimination under the ADA's anti-retaliation provisions may file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. Upon receipt of the charge, the EEOC will conduct an investigation. If the EEOC determines after the investigation that there is not reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, it will dismiss the charge and notify the claimant and respondent of its action. If reasonable cause is found, the EEOC will attempt to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. The EEOC will make its determination as promptly as possible and, so far as practicable, no later than 120 days from the filing of the charge or, in specified circumstances, the date upon which the EEOC is authorized to take action with respect to the charge. If the EEOC is unable to secure from the respondent an acceptable conciliation agreement, it may bring a civil action against the respondent, so long as the respondent is not a government, governmental agency, or political subdivision. In cases involving such entities, the EEOC will refer the case to the Attorney General, who may bring a civil action in the appropriate federal district court. Yes. If the EEOC dismisses a charge, a civil action is not filed by the EEOC or the Attorney General, or if the EEOC has not entered into a conciliation agreement involving the aggrieved party, such person may file a civil action in any judicial district in the state in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, in the judicial district in which the relevant employment records are maintained or administered, or in the judicial district in which the person would have worked but for the alleged practice. If the respondent is not found in any of these districts, the action may be brought in the judicial district in which the respondent has its principal office. If a court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice, it may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, including reinstatement or any other equitable relief. A reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses and costs, may be awarded. Adopted 1990. The AHERA prohibits an employer, including a state or local education agency, from discharging or otherwise discriminating against an employee for providing information related to a potential violation of its provisions to any other person, including a state or the federal government. An employee or representative of employees who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against in violation of the AHERA's whistleblower provisions may apply to the Secretary of Labor for a review of the termination or alleged discrimination within 90 days after the alleged violation occurs. The review will be conducted in accordance with section 660(c) of Title 29, U.S. Code. Under section 660(c), the Secretary will institute an investigation as he deems appropriate. If the Secretary determines that a violation has occurred, he will bring an action in any appropriate federal district court. No. A federal district court that finds a violation of the AHERA may order all appropriate relief including reinstatement with back pay. Adopted 1986. The CAA prohibits an employer from discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employee because the employee (1) commenced or is about to commence a proceeding under the CAA or a proceeding for the administration or enforcement of any requirement imposed by the CAA; (2) testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding; or (3) assisted or participated, or is about to assist or participate, in any manner in such a proceeding. Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against in violation of the CAA may, within 30 days after such violation occurs, file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Upon receipt of the complaint, the Secretary will conduct an investigation and within 30 days of the receiving the complaint, shall notify the complainant and the alleged violator with the results of the investigation. Within 90 days of receipt of the complaint, the Secretary will issue an order either providing relief or denying the complaint. Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under the CAA's whistleblower provisions may obtain review of the order in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred. The petition for review must be filed within 60 days from the issuance of the Secretary's order, and the commencement of proceedings shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Secretary's order. No. If the Secretary determines that a violation has occurred, the Secretary will order the person who committed such violation to (1) take affirmative action to abate the violation, and (2) reinstate the complainant to his or her former position with compensation, including back pay, terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. The Secretary may order the payment of compensatory damages to the complainant. If an order is issued, at the request of the complainant, the Secretary will assess against the person against whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses, including attorneys' and expert witness fees, reasonably incurred by the complainant in bringing the complaint. Adopted 1977. The CMVSA prohibits an employer from discharging, disciplining, or discriminating against an employee regarding pay, terms, or privileges of employment because the employee (1) filed a complaint or instituted a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security regulation, standard, or order, or testified or will testify in such a proceeding; (2) is perceived to have filed or instituted a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security regulation, standard, or order; (3) refuses to operate a vehicle because the operation violates a regulation, standard, or order related to commercial motor vehicle safety, health, or security, or has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury because of the vehicle's hazardous safety or security condition; (4) has accurately reported hours on duty; (5) has cooperated or is perceived as being about to cooperate with a safety or security investigation by the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the National Transportation Security Board; or (6) has furnished or is perceived to have furnished specified information to the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the National Transportation Security Board, or any federal, state, or local regulatory or law enforcement agency. An employee alleging discharge, discipline, or discrimination in violation of the CMVSA's anti-retaliation provisions may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within 180 days after the alleged violation occurred. Within 60 days of receiving the complaint, the Secretary will conduct an investigation, decide whether it is reasonable to believe the complaint has merit, and notify the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation of the findings. If the Secretary determines that it is reasonable to believe that the violation occurred, he will include with the decision findings and a preliminary order that provides for affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement, and compensatory damages, including back pay. The parties may object to the findings or order, and request a hearing within 30 days of the date of notification of the findings. If a hearing is not requested, the preliminary order is final and not subject to judicial review. A hearing will be conducted expeditiously, and not later than 120 days after the end of the hearing, the Secretary will issue a final order. A person adversely affected by the order may file a petition for review in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation occurred or the person resided on the date of the violation. The petition for review must be filed no later than 60 days after the order is issued. Yes. If the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 210 days after the filing of a complaint and the delay is not because of the employee's bad faith, the employee may bring an original action at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate federal district court. A prevailing employee is entitled to affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement, and compensatory damages, including back pay. Relief may also include punitive damages in an amount not to exceed $250,000. Adopted 1994. Amended 2007. See P.L. 110-53 , \u00a7 1536, 121 Stat. 464 (2007). Sponsor: Representative Bennie G.

Upon receipt of such application, the Secretary will institute an investigation and upon receiving the investigation report, make findings of fact. If the Secretary finds that a violation occurred, he will issue a decision, incorporating an order that requires the party committing the violation to take such affirmative action to abate the violation as the Secretary deems appropriate, including reinstatement with compensation.

If the Secretary concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, he will also issue a preliminary order that provides for affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with back pay, and compensatory damages. Either party may file objections to the Secretary's findings or order and request a hearing within 30 days after receiving his notification. If a hearing is not requested in the 30-day period, the preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is not subject to judicial review.

Employers who willfully violate the FLSA's anti-retaliation provisions may be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned up to six months. Employers who retaliate against employees in violation of this provision shall be liable for legal and equitable relief, including, without limitation, reinstatement, the payment of lost wages, and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages. The court will, in addition to any judgment awarded, allow reasonable attorneys' fees to be paid to the plaintiff, as well as the costs of the action. Adopted 1938. The FMLA prohibits an employer from discharging or otherwise discriminating against any individual because he or she (1) has opposed any practice made unlawful by the FMLA; (2) has filed a charge, or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to the FMLA; (3) has given or is about to give any information in connection with any inquiry or proceeding related to any right provided under the FMLA; or (4) has testified or is about to testify in any inquiry or proceeding related to any right provided under the FMLA. The Secretary of Labor will receive, investigate, and attempt to resolve complaints that allege violations of the FMLA's anti-retaliation provisions, and may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction. Yes. An aggrieved employee may bring an action to recover damages or obtain equitable relief in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction. In cases other than those involving a willful violation, an action must be brought within two years of the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation. In cases involving a willful violation, an action must be brought within three years of the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation. An employer that violates the FMLA's anti-retaliation provisions will be liable for damages equal to the following: (1) the amount of any wages, salary, benefits, or other compensation lost because of the violation, or, if there has been no such loss, the amount of any actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, such as the cost of providing care, up to a sum equal to 12 weeks of wages or salary; (2) the interest on the aforementioned amount; and (3) an additional amount as liquidated damages. The employer will also be liable for such equitable relief as may be appropriate, including reinstatement. Adopted 1993. Applicants and employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are protected from retaliatory personnel actions taken because the employee disclosed information to the Attorney General that the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. According to regulations promulgated under the statute, an FBI employee who believes that a retaliatory personnel action has been taken may report the alleged reprisal to the FBI's Investigative Offices. Within 15 calendar days of receipt, the office conducting the investigation (Conducting Office) shall provide written notice of receipt of the allegation to the person who made it (the complainant) and shall conduct an investigation to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a reprisal has been or will be taken. Within 90 days of providing such notice to the complainant, and at least every 60 calendar days thereafter, the Conducting Office shall notify the complainant of the status of the investigation. Within 240 days of receiving the allegation, the office will determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a retaliatory personnel action has been or will be taken, unless the complainant agrees to an extension.  No. If the Conducting Office determines there are reasonable grounds to believe that a reprisal has been taken, it will report this to the Director of the Office of Attorney Recruitment and Management, Department of Justice (Director) along with recommendations for corrective action. The Conducting Office may request the Director to order a stay of any personnel action for 45 calendar days, which may be extended.  Within 60 days of being notified that an investigation has ended\u2014or at any time after 120 days from the date that the complainant first reported the alleged reprisal, if the complainant has not been notified by the Conducting Office that it will seek corrective action\u2014the complainant may request corrective action directly to the Director. In such cases, the complainant may request the Director to order a stay of any personnel action allegedly taken or to be taken in reprisal for a protected disclosure.  Based upon all the evidence, the Director will determine whether a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. If the Director makes such a determination, the Director will order corrective action unless the FBI demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. Corrective action may include placing the complainant, as nearly as possible, in the position he would have been in had the reprisal not taken place; reimbursement for attorney's fees, reasonable costs, medical costs incurred, and travel expenses; back pay and related benefits; and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages. Adopted 1978. The FDA Modernization Act amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit an entity engaged in the manufacture, processing, packing, transporting, distribution, reception, holding, or importation of food from discharging or otherwise discriminating against an employee with respect to the individual's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee (1) provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide or cause to be provided information relating to a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to the employer, the federal government, or the attorney general of a state; (2) testified or is about to testify in a proceeding concerning the violation; (3) assisted or participated or is about to assist or participate in a proceeding concerning the violation; or (4) objected to, or refused to participate in any activity that the employee believed to be in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. An individual who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against in violation of the relevant whistleblower provisions may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within 180 days after the date on which the violation occurs. Within 60 days of receiving the complaint, the Secretary will initiate an investigation and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has merit. If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists, he will accompany his findings with a preliminary order that requires the person who committed the violation to take affirmative action to abate the violation, to reinstate the complainant with back pay, and to provide compensatory damages. The person alleged to have committed the violation or the complainant may file objections to the findings or the order and request a hearing. A final order must be issued by the Secretary within 120 days after the date of the hearing's conclusion. Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order may obtain review in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of the violation. A petition for review must be filed no later than 60 days after the date of the issuance of the final order. Yes. If the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 210 days after the filing of the complaint, or within 90 days after receiving a written determination, the complainant may bring an action at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate federal district court having jurisdiction.

The parties may object to the findings or order, and request a hearing within 60 days of the date of notification of the findings. If a hearing is not requested within the 60-day period, the preliminary order will be deemed a final order that is not subject to judicial review. If a hearing is requested, the Secretary will issue a final order no later than 90 days after the date of the hearing. Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the Secretary's final order may obtain review of the order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of the violation. The petition for review must be filed no later than 60 days after the date of issuance of the final order. Yes. Under section 60121(a) of title 49, U.S. Code, a person may bring a civil action in an appropriate federal district court for an injunction against another person for a violation of chapter 601, title 49, U.S. Code. The PSIA's whistleblower provisions are codified in chapter 601. Under the PSIA's whistleblower provisions, a prevailing employee is entitled to affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with back pay, and compensatory damages. Injunctive relief is available for actions brought under section 60121(a) of title 49, U.S. Code. Adopted 2002. See P.L. 107-355 , \u00a7 6(a), 116 Stat. 2989 (2002).

The SDWA prohibits an employer from firing, or in any other way discriminating against, or causing to be fired or discriminated against, any employee because such employee filed, instituted, or caused to be filed or instituted any proceeding under the SDWA or has testified or is about to testify in any proceeding resulting from the administration or enforcement of the SDWA. Any employee who believes that he or she has been fired or otherwise discriminated against in violation of the SDWA's anti-retaliation provisions may, within 30 days after such alleged violation occurs, file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Upon receiving the complaint, the Secretary will conduct an investigation and notify the complainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation of the investigation results. Within 90 days of receiving the complaint, the Secretary will issue an order that either denies the complaint or provides affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with back pay, compensatory damages, and, where appropriate, exemplary damages. An order will be made on the record after notice and an opportunity for agency hearing. Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order may obtain review in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred. A petition for review must be filed within 60 days from the issuance of the order. No. A prevailing employee is entitled to affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with back pay, compensatory damages, and, where appropriate, exemplary damages. At the request of the complainant, the Secretary will assess against the person who committed the violation a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred by the complainant in connection with the complaint. Adopted 1974. SOX prohibits publicly traded companies, including any subsidiaries or affiliates whose financial information is included in the consolidated financial statements of such companies, and nationally recognized statistical rating organizations from discharging, demoting, suspending, threatening, harassing, or in any other manner discriminating against an employee because such employee provided information, caused information to be provided, otherwise assisted in an investigation, or filed, testified, or participated in a proceeding regarding any conduct that the employee reasonably believes is a violation of SOX, any SEC rule or regulation, or any federal statute relating to fraud against shareholders, when the information or assistance is provided to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, any Member or committee of Congress, or a person with supervisory authority over the employee or investigative authority for the employer, regarding any violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1344 ( bank fraud), 1348 (securities fraud against shareholders), or any SEC rule or regulation, or of any federal law regarding fraud against shareholders. Any employee who alleges discharge or other discrimination in violation of SOX's whistleblower provisions may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, using procedures set forth in section 42121(b) of title 49, U.S. Code. (These procedures are discussed below in the Enforcement section for the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act of the 21 st Century.) SOX indicates, however, that a complaint must be filed within 180 days after the date on which the violation occurs, or 180 days after the date on which the employee became aware of the violation. Yes. If the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days of the filing of a complaint and there is no showing that the delay is because of the claimant's bad faith, the claimant may bring an action at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate federal district court. A prevailing employee may be awarded all relief necessary to make the individual whole, including reinstatement with back pay and interest, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination.

A seaman may file a complaint in the same manner as a complaint may be filed under section 31105(b) of title 49, U.S. Code. The procedures, requirements, and rights described in section 31105, including those providing for the judicial review of final orders, also apply to whistleblower claims under the SPA. (Section 31105 is discussed in the Enforcement section for the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act.) Yes. Pursuant to section 31105(c) of title 49, U.S. Code, a seaman may bring an original action at law or equity for de novo review in an appropriate federal district court if the Secretary of Labor has not issued a final decision within 210 days after the filing of the complaint and if the delay is not the result of the seaman's bad faith. Pursuant to section 31105(b) of title 49, U.S. Code, a prevailing seaman is entitled to affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with back pay, and compensatory damages. Relief may also include punitive damages in an amount not to exceed $250,000. Adopted 1984. Amended 2002. See P.L. 107-295 , \u00a7 428, 116 Stat. 2127 (2002). Sponsor: Senator Ernest F.

The SWDA prohibits an employer from firing, or in any other way discriminating against, or causing to be fired or discriminated against, any employee because such employee filed, instituted, or caused to be filed or instituted any proceeding under the SWDA, or has testified or is about to testify in any proceeding resulting from the administration or enforcement of the SWDA. Any employee who believes that he or she has been fired or otherwise discriminated against in violation of the SWDA's anti-retaliation provisions may, within 30 days after such alleged violation occurs, apply to the Secretary of Labor for a review of the firing or alleged discrimination. Upon receipt of such application, the Secretary will institute an investigation as he deems appropriate. Following the receipt of the investigation report, the Secretary will make findings of fact. If he finds that a violation did occur, the Secretary will issue a decision, incorporating an order and findings, and require the party committing the violation to take such affirmative action to abate the violation as the Secretary deems appropriate, including the rehiring or reinstatement of the employee with compensation. If the Secretary finds no violation, he will issue an order denying the application; such order shall be subject to judicial review in the same manner as orders and decisions are subject to judicial review under the SWDA. No. A prevailing employee is entitled to such affirmative action to abate the violation as the Secretary deems appropriate, including rehiring or reinstatement with compensation. Whenever an order is issued, at the request of the applicant, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, to have been reasonably incurred by the applicant, will be assessed against the person who committed the violation. Adopted 1976. The SMCRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way discriminating against or causing to be fired or discriminated against any employee because such employee has filed, instituted, or caused to be filed or instituted any proceeding under the SMCRA. Any employee who has testified or is about to testify in any such proceedings is also protected from such retaliatory action. An employee who believes that he or she has been fired or otherwise discriminated against in violation of the SMCRA's anti-retaliation provisions may, within 30 days, apply to the Secretary of Labor for a review of such firing or alleged discrimination. Upon receipt of the complaint, the Secretary will initiate an investigation as he deems appropriate. The Secretary will make findings of act after receiving a report of the investigation. If the Secretary determines that a violation occurred, he will issue a decision incorporating the findings and an order that requires the party committing the violation to take such affirmative action to abate the violation as the Secretary deems appropriate, including the rehiring or reinstatement of the employee with compensation. If the Secretary finds that no violation occurred, he will issue a finding. Orders issued by the Secretary are subject to judicial review in the same manner as other orders and decisions of the Secretary are subject to judicial review under the SMCRA. No. A prevailing employee is entitled to such affirmative action to abate the violation as the Secretary deems appropriate, including the rehiring or reinstatement of the employee with compensation. Whenever an order is issued to abate a violation, at the request of the applicant, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, determined to have been reasonably incurred by the applicant in connection with the institution and prosecution of such proceedings, will be assessed against the person who committed the violation. Adopted 1977. Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating against any employee or applicant for employment because he or she has (1) opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by Title VII; or (2) made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII. Title VII also prohibits such actions when committed by an employment agency or joint labor-management committee against an individual, or labor organization against a member or applicant for membership. A person alleging discrimination under Title VII's anti-retaliation provisions may file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. Upon receipt of the charge, the EEOC will conduct an investigation. If the EEOC determines after the investigation that there is not reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, it will dismiss the charge and notify the claimant and respondent of its action. If reasonable cause is found, the EEOC will attempt to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. The EEOC will make its determination as promptly as possible and, so far as practicable, no later than 120 days from the filing of the charge or, in specified circumstances, the date upon which the EEOC is authorized to take action with respect to the charge. If the EEOC is unable to secure from the respondent an acceptable conciliation agreement, it may bring a civil action against the respondent, so long as the respondent is not a government, governmental agency, or political subdivision. In cases involving such entities, the EEOC will refer the case to the Attorney General, who may bring a civil action in the appropriate federal district court. Yes. If the EEOC dismisses a charge, a civil action is not filed by the EEOC or the Attorney General, or if the EEOC has not entered into a conciliation agreement involving the aggrieved party, such person may file a civil action in any judicial district in the state in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, in the judicial district in which the relevant employment records are maintained or administered, or in the judicial district in which the person would have worked but for the alleged practice. If the respondent is not found in any of these districts, the action may be brought in the judicial district in which the respondent has its principal office. If a court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice, it may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, including reinstatement or any other equitable relief. A reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses and costs, may be awarded. Adopted 1964. Amended 1972. The TSCA prohibits an employer from discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee has (1) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under the TSCA; (2) testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding; or (3) assisted or participated or is about to assist or participate in such a proceeding or in any other action to carry out the purposes of the TSCA. Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of the TSCA's anti-retaliation provisions may, within 30 days after such alleged violation occurs, file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Within 30 days of receiving the complaint, the Secretary will complete an investigation. Within 90 days of receiving the complaint, the Secretary will, unless the proceeding is terminated due to a settlement, issue an order either denying the complaint or providing for affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with compensation, compensatory damages, and, where appropriate, exemplary damages. The order will be made on the record after notice and an opportunity for agency hearing. Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the order may obtain review in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred. A petition for review must be filed within 60 days from the issuance of the order. No. A prevailing employee is entitled to affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with compensation, compensatory damages, and, where appropriate, exemplary damages. Whenever an order is issued, at the request of the applicant, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, will be assessed against the person who committed the violation. Adopted 1976. USERRA prohibits an employer from discriminating or taking any adverse employment action against any person because such person has (1) taken an action to enforce a protection afforded by the statute; (2) testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under USERRA; (3) has assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under USERRA; or (4) has exercised a right provided by USERRA. A person who claims to be entitled to employment or reemployment rights under USERRA may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, who will investigate the complaint. If the Secretary determines that the action alleged in the complaint occurred, he will attempt to resolve the complaint by making reasonable efforts to ensure compliance. If the Secretary's efforts do not resolve the complaint, he will notify the complainant of the results of the Secretary's investigation and the ability to have the request referred to the Attorney General, if the employer is a state or private employer, or the Office of Special Counsel, if the employer is a federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). If the Attorney General is reasonably satisfied that the person on whose behalf the complaint is referred is entitled to relief, the Attorney General may appear on behalf of the person and commence an action. In an action against a state employer, the action will be brought in the name of the United States. If the Special Counsel is reasonably satisfied that the person on whose behalf the complaint is referred is entitled to relief, the Special Counsel, upon the request of the complainant, may appear on behalf of the person and initiate an action before the Merit Systems Protection Board. A person may submit directly a complaint against a federal executive agency or OPM to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) if that person has chosen not to apply to the Secretary for assistance, has received notification from the Secretary, has chosen not be represented by the Special Counsel, or has received notification of a decision from the Special Counsel declining to initiate an action and represent the person before the MSPB. If the MSPB determines that a federal executive agency or OPM has not complied with USERRA's employment or reemployment provisions, it will enter an order requiring the agency of OPM to comply with such provisions and to compensate the complainant for lost wages or benefits. A person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final MSPB order or decision may petition the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for review. Yes. A person may commence an action with respect to a complaint against a state or private employer if the person has chosen not to apply to the Secretary for assistance, has chosen not to request referral of the complaint to the Attorney General, or has been refused representation by the Attorney General. In the case of an action against a state employer, the action may be brought in a state court of competent jurisdiction. In the case of an action against a private employer, the action may be brought in the federal district court for any district in which the employer maintains a place of business. A person who prevails in a claim against a state or private employer may be awarded lost wages or benefits. If a court determines that the employer's failure to comply with USERRA's employment and reemployment provisions was willful, it may require the employer to pay an equal amount as liquidated damages. In addition, the court will use, where it finds appropriate, its full equity powers, including temporary or permanent injunctions, temporary restraining orders, and contempt orders. Adopted 1994.

AIR21 prohibits an air carrier, or a contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier, from discharging or otherwise discriminating again an employee because he or she (1) provided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide or cause to be provided to the employer or the federal government information related to a violation or alleged violation of an order, regulation, or standard of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or any other provision of federal law involving air carrier safety; (2) filed, caused to be filed, or is about to file or cause to be filed a proceeding related to a violation or alleged violation of any order, regulation, or standard of the FAA or any other provision of federal law involving air carrier safety; (3) testified or is about to testify in such a proceeding; or (4) assisted or participated in, or is about to assist or participate in such a proceeding. A person who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against in violation of AIR21's anti-retaliation provisions may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor no later than 90 days after the date on which the violation occurs. Within 60 days of receiving the complaint, the Secretary will conduct an investigation and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has merit. If the Secretary concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, he will accompany the findings with a preliminary order that provides for affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with back pay, and compensatory damages. The parties may object to the findings or order, and request a hearing within 30 days of the date of notification of the findings. If a hearing is not requested within the 30-day period, the preliminary order will be deemed a final order that is not subject to judicial review. If a hearing is requested, the Secretary will issue a final order no later than 120 days after the date of the hearing. Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the Secretary's final order may obtain review of the order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of the violation. The petition for review must be filed no later than 60 days after the date of issuance of the final order. No. A prevailing employee is entitled to affirmative action to abate the violation, reinstatement with back pay, and compensatory damages. Adopted 2000. Generally, the WPA provides protections for many federal employees who make disclosures evidencing illegal or improper government activities. In order to trigger the protections of the WPA, a case must contain the following elements: a \"personnel action\" that was taken because of a \"protected disclosure\" made by a \"covered employee.\" Within 240 days of receipt of a complaint, the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) must make a determination as to whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken. If a positive determination is made and the information was sent to the Special Counsel by an employee, former employee, applicant for employment, or an employee who obtained the information acting within the scope of employment, the Special Counsel must transmit the information to the appropriate agency head and require that the agency head conduct an investigation and submit a written report. The identity of the complaining employee may not be disclosed without such individual's consent, unless the Special Counsel determines that disclosure is necessary to avoid imminent danger to health and safety or an imminent criminal violation. The Special Counsel then reviews the reports as to their completeness and the reasonableness of the findings and submits the reports to Congress, the President, the Comptroller General, and the complainant. If the Special Counsel does not make a positive determination, however, he or she may only transmit the information to the agency head with the consent of the individual. Further, if the Special Counsel receives the information from some source other than the ones described above, he or she may transmit the information to the appropriate agency head, who shall inform the Special Counsel of any action taken. In any case where the subject of the whistleblowing disclosure evidences a criminal violation, however, all information is referred to the Attorney General and no report is transmitted to the complainant. At least every 60 days throughout its investigation, the OSC must give notice of the status of the investigation to the individual who brought the allegation. In addition, no later than 10 days before the termination of an investigation, a written status report including the proposed findings and legal conclusions must be made to the individual who made the allegation of wrongdoing. Yes. The WPA provides that an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the independent right to seek review of whistleblower reprisal cases by the MSPB no more than 60 days after notification is provided to such employee that the investigation was closed or 120 days after filing a complaint with the OSC. If in any investigation the Special Counsel determines that there are \"reasonable grounds to believe\" a prohibited personnel practice exists or has occurred, the Special Counsel must report findings and recommendations, and may include recommendations for corrective action, to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the agency involved, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and, optionally, to the President. If the agency does not act to correct the prohibited personnel practice, the Special Counsel may petition the MSPB for corrective action. The MSPB, before rendering its decision, is required to provide an opportunity for oral or written comments by the Special Counsel, the agency involved, and the OPM, and for written comments by any individual who alleges to be the victim of the prohibited personnel practices.  Proceedings for disciplinary action against an officer or employee who commits a prohibited personnel practice may be instituted by the Special Counsel by filing a written complaint with the MSPB. After proceedings before the MSPB or an administrative law judge, if violations are found, the MSPB may impose (i) disciplinary action consisting of removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed five years, suspension, or reprimand; (ii) an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $ 1,000; or (iii) any combination of disciplinary actions described under clause (i) and an assessment described under clause (ii). In addition, the agency where the prevailing party was employed or had applied for employment may be held responsible for reasonable attorney's fees. In the case of presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed employees in \"confidential, policy-making, policy-determining, or policy-advocating\" positions, the complaint and the statement of facts, along with any response from the employee, are to be presented to the President for disposition in lieu of the presentation to the Board.
