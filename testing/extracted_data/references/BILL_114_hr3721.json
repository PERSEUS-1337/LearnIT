FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a \n        barrier for many students in achieving higher education.\n            (2) According to the College Board, during the 2014-2015 \n        academic year, the average student budget for college books and \n        supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher education was \n        $1,225.\n            (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new \n        textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012 and \n        that although Federal efforts to increase price transparency \n        have provided students and families with more and better \n        information, more must be done to address rising costs.\n            (4) The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and \n        sharing of digital content, including open educational \n        resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and \n        members of the public.\n            (5) Using open educational resources in place of \n        traditional materials in large-enrollment college courses can \n        reduce textbook costs by 80 to 100 percent.\n            (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open \n        educational resources could significantly lower college \n        textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher \n        education, while making efficient use of taxpayer funds.\n\nSEC. 3.
