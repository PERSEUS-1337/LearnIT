FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The procedures used by the White House and the Federal \n        Bureau of Investigation to protect the privacy and security of \n        records containing sensitive background security information \n        have been inadequate to provide that protection.\n            (2) Under chapter 22 of title 44, United States Code, \n        popularly known as the ``Presidential Records Act of 1978'', \n        upon the conclusion of a President's term of office the \n        Archivist of the United States assumes responsibility for all \n        Presidential records, including records that were provided by \n        the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that contain sensitive \n        background security information on individuals having access to \n        the White House.\n            (3) The Archivist is required to deposit all such \n        Presidential records in a Presidential archival depository or \n        other archival facility. Thereafter, the records are not \n        readily available to an incoming President for use to review \n        the security of individuals who have a continuing need for \n        access to the White House, including permanent employees of the \n        White House.\n            (4) After deposit in a Presidential archival depository or \n        other archival facility, such records and the sensitive \n        background information they contain are eventually available to \n        researchers, cannot be restricted from the public for more than \n        12 years, and therefore are not afforded the level of privacy \n        and security which are appropriate for these sensitive records.\n            (5) To request such files from the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation or to otherwise review the security of \n        individuals who have a continuing need for access to the White \n        House, the White House needs accurate lists of all individuals \n        employed by, detailed to, or otherwise having a continuing need \n        for access to the White House.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that Federal \nBureau of Investigation records containing sensitive background \nsecurity information that are provided to the White House are properly \nprotected for privacy and security.\n\nSEC. 3.
