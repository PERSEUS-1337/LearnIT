    "content": "Since 2007, at least 19 state legislatures have introduced bills that would require the creation of state Do Not Mail (DNM) registries. Although each state's bill is unique, all the bills attempt to curb the delivery of unsolicited advertising mail\u2014often referred to as \"junk mail\" or \"direct mail marketing.\" Each bill would permit a resident to submit his or her name and address to a state agency or department, which would compile all the names and addresses into a registry that would then be distributed to direct mail marketers. Marketers who knowingly ignored the registry and sent unsolicited direct mail advertisements to individuals on a state's registry could be charged a fine for each infraction. This report focuses on the environmental and economic issues associated with state DNM statutes, recognizing that there may be constitutional impediments to their full implementation should they be enacted. Table 1 includes states that have introduced do-not-mail legislation in 2007 and 2008. Environmental groups, including GreenDimes, ProQuo, ForestEthics, and The New American Dream, state that unsolicited mail creates large amounts of paper waste, invades individuals' privacy, renders individuals more susceptible to identity theft and mail fraud, and is a nuisance. Direct mail marketers and the United States Postal Service (USPS), however, state that advertising mail is an extremely successful means for businesses and not-for-profit organizations to communicate with potential customers and donors that causes minimal environmental impact, creates jobs, and adds billions of dollars to the domestic and global economies. USPS estimates that it could lose between $4 billion and $10 billion in annual revenue if every state created a Do Not Mail Registry and every consumer placed his or her name on it. Currently, no federal legislation to create a Do Not Mail registry has been introduced in the 110 th Congress. Advertising mail, however, has been an issue of interest at congressional oversight hearings. At a March 5, 2008, hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, and International Security, for example, Postmaster General John Potter stated that DNM initiatives not only threaten the viability of the mail in and among the affected states; they also undermine our ability to support a national network, one capable of serving every resident of every state, territory, and possession\u2014affordably, effectively, and efficiently. We believe the success of these initiatives will also come at the expense of jobs, the viability of local businesses, and the reduction in municipal, county, and state revenue. We cannot afford these results during the best of times; they are unthinkable when the economy is faltering. Additionally, at the April 1, 2008, annual meeting of the National Postal Supervisors Association Meeting in Washington, D.C., Senator Susan M. Collins, the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, discussed existing state DNM initiatives. The entire postal community is very concerned about proposed \"Do Not Mail\" legislation. This sounds good to a lot of legislators, who mistakenly equate this ill-conceived proposal with the \"Do Not Call\" registry. In fact, it would have devastating consequences. Direct mail is an essential part of the Postal Service's mail volume. \"Do Not Mail\" legislation would curb this growth and place a heavier burden on other classes of mail to cover the fixed costs of providing postal service, and thus raise its costs and jeopardize universal, affordable service. Direct mail is in no way comparable to the unsolicited and invasive telephone calls that are curbed by the \"Do Not Call\" registry. Direct mail imposes no burden on the public, it causes no interruptions, and I, for one, look forward to the Bed, Bath, and Beyond coupons I get in the mail. A \"Do Not Mail\" registry would attempt to solve a problem that does not exist and would have devastating consequences for every home, community, and business that relies upon our Postal Service. The proposed reduction or elimination of advertising mail is a controversial issue. USPS states that 100 billion pieces of advertising mail were delivered to households in the United States in 2007\u2014about 16.7 pieces of advertising mail to each household per week. In 2007, advertising mail represented 60% of all household mail delivered in the United States. In 2006, advertising mail accounted for roughly 2.3% of all municipal waste. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Standard Mail generated nearly 5.9 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2006. Nearly 2.3 million tons (38.7%) of that waste was recovered. Groups seeking to reduce or eliminate advertising mail assert that it inflicts costs upon the environment and the public. Advocates of curbing advertising mail state that nearly half of it is brought to landfills unopened. According to the New American Dream, a Takoma Park, Maryland-based nonprofit organization, \"more than 100 million trees' worth of bulk mail arrive in American mail boxes each year ... the equivalent of deforesting the entire Rocky Mountain National Park every four months.\" Forest Ethics calculates that it \"would take the equivalent of over 500,000 garbage truck loads to dump all junk mail into landfills and incinerators each year.\" In addition, ProQuo\u2014a San Diego-based company that helps consumers control which organizations receive their names, addresses, and other personal information\u2014advocates for the reduction of unsolicited advertising mail. ProQuo claims that such mailings could lead to identity theft because direct mail marketers, credit bureaus, and data brokers often trade and sell consumer information, making it more accessible to thieves and computer hackers. The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) does not dispute the New American Dream's statistics or calculations, but points out that the numbers do not include important details. According to DMA, for example, many of the trees cut down to make paper for advertising mail were grown carefully and specifically for the purpose of being harvested for paper. According to a USPS study, 48% of recipients read their unsolicited advertising mail; an additional 33% glance at it, leaving 19% of people who do not read their advertising mail. According to USPS's Household Diary Study , an average of 1 in 10 pieces of advertising mail elicited a consumer response. A 2007 USPS Environmental Impact of Mail study found \"that advertising mail, through the elimination of shopping trips, harmful emissions, and traffic accidents, results in an annual $553 million net benefit to the American economy.\" Additionally, USPS, the Direct Marketing Association, Valassis , and other direct mail marketers contend that advertising mail is constitutionally protected commercial speech, and provides very little opportunity for identity theft. According to the Federal Trade Commission 2006 Identity Theft Survey Report , in 2005 2% of 8.3 million identity theft victims believe their personal information was acquired through postal mail items. Finally, these organizations stress advertising mail's importance to the economy. Estimates suggest that advertisers spent $60 billion on direct mail marketing in 2006. One out of every five dollars spent on advertising in the United States is spent on mail. In addition to USPS's 786,000 part-time and full-time employees, DMA estimates that nearly 460,000 people have jobs linked directly to advertising mail. Those who hold jobs include delivery employees, graphic artists, catalog designers for companies like L.L. Bean, employees of tree-growing companies, and paper company employees. An additional 3.1 million people are employed in jobs indirectly linked to direct mail marketing, including warehouse workers, package deliverers, and customer service representatives. The U.S. Postal Service generates nearly all of its funding\u2014about $74.8 billion annually\u2014by charging users of the mail for the costs of its services. Congress does provide an annual appropriation of approximately $100 million to compensate USPS for revenue it forgoes in providing free mailing privileges to the blind and overseas voters, and for other purposes. The largest product profit margin is created by First Class Mail sales, which have been in decline since 2000. USPS has, therefore, had to change its business model to rely more heavily on Standard Mail sales, which is comprised mainly of advertising mail. Most advertising mail (83%) in 2007 was sent as Standard Mail, a USPS classification for specialized items that weigh fewer than 16 ounces. Items that can be sent as Standard Mail include printed matter, flyers, circulars, advertising, newsletters, bulletins, catalogs and small parcels. The remaining 17% of advertising mail was sent as First Class. Any item can be sent as First Class Mail, which is more expensive than Standard Mail. Certain items, however, must be mailed First Class\u2014including handwritten or typewritten material, bills, statements of account or invoices, credit cards, personal correspondence, personalized business correspondence, and all matter sealed against inspection. Over the past eight years, USPS has experienced a significant shift in the composition of its mail volume. Since 2000, the volume of USPS First Class Mail has steadily declined. In 2005, for the first time, the volume of Standard Mail exceeded the volume of First Class Mail delivered by USPS ( Figure 1 ). Because it is sold at a higher price and costs roughly the same for USPS to deliver, First Class Mail provides the Postal Service with a higher profit per mail piece. Although USPS anticipates that Standard Mail sales and revenue will continue to grow, a significant reduction in Standard Mail volume\u2014for example, volume losses prompted by the enactment of Do Not Mail initiatives\u2014could lead to large revenue losses for USPS. As the volume of First Class Mail dropped, USPS increased the postage rate to send it. However, as Figure 2 shows, revenue for First Class Mail has remained stagnant. Meanwhile USPS's annual operating costs have increased. Standard Mail revenue, on the other hand, has grown from more than $15.8 billion in FY2002 to nearly $20.8 billion in FY2007. In 2007, Standard Mail generated 28% ($20.8 billion) of USPS's total revenue ( Figure 3 ), and made up 49% of the 212 billion mail pieces delivered ( Figure 4 ). According to Postmaster General John Potter, First Class Mail and Standard Mail have been declining in volume in 2007. First-Class Mail, our largest revenue producer, fell by almost 1 billion pieces, some 4 percent below the same period last year. Standard Mail, which eclipsed First-Class Mail as our largest volume product in 2005, declined by almost 750 million pieces, 2.6 percent less than the first quarter of 2007. There are no current signs of improvement for quarter 2. According to The Washington Post , recent economic conditions have also affected USPS, which anticipates a $1 billion budget shortfall in 2008. Troubled banks are mailing fewer credit card offers. Declining new-home sales mean vacant houses sitting with empty mailboxes. And as consumers switch to paying bills online, first-class mailings are drying up. As USPS operating costs have increased steadily, revenue has not kept pace ( Table 2 ). In 2007, USPS generated a $5.4 billion revenue loss. A June 3, 2008, GAO report found USPS's $5 billion shortfall in FY2007 was largely caused by advance payments of retiree health benefits. At a March 5, 2008, congressional oversight hearing, USPS Postmaster General John Potter stated that the service was already attempting to cut costs by reducing \"expenditures for supplies, services and other non-personnel expenses.\" USPS employees are not receiving as much overtime pay, and the service is, instead, making heavier use of less-expensive seasonal employees. The additional loss of revenue has USPS administrators seeking new ways to earn money\u2014including the possibility of renting space in the service's existing 37,000 post offices to private companies, such as banks or coffee shops. \"[W]hen you look at the posts around the world, many of them are using their retail outlets as banks.... That type of flexibility is something, I think, that we need to explore because we do have the assets,\" Potter said. Statutes that restrict uses of federal property, however, could prevent such an activity. According to USPS estimates, if Do Not Mail legislation were passed in every state\u2014or if Congress passed a federal statute creating a DNM registry\u2014the postal service could lose between $4 billion and $10 billion annually in sales revenue. These estimates do not include secondary effects, including revenue from business reply mail or future revenue from the creation of business relationships through advertising mail. \"We would have to cut costs and make a lot of adjustments,\" said Michael Kubayanda, a USPS congressional liaison. According to media reports, private organizations that keep track of USPS sales as well as postal unions believe that the decrease in First Class Mail has made direct mail advertising critical to the Postal Service's financial success. In addition, these groups fear that continued loss in First Class Mail revenue could lead to severe financial troubles for USPS in the future. USPS and direct mail marketing organizations assert that DNM legislation would heavily affect sales revenue and potentially\u2014in the longer term\u2014employment at both the state and national levels. In the United States in 2007, 459,500 people were employed in businesses directly linked to advertising mail. Roughly 3.1 million people were employed in jobs that were indirectly linked to advertising mail. Table 3 lists the number of employees directly and indirectly linked to direct mail marketing\u2014as well as the number of USPS employees\u2014in each state that has pending DNM legislation in 2008. In 2008, at least 12 states have pending legislation at the state level that, if passed, require the creation of a Do Not Mail registry. The lists are similar to the National Do Not Call Registry, which imposes fines on telemarketers who call phone numbers that are on the list. Unlike the National Do Not Call Registry, however, the Do Not Mail registries would be state run. Some state proposals include very high penalties for organizations that ignore the registry. Two states' DNM bills\u2014Tennessee's and Pennsylvania's\u2014do not explicitly create penalty exemptions for nonprofit organizations. Other states exempt political mail, small businesses, and existing business relationships from penalty\u2014in addition to exemptions for non-profit entities. Some states' bills would require the state attorney general to manage the list, while others would require the state's division of consumer protection to perform those duties. Still other states allow the registry to be contracted out to a private vendor. Table 4 shows each state's bill, its status, and summary details on its design and content. In state legislatures where DNM bills have been introduced, anticipated environmental benefits of the bills have been pitted against potential commercial losses. Some states reference environmental concerns in the text of their pending DNM bills. North Carolina's legislation, for example, states, \"Unsolicited bulk mail ('junk mail') ... annually accounts for millions of pounds of trash in North Carolina and the destruction of 100 million trees nationwide for paper pulp.\" Rhode Island's DNM legislation states the following: Unsolicited bulk mail (\"junk mail\") now represents a major portion of the budget and workload of the United States Postal Service, with over ninety billion (90,000,000,000) pieces delivered per year, and annually account for millions of pounds of trash in North Carolina and the destruction of 100 million trees nationwide for paper pulp. ... Junk Mail is a large, unnecessary source of solid waste and imposes an unnecessary burden on the environment for which taxpayers bear the cost. Individual rights and commercial freedom of speech should be balanced in a way that accommodates both individual choice and legitimate marketing practices. Illinois's bill refers to junk mail as \"environmental sacrilege,\" and finds it \"in the public interest to establish a mechanism under which the residents .... can decide whether or not to receive junk mail.\" In New Hampshire, however, the current majority party stated that while DNM legislation could reduce environmental concerns, other potential effects of the bill outweighed those benefits. The Commerce Committee, in reporting the bill, stated, \"[v]aluable natural resources could be saved, landfill waste could be reduced, and postal customers could save time.\" Despite these \"benefits,\" \"they were not enough to overcome the various concerns and questions about this bill.\" Many rural postal carriers are paid by the number of pieces of mail they deliver\u2014HB1506 would directly affect their income. Exceptions in the bill for saturation mailings that go to every resident along the postal route, mailings by non-profits or political groups, and by or on behalf of a business with less then [sic] 20 employees led us to the conclusion that this bill, as drafted, would not significantly reduce unwanted mail. Lastly, the committee learned that the NHDES [New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services] website offers preaddressed postcards to major mailing organizations, which can be easily printed and used to be put on their 'do-not-mail' lists. This could be just as effective in reducing junk mail as the proposed legislation. The report indicated the majority found it \"inexpedient to legislate\" on the initiative. Although most nonprofit and for-profit organizations advocating the creation of DNM registries stress the environmental impact of \"junk mail,\" none of the state legislatures have referred their bills to an environmental committee. States referred their bills to consumer protection, judiciary, and finance committees. The public's dislike of unsolicited advertising mail may be prompting state legislative initiatives to give consumers a way to opt out of receiving it. A 2003 Pew Internet and American Life Project telephone poll of 2,200 adults found that 19% of respondents thought unsolicited advertising mail was a \"very big intrusion\" in their own life; 33% found unsolicited advertising mail a \"big intrusion,\" and 29% said it was a \"small intrusion.\" Some 17% of respondents found unsolicited advertising mail to be \"no intrusion at all.\" There are actions that individuals may take to reduce the amount of advertising mail delivered to them. Subscribing to private Do Not Mail registries or contacting companies directly can curb advertising mail delivery, but it may take several months for mailings to decrease. Other ways to reduce unsolicited advertising mail include refusing to receive it when it is delivered, and avoiding solicitations that request personal information. Several private organizations host \"do not mail\" registries that are regularly updated and checked by direct mail marketers who then remove those addresses from their mailing lists. The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) maintains a Mail Preference Service, which functions similarly to a DNM registry. Consumers can log onto the DMA's Mail Preference Service website and register their name and address. Created in 1971, the Mail Preference Service allows consumers to tailor which advertising magazines they would like to have mailed to their homes and which magazines they would prefer not to receive. After selecting to opt out from receipt of certain magazines, catalogs, or other direct mail, consumers are asked to wait an additional 30 to 90 days for the request to become effective. Other private companies, like GreenDimes, DirectMail.com and CatalogChoice.org, offer services that remove a consumer's name from a variety of direct mail marketing lists. GreenDimes grants subscribers access to a \"catalog screener\" that allows them to individually select catalogs they would like to continue to receive\u2014and those they would not. GreenDimes offers their basic service\u2014which includes removing the subscriber's name from a variety of mailing lists\u2014for free. GreenDimes also offers services at various fee levels. The $20 GreenDimes level, for example, includes everything in the free service plus access to the customer service hotline, monthly account monitoring, and the planting of five trees in the subscriber's name at a separate non-profit organization. DirectMail.com also maintains an online Do Not Mail List. Similar to the other DNM efforts, DirectMail.com allows a subscriber to register for free and tailor their direct mail to his or her preferences. CatalogChoice allows subscribers to create an individual account, and then select which catalogs they would like to receive and which they would not. Additionally, several other private companies offer services to help consumers reduce the advertising mail for a variety of fees. A consumer can remove his or her address from credit card and insurance company mailing lists for five years\u2014or permanently\u2014using optoutprescreen.com. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq.), consumer credit reporting companies may place a consumer's name and address on lists that creditors and insurers then use as potential customer databases. Credit card companies and insurance companies may send consumers on these lists unsolicited offers. FCRA, however, also mandated a right for consumers to \"opt out\" of receiving credit card and insurance company advertising mail. At optoutprescreen.com, consumers can electronically register to opt out of receiving the solicitations for up to five years. Consumers who would like to stop the solicitations indefinitely may fill out an online form and then print the electronic Permanent Opt Out Election form found on the site. The form must then be mailed to the Opt Out Department in Illinois. Optoutprescreen.com also allows consumers to opt in to credit card and insurance offers they would like to receive. Private DNM initiatives allow a consumer to individualize advertising mail to suit his or her preferences\u2014an option not found in any of the pending state DNM bills. The private efforts, however, may not stop mail from direct mail marketers who do not use\u2014or refuse to heed\u2014the mailing lists provided by GreenDimes, DMA, optoutprescreen.com, or DirectMail.com. Also, companies or organizations that continue to send advertising mail to those who have signed a registry are often not penalized. Additionally, according to DirectMail.com, the company \"cannot guarantee that you will not receive mail addressed to 'Occupant' or 'Resident.'\" When using the private opt out services, a consumer must contact multiple organizations to ensure his or her name is removed from any number of marketing lists. Because private companies cannot offer a centralized, one-stop, direct-mail-blocking service, consumers may spend substantial time finding the correct ways to curb unwanted advertising mail. Private DNM initiatives are available, but may be only minimally effective in curbing the delivery of unwanted advertising mail. While DNM registries allow consumers to remove themselves from larger mailing lists used by direct mail marketers, contacting individual mailers by telephone or mail may curtail the delivery of specific pieces of advertising mail. Additionally, to stop bulk mail coupons, consumers can visit the appropriate websites. For example, many households receive bulk mail coupons from companies such as those sent by Valpak, ADVO, and Shop-Wise mailings. A consumer who has existing business-by-mail relationships with entities such as individual magazine publishers, credit card companies, gardening supply companies, or clothing stores may call or write to these organizations and request his or her personal information\u2014including home address, demographic information, and name\u2014not be shared with other solicitors. Contacting the marketers themselves can be an effective method of stopping individual solicitations, but it can also sometimes become a time consuming effort. Because the consumer must contact each organization individually, which can sometimes require navigating automated telephone systems before his or her name can be removed from the mailing list, consumers may decide that removing their address requires too much effort\u2014especially if the effort culminates in removal from just one mailer's list. A customer receiving mailings may refuse them by writing \"Refused\u2014return to sender\" on the outside of the envelope or catalog, and then leaving the item in his or her mailbox for their mail carrier. Depending on the size of the mail item, USPS will return it to the sender or will dispose of it. Mailers who receive mail marked \"refused\" may remove the names and addresses of recipients from their mailing lists. A recipient of unwanted advertising mail can ask his or her letter carrier for further suggestions, or the consumer may visit websites like the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's \"Reducing Junk Mail\" website. Privacy Rights, as an example, offers additional tactics to reduce advertising mail. In addition, consumers should be mindful that participating in certain activities can result in their names being placed on mailing lists. For example, individuals who sign up for sweepstakes offers may receive additional advertising mail. These solicitations often serve to create address databases for direct mail marketers. Private sector organizations and the USPS have been increasing efforts to recycle unwanted advertising mail and use certified paper providers. DMA, for example, requires its members to progress toward a \"Green 15\"\u201415 business practices \"that are well understood to deliver environmental benefits, with sensitivity toward an organization's bottom line.\" Included among the guidelines are requirements to \"encourage paper suppliers to increase wood purchases from recognized forest certification programs\" and \"encourage packaging suppliers to submit alternate solutions for environmentally preferable packaging.\" While the DMA requires its members to follow the guidelines, it does not have a penalty for those who ignore them. Other organizations, including the National Recycling Coalition, Verso Paper, and Time, Inc., have joined forces to create the Recycling Magazines is Excellent (ReMix) campaign in five U.S. cities. The effort, according to a GAO report, increased the recycling of magazines and catalogs in one city 19%. USPS generates nearly $7.5 million per year through recycling efforts\u2014recycling about 1 million tons of waste paper per year. USPS also hosts a website http://www.usps.com/ green/ greenmail.htm that includes information on how customers can reduce, reuse, and recycle their mail. The USPS greenmail website includes a link to the DMA's Mail Preference Service. A recent GAO report that examined USPS recycling efforts stated that the service recently established \"annual goals to increase its revenue from mail-related recycling from $7.5 million in fiscal year 2007 to $40 million in fiscal year 2010.\" USPS also is increasing recycling efforts related to undeliverable-as-addressed (UAA) mail. According to a GAO report, \"USPS treatment of UAA mail depends on the mail class.\" First Class Mail is returned to the addressee if a return address is available. If no return address is available, the item is sent to a USPS Mail Recovery Center. Generally, according to GAO, all Standard Mail that is undeliverable\u2014including UAA mail\u2014is treated as waste, most of which is recycled. Nearly 317,000 tons of Standard Mail was UAA mail in 2006. Beginning March 2009, USPS will begin using the Intelligent Mail Barcodes to tally the amount of UAA mail created by organizations that send large quantities of mail. State-level DNM bills inherently generate issues of federalism because such bills could affect the operations and revenue stream of a federal quasi-governmental agency: the USPS. Moreover, the bills may raise constitutional questions related to post offices and postal roads as well as the regulation of interstate commerce, powers that the U.S. Constitution grants to Congress. The national impact of state-level legislation may be of concern to lawmakers at all levels of government. Efforts to protect both the environment and consumer identity may negatively affect job creation and USPS self-sustainability requirements. Existing private-sector efforts that allow a consumer to tailor the solicitations that arrive in his or her mailbox may significantly reduce the amount of unsolicited advertising mail he or she receives. The mail registries, however, have no authority to fine or otherwise penalize organizations that do not heed the lists. Congress may consider potential legislative options related to reduction of unsolicited advertising mail. One option would be to seek legislation that is nearly identical to many of the pending state DNM bills. The bill might specify which agency would manage the DNM registry and/or whether its maintenance could be awarded as a private contract. Direct mail marketers would need to access the list at intervals determined by the legislation. The bill could also determine the penalties for direct mail marketers who fail to heed the list\u2014or leave that determination to the entity managing the list. Creating such legislation would have costs and benefits. Constituents with concerns about environmental waste or identity theft could sign up for the registry and reduce unsolicited advertising mail from their mailboxes. Organizations that rely on advertising mail for revenue, however, could suffer economic losses that prompt a rise in pricing or lead to the elimination of jobs. Congress may also consider other legislative action to help USPS generate revenues to replace those lost, including increasing federal building flexibilities for USPS. Current statutes and USPS policies place restrictions on renting space in post offices to private vendors like banks and coffee shops. By allowing USPS greater flexibility to rent some of its retail space, the service could collect additional revenue to help close its current budget shortfall and possibly replace revenue that could be lost if state or federal level DNM legislation were passed. In regard to resource usage concerns, Congress may consider policies that would provide mailers with incentives to use environment-sensitive products and methods. A GAO report suggested the creation of a Green Rate, or \"discounted postal rate ... for mailers that use recycled and/or certified paper.\" The report states that \"stakeholders in the environmental advocacy industry\" suggested the idea, which \"would help mailers offset the increased costs associated with using recycled paper and would provide an incentive for mailers to use certified paper.\" A Green Rate could also be used to reward direct mail marketers who heed existing private Do Not Mail registries. If marketers demonstrated that they did not contact consumers who opted out of receiving unsolicited marketing, the company could be deemed eligible for the Green Rate. Additionally, the Green Rate could also be made available to \"demonstrate measurable reductions in the amount of [undeliverable-as-addressed] UAA mail they send\" and \"use mail materials efficiently.\" GAO stated that a Green Rate could increase USPS revenue, but added that USPS would have to conduct a variety of \"feasibility studies\" to ensure that the service had the technology and resources needed to create a new mail class. USPS may need both congressional and Postal Regulatory Commission approval to create a new class of mail. Congress could equally choose to not take any legislative action, but instead provide constituents and governmental entities guidance on how to manage the volume and impact of direct mail. Members could inform constituents of the previously discussed private registries available to manage advertising mail as well as other options that could reduce it."
