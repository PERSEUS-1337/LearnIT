FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that Cuba \n        and the United States would reopen their embassies and restore \n        diplomatic ties.\n            (2) Diplomatic relations between the two countries were \n        formally reestablished July 20, 2015, when the United States \n        and Cuba reopened their respective embassies.\n            (3) The International Business Times reported on September \n        10, 2015, that ``Texas is on pace this year to set a new record \n        for the number of Cubans trying to enter the United States \n        through the Lone Star State, with about 60 percent more \n        migrants from the island nation making the trip in 2015 \n        compared to one year before.''.\n            (4) The Obama Administration has reestablished relations \n        with Cuba, and that, therefore, the special treatment Cuban \n        nationals receive under the Cuban Adjustment Act, the \n        Immigration and Nationality Act, the Cuban Family Reunification \n        Program and the Wet Foot/Dry Foot policy are no longer \n        applicable and fail the ``urgent humanitarian reasons'' and \n        ``significant public benefit'' tests.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Cuban \nnationals should be treated under the same immigration rules as \nnationals of other countries with which the United States has \ndiplomatic relations and should not receive preferential treatment.\n\nSEC. 3.
