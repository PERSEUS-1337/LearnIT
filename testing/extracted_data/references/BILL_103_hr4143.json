CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) open spaces and community parks are a critically \n        important portion of urban infrastructure;\n            (2) many inner-city areas suffer from a lack of public open \n        space for community residents to use for recreation, social \n        interaction, and relief from dense urban conditions;\n            (3) vacant lots, many in public ownership as a result of \n        tax foreclosures, are common in inner-city areas;\n            (4) the recent economic recession substantially increased \n        the number of such vacant lots;\n            (5) such lots often become drug trafficking areas, thereby \n        decreasing the value of surrounding property and leading to \n        higher crime rates in inner-city areas; and\n            (6) the refurbishment of such lots, by removing garbage and \n        rubble and creating well-lighted and maintained open spaces and \n        community parks, would establish positive assets for \n        surrounding communities, provide positive outlets for community \n        youth, increase property values, make other types of investment \n        in the communities more attractive, and generally improve the \n        quality of life for residents of the affected communities.\n\nSEC. 3.
