FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n        illuminated many flaws in the Nation's domestic security, \n        especially in its identification system.\n            (2) Drivers' licenses and identification cards issued by \n        States have become the favored form of identity verification in \n        the United States and are used by government agencies and \n        private entities alike.\n            (3) Inconsistent requirements between the States for \n        initial identity verification and insufficient verification of \n        identity documents have made the identification systems of \n        States a prime target for fraud and identity theft.\n            (4) Different designs on drivers' licenses and \n        identification cards issued by States have created a market, \n        including sales on the Internet, for fake cards that look real \n        to those who are unfamiliar with the official designs.\n            (5) Improving the security of State identification systems \n        will require taking advantage of new technology.\n            (6) Identification card technologies that can accommodate \n        other government and private applications will provide the best \n        return on the investment in the new cards.\n            (7) It is necessary to improve the security of drivers' \n        licenses and identification cards issued by States so that \n        multiple licensing of individuals will be eliminated, the \n        purchase of alcohol and tobacco products by underage \n        individuals will be reduced, and identity theft will be \n        severely reduced.\n\nSEC. 3.
