FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (referred to \n        in the section as ``title VI'') is one of the principal \n        antidiscrimination statutes enforced by the Department of \n        Education's Office for Civil Rights.\n            (2) Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, \n        color, or national origin.\n            (3) Both the Department of Justice and the Department of \n        Education have properly concluded that title VI prohibits \n        discrimination against Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, and members of \n        other religious groups when the discrimination is based on the \n        group's actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic \n        characteristics or when the discrimination is based on actual \n        or perceived citizenship or residence in a country whose \n        residents share a dominant religion or a distinct religious \n        identity.\n            (4) A September 8, 2010, letter from Assistant Attorney \n        General Thomas E. Perez to Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights \n        Russlynn H. Ali stated that ``[a]lthough Title VI does not \n        prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, \n        discrimination against Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, and members of \n        other groups violates Title VI when that discrimination is \n        based on the group's actual or perceived shared ancestry or \n        ethnic characteristics''.\n            (5) To assist State and local educational agencies and \n        schools in their efforts to comply with Federal law, the \n        Department of Education periodically issues Dear Colleague \n        letters. On a number of occasions, these letters set forth the \n        Department of Education's interpretation of the statutory and \n        regulatory obligations of schools under title VI.\n            (6) On September 13, 2004, the Department of Education \n        issued a Dear Colleague letter regarding the obligations of \n        schools (including colleges) under title VI to address \n        incidents involving religious discrimination. The 2004 letter \n        specifically notes that ``since the attacks of September 11, \n        2001, OCR has received complaints of race or national origin \n        harassment commingled with aspects of religious discrimination \n        against Arab Muslim, Sikh, and Jewish students.''.\n            (7) An October 26, 2010, Dear Colleague letter issued by \n        the Department of Education stated, ``While Title VI does not \n        cover discrimination based solely on religion, groups that face \n        discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived shared \n        ancestry or ethnic characteristics may not be denied protection \n        under Title VI on the ground that they also share a common \n        faith. These principles apply not just to Jewish students, but \n        also to students from any discrete religious group that shares, \n        or is perceived to share, ancestry or ethnic characteristics \n        (e.g., Muslims or Sikhs).''.\n            (8) Anti-Semitism, and harassment on the basis of actual or \n        perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics with a \n        religious group, remains a persistent, disturbing problem in \n        elementary and secondary schools and on college campuses.\n            (9) Students from a range of diverse backgrounds, including \n        Jewish, Arab Muslim, and Sikh students, are being threatened, \n        harassed, or intimidated in their schools (including on their \n        campuses) on the basis of their shared ancestry or ethnic \n        characteristics including through harassing conduct that \n        creates a hostile environment so severe, pervasive, or \n        persistent so as to interfere with or limit some students' \n        ability to participate in or benefit from the services, \n        activities, or opportunities offered by schools.\n            (10) The 2010 Dear Colleague letter cautioned schools that \n        they ``must take prompt and effective steps reasonably \n        calculated to end the harassment, eliminate any hostile \n        environment, and its effects, and prevent the harassment from \n        recurring,'' but did not provide guidance on current \n        manifestations of anti-Semitism, including discriminatory anti-\n        Semitic conduct that is couched as anti-Israel or anti-Zionist.\n            (11) The definition and examples referred to in paragraphs \n        (1) and (2) of section 3 have been valuable tools to help \n        identify contemporary manifestations of anti-Semitism, and \n        include useful examples of discriminatory anti-Israel conduct \n        that crosses the line into anti-Semitism.\n            (12) Awareness of this definition of anti-Semitism will \n        increase understanding of the parameters of contemporary anti-\n        Jewish conduct and will assist the Department of Education in \n        determining whether an investigation of anti-Semitism under \n        title VI is warranted.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act, the term ``definition of anti-\nSemitism''--\n            (1) includes the definition of anti-Semitism set forth by \n        the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism of the \n        Department of State in the Fact Sheet issued on June 8, 2010; \n        and\n            (2) includes the examples set forth under the headings \n        ``Contemporary Examples of Anti-Semitism'' and ``What is Anti-\n        Semitism Relative to Israel?'' of the Fact Sheet.\n\nSEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION FOR TITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF \n              1964.\n\n    In reviewing, investigating, or deciding whether there has been a \nviolation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d \net seq.) on the basis of race, color, or national origin, based on an \nindividual's actual or perceived shared Jewish ancestry or Jewish \nethnic characteristics, the Department of Education shall take into \nconsideration the definition of anti-Semitism as part of the \nDepartment's assessment of whether the practice was motivated by anti-\nSemitic intent.\n\nSEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    The Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights shall administer and \nenforce title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et \nseq.) and title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 \net seq.) in a manner that is consistent with the manner of \nadministration and enforcement described in the Dear Colleague letter \nissued on September 13, 2004, by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nEnforcement of the Department of Education, entitled ``Title VI and \nTitle IX Religious Discrimination in Schools and Colleges''.\n\nSEC. 6. OTHER RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) General Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued--\n            (1) to expand the authority of the Secretary of Education;\n            (2) to alter the standards pursuant to which the Department \n        of Education makes a determination that harassing conduct \n        amounts to actionable discrimination; or\n            (3) to diminish or infringe upon the rights protected under \n        any other provision of law that is in effect as of the date of \n        enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Constitutional Protections.--Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the \nFirst Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."
