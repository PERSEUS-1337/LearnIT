FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Commercial livestock grazing on Federal lands is \n        increasingly difficult for grazing permittees and lessees due \n        to growing conflicts with other legitimate multiple uses of \n        those lands, such as environmental protection and burgeoning \n        recreational use, and with congressionally mandated goals of \n        wildlife and habitat protection and improved water quality and \n        quantity.\n            (2) The recreational use of Federal lands often leads to \n        conflicts with commercial livestock grazing on the same lands, \n        because some recreationists damage property related to the \n        grazing operations or disturb livestock, rendering many grazing \n        operations on Federal lands uneconomical.\n            (3) A combination of sustained drought, foreign \n        competition, changing domestic markets, industry restructuring, \n        and individual ranch situations has resulted in grazing permits \n        and leases becoming stranded investments for many permittees \n        and lessees.\n            (4) Many permittees and lessees would like to retire, but \n        do not have family members willing or able to take over ranch \n        operations.\n            (5) Attempts to resolve grazing conflicts with other \n        multiple uses often require extensive range developments and \n        monitoring that greatly increases costs to both permittees and \n        lessees and taxpayers, far out of proportion to the benefit \n        received.\n            (6) Certain grazing allotments on Federal lands have, or \n        are likely to become, unsuitable for livestock production as a \n        result of the combined effect of the aforementioned factors.\n            (7) The cost of the Federal grazing program greatly exceeds \n        revenues to the Federal treasury from grazing receipts.\n            (8) Many Federal grazing permittees and lessees have \n        indicated their desire to end their livestock grazing on \n        Federal lands in exchange for a one-time payment to reasonably \n        compensate them for the effort and investment that they have \n        made in a grazing allotment.\n            (9) Compensating permittees and lessees who relinquish \n        their grazing permit or lease and end livestock grazing on \n        Federal lands would help recapitalize an ailing sector of rural \n        America, by providing economic options to permittees and \n        lessees that do not presently exist and allowing them to \n        restructure their ranch operations, start new businesses, \n        retire with security, or provide a family legacy.\n            (10) Reasonable compensation for the relinquishment of a \n        grazing permit or lease will help alleviate the need for \n        permittees and lessees to sell or subdivide their private \n        lands.\n            (11) A voluntary buyout program for grazing permits and \n        leases will help resolve growing conflicts between livestock \n        grazing and other multiple uses, and would be ecologically \n        imperative, economically rational, fiscally prudent, and \n        socially just.\n\nSEC. 3.
