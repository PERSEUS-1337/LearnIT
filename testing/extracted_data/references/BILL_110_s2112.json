FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nurse-managed health clinics (referred to in this \n        section as ``NMHCs'') offer their patients primary care based \n        on the nursing model, which emphasizes the protection, \n        promotion, and optimization of health along with the prevention \n        of illness, and the alleviation of suffering in conjunction \n        with diagnosis and treatment. Nurses are advocates and \n        educators providing care for individuals, families, \n        communities, and populations.\n            (2) More than 200 NMHCs are currently in operation across \n        the United States. These clinics record over 2,000,000 client \n        encounters annually.\n            (3) NMHCs meet the Institute of Medicine's definition of \n        safety-net provider by providing care regardless of their \n        patient's ability to pay. A substantial share of their patient \n        mix is made up of uninsured individuals, Medicaid recipients, \n        and other vulnerable populations. A recent study funded by the \n        Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reported that more \n        than 45 percent of the payor mix for NMHCs is uninsured, and 37 \n        percent are Medicaid recipients.\n            (4) NMHCs provide a medical home for the underserved, and \n        are viable partners with the Federal Government to reduce \n        health disparities. They provide a full range of health care \n        services, including primary care, health promotion, disease \n        prevention, and behavioral health care to the residents of \n        rural and urban underserved communities. Because NMHCs are \n        often located in public housing developments, senior living \n        arrangements, schools, and community centers, they help remove \n        barriers preventing access to care and are instrumental in \n        addressing and eliminating the factors contributing to health \n        disparities.\n            (5) Nurse-managed clinics are playing an ever-increasing \n        role in the Nation's health care safety-net, and are currently \n        being under-utilized and under-funded by both Federal and State \n        governments.\n            (6) Lack of adequate funding has caused 39 percent of the \n        NMHCs established between 1993 and 2001 to close. These clinics \n        are frequently the only source of health care for their \n        patients. These closures have had a negative impact on the \n        ability of the underserved to access primary care.\n            (7) The goal of this Act is to provide NMHCs with access to \n        a stable source of funding that will enable them to continue \n        expanding primary care services in underserved communities, \n        while reducing the level of health disparities suffered by \n        vulnerable populations.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to fund the development \nand operation of nurse-managed health clinics to--\n            (1) provide comprehensive and accessible primary health \n        care services to vulnerable populations living in underserved \n        communities around the Nation; and\n            (2) reduce the level of health disparities experienced by \n        vulnerable populations.\n\nSEC. 3.
