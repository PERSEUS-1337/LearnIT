    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In September 2000, the United States and the Russian \n        Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition \n        Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34 metric tons of \n        weapons-grade plutonium.\n            (2) The agreement with Russia is a significant step toward \n        safeguarding nuclear materials and preventing their diversion \n        to rogue states and terrorists.\n            (3) The Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34 metric \n        tons of weapons-grade plutonium of the United States before the \n        end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a mixed-oxide fuel \n        to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.\n            (4) The Department has formulated a plan for implementing \n        the agreement with Russia through construction of a mixed-oxide \n        fuel fabrication facility and a pit disassembly and conversion \n        facility at the Savannah River Site.\n            (5) The United States and the State of South Carolina have \n        a compelling interest in the safe, proper, and efficient \n        operation of the plutonium disposition facilities at the \n        Savannah River Site. The MOX facility will also be economically \n        beneficial to the State of South Carolina, and that economic \n        benefit will not be fully realized unless the MOX facility is \n        built.\n            (6) The State of South Carolina desires to ensure that all \n        plutonium transferred to the State of South Carolina is stored \n        safely; that the full benefits of the MOX facility are realized \n        as soon as possible; and, specifically, that all defense \n        plutonium or defense plutonium materials transferred to the \n        Savannah River Site either be processed or be removed \n        expeditiously.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) MOX Production Objective Defined.--The term ``MOX production \nobjective'' means production at the MOX facility of mixed-oxide fuel \nfrom defense plutonium and defense plutonium materials at an average \nrate equivalent to not less than one metric ton of mixed-oxide fuel per \nyear. The average rate shall be determined by measuring production at \nthe MOX facility from the date the facility is declared operational to \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission through the date of assessment.\n    (b) MOX Facility Defined.--The term ``MOX facility'' means the \nmixed-oxide fuel fabrication facility at the Savannah River Site, \nAiken, South Carolina.\n    (c) Defense Plutonium and Defense Plutonium Materials Defined.--The \nterm ``defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials'' means \nweapons-usable plutonium.\n\nSEC. 3.
