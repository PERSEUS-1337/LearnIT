FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) many of the crops that humans and livestock consume \n        rely on pollinators for healthy growth;\n            (2) pollination by honey and native bees adds more than \n        $18,000,000,000 annually to the value of United States crops;\n            (3) \\1/3\\ of the food supply of the United States depends \n        on bee pollination, which makes the management and protection \n        of pollinators an issue of paramount importance to the security \n        of the United States food supply system;\n            (4) colony collapse disorder is the name that has been \n        given to the latest die-off of honey bee colonies, exacerbating \n        the continual decline of pollinators in North America;\n            (5) honey bee colonies in more than 23 states have been \n        affected by colony collapse disorder;\n            (6) if the current rate of decline continues, the United \n        States will be forced to rely more heavily on imported foods, \n        which will destabilize the food security of the United States \n        through adverse affects on the availability, price, and quality \n        of the many fruits, vegetables, and other products that depend \n        on animal pollination; and\n            (7) enhanced funding for research on honey bees, native \n        bees, parasites, pathogens, toxins, and other environmental \n        factors affecting bees and pollination of cultivated and wild \n        plants will result in methods of response to colony collapse \n        disorder and other factors causing the decline of pollinators \n        in North America.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) Agricultural Research Service.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the \nAgricultural Research Service--\n            (1) $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012, \n        to be used for new personnel, facilities improvement, and \n        additional research at Department of Agriculture Bee Research \n        Laboratories;\n            (2) $2,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 and 2009, to \n        be used for research on honey and native bee physiology, insect \n        pathology, insect chemical ecology, and honey and native bee \n        toxicology at other Department of Agriculture facilities in New \n        York, Florida, California, Utah, and Texas; and\n            (3) $1,750,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2010, \n        to be used for an area-wide research program to identify causes \n        and solutions for colony collapse disorder in affected States, \n        of which--\n                    (A) $875,000 for each fiscal year shall be used to \n                carry out the program at the bee laboratory of the \n                Agricultural Research Service located in Beltsville, \n                Maryland; and\n                    (B) $875,000 for each fiscal year shall be used to \n                carry out the program at the bee laboratory of the \n                Agricultural Research Service located in Tucson, \n                Arizona.\n    (b) Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service.--\nThere is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Agriculture, \nacting through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension \nService, $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to be \nused to fund Department of Agriculture extension and research grants to \ninvestigate--\n            (1) honey bee biology, immunology, and ecology;\n            (2) honey bee genomics;\n            (3) honey bee bioinformatics;\n            (4) native bee crop pollination and habitat conservation;\n            (5) native bee taxonomy and ecology;\n            (6) pollination biology;\n            (7) sublethal effects of insecticides, herbicides, and \n        fungicides on honey bees, native pollinators, and other \n        beneficial insects;\n            (8) the effects of genetically-modified crops, including \n        the interaction of genetically-modified crops with honey bees \n        and other native pollinators; and\n            (9) honey, bumble, and other native bee parasites and \n        pathogens and effects on other native pollinators.\n    (c) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.--There is \nauthorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting \nthrough the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, $2,250,000 for \neach of fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to conduct a nationwide honey \nbee pest and pathogen surveillance program.\n\nSEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n    The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Agricultural \nResearch Service and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and \nExtension Service, shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the \nHouse of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry of the Senate a report on the status and progress of bee \nresearch projects that are carried out by the Secretary."
