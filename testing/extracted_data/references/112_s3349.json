FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Veterans are at a greater risk of becoming homeless \n        than other people in the United States because of \n        characteristics that include the following:\n                    (A) Having employment-related skills that are \n                unique to military service and that can be difficult to \n                transfer to the civilian sector.\n                    (B) Combat-related health issues.\n                    (C) Earning minimal income or being unemployed.\n                    (D) A shortage of safe, affordable housing.\n            (2) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs estimates the \n        following:\n                    (A) More than 67,000 veterans are homeless on any \n                given night.\n                    (B) About 145,000 veterans experience homelessness \n                each year.\n                    (C) Veterans account for nearly \\1/5\\ of all \n                homeless people in the United States.\n            (3) It is expected that significant increases in services \n        will be needed to serve the aging veterans of the Vietnam War \n        and members of the Armed Forces returning from service in Iraq \n        and Afghanistan.\n            (4) In 2009, the President and the Secretary of Veterans \n        Affairs announced the Federal Government's renewed efforts to \n        address veteran homelessness.\n\nSEC. 3.
