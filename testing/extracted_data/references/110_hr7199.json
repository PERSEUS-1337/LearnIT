Definitions.\nSec. 302. Effective dates.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Congress and the American people desire to live \n        healthy lives and foster an effective and efficient health care \n        system. This system requires timely, accurate, and ever-\n        improving information resources. This will foster maximization \n        of health care outcomes and help health care practitioners and \n        patients partner for more effective results.\n            (2) The Internet is a unique tool offering access to great \n        volumes of information. Some is accurate and some is not. There \n        has also been extensive government investment in placing \n        medical information on the Internet in many diverse places.\n            (3) There is a need to consolidate and translate this \n        myriad of information for physicians and consumers, from the \n        listing of clinical trials to the protocols for treatment of \n        various diseases and conditions, as well as the integration of \n        new discoveries and the evaluations of outcomes-based \n        examinations of drugs and devices for conditions other than \n        those for which they are already approved. This will lead to \n        more accurate treatment, fewer medical errors, and more \n        successful outcomes, while also protecting patients, a \n        physician's right to practice medicine, and a patient's right \n        to access the health care the patient desires.\n            (4) The Food and Drug Administration is uniquely qualified \n        to assist the Nation in fulfilling this mission to improve \n        health care for the benefit of Americans. The Administration \n        already coordinates the information needs of many government \n        agencies and equivalent regulatory bodies in other countries.\n            (5) In providing Internet-based forums for obtaining and \n        disseminating health-related information (including information \n        on surgical procedures; complimentary and alternative medicine; \n        dietary supplements and food; and unapproved treatments), the \n        Food and Drug Administration should work closely with \n        educational institutions, schools of medicine, and other \n        appropriate private entities and ensure that the expertise of \n        such entities is appropriately utilized.\n\n  TITLE I--FEDERAL INTERNET SITE FOR CONSOLIDATION AND TRANSLATION OF \n              INFORMATION ON DISEASES AND OTHER CONDITIONS\n\nSEC. 101.
