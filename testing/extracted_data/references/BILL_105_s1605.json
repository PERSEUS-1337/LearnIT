FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n        (1) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed in \n    the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n    enforcement officer in the United States had the protection of an \n    armor vest;\n        (2) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, 709 law \n    enforcement officers in the United States were feloniously killed \n    in the line of duty;\n        (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the risk \n    of fatality to law enforcement officers while not wearing an armor \n    vest is 14 times higher than for officers wearing an armor vest;\n        (4) the Department of Justice estimates that approximately \n    150,000 State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, nearly \n    25 percent, are not issued body armor;\n        (5) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, bullet-\n    resistant materials helped save the lives of more than 2,000 law \n    enforcement officers in the United States; and\n        (6) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law Enforcement \n    Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian country has risen \n    sharply, despite a decrease in the national crime rate, and has \n    concluded that there is a ``public safety crisis in Indian \n    country''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of law \nenforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal law \nenforcement agencies provide officers with armor vests.\n\nSEC. 3.
