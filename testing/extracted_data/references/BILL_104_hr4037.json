FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Article 32 of the United Nations Convention on the \n        Rights of the Child recognizes ``the right of the child to be \n        protected from economic exploitation and from performing any \n        work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the \n        child's education or to be harmful to the child's health or \n        physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''.\n            (2) Article 2 of Convention 138 of the International Labor \n        Organization, the Minimum Age Convention, states that the \n        minimum age for admission to employment or work ``shall not be \n        less than the age of completion of compulsory schooling and, in \n        any case, shall not be less than 15 years.''.\n            (3) Convention 29 of International Labor Organization, the \n        Forced Labor Convention, which has been in effect since 1930, \n        prohibits most forms of ``forced or compulsory labor'', \n        including all forced labor by people under the age of 18.\n            (4) Although it is among the most universally condemned of \n        all human rights abuses, child labor is widely practiced. The \n        International Labor Organization has estimated the total number \n        of child workers to be between 100,000,000 and 200,000,000. \n        More than 95 percent of those child workers live in developing \n        countries.\n            (5) The International Labor Organization has estimated that \n        13.2 percent of all children 10 to 14 years of age around the \n        world were economically active in 1995. There are no reliable \n        figures on workers under 10 years of age, though their numbers \n        are known to be significant. Reliable child labor statistics \n        are not readily available, in part because many governments in \n        the developing world are reluctant to document those \n        activities, which are often illegal under domestic laws, which \n        violate international standards, and which may be perceived as \n        a failure of internal public policy.\n            (6) Notwithstanding international and domestic \n        prohibitions, many children in developing countries are forced \n        to work as debt-bonded and slave laborers in hazardous and \n        exploitative industries. According to the United Nations \n        Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery and the \n        International Labor Organization, there are tens of millions of \n        child slaves in the world today. Large numbers of those slaves \n        are involved in agricultural and domestic labor, the sex \n        industry, the carpet and textile industries, and quarrying and \n        brick making.\n            (7) In many countries, children lack either the legal \n        standing or the means to protect themselves from cruelty and \n        exploitation in the workplace.\n            (8) The employment of children often interferes with the \n        opportunities of such children for basic education. \n        Furthermore, where it coexists with high rates of adult \n        unemployment, the use of child labor likely denies gainful \n        employment to millions of adults.\n            (9) While child labor is a complex and multifaceted \n        phenomenon that is tied to issues of poverty, educational \n        opportunity, and culture, its most abusive and hazardous forms \n        are repugnant to basic human rights and must be eliminated.\n\nSEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND INDUSTRIES THAT USE \n              CHILD LABOR IN PRODUCING GOODS.\n\n    (a) Identification of Countries and Industries.--The Secretary of \nLabor shall, not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act, and not later than the end of each 1-year period thereafter, \nidentify those foreign countries that do not prohibit child labor, or \nthat have laws prohibiting child labor but do not effectively enforce \nthem, and those industries in such countries in which goods are \nproduced or services provided with the use of child labor. The \nSecretary may revoke the identification of a country or an industry \nbefore the end of the 1-year period during which the identification \nwould otherwise be effective, if revocation is warranted by new \ninformation or a change in the laws or practices of a country.\n    (b) Sanctions.--The sanctions set forth in section 4 shall apply \nwith respect to those countries and industries identified under \nsubsection (a) for so long as the identification is effective under \nsuch subsection.\n    (c) Exemption.--The prohibition under section 4(a)(1)(B) on \nactivities of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the \nprohibition under section 4(a)(1)(C) on activities of the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation, and the prohibition on multilateral \nassistance under section 4(a)(2) shall not apply with respect to a \nbusiness entity if it is established to the satisfaction of the \nSecretary of Labor that no goods produced by that entity are products \nof child labor and that the business entity does not otherwise use \nchild labor.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON ASSISTANCE FOR FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT USE CHILD \n              LABOR IN PRODUCING GOODS.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Assistance.--\n            (1) Bilateral assistance.--\n                    (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (C), the \n                President may not provide to a foreign country \n                identified by the Secretary of Labor under section \n                3(a)--\n                            (i) any assistance under the Foreign \n                        Assistance Act of 1961, other than--\n                                    (I) disaster relief assistance, \n                                including any assistance under chapter \n                                9 of part I of such Act;\n                                    (II) assistance which involves the \n                                provision of food (including \n                                monetization of food) or medicine; and\n                                    (III) assistance for refugees;\n                            (ii) sales, or financing on any terms, \n                        under the Arms Export Control Act; and\n                            (iii) the provision of agricultural \n                        commodities, other than food, under the \n                        Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n                        Act of 1954.\n                    (B) Export-import bank.--The Export-Import Bank of \n                the United States may not give approval to the issuance \n                of any guarantee, insurance, extension of credit, or \n                participation in an extension of credit in connection \n                with the provision of any good or service to--\n                            (i) the government of a foreign country \n                        identified by the Secretary of Labor under \nsection 3(a), or an agency of such government; or\n                            (ii) a business entity that is in an \n                        industry identified by the Secretary of Labor \n                        under section 3(a) in such a country.\n                    (C) Overseas private investment corporation.--(i) \n                The Overseas Private Investment Corporation may not \n                issue insurance, reinsurance, or financing, or conduct \n                other activities, in connection with an industry \n                identified by the Secretary of Labor under section \n                3(a).\n                    (ii) Clause (i) does not affect contracts entered \n                into by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation \n                before the date of the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Multilateral assistance.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n        shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each \n        international financial institution to use the voice and vote \n        of the United States to oppose any loan or other use of the \n        funds of such institution to or for any industry identified by \n        the Secretary of Labor under section 3(a).\n    (b) Exception.--A foreign country or an industry identified by the \nSecretary of Labor under section 3(a) may receive bilateral assistance \ndescribed in subsection (a)(1) if the President determines and \ncertifies to the Congress that it is in the vital national interest of \nthe United States to provide such bilateral assistance to such country \nor industry, as the case may be.
