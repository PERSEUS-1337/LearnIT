FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Students from low-income families are 6 times more \n        likely to attend high-poverty schools than their more affluent \n        peers.\n            ``(2) Racial diversity in schools results in long-term \n        social and academic benefits, including reduced neighborhood, \n        college, and workplace segregation, higher levels of social \n        cohesion, a reduced likelihood of racial prejudice, and the \n        development of skills to navigate and find comfort in racially \n        diverse settings.\n            ``(3) Students from low-income families who attend more \n        affluent elementary schools are more likely to perform better \n        academically than similar students who attend high-poverty \n        schools.\n            ``(4) Students who attend the most affluent schools are \n        nearly 70 percent more likely to attend college than students \n        who attend the highest-poverty schools, regardless of their \n        socioeconomic background.\n            ``(5) Students who attend racially and socioeconomically \n        isolated schools have less access to experienced and qualified \n        teachers, advanced coursework, high-quality instructional \n        materials, and adequate facilities.\n            ``(6) According to the Government Accountability Office, as \n        of the 2013-14 school year, 16 percent of our Nation's public \n        elementary schools and secondary schools served student \n        populations comprised of 75 percent or more Black and Hispanic \n        students and 75 percent or more students eligible for free or \n        reduced-price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National \n        School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), an increase of more \n        than 9 percent compared to the percentage of such elementary \n        and secondary schools in the 2000-2001 school year. More than \n        7,700,000 Black students and 12,300,000 Hispanic students \n        attend racially and socioeconomically isolated public \n        elementary schools and secondary schools.\n    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this part is to support the \ndevelopment, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive strategies \nto address the effects of concentrated poverty or racial isolation by \nincreasing diversity, including socioeconomic diversity or racial \ndiversity, in publicly funded early childhood education programs and \npublic elementary schools and secondary schools.\n\n``SEC. 4552.
