Membership, duties, provisions for chairman \nand vice-chairman, terms, expense allowances and compensation shall be \nsimilar to that of the Technology Assessment Advisory Council of the \nOffice of Technology Assessment. The Council will advise the Board on \nresearch priorities and methods which are the most promising and cost \neffective to pursue and keep itself informed on the state-of-the-art of \nopinion research, including such developments as interactive TV, \nelectronic fora and town meetings, computer network conferencing, and \nall methods for enhancing democracy in this and other countries.\n\nSEC. 6. EXPERT PANELS.\n\n    An expert, ad hoc panel will be set up by the Director for each \nsurvey to assist in the design and analysis. Members of these panels \nwill be experts in the issues of the survey and represent a full range \nof scientific expertise, approaches, and viewpoints on alternative \ncourses for dealing with the issue in its various aspects and including \nall major policy alternatives. A report will be prepared in a timely \nfashion at the conclusion of each survey including a master \nquestionnaire, containing the questions as asked with frequencies or \npercentage responses, and an analysis prepared by the advisory panel \nwith the assistance of in-house or contractor personnel.\n\nSEC. 7. PUBLIC RELEASE.\n\n    The survey report and all other survey data (including the \nmethodology used and an analysis of the probable accuracy and estimates \nof the probable errors both because of sampling error and all other \ncauses) will be made public in a timely manner to the news media and to \norganizations and individuals specializing in public policy or public \nopinion. The other survey data will be available in written form as a \ndata book and in electronic form as complete data discs readable by \npersonal computers suitable for statistical analysis in standard \nfashion and will be provided on request to anyone at a reasonable cost \nadequate to cover the full marginal cost of production and \ndistribution.\n\nSEC. 8. METHODOLOGY.\n\n    The surveys will test the degree of public support for alternative \npolicy proposals when the survey respondents are informed in a fair, \nbalanced, and accurate manner with relevant facts. The surveys will not \nonly test support for various policy proposals, but also seek to \ndetermine how important various pieces of information, including \nbalanced sets of arguments for and against the proposal, turn out to be \nin determining that support. Depending on available funds to pay for \nthe interviewing and analyzing of statistically adequate oversamples, \nsome surveys will also endeavor to determine statistically significant \ndifferences between the national sample and State or district samples, \nparticularly in those issue areas where particular regions, States, or \ndistricts are expected to have different opinions because of the nature \nof the issue.\n\nSEC. 9. METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH.\n\n    (a) In General.--The surveys will experiment with innovative \ntechnology, hardware, and software, including electronic media, digital \nand fiber optics networks, both with independent telephone interviewing \nand supplemented by and in conjunction with face-to-face interviewing \nand television programming that attempts to create the group \ninteractivity, issue-defining, agenda-setting and consensus-building of \nwhat has come to be called the electronic town meeting, as any of these \ntechniques and methodologies show promise of improving the ability of \nthe Office to accomplish its purposes. The surveys will be designed not \nonly to obtain the policy views of the public but also--\n            (1) to test various concepts about how best to design, \n        formulate, word, and include in the survey as it is spoken, \n        shown, or read by interviewers, whether from CATI (Computer \n        Assisted Telephone Interviewing) screens or by other means, the \n        required factual information and pro and con arguments; and\n            (2) to determine the direction and degree to which doing \n        this in different ways affects the results of the surveys.\n    (b) Sensitivity Analysis Research.--Sensitivity analysis research \nwill also be performed which will determine the degree to which \nimbalance in the amount and quality of factual information and in the \nbias created by cuing and permission language affects survey data. Such \nresearch shall be designed to lead to a better understanding of the \naffects of question design, menu choices, and implicit or unstated \nassumptions or survey researchers.\n    (c) Interaction Testing.--Surveys will also test the degree of \ninteraction that works best--i.e., is most informative of the public \nposition--at different stages in the designers' understanding of the \npublic view in the issue.\n\nSEC. 10. APPROPRIATION FOR THE OFFICE AND PARTIAL RESCISSION OF \n              APPROPRIATIONS FOR SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n              MAIL COSTS.\n\n    (a) Appropriation.--There is appropriated, out of any money in the \nTreasury not otherwise appropriated, $10,000,000 for the Congressional \nOffice for Public Opinion Research and Assessment for fiscal year 1994.\n    (b) Rescissions.--Of the funds appropriated in the Legislative \nBranch Appropriations Act, 1994, for the Senate under the heading \n``official mail costs'', there is rescinded the sum of $5,000,000.
