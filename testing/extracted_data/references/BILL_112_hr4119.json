FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Trafficking and smuggling organizations are intensifying \n    their efforts to enter the United States through tunnels and other \n    subterranean passages between Mexico and the United States.\n        (2) Border tunnels are most often used to transport narcotics \n    from Mexico to the United States, but can also be used to transport \n    people and other contraband.\n        (3) From Fiscal Year 1990 to Fiscal Year 2011, law enforcement \n    authorities discovered 149 cross-border tunnels along the border \n    between Mexico and the United States, 139 of which have been \n    discovered since Fiscal Year 2001. There has been a dramatic \n    increase in the number of cross-border tunnels discovered in \n    Arizona and California since Fiscal Year 2006, with 40 tunnels \n    discovered in California and 74 tunnels discovered in Arizona.\n        (4) Section 551 of the Department of Homeland Security \n    Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 109-295) added a new section \n    to title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 555), which--\n            (A) criminalizes the construction or financing of an \n        unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an \n        international border into the United States; and\n            (B) prohibits any person from recklessly permitting others \n        to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean \n        passage on the person's land.\n        (5) Any person convicted of using a tunnel or subterranean \n    passage to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or illegal \n    goods is subject to an enhanced sentence for the underlying \n    offense. Additional sentence enhancements would further deter \n    tunnel activities and increase prosecutorial options.\nSEC. 3. ATTEMPT OR CONSPIRACY TO USE, CONSTRUCT, OR FINANCE A BORDER \nTUNNEL.\n    Section 555 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(d) Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense \nunder subsection (a) or subsection (c) of this section shall be subject \nto the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the \ncommission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.''.\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR INTERCEPTION OF WIRE, ORAL, OR ELECTRONIC \nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n    Section 2516(1)(c) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \ninserting ``, section 555 (relating to construction or use of \ninternational border tunnels)'' before the semicolon at the end.\nSEC. 5. FORFEITURE.\n    Section 982(a)(2)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \ninserting ``555,'' after ``545,''.\nSEC. 6. MONEY LAUNDERING DESIGNATION.\n    Section 1956(c)(7)(D) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \nby inserting ``section 555 (relating to border tunnels),'' after \n``section 554 (relating to smuggling goods from the United States),''.\nSEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n        (1) success in combating the construction and use of cross-\n    border tunnels requires cooperation between Federal, State, local, \n    and tribal officials and assistance from private land owners and \n    tenants across the border between Mexico and the United States;\n        (2) the Department of Homeland Security is currently engaging \n    in outreach efforts in California to certain landowners and tenants \n    along the border to educate them about cross-border tunnels and \n    seek their assistance in combating their construction; and\n        (3) the Department should continue its outreach efforts to both \n    private and governmental landowners and tenants in areas along the \n    border between Mexico and the United States with a high rate of \n    cross-border tunnels.\nSEC. 8. REPORT.\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit an \nannual report to the congressional committees set forth in subsection \n(b) that includes a description of--\n        (1) the cross-border tunnels along the border between Mexico \n    and the United States discovered during the preceding fiscal year; \n    and\n        (2) the needs of the Department of Homeland Security to \n    effectively prevent, investigate and prosecute border tunnel \n    construction along the border between Mexico and the United States.\n    (b) Congressional Committees.--The congressional committees set \nforth in this subsection are--\n        (1) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n    of the Senate;\n        (2) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n        (3) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;\n        (4) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n    Representatives;\n        (5) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n    Representatives; and\n        (6) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n    Representatives.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
