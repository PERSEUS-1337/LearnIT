    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Cancer \nPatient Database and Coverage Act of 2009''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Each year, more than 1.4 million Americans receive a \n        cancer diagnosis, and more than 11 million Americans are \n        currently living with cancer.\n            (2) Newly diagnosed cancer patients need access to quality \n        health care from the time of diagnosis to ensure the best \n        possible outcome, and those entering the period of survivorship \n        require active monitoring and follow-up care related to effects \n        of cancer treatment and possible second cancers.\n            (3) More than 47 million Americans have no health \n        insurance, and this number includes many who will be diagnosed \n        with cancer this year.\n            (4) Among the non-elderly who receive a cancer diagnosis, \n        more than 10 percent are uninsured, and among minority \n        populations the percentage of uninsured cancer patients is \n        higher.\n            (5) Those with no insurance receive less cancer care and \n        receive it later: they have lower rates of cancer screening, \n        experience delays in follow-up after abnormal test results, and \n        are diagnosed at a more advanced stage of disease.\n            (6) Uninsured cancer patients receive less care than the \n        insured, and they may face substantial medical expenses leading \n        to bankruptcy.\n            (7) Young adults have worse cancer outcomes than young \n        children or older adults; experts believe part of the \n        discrepancy in cancer outcomes can be attributed to the fact \n        this population is less likely to be insured than others.\n            (8) The Medicare program is a source of medical insurance \n        for more than half of all cancer patients.\n            (9) The Medicare program eliminates financial barriers to \n        care for its beneficiaries and provides quality care to cancer \n        patients.\n            (10) Access to care, better cancer outcomes, and protection \n        from devastating out-of-pocket medical expenses could be \n        assured to cancer patients by providing all diagnosed with \n        cancer the opportunity to enroll in Medicare.\n\nSEC. 2. IMPROVING CANCER DATABASE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \ncollect such additional data as may be necessary to update existing \ndatabases that contain data regarding individuals with cancer in the \nUnited States in order to provide for accurate information of the \nnumber of such individuals, the types and stages of cancer, and the \nefficacy of different treatments for the types and stages of cancer.\n    (b) Data.--The database under subsection (a) shall include \ninformation to monitor an individual's full experience with cancer \nbased upon the stage of the cancer, from the initial diagnosis to early \nand continued treatment until elimination of evidence of cancer or \ndeath.\n    (c) Increased Funding.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \nthe National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health \nsuch additional funding as may be necessary to apply the information in \nthe database for improved research and treatment of cancer, including \nproviding physicians with timely information on outcomes to improve the \ntreatment of cancer and to promote increased quality care.\n\nSEC. 3.
