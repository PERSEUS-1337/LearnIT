FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to a 2013 Census Bureau study, women's \n        representation in STEM occupations has increased since the \n        1970s, but women remain significantly underrepresented in \n        engineering and computing occupations that make up more than 80 \n        percent of all STEM employment. Women's representation in \n        computer occupations has declined since the 1990s. In 2011, 26 \n        percent of STEM workers were women. According to the National \n        Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, Inc., the number \n        of engineering degrees awarded to African-American women has \n        steadily declined since the late 1990s.\n            (2) According to the Brookings Institution 2013 report, \n        ``The Hidden STEM Economy'', half of all STEM jobs are \n        available to workers without a 4-year college degree, and these \n        jobs pay $53,000 per year on average. This sector of the STEM \n        economy offers job opportunities for many workers with \n        qualified certificates or associate degrees, drawing from high \n        schools, workforce training programs, career and technical \n        education schools, and community colleges. Despite these \n        opportunities, only \\1/5\\ of the $4,300,000,000 spent annually \n        by the Federal Government on STEM education and training goes \n        towards supporting training below the baccalaureate degree \n        level.\n            (3) According to a 2011 report by the Department of \n        Commerce, underrepresented minorities account for only 3 out of \n        10 professionals in STEM fields.\n            (4) STEM workers in all demographic groups earn more than \n        their non-STEM counterparts.\n            (5) According to the Afterschool Alliance 2014 report, \n        ``America After 3pm'', children from African-American, \n        Hispanic, and Native American populations participate in \n        afterschool programs at higher rates than the national average \n        participation rate. Girls also participate in equal numbers to \n        boys in such programs. Afterschool learning thus represents an \n        intervention point to engage with populations currently \n        underrepresented in STEM fields and careers.\n\nSEC. 3.
