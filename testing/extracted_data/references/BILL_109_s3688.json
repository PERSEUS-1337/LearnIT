Soledad Veterans Memorial has proudly stood \n        overlooking San Diego, California, for over 52 years as a \n        tribute to the members of the United States Armed Forces who \n        sacrificed their lives in the defense of the United States.\n            (2) The Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial was dedicated on \n        April 18, 1954, as ``a lasting memorial to the dead of the \n        First and Second World Wars and the Korean conflict'' and now \n        serves as a memorial to American veterans of all wars, \n        including the War on Terrorism.\n            (3) The United States has a long history and tradition of \n        memorializing members of the Armed Forces who die in battle \n        with a cross or other religious emblem of their faith, and a \n        memorial cross is fully integrated as the centerpiece of the \n        multi-faceted Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial that is replete \n        with secular symbols.\n            (4) The patriotic and inspirational symbolism of the Mt. \n        Soledad Veterans Memorial provides solace to the families and \n        comrades of the veterans it memorializes.\n            (5) The Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial has been recognized \n        by Congress as a National Veterans Memorial and is considered a \n        historically significant national memorial.\n            (6) 76 percent of the voters of San Diego supported \n        donating the Mt. Soledad Memorial to the Federal Government \n        only to have a superior court judge of the State of California \n        invalidate that election.\n            (7) The City of San Diego has diligently pursued every \n        possible legal recourse in order to preserve the Mt. Soledad \n        Veterans Memorial in its entirety for persons who have served \n        in the Armed Forces and those persons who will serve and \n        sacrifice in the future.\n            (8) Congressional action is now necessary because the City \n        of San Diego is under a district court order to remove the \n        Memorial Cross from city property by August 1, 2006.\n\nSEC. 2.
