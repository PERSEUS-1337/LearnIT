FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Under the timber management policy of nondeclining even \n        flow, articulated in section 13(a) of the Forest and Rangeland \n        Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, the allowable sale \n        quantity for a national forest is a function of total timber \n        growth, which depends on available timberland area and the rate \n        of timber growth.\n            (2) Protecting the northern spotted owl and other factors \n        will lead to reductions in the Federal land available for \n        timber harvesting, leading to declines in harvests and to \n        undesirable declines in timber industry employment.\n            (3) Increases in timber management investments on Federal \n        and other lands not protected as spotted owl habitat could \n        offset some of the declines in allowable sale quantities \n        resulting from spotted owl protection.\n            (4) No separate studies of timber management investment \n        opportunities on Federal timberlands have been conducted for \n        more than a decade.\n            (5) The fund established by section 3 of the Act of June 9, \n        1930 (16 U.S.C. 576b; commonly referred to as the ``K-V \n        fund''), was originally established to assure adequate funding \n        for timber management investments for the national forests, but \n        since 1976, substantial and increasing portions of this fund \n        have been used for wildlife habitat improvement, watershed \n        improvement, and other nontimber resource projects.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) identify and examine timber management investment \n        opportunities on Federal timberlands in the States of \n        California, Oregon, and Washington;\n            (2) expand financial assistance programs for timber \n        investments on non-Federal timberlands in the States of \n        California, Oregon, and Washington; and\n            (3) assure that amounts from the fund established by \n        section 3 of the Act of June 9, 1930, are available for timber \n        management investments on Federal timberlands, consistent with \n        the original intent of that Act.\n\nSEC. 3. TIMBER MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT STUDY.\n\n    (a) Yields and Costs Report.--The Secretary of Agriculture, acting \nthrough the Forest Service, and the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Land Management, shall each prepare a report \ndisplaying the yields and costs, both financial and environmental, of \ntimber management investment opportunities for lands under their \nrespective jurisdictions in the States of California, Oregon, and \nWashington. Timber management investment opportunities considered shall \ninclude--\n            (1) reforestation, including site preparation, direct \n        seeding, planting, and interplanting; and\n            (2) timber stand improvement, including release (manual, \n        chemical, and mechanical), fertilization, pruning, \n        precommercial thinning, and commercial thinning.\n    (b) Land and Forest Class.--The report prepared under subsection \n(a) shall present the yield and cost information for each of the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Timber site productivity class.\n            (2) Current forest condition class, including old-growth, \n        second-growth, sawtimber, poletimber, saplings, seedlings, and \n        nonstock.\n            (3) Land suitability allocation for timber production under \n        the appropriate forest plan.\n    (c) Lands Classified As Unsuitable For Timber Production.--The \nSecretary of Agriculture shall include in the report required by this \nsection--\n            (1) the reasons why lands in Forest Service Regions 5 and 6 \n        are classified as not suitable for timber production pursuant \n        to the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning of \n        1974, distinguishing among timber site productivity classes and \n        current forest conditions; and\n            (2) the specific identity of those lands deemed to be \n        unsuitable for timber production solely due to difficulties in \n        meeting the reforestation requirements of the Forest and \n        Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, and a \n        description of those difficulties.\n    (d) Exchange and Consolidation of Lands.--In addition to other \nmatters required to be included in the study under this section, the \nstudy shall address opportunities for land exchanges with private \nlandowners to consolidate Federal landholdings in the States of \nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington to enhance reforestation and timber \nstand improvement.\n    (e) Advisory Boards.--In order to assure a comprehensive and \nunbiased report on the costs and yields of timber management investment \nopportunities, the Secretary of Agriculture on a forest-by-forest basis \nin Forest Service Regions 5 and 6, and the Secretary of the Interior on \na district-by-district basis for the Bureau of Land Management \ndistricts subject to this Act, shall establish and consult with \nadvisory boards before releasing a draft of the report required by \nsubsection (a) to the public. The advisory boards shall be comprised of \nindividuals who, in the appropriate Secretary's judgment, represent a \ndiversity of views. The appropriate Secretaries shall provide the \nadvisory boards with the opportunity to review and comment on the \npractices and investments being examined under subsection (a) and on \nthe draft of the report before its release to the public. The Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act shall not apply to advisory boards established \nunder this subsection.\n    (f) Consultation With Private and Other Public Timberland Owners.--\n(1) In preparing the report required under subsection (a), the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior shall \nconsult with private and other public timberland owners in the general \nvicinity of the forest or district, as appropriate, to--\n            (A) identify possible timber management investments and \n        practices, and\n            (B) identify potential costs and yields of those \n        investments and practices.\n    (2) The report shall include information gathered under this \nsubsection in a manner which protects the proprietary nature of \ncorporate cost information and the cost and yield estimates of the \nSecretaries.\n    (g) Date of Submission.--The report required by this section shall \nbe submitted to the Congress within 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. PRIVATE FOREST LANDS.\n\n    Section 4 of the Cooperative Forest Assistance Act of 1978 (16 \nU.S.C. 2103) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(l) Of the amounts appropriated to carry out this section, not \nless than $1,500,000 shall be made available for assistance under this \nsection in each of the States of California, Oregon, and Washington for \nplanning, reforestation, and timber stand improvement practices to \nfurther second growth management of timber resources to offset the \nexpected decline in timber harvests from Federal lands as a result of \nlisting the northern spotted owl as a threatened species under the \nEndangered Species Act of 1973. Such assistance shall be concentrated \nin those counties containing Federal lands designated as habitat \nconservation areas for the purposes of the protection and recovery of \nthe northern spotted owl.''.\n\nSEC. 5. KNUTSON-VANDENBERG ACT.\n\n    (a) Reforestation of BLM Lands.--Section 3 of the Act of June 9, \n1930 (16 U.S.C. 576b) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a)'' after ``Sec. 3.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Subsection (a) shall apply with respect to the lands \nadministered by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of \nLand Management in the same manner as such subsection applies with \nrespect to national forest lands.''.\n    (b) Reforestation Under the K-V Act.--Section 3(a) of the Act of \nJune 9, 1930 (16 U.S.C. 576b), as amended by subsection (a) of this \nAct, is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``or'' before ``(3)''; and\n            (2) by striking ``timber, or (4)'' and all that follows \n        through ``Provided,'' and inserting ``timber: Provided,''."
