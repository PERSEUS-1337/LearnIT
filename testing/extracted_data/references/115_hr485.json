CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) while significant progress has occurred due to the \n        antidiscrimination amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, \n        barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for candidates \n        reflective of gender diversity and racial or ethnic diversity \n        for Federal Reserve bank president positions in the Federal \n        Reserve System;\n            (2) the continuing barriers described in paragraph (1) \n        merit the following amendment;\n            (3) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and \n        documentation of the historical lack of gender, racial, and \n        ethnic diversity from numerous sources, including congressional \n        hearings, scientific reports, reports issued by public and \n        private agencies, news stories, and reports of related barriers \n        by organizations and individuals, which show that \n        race-, ethnicity-, and gender-neutral efforts alone are \n        insufficient to address the problem;\n            (4) the testimony and documentation described in paragraph \n        (3) demonstrate that barriers across the United States prove \n        problematic for full and fair participation in developing \n        monetary policy by individuals reflective of gender diversity \n        and racial or ethnic diversity; and\n            (5) the testimony and documentation described in paragraph \n        (3) provide a strong basis that there is a compelling need for \n        the below amendment to address the historical lack of gender, \n        racial, and ethnic diversity in the Federal Reserve regional \n        bank presidents selection process in the Federal Reserve \n        System.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK PRESIDENTS.\n\n    The provision designated ``fifth'' of the fourth undesignated \nparagraph of section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 341) is \namended by inserting after ``employees.'' the following: ``In making \nthe appointment of a president, the bank shall interview at least one \nindividual reflective of gender diversity and one individual reflective \nof racial or ethnic diversity.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
