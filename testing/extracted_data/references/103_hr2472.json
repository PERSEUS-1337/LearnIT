This Act may be cited as the ``Information Dissemination \nand Research Accountability Act''.\n\n                          findings and purpose\n\n    Sec. 2. (a) The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal Government must, for the public good, bear \n        the responsibility for making the results of biomedical \n        research readily and economically accessible in a form that \n        maximizes its usefulness to the research community, reviewers \n        of research proposals, and other individuals involved in the \n        Federal funding of research proposals;\n            (2) with the present inefficient system of storage and \n        dissemination of biomedical information, most biomedical \n        researchers and Federal agencies cannot readily and \n        economically obtain the full-text results, current and \n        archival, of research that has been or is being performed;\n            (3) the inability of the research community to obtain full-\n        text results of such research promotes duplicative research;\n            (4) overwhelming numbers of laboratory animals are used in \n        duplicative research because of the research community's \n        inability to determine what research has been performed;\n            (5) because of a lack of funding, the National Library of \n        Medicine of the Department of Health and Human Services has not \n        met the needs of the biomedical research community;\n            (6) the failure of the Federal Government to fund \n        adequately the National Library of Medicine has resulted in the \n        Library's inability to support effectively the creation of new \n        information for use in teaching and demonstrations, including \n        audiovisual aids and computer graphics;\n            (7) the failure of the Federal Government to support \n        adequately the storage and dissemination of full-text \n        biomedical information has been devastating to the Nation's \n        medical libraries, forcing them to terminate the acquisition of \n        costly printed material;\n            (8) the amount of biomedical information is so vast and is \n        increasing at such a rate that traditional methods of \n        information storage and dissemination are no longer efficient \n        or effective;\n            (9) modern technology, including optical videodiscs, can be \n        used for storage of whole libraries of full-text biomedical \n        information in a relatively small space;\n            (10) these modern technologies are easily and economically \n        reproducible for distribution to all of the Nation's medical \n        libraries for the immediate use of the scientific community; \n        and\n            (11) the benefits of developing a modern, efficient, and \n        economical full-text biomedical information storage and \n        dissemination system are--\n                    (A) the advancement of scientific knowledge;\n                    (B) the savings to the taxpayers by preventing \n                duplicative research; and\n                    (C) the sparing of millions of laboratory animals \n                from suffering, fear, and death in duplicative \n                research.\n    (b) The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) establish a National Center for Research \n        Accountability;\n            (2) provide for a comprehensive, full-text literature \n        search before the approval of Federal funding for any research \n        proposal involving the use of live animals;\n            (3) prevent duplicative experimentation or testing on live \n        animals;\n            (4) promote the advancement and use of modern technologies \n        with respect to the storage and dissemination of biomedical \n        information;\n            (5) provide, through grants, awards, and stipends, for \n        training of additional biomedical information specialists in \n        such modern technologies;\n            (6) make available at a reasonable cost the full-text \n        results of biomedical research, current and archival, to the \n        Nation's medical libraries for use by the scientific community; \n        and\n            (7) promote the creation and use of modern technologies, \n        including audiovisual aids and computer graphics, for teaching \n        and demonstrations.\n\n            the national center for research accountability\n\n    Sec. 3. (a)(1) In order to create an independent center to assist \nin eliminating duplication of effort in Federal research proposals \ninvolving live animals, there is hereby established a National Center \nfor Research Accountability.\n    (2) Such Center shall be located at the National Library of \nMedicine and utilize the facilities of the Library in accordance with \nsubsection (d).\n    (b)(1) The President shall appoint twenty persons to serve as \nmembers of the Center and carry out the responsibilities of the Center \nas described in subsection (f). The terms of such appointments shall be \nfor a period of time which the President determines is necessary to \nassure that the members will serve long enough to provide adequate \ncontinuity of effort within the Center but also provide for periodic \nappointment of new persons as members.\n    (2) Such appointments shall be made without regard to political \naffiliation and solely on the basis of demonstrated ability to carry \nout the responsibilities of the Center.\n    (3) A person appointed to the Center may be removed only by the \nPresident.\n    (4) Such persons shall be experts in the biomedical information \nsciences and, at the time of such appointment, be employed by a Federal \nagency in a capacity which qualifies them to make determinations with \nrespect to whether research proposals involving live animals are \nduplicative of other research efforts. In making such appointments, the \nPresident shall, to the extent practicable, appoint representatives \nfrom each Federal agency which funds research on live animals.\n    (5) Such persons shall perform their duties at the Center on a \nfull-time basis and, while performing such duties, shall be considered \nto be employees of the Federal agencies which employed them at the time \nof their appointment to the Center.\n    (c)(1) The President shall appoint as the Director of the Center a \nqualified biomedical information science expert who, at the time of \nsuch appointment, serves in an administrative position as a Federal \nemployee.\n    (2) Such person shall perform his or her duties on a full-time \nbasis, and while performing such duties, shall be considered to be an \nemployee of the Federal agency which employed him or her at the time of \nthe appointment to the Center.\n    (3) Such appointment shall be made for a term established by the \nPresident and shall be made without regard to political affiliation and \nsolely on the basis of demonstrated ability to serve as a chief \nadministrative officer.\n    (4) The Director may be removed only by the President.\n    (5) The Director may, to the extent approved by the President and \nin appropriation Acts, appoint a clerical staff, or to the extent \napproved by the President after consultation with the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, the Director may utilize the clerical staff \nof the National Library of Medicine.\n    (d) The President shall, after consultation with the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, provide for adequate office space for the \nCenter within the facilities of the National Library of Medicine and, \nto the extent approved in appropriation Acts, provide for such \nequipment, office supplies, and communications facilities and services \nas may be necessary for the operation of the Center.\n    (e)(1) No Federal agency may carry out or fund any research \nproposal involving live animals unless the proposal is submitted to the \nCenter in accordance with paragraph (2).\n    (2) Following approval by a Federal agency of a research proposal \ninvolving live animals, but prior to the agency's carrying out or \nmaking a commitment to award funding for such proposal, such proposal \nshall be submitted by the agency to the Center to ascertain whether \nsuch proposal is essentially duplicative of other research completed or \nin process.\n    (f) If the members of the Center determine, in accordance with \nguidelines prescribed by the President, that such proposal is \nessentially duplicative of other research completed or in process, no \nFederal funding may be utilized with respect to such project.\n    (g) To assist in carrying out its responsibilities for conducting \ncomprehensive full-text literature searches, as it makes determinations \nunder subsection (f), the Center may, to the extent approved in \nappropriation Acts, award contracts to private entities. The President \nshall establish rules for the purpose of precluding any conflict of \ninterest with respect to the awarding of such contracts.\n    (h) The President may appoint persons to serve, without \ncompensation, as advisors to the members of the Center.\n    (i) The Center shall transmit an annual report to the President and \nto both Houses of the Congress summarizing action it has taken in \nfulfilling its responsibilities under this Act.\n\n modernization of biomedical information storage and dissemination by \n                    the national library of medicine\n\n    Sec. 4.
