FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) safe and clean drinking water is essential to the \n        health, well-being, comfort, and standard of living of every \n        person of the United States;\n            (2) emerging contaminants in drinking water systems are \n        increasingly being detected at low levels;\n            (3) prolonged exposure to unregulated drinking water \n        contaminants, including emerging contaminants, may pose human \n        health risks, particularly to vulnerable populations;\n            (4) the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), \n        requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency--\n                    (A) to periodically make regulatory determinations \n                with respect to unregulated contaminants; and\n                    (B) not less frequently than once every 5 years, to \n                identify and publish a description of unregulated \n                contaminants that may require regulation;\n            (5) in a 2011 report of the Government Accountability \n        Office, the Comptroller General of the United States found, \n        with respect to unregulated drinking water contaminants, that--\n                    (A) the Administrator has made limited progress in \n                prioritizing drinking water contaminants based on \n                greatest public health concern;\n                    (B) the lack of data relating to the exposure of \n                the public to potentially harmful drinking water \n                contaminants and the related health effects of that \n                exposure continues to limit the ability of the \n                Administrator to make regulatory determinations; and\n                    (C) in many cases, gathering sufficient data to \n                address contaminants awaiting regulatory determinations \n                by the Administrator has taken the Administrator more \n                than 10 years, and obtaining data on other contaminants \n                that are currently awaiting regulatory determinations \n                may take decades;\n            (6) in the 2016 Drinking Water Action Plan of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator recommended \n        that the Government and key water stakeholders strengthen the \n        effectiveness of drinking water health advisories through \n        enhanced collaboration and increased focus on risk management \n        and risk communication approaches; and\n            (7) it is vital that legislators, regulatory officials, \n        public water system owners and operators, scientists, and \n        environmental advocacy groups continue to work to ensure that \n        the public water systems of the United States are among the \n        safest in the world.\n\nSEC. 3.
