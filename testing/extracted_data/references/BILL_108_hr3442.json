FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The statutory advisory committee of the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs known as the Committee on Care of Veterans \n        with Serious Mental Illness has underscored the need to \n        integrate psychosocial recovery in the treatment of mental \n        illness.\n            (2) In its report to the President dated July 22, 2003, the \n        President's New Freedom Commision on Mental Health (established \n        by Executive order No. 13263 of April 29, 2002), identified the \n        hope of recovery as the single most important goal of mental \n        health service delivery.\n            (3) The Surgeon General, in a report on mental health \n        issued in 1999, stated that ``state of the art care for severe \n        mental illness is recovery oriented care which requires an \n        array of services that include intensive case management, \n        access to substance abuse treatment, peer support and \n        psychosocial rehabilitation such as pharmacologic treatment, \n        housing, employment services, independent living and social \n        skills training.''.\n            (4) During fiscal year 2002, the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs treated 757,767 patients in specialty mental health \n        settings, of whom 293,246 were seriously mentally ill.\n            (5) Approximately 21 percent of all patients seen by the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs are seen for mental health \n        treatment.\n            (6) When veterans with mental illness do not receive \n        comprehensive rehabilitative care, they are more likely to \n        become homeless and, according to the National Coalition for \n        Homeless Veterans, 45 percent of homeless veterans suffer from \n        at least one mental illness and need help finding a job.\n            (7) A study of the program operations of the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs during fiscal year 2000 found that fewer than \n        one percent of the 82,000 veterans under the age of 55 who have \n        schizophrenia participated in compensated work therapy \n        programs.\n            (8) The National Mental Health Information Center of the \n        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of \n        the Department of Health and Human Services found a shocking 90 \n        percent unemployment rate among adults with serious mental \n        illness, the worst level of unemployment of any group of people \n        with disabilities.\n            (9) A study by the National Mental Health Information \n        Center found that serious mental illness need not lead to \n        unemployment when seriously mentally ill individuals are given \n        proper training and employment support services.\n\nSEC. 3.
