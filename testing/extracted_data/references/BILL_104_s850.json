SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n            (1) the availability and accessibility of quality child \n        care will be critical to any welfare reform effort;\n            (2) as parents move from welfare into the workforce or into \n        job preparation and education, child care must be affordable \n        and safe;\n            (3) whether parents are pursuing job training, \n        transitioning off welfare, or are already in the work force and \n        attempting to remain employed, no parent can be expected to \n        leave his or her child in a dangerous situation;\n            (4) affordable and accessible child care is a prerequisite \n        for job training and for entering the workforce; and\n            (5) studies have shown that the lack of quality child care \n        is the most frequently cited barrier to employment and self-\n        sufficiency.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \nFederal Government has a responsibility to provide funding and \nleadership with respect to child care.\n\nSEC. 4. REPEALS AND TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) State Dependent Care Development Grants Act.--The State \nDependent Care Development Grants Act (42 U.S.C. 9871 et seq.) is \nrepealed.\n    (b) Child Development Associate Scholarship Assistance Act of \n1985.--The Child Development Associate Scholarship Assistance Act of \n1985 (42 U.S.C. 10901 et seq.) is repealed.\n    (c) Additional Conforming Amendments.--\n            (1) Recommended legislation.--After consultation with the \n        appropriate committees of the Congress and the Director of the \n        Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of Health and \n        Human Services shall prepare and submit to the Congress a \n        legislative proposal in the form of an implementing bill \n        containing technical and conforming amendments to reflect the \n        amendments and repeals made by this Act.\n            (2) Submission to congress.--Not later than 6 months after \n        the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and \n        Human Services shall submit the implementing bill referred to \n        under paragraph (1)."
