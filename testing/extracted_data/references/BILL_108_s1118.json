FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Champlain Valley and its extensive cultural and \n        natural resources have played a significant role in the history \n        of the United States and the individual States of Vermont and \n        New York;\n            (2) archaeological evidence indicates that the Champlain \n        Valley has been inhabited by humans since the last retreat of \n        the glaciers, with the Native Americans living in the area at \n        the time of European discovery being primarily of Iroquois and \n        Algonquin descent;\n            (3) the linked waterways of the Champlain Valley, including \n        the Richelieu River in Canada, played a unique and significant \n        role in the establishment and development of the United States \n        and Canada through several distinct eras, including--\n                    (A) the era of European exploration, during which \n                Samuel de Champlain and other explorers used the \n                waterways as a means of access through the wilderness;\n                    (B) the era of military campaigns, including highly \n                significant military campaigns of the French and Indian \n                War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812; and\n                    (C) the era of maritime commerce, during which \n                canals boats, schooners, and steamships formed the \n                backbone of commercial transportation for the region;\n            (4) those unique and significant eras are best described by \n        the theme ``The Making of Nations and Corridors of Commerce'';\n            (5) the artifacts and structures associated with those eras \n        are unusually well-preserved;\n            (6) the Champlain Valley is recognized as having one of the \n        richest collections of historical resources in North America;\n            (7) the history and cultural heritage of the Champlain \n        Valley are shared with Canada and the Province of Quebec;\n            (8) there are benefits in celebrating and promoting this \n        mutual heritage;\n            (9) tourism is among the most important industries in the \n        Champlain Valley, and heritage tourism in particular plays a \n        significant role in the economy of the Champlain Valley;\n            (10) it is important to enhance heritage tourism in the \n        Champlain Valley while ensuring that increased visitation will \n        not impair the historical and cultural resources of the region;\n            (11) according to the 1999 report of the National Park \n        Service entitled ``Champlain Valley Heritage Corridor \n        Project'', ``the Champlain Valley contains resources and \n        represents a theme `The Making of Nations and Corridors of \n        Commerce', that is of outstanding importance in U.S. history''; \n        and\n            (12) it is in the interest of the United States to preserve \n        and interpret the historical and cultural resources of the \n        Champlain Valley for the education and benefit of present and \n        future generations.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish the Champlain Valley National Heritage \n        Partnership in the States of Vermont and New York to recognize \n        the importance of the historical, cultural, and recreational \n        resources of the Champlain Valley region to the United States;\n            (2) to assist the State of Vermont and New York, including \n        units of local government and nongovernmental organizations in \n        the States, in preserving, protecting, and interpreting those \n        resources for the benefit of the people of the United States;\n            (3) to use those resources and the theme ``The Making of \n        Nations and Corridors of Commerce'' to--\n                    (A) revitalize the economy of communities in the \n                Champlain Valley;
