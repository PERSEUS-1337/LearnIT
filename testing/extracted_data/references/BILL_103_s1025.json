FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a productive manufacturing sector is essential to a \n        competitive national economy;\n            (2) small businesses are responsible for most new job \n        creation in the United States;\n            (3) small manufacturers play a critical role in maintaining \n        the vitality of the manufacturing sector;\n            (4) small manufacturers often do not use the most modern \n        production technology;\n            (5) the barriers to the adoption of modern technology by \n        small manufacturers include--\n                    (A) the lack of readily available sources of \n                information about such technology;\n                    (B) the perception that such technology is too \n                costly; and\n                    (C) the difficulty in attracting talented engineers \n                to work for small manufacturers; and\n            (6) the education of engineering students often does not \n        expose such students to current industrial practices, \n        especially those of small manufacturers.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to give undergraduate students of \nengineering the opportunity to work with small manufacturing companies \nin order to--\n            (1) bring knowledge of modern engineering practices to \n        small manufacturers, increase the recognition by small \n        manufacturers of the importance of these practices, and promote \n        the adoption of modern engineering practices by small \n        manufacturers;\n            (2) expose engineering students to the special environment \n        and needs of small manufacturers, and increase the number of \n        engineers who choose to work for small manufacturers;\n            (3) encourage engineering colleges to devote greater \n        attention to the needs of small manufacturers; and\n            (4) promote the development and expansion of a community of \n        technological entrepreneurs in the small manufacturing sector.\n\nSEC. 4.
