    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Syria Accountability Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 \n        (September 28, 2001) mandates that all states ``refrain from \n        providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities \n        or persons involved in terrorist acts'', take ``the necessary \n        steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts'', and ``deny \n        safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit \n        terrorist acts''.\n            (2) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by \n        United States law from receiving United States assistance \n        because it is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n            (3) Although the Secretary of State lists Syria as a state \n        sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides ``safe \n        haven and support to several terrorist groups'', fewer United \n        States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with respect \n        to any other country that the Secretary lists as a state \n        sponsor of terrorism.\n            (4) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, the \n        Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular \n        Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, maintain \n        offices, training camps, and other facilities on Syrian \n        territory and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by the \n        Syrian armed forces and receive supplies from Iran through \n        Syria.\n            (5) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 \n        (September 17, 1982) calls for ``strict respect of the \n        sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political \n        independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority \n        of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese Army \n        throughout Lebanon''.\n            (6) More than 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel \n        occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon, thereby \n        exerting undue influence upon its government and undermining \n        its political independence.\n            (7) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have \n        passed seven bills and resolutions calling for the withdrawal \n        of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.\n            (8) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people \n        from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted \n        peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the Syrian \n        Army from Lebanese soil.\n            (9) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from \n        Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council \n        Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978), as certified by the United \n        Nations Secretary General.\n            (10) Even in the face of this United Nations certification \n        that acknowledged Israel's full compliance with Resolution 425, \n        Syria permits attacks by Hizballah and other militant \n        organizations on Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the \n        false guise that it remains Lebanese land. Syria also permits \n        attacks on civilian targets in Israel.\n            (11) Syria will not allow Lebanon, a sovereign country, to \n        fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council \n        Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.\n            (12) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of \n        southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which \n        continues to attack Israeli positions and allows Iranian \n        Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate \n        freely in the area, destabilizing the entire region.\n            (13) The United States provides $40,000,000 in assistance \n        to the Lebanese people through private nongovernmental \n        organizations, $7,900,000 of which is provided to Lebanese-\n        American educational institutions.\n            (14) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, \n        President George W. Bush declared that the United States will \n        ``work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their \n        state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make \n        and deliver weapons of mass destruction''.\n            (15) The Government of Syria continues to develop and \n        deploy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.\n            (16) The Government of Syria is pursuing the development \n        and production of biological and chemical weapons.\n            (17) United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 (August \n        6, 1990) and subsequent relevant resolutions restrict the sale \n        of oil and other commodities by Iraq, except to the extent \n        authorized by other relevant resolutions.\n            (18) Syrian President Bashar Assad promised the Secretary \n        of State in February 2001 to end violations of Security Council \n        Resolution 661 but this pledge has not been fulfilled.\n            (19) In direct violation of United Nations Sanctions, Syria \n        has been importing 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil on a daily \n        basis since 2000, which has provided Iraq with up to \n        $1,200,000,000 annually.\n            (20) There are reports that Syria is pursuing the \n        development of chemical weapons, such as VX and Sarin, and is \n        harboring fugitive Iraqi officials.\n            (21) On April 20, 2003, President Bush said there were \n        positive signs that Syria will cooperate on the issue of \n        harboring fugitive Iraqi officials.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Government of Syria should immediately and \n        unconditionally halt support for terrorism, permanently and \n        openly declare its total renunciation of all forms of \n        terrorism, and close all terrorist offices and facilities in \n        Syria, including the offices of Hamas, Hizballah, the Popular \n        Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front \n        for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command;\n            (2) in accordance with United Nations Security Council \n        Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982), which calls for the strict \n        respect for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity, \n        the Government of Syria should immediately declare its \n        commitment to completely withdraw its armed forces, including \n        military, paramilitary, and security forces, from Lebanon, and \n        set a firm schedule for such withdrawal;\n            (3) the Government of Syria should halt the development and \n        deployment of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles and \n        cease the development and production of biological and chemical \n        weapons;\n            (4) the Government of Syria should halt illegal imports and \n        transshipments of Iraqi oil and come into full compliance with \n        United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 and subsequent \n        relevant resolutions;\n            (5) the Governments of Lebanon and Syria should enter into \n        serious unconditional bilateral negotiations with the \n        Government of Israel in order to realize a full and permanent \n        peace; and\n            (6) the United States should continue to provide \n        humanitarian and educational assistance to the people of \n        Lebanon only through appropriate private, nongovernmental \n        organizations and appropriate international organizations, \n        until such time as the Government of Lebanon asserts \n        sovereignty and control over all of its territory and borders \n        and achieves full political independence, as called for in \n        United Nations Security Council Resolution 520.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States that--\n            (1) Syria should bear responsibility for all attacks \n        committed by Hizballah and other terrorist groups with offices \n        or other facilities in Syria, or bases in areas of Lebanon \n        occupied by Syria;\n            (2) the United States will work to deny Syria the ability \n        to support acts of international terrorism and efforts to \n        develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n            (3) the Secretary of State will continue to list Syria as a \n        state sponsor of terrorism until Syria ends its support for \n        terrorism, including its support of Hizballah and other \n        terrorist groups in Lebanon and its hosting of terrorist groups \n        in Damascus, and comes into full compliance with United States \n        law relating to terrorism and United Nations Security Council \n        Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001);\n            (4) the full restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty, \n        political independence, and territorial integrity is in the \n        national security interest of the United States;\n            (5) Syria is in violation of United Nations Security \n        Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) through its \n        continued occupation of Lebanese territory and its encroachment \n        upon its political independence;\n            (6) Syria's obligation to withdraw from Lebanon is not \n        conditioned upon progress in the Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-\n        Lebanese peace process but derives from Syria's obligation \n        under Security Council Resolution 520;\n            (7) Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and \n        ballistic missile programs threaten the security of the Middle \n        East and the national interests of the United States;\n            (8) Syria has violated United Nations Security Council \n        Resolution 661 (August 6, 1990) and subsequent relevant \n        resolutions by purchasing oil from Iraq; and\n            (9) the United States will restrict assistance to Syria and \n        will oppose multilateral assistance for Syria until Syria \n        withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon, halts the development \n        and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic \n        missiles, and complies with Security Council Resolution 661 and \n        subsequent relevant resolutions.\n\nSEC. 5.
