FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Alcohol is by far the drug most widely used and abused \n        by young people in the United States.\n            (2)(A) In 2003, it is illegal for youths under the age of \n        21 to purchase alcohol in all of the 50 States and the District \n        of Columbia, and illicit drugs remain illegal.\n            (B) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, on \n        average, young people begin drinking at about age 13. However, \n        some start even younger. By the time young people are high \n        school seniors, more than 80 percent have used alcohol and \n        approximately 64 percent have been drunk.\n            (C) When adolescents move on to college, they bring their \n        drinking habits with them. According to a 1993-1997 Harvard \n        School of Public Health College Alcohol Study, 40 percent of \n        college students are binge drinkers.\n            (D) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, in 1998, 10,400,000 current drinkers were under legal \n        age (age 12-21) and of these, 5,100,000 were binge drinkers, \n        including 2,300,000 heavy drinkers.\n            (E) Among 10th graders the perceived harmfulness of \n        regularly taking LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is 68.8 \n        percent, and among 8th graders the perceived harmfulness is \n        52.9 percent, according to the 2001 Monitoring the Future Study \n        (MTF) funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n            (F) Only 45.7 percent of 12th graders perceived a great \n        risk in trying MDMA (ecstasy) once or twice.\n            (G) The perceived availability of crack and cocaine among \n        10th graders was thought of as easy or fairly easy by 31 \n        percent of 10th graders.\n            (3)(A) Underage drinking particularly impacts institutions \n        of higher education.\n            (B) In 1999, Harvard University's School of Public Health \n        College Alcohol Study surveyed 119 colleges and found that \n        students who were binge drinkers in high school were 3 times \n        more likely to binge drink in college.\n            (C) According to a March 2002 article published in the \n        Journal of Studies on Alcohol, a study conducted by the Social \n        and Behavioral Sciences Department of the Boston University \n        School of Public Health reported that 1998 and 1999 studies \n        show over 2,000,000 of the 8,000,000 college students in the \n        United States drove under the influence of alcohol, over \n        500,000 were unintentionally injured while under the influence \n        of alcohol, and over 600,000 were hit or assaulted by another \n        student who had been drinking.\n            (D) According to the same Boston University study, it is \n        estimated that over 1,400 students aged 18-24 and enrolled in \n        2-year and 4-year colleges died in 1998 from alcohol-related \n        unintentional injuries.\n            (E) More than 600,000 students between the ages of 18 and \n        24 are assaulted by another student who has been drinking, and \n        another 500,000 students are unintentionally injured under the \n        influence of alcohol.\n            (F) More than 70,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 \n        are victims of alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape, \n        more than 400,000 students reported having unprotected sex, and \n        more than 100,000 students reported having been too intoxicated \n        to know if they consented to having sex, according to the \n        Boston University study.\n            (4)(A) Longstanding cultural influences perpetuate student \n        patterns of drinking.\n            (B) Of frequent binge drinkers, 73 percent of males and 68 \n        percent of females cited drinking to get drunk as an important \nreason for drinking according to ``Binge Drinking on Campus: Results of \na National Study'', from Harvard School of Public Health.\n            (C) The proportion of college students who drink varies \n        depending on where they live. Drinking rates are highest in \n        fraternities and sororities, followed by on-campus housing. \n        Students who live independently offsite (e.g., in apartments) \n        drink less, while commuting students who live with their \n        families drink the least.\n            (D) Institutions of higher education in places with strict \n        laws such as keg registration, prohibitions on happy hours, and \n        open container in public bans, which restrict the volume of \n        alcohol sold or consumed, displayed lower rates of consumption \n        and binge drinking among underage students.\n            (E) A 2000 report by the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, entitled ``Healthy People 2010'', observes that ``The \n        perception that alcohol use is socially acceptable correlates \n        with the fact that more than 80 percent of American youth \n        consume alcohol before their 21st birthday, whereas the lack of \n        social acceptance of other drugs correlates with comparatively \n        low rates of use. Similarly, widespread societal expectations \n        that young persons will engage in binge drinking may encourage \n        this highly dangerous form of alcohol consumption.''.\n            (F) Mutually reinforcing interventions between the college \n        and surrounding community can change the broader environment \n        and help reduce alcohol abuse and alcohol-related problems over \n        the long term.\n            (5)(A) The use of illicit drugs threatens the lives and \n        well-being of students at institutions of higher education.\n            (B) According to the working paper, ``Alcohol and Marijuana \n        Use Among College Students: Economic Complements or \n        Substitutes'', for the National Bureau of Economic Research, \n        alcohol and marijuana are economic complements, meaning that as \n        the use of alcohol goes down on campuses, it is expected that \n        marijuana will as well, or that as marijuana usage falls, so \n        will alcohol usage.\n            (C) The annual prevalence of the use of an illicit drug at \n        institutions of higher education is 36 percent. The annual \n        marijuana use is 34 percent. The annual use of cocaine and LSD \n        is 4.8 percent. The annual use of heroin is 4.5 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.
