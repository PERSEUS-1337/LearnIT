    "content": "The President is responsible for appointing individuals to positions throughout the federal government. In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted to the President alone. Other appointments are made with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation of appointees. Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation are often referred to with the abbreviation PAS. This report identifies, for the 112 th Congress, all nominations to full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation in 40 organizations in the executive branch (27 independent agencies, 6 agencies in the Executive Office of the President [EOP], and 7 multilateral organizations) and 4 agencies in the legislative branch. It excludes appointments to executive departments and to regulatory and other boards and commissions. A pair of tables presents information for each agency in this report. The first table in each pair provides information on full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation as of the end of the 112 th Congress and the pay levels of those positions. The second table for each agency tracks appointment activity within the 112 th Congress by the Senate (confirmations, rejections, returns to the President, and elapsed time between nomination and confirmation) as well as further related presidential activity (including withdrawals and recess appointments). In some instances, no appointment action occurred within an agency during the 112 th Congress. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) at http://www.lis.gov/nomis/ , the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents , telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code , and the 2012 Plum Book ( United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions ). Related Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports regarding the presidential appointments process, nomination activity for other executive branch positions, recess appointments, and other appointments-related matters may be found at http://www.crs.gov .  During the 112 th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted 34 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions in independent agencies, agencies in the EOP, multilateral agencies, and legislative branch agencies. Of these nominations, 27 were confirmed, 6 were returned to the President, and 1 was withdrawn. The President made one recess appointment during this period to a position in organizations covered in this report. Table 1 summarizes the appointment activity. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate varies widely. Some nominations are confirmed within a few days, others are not confirmed for several months, and some are never confirmed. For each nomination covered by this report and confirmed in the 112 th Congress, the report provides the number of days between nomination and confirmation (\"days to confirm\"). The mean (average) number of days elapsed between nomination and confirmation was 142.7. The median number of days elapsed was 112.0. Agency profiles in this report are organized in two parts: a table listing the organization's full-time PAS positions as of the end of the 112 th Congress and a table listing appointment action for vacant positions during the 112 th Congress. Data for these tables were collected from several authoritative sources. As noted, some agencies had no nomination activity during this time. In each agency profile, the first of the two tables identifies, as of the end of the 112 th Congress, each full-time PAS position in the organization and its pay level. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, the pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule, which, as of January 2013, ranged from level I ($199,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($145,700) for lower-ranked positions. The second table, the appointment action table, provides, in chronological order, information concerning each nomination. It shows the name of the nominee, position involved, date of nomination, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation. It also notes actions other than confirmation (i.e., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President). The appointment action tables with more than one nominee to a position also list statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. Each nomination action table provides the average \"days to confirm\" in two ways: mean and median. Although the mean is a more familiar measure, it may be influenced by outliers in the data. The median, by contrast, does not tend to be influenced by outliers. In other words, a nomination that took an extraordinarily long time might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Examining both numbers offers more information with which to assess the central tendency of the data.  Appendix A provides two tables. Table A-1 relists all appointment action identified in this report and is organized alphabetically by the appointee's last name. Table entries identify the agency to which each individual was appointed, position title, nomination date, date confirmed or other final action, and duration count for confirmed nominations. In the final two rows, the table also includes the mean and median values for the days to confirm column.  Table A-2 provides summary data on the appointments identified in this report and is organized by agency type, including independent executive agencies, agencies in the EOP, multilateral organizations, and agencies in the legislative branch. The table summarizes the number of positions, nominations submitted, individual nominees, confirmations, nominations returned, and nominations withdrawn for each agency grouping. It also includes mean and median values for the number of days taken to confirm nominations in each category. During the 112 th Congress, the Presidential Appointments Streamlining and Efficiency Act ( P.L. 112-166 ) was enacted, which eliminated the requirement for the Senate's advice and consent for 163 positions in federal agencies. A number of those positions, listed in Appendix B , have been included in previous versions of this tracking report. This report notes each agency and position affected.  Appendix C provides a list of department abbreviations. Appendix A. Summary of All Nominations and Appointments to Independent and Other Agencies Appendix B. Positions Affected by P.L. 112-166 Appendix C. Agency Abbreviations"
