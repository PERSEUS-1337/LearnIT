    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Global Access Policy Act of \n2016'' or the ``Digital GAP Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to encourage the efforts of developing \ncountries to improve mobile and fixed access to the Internet in order \nto spur economic growth and job creation, improve health, education, \nand financial services, reduce poverty and gender inequality, mitigate \ndisasters, promote democracy and good governance, strengthen \ncybersecurity, and update the Department of State's structure to \naddress cyberspace policy.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since 2005, the number of Internet users has more than \n        tripled from 1 billion to 3.2 billion.\n            (2) 4.2 billion people, 60 percent of the world's \n        population, remain offline and the growth rate of Internet \n        access is slowing. An estimated 75 percent of the offline \n        population lives in just 20 countries and is largely rural, \n        female, elderly, illiterate, and low-income.\n            (3) Studies suggest that across the developing world, women \n        are nearly 50 percent less likely to access the Internet than \n        men living within the same communities, and that this digital \n        gender divide carries with it a great economic cost. According \n        to a study, ``Women and the Web'', bringing an additional 600 \n        million women online would contribute $13 billion-$18 billion \n        to annual GDP across 144 developing countries.\n            (4) Without increased Internet access, the developing world \n        risks falling behind.\n            (5) Internet access in developing countries is hampered by \n        a lack of infrastructure and a poor regulatory environment for \n        investment.\n            (6) Build-once policies and approaches are policies or \n        practices that minimize the number and scale of excavation and \n        construction activities when installing telecommunications \n        infrastructure in rights-of-way, thereby lowering the \n        installation costs for high-speed Internet networks and serve \n        as a development best practice.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to \npartner, consult, and coordinate with the governments of foreign \ncountries, international organizations, regional economic communities, \nbusinesses, civil society, and other stakeholders in a concerted effort \nto--\n            (1) promote first-time Internet access to mobile or \n        broadband Internet for at least 1.5 billion people in \n        developing countries by 2020 in both urban and rural areas;\n            (2) promote Internet deployment and related coordination, \n        capacity building, and build-once policies and approaches in \n        developing countries, including actions to encourage--\n                    (A) a build-once approach by standardizing the \n                inclusion of broadband conduit pipes which house fiber \n                optic communications cable that support broadband or \n                wireless facilities for broadband service as part of \n                rights-of-way projects, including sewers, power \n                transmission facilities, rail, pipelines, bridges, \n                tunnels, and roads, that are funded, co-funded, or \n                partially financed by the United States or any \n                international organization that includes the United \n                States as a member, in consultation with \n                telecommunications providers, unless a cost-benefit \n                analysis determines that the cost of such approach \n                outweighs the benefits;\n                    (B) national and local government agencies of \n                developing countries and donor governments and \n                organizations to coordinate road building, pipe laying, \n                and major infrastructure with the private sector so \n                that, for example, fiber optic cable could be laid \n                below roads at the time such roads are built; and\n                    (C) international organizations to increase their \n                financial support, including grants and loans, and \n                technical assistance to expand information and \n                communications access and Internet connectivity;\n            (3) promote policy changes that encourage first-time \n        affordable access to the Internet in developing countries, \n        including actions to encourage--\n                    (A) integration of universal and gender-equitable \n                Internet access goals, to be informed by the collection \n                of related gender disaggregated data, and Internet \n                tools into national development plans and United States \n                Government country-level strategies;\n                    (B) reforms of competition laws and spectrum \n                allocation processes that may impede the ability of \n                companies to provide Internet services; and\n                    (C) efforts to improve procurement processes to \n                help attract and incentivize investment in Internet \n                infrastructure;\n            (4) promote the removal of tax and regulatory barriers to \n        Internet access;\n            (5) promote the use of the Internet to increase economic \n        growth and trade, including--\n                    (A) policies and strategies to remove restrictions \n                to e-commerce, cross-border information flows, and \n                competitive marketplaces; and\n                    (B) entrepreneurship and distance learning enabled \n                by access to technology;\n            (6) promote the use of the Internet to bolster democracy, \n        government accountability, transparency, and human rights, \n        including--\n                    (A) policies, initiatives, and investments, \n                including the development of national Internet plans, \n                that are consistent with United States human rights \n                goals, including freedom of expression, religion, and \n                association;\n                    (B) policies and initiatives aimed at promoting the \n                multistakeholder model of Internet governance; and\n                    (C) policies and support programs, research, and \n                technologies that safeguard human rights and \n                fundamental freedoms online, and enable political \n                organizing and activism, free speech, and religious \n                expression that are in compliance with international \n                human rights standards;\n            (7) promote Internet access and inclusion into Internet \n        policymaking for women, people with disabilities, minorities, \n        low-income and marginalized groups, and underserved \n        populations; and\n            (8) promote cybersecurity and data protection, including \n        international use of the National Institute of Standards and \n        Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical \n        Infrastructure Cybersecurity that are industry-led, globally \n        recognized cybersecurity standards and best practices.\n\nSEC. 5. DEPARTMENT OF STATE ORGANIZATION.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nSecretary of State should redesignate an existing Assistant Secretary \nposition to be the Assistant Secretary for Cyberspace to lead the \nDepartment of State's diplomatic cyberspace policy generally, including \nfor cybersecurity, Internet access, Internet freedom, and to promote an \nopen, secure, and reliable information and communications technology \ninfrastructure.\n    (b) Activities.--In recognition of the added value of technical \nknowledge and expertise in the policymaking and diplomatic channels, \nthe Secretary of State should--\n            (1) update existing training programs relevant to policy \n        discussions; and\n            (2) promote the recruitment of candidates with technical \n        expertise into the Civil Service and the Foreign Service.\n    (c) Offset.--To offset any costs incurred by the Department of \nState to carry out the designation of an Assistant Secretary for \nCyberspace in accordance with subsection (a), the Secretary of State \nshall eliminate such positions within the Department of State, unless \notherwise authorized or required by law, as the Secretary determines to \nbe necessary to fully offset such costs.\n    (d) Rule of Construction.--The redesignation of the Assistant \nSecretary position described in subsection (a) may not be construed as \nincreasing the number of Assistant Secretary positions at the \nDepartment of State above the current level of 24 as authorized in \nsection 1(c)(1) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 \n(22 U.S.C. 2651a(c)(1)).\n\nSEC. 6.
