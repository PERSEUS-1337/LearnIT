FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in response to the proposed debit interchange rule of \n        the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System mandated \n        by section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n        Consumer Protection Act, the Chairman of Board, the Comptroller \n        of the Currency, the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit \n        Insurance Corporation, and the Chairman of the National Credit \n        Union Administration Board have publicly raised concerns about \n        the impact of the proposed rule;\n            (2) while testifying before the Committee on Banking, \n        Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on February 17, 2011, \n        the Chairman of the Board stated in response to questions about \n        the small bank exemption to the interchange rule, ``. . . there \n        is some risk that the exemption will not be effective and that \n        the interchange fees available through smaller institutions \n        will be reduced to the same extent we would see for larger \n        banks'';\n            (3) the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, in comments to \n        the Board, cited safety and soundness concerns and stated, ``. \n        . . we believe the proposal takes an unnecessarily narrow \n        approach to recovery of costs that would be allowable under the \n        law and that are recognized and indisputably part of conducting \n        a debit card business. This has long-term safety and soundness \n        consequences--for banks of all sizes . . .'';\n            (4) the chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n        Corporation stated in comments to the Board regarding the \n        proposed rule their concern that the small bank exemption would \n        not work, stating, ``. . . we are concerned that these \n        institutions may not actually receive the benefit of the \n        interchange fee limit exemption explicitly provided by \n        Congress, resulting in a loss of income for community banks and \n        ultimately higher banking costs for their customers'';\n            (5) the chairman of the National Credit Union \n        Administration Board, in comments to the Board, cited concern \n        with making sure there are ``meaningful exemptions for smaller \n        card issuers''; and\n            (6) all of the comments and concerns raised by the banking \n        and credit union regulatory agencies cast serious questions \n        about the practical implementation of section 1075 of the Dodd-\n        Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and \n        further study and consideration are needed.\n\nSEC. 3.
