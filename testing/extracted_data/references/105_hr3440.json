    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Alternative Routes to Teacher \nCertification Act of 1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) If current trends continue, American schools will need \n        to hire more than two million teachers in the next decade to \n        educate an increasing number of students and to replace current \n        teachers who will retire or leave the profession.\n            (2) There are highly qualified individuals who serve in \n        other occupations that are interested in pursuing a teaching \n        career; in 1996, ten percent of all teachers at the elementary \n        or secondary level worked in an occupation outside of education \n        in the previous year.\n            (3) Schools are having trouble recruiting qualified \n        teachers. Nearly three-quarters of physical science students \n        and one-third of English students in high-poverty schools take \n        classes from unqualified teachers. Urban and rural areas face \n        significant challenges in finding highly qualified teachers.\n            (4) In addition, while one-third of American students in \n        1998 are members of minority groups, members of racial and \n        ethnic minorities make up only 13 percent of the teaching \n        force. In 1988, only eight percent of teacher education \n        students enrolled in a national representative sample of \n        college programs were minorities, while one study indicates \n        that more than one third of the alternative route candidates \n        were minorities.\n            (5) The same study found that 69 percent of alternatively \n        certified teacher interns that are being trained to teach \n        mathematics would prefer to teach in an urban or city setting, \n        while only 14 percent of university-certified teacher \n        candidates in mathematics chose an urban or city setting.\n            (6) Bringing distinctive life experiences and perspectives \n        into the classroom can enrich the instructional curriculum and \n        school climate, and enhance the quality of American education. \n        Alternative routes to certification programs help open the \n        teaching profession to individuals with high subject knowledge \n        and diverse life and professional experiences.\n            (7) Alternative routes to certification partnerships will \n        target Federal dollars directly to local school districts that \n        desire to create a program that will attract qualified teachers \n        to areas of high need, which would include a shortage of \n        teachers in a subject-content area.\n            (8) Alternative routes to certification programs should \n        help states develop new teacher-licensing policies based on \n        subject-matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, teaching skills, \n        and other performance-based examinations.\n\nSEC. 3.
