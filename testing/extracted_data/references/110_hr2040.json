    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nCommemorative Coin Act''.\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n    The Congress hereby finds as follows:\n        (1) On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks' brave act of defiance, \n    refusing to give up her seat to a white person on a segregated bus \n    in Montgomery, Alabama, galvanized the modern civil rights movement \n    and led to the desegregation of the South.\n        (2) On February 1, 1960, 4 college students, Joseph McNeil, \n    Franklin McCain, David Richmond, and Ezell Blair, Jr., asked to be \n    served at a lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, and lunch \n    counter sit-ins began to occur throughout the South to challenge \n    segregation in places of public accommodation.\n        (3) On May 4, 1961, the Freedom Rides into the South began to \n    test new court orders barring segregation in interstate \n    transportation, and riders were jailed and beaten by mobs in \n    several places, including Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama.\n        (4) Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was the leading civil rights \n    advocate of the time, spearheading the civil rights movement in the \n    United States during the 1950s and 1960s with the goal of \n    nonviolent social change and full civil rights for African \n    Americans.\n        (5) On August 28, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led over \n    250,000 civil rights supporters in the March on Washington and \n    delivered his famous ``I Have A Dream'' speech to raise awareness \n    and support for civil rights legislation.\n        (6) Mrs. Coretta Scott King, a leading participant in the \n    American civil rights movement, was side-by-side with her husband, \n    Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., during many civil rights marches, \n    organized Freedom Concerts to draw attention to the Movement, and \n    worked in her own right to create an America in which all people \n    have equal rights.\n        (7) The mass movement sparked by Rosa Parks and led by Dr. \n    Martin Luther King, Jr., among others, called upon the Congress and \n    Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to pass civil \n    rights legislation which culminated in the enactment of the Civil \n    Rights Act of 1964.\n        (8) The Civil Rights Act of 1964 greatly expanded civil rights \n    protections, outlawing racial discrimination and segregation in \n    public places and places of public accommodation, in federally \n    funded programs, and employment and encouraging desegregation in \n    public schools, and has served as a model for subsequent anti-\n    discrimination laws.\n        (9) We are an eminently better Nation because of Rosa Parks, \n    Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and all those men and women who have \n    confronted, and continue to confront, injustice and inequality \n    wherever they see it.\n        (10) Equality in education was one of the cornerstones of the \n    civil rights movement.\n        (11) On September 10, 1961, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote \n    that African American ``students are coming to understand that \n    education and learning have become tools for shaping the future and \n    not devices of privilege for an exclusive few''.\n        (12) Over its long and distinguished history, the United Negro \n    College Fund has provided scholarships and operating funds to its \n    member colleges that have enabled more than 300,000 young African \n    Americans to earn college degrees and become successful members of \n    society.\n        (13) Those graduates include Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as \n    well as leaders in the fields of education, science, medicine, law, \n    entertainment, literature, the military, and politics who have made \n    major contributions to the civil rights movement and the creation \n    of a more equitable society.\n        (14) Congress has an obligation to lead America's continued \n    struggle to fight discrimination and ensure equal rights for all.\n        (15) The year 2014 will mark the semicentennial of the passage \n    of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nSEC. 3.
