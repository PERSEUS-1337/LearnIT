Research program.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Individuals with cancer often do not have access to a \n        cancer care system that provides comprehensive and coordinated \n        care of high quality.\n            (2) The cancer care system has not traditionally offered \n        individuals with cancer a prospective and comprehensive plan \n        for treatment and symptom management, strategies for updating \n        and evaluating such plan with the assistance of a health care \n        professional, and a follow-up plan for monitoring and treating \n        possible late effects of cancer and its treatment.\n            (3) Cancer survivors often experience the under-diagnosis \n        and under-treatment of the symptoms of cancer, a problem that \n        begins at the time of diagnosis and may become more severe with \n        disease progression and at the end of life. The failure to \n        treat the symptoms, side effects, and late effects of cancer \n        and cancer treatment may have a serious adverse impact on the \n        health, survival, well-being, and quality of life of cancer \n        survivors.\n            (4) Cancer survivors who are members of racial and ethnic \n        minority groups may face severe obstacles in receiving \n        coordinated cancer care that includes appropriate management of \n        cancer symptoms and treatment of side effects.\n            (5) Individuals with cancer are sometimes not provided \n        information about their disease and treatment options that \n        might result in their request for, and engagement in, \n        coordinated care that includes appropriate treatment and \n        symptom management.\n            (6) Comprehensive cancer care should incorporate access to \n        psychosocial services and management of the symptoms of cancer \n        and the symptoms of cancer treatment, including pain, nausea, \n        vomiting, fatigue, and depression.\n            (7) Comprehensive cancer care should include a means for \n        providing cancer survivors with a comprehensive care summary \n        and a plan for follow-up care after primary treatment to ensure \n        that cancer survivors have access to follow-up monitoring and \n        treatment of possible late effects of cancer and cancer \n        treatment.\n            (8) The Institute of Medicine report entitled ``Ensuring \n        Quality Cancer Care'' described the elements of quality care \n        for an individual with cancer, including--\n                    (A) the development of initial treatment \n                recommendations by an experienced health care provider;\n                    (B) the development of a plan for the course of \n                treatment of the individual and communication of the \n                plan to the individual;\n                    (C) access to the resources necessary to implement \n                the course of treatment;\n                    (D) access to high-quality clinical trials;\n                    (E) a mechanism to coordinate services for the \n                treatment of the individual; and\n                    (F) psychosocial support services and compassionate \n                care for the individual.\n            (9) In its report ``From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: \n        Lost in Transition'', the Institute of Medicine recommended \n        that individuals with cancer completing primary treatment be \n        provided a comprehensive summary of their care along with a \n        follow-up survivorship plan of treatment.\n            (10) Since more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur \n        among elderly Medicare beneficiaries, the problems of providing \n        cancer care are problems of the Medicare program.\n            (11) Shortcomings in providing cancer care, resulting in \n        inadequate management of cancer symptoms and insufficient \n        monitoring and treatment of late effects of cancer and its \n        treatment, are related to problems of Medicare payments for \n        such care, inadequate professional training, and insufficient \n        investment in research on symptom management.\n            (12) Changes in Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer \n        care, enhanced public and professional education regarding \n        symptom management, and more research related to coordination \n        of care, symptom management and palliative care will enhance \n        patient decisionmaking about treatment options and will \n        contribute to improved care for individuals with cancer from \n        the time of diagnosis of the individual through the end of the \n        life of the individual.\n\n     TITLE I--COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CARE UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101.
