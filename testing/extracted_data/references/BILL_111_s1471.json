FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) section 4303 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' \n        Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations \n        Act, 2007 (Public Law 110-28; 121 Stat. 154) requires the \n        Secretary to provide to Congress an analysis of each advantage \n        and disadvantage, and the technical operational effectiveness \n        of--\n                    (A) the operation of the new pumping stations \n                located at the mouths of the 17th Street, Orleans \n                Avenue, and London Avenue canals in the New Orleans \n                area concurrently, or in a series with, pumping \n                stations that--\n                            (i) are in existence as of the date of \n                        enactment of that Act (Public Law 110-28; 121 \n                        Stat. 112); and\n                            (ii) serve the canals;\n                    (B) the removal of the pumping stations described \n                in subparagraph (A) and the configuration of the new \n                pumping stations described in that subparagraph \n                (including associated canals) to accommodate each--\n                            (i) necessary discharge to the lakefront; \n                        and\n                            (ii) discharge described in clause (i) in \n                        combination with each discharge directly to the \n                        portion of the Mississippi River located in \n                        Jefferson Parish; and\n                    (C) the replacement or improvement of the \n                floodwalls and levees adjacent to each canal described \n                in subparagraph (A);\n            (2) prior to the required analysis described in paragraph \n        (1), engineering concept studies were performed by the \n        Secretary to determine the most technically effective means of \n        accomplishing the dual purpose of--\n                    (A) protecting against storm surges; and\n                    (B) simultaneously evacuating storm water;\n            (3) a collaborative process was established and many \n        technical review meetings were held to exchange ideas;\n            (4) to develop and evaluate each technical advantage and \n        disadvantage, and the operational effectiveness, of each option \n        through the use of each result and recommendation contained in \n        each report (including each draft report) completed after \n        Hurricane Katrina, the Secretary expanded and formalized the \n        collaborative process described in paragraph (3) with external \n        stakeholders that included--\n                    (A) the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans;\n                    (B) Jefferson Parish;\n                    (C) the New Orleans Business Council;\n                    (D) the Louisiana Department of Transportation and \n                Development;\n                    (E) the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection \n                Authority-East;\n                    (F) the Regional Planning Commission, New Orleans; \n                and\n                    (G) independent groups;\n            (5) the reports described in paragraph (4) provide much of \n        the background technical data required to carry out in an \n        expedited manner the analysis described in paragraph (1); and\n            (6) based on the information compiled for the analysis \n        described in paragraph (1), the Secretary concluded that the \n        option identified as ``Option 2'', as described in the report, \n        is ``generally more technically advantageous and more effective \n        operationally over Option 1 because it would have greater \n        reliability and further reduces risk of flooding''.\n\nSEC. 3.
