FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Lupus Foundation of America estimates that at least \n        1.5 million Americans have a form of lupus, 9 out of 10 of \n        these Americans are women, and 80 percent of all newly \n        diagnosed cases of lupus are among women of childbearing age.\n            (2) According to a Lupus Foundation of America survey, more \n        than half of the people with lupus suffered for 4 or more years \n        and visited 3 or more doctors before obtaining a diagnosis of \n        lupus.\n            (3) Early diagnosis of and commencement of treatment for \n        lupus can prevent or reduce serious organ damage, disability, \n        and death.\n            (4) About 1 out of 5 lupus sufferers receives disability \n        payments, costing the Government several billion dollars each \n        year for social security disability benefits, lost taxes, and \n        medical care provided through Medicare and Medicaid.\n            (5) The average annual cost of medical treatment for an \n        individual with lupus is $6,000 to $10,000; for some people, \n        medical costs may exceed several thousand dollars every month.\n            (6) Despite the prevalence of lupus, public awareness and \n        understanding of lupus remains low. According to a Lupus \n        Foundation of America survey, only 1 out of 5 Americans can \n        provide even basic information about lupus.\n            (7) Awareness of lupus is lowest among adults ages 18 to \n        34, the age group most likely to develop symptoms of lupus.\n            (8) Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling \n        disease of the central nervous system which often first appears \n        in people who are 20 to 50 years of age, with lifelong physical \n        and emotional effects.\n            (9) Multiple sclerosis is twice as common in women as in \n        men.\n            (10) An estimated 250,000 to 400,000 individuals have \n        multiple sclerosis nationally.\n            (11) The average annual cost of multiple sclerosis to each \n        affected individual is approximately $50,000, and the total \n        cost can exceed $3,000,000 over an individual's lifetime.\n            (12) The annual cost of treating all people who suffer from \n        multiple sclerosis in the United States is approximately \n        $20,000,000,000.\n            (13) Symptoms of multiple sclerosis can be mild (such as \n        numbness in the limbs) or severe (such as paralysis or loss of \n        vision).\n            (14) The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of \n        multiple sclerosis in any one individual cannot yet be \n        predicted.\n            (15) Arthritis is the number one cause of disability in the \n        United States.\n            (16) Among the 2,100,000 people with rheumatoid arthritis \n        in the United States, women outnumber men 3 to 1.\n            (17) The total direct costs of rheumatoid arthritis, \n        including money spent on treatments, hospitalizations, \n        medications, transportation, and specialist aids, is \n        approximately $1,200,000,000 each year.\n            (18) The average medical care expenditures over the course \n        of a rheumatoid arthritis patient's lifetime is $225,000 to \n        $370,000.\n            (19) Fibromyalgia is believed to affect approximately \n        3,700,000 people (approximately 2 percent of the United States \n        population) and occurs more commonly in women than men.\n            (20) The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but may be \n        triggered by stress, trauma, or possibly an infectious agent in \n        susceptible people.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase awareness \nof autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid \narthritis, and fibromyalgia, in order to provide to the public a more \ncomplete understanding of these diseases, which affect 5 to 10 percent \nof the people in the United States.\n    (b) Amendments.--Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 \nU.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by moving section 317R so that such section follows \n        section 317Q; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 317R (as so moved) the \n        following:\n    ``Sec. 317S.
