The methods and procedures shall be a mandatory prerequisite to pursuing other dispute resolution mechanisms, including, but not limited to, litigation. However, if conciliation, mediation, or arbitration proceedings are commenced under this section to resolve a controversy, the statute of limitations that applies to a civil action concerning that controversy is tolled upon commencement of conciliation, mediation, or arbitration proceedings, and until 30 days after the completion of those proceedings. As used in this subdivision, \u201ccompletion of those proceedings\u201d means the filing of a statement of agreement or nonagreement by the conciliator or mediator, or the rendering of a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration committee.\n(B) If a proceeding for the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of a dispute between a dealer and a grower is commenced under this subdivision for conformance with the financial terms by a dealer to a grower, and the decision in the proceeding is in favor of the grower, the decision may include a provision requiring compensation to the grower for the estimated value of the seed production services a grower provides to a dealer, including, but not limited to, labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product.\n(C) If a dealer fails to comply with the financial obligations of a judgment rendered in a conciliation, mediation, or arbitration proceeding between a dealer and a grower commenced pursuant to this subdivision following the conclusion of all appeals in the proceeding, the secretary may revoke the dealer\u2019s registration and prevent the dealer from renewing his or her registration until the time the financial obligation is fulfilled.\n(2) Conciliation, mediation, or arbitration shall not affect any enforcement action by the secretary pursuant to this chapter. Regulations adopted by the secretary for the mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of disputes shall require that adequate notice be provided on the seed label notifying any buyer of the requirement to submit a dispute to mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitration as a prerequisite to other dispute resolution mechanisms, including litigation.\n(g) Establish additional labeling requirements for coated, pelleted, encapsulated, mat, tape, or any other germination medium or device used on seed in order that the purchaser or consumer will be informed as to the actual amount of seed purchased.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 55631 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n55631.\n(a) Every producer of any farm product that sells any product that is grown by him or her to any processor under contract, express or implied, in addition to all other rights and remedies that are provided for by law, has a lien upon that product and upon all processed or manufactured forms of that farm product for his or her labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product. The lien shall be to the extent of the agreed price, if any, for that product so sold. If there is no agreed price or a method for determining it that is agreed upon, the extent of the lien is the value of the farm product as of the date of the delivery. Any portion of that product or the processed or manufactured forms of that product, in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the total amount owed to producers under contract, shall be free and clear of that lien.\n(b) Every producer of a flower, agricultural, or vegetable seed that sells seed that is grown by him or her, when the seed was purchased or supplied by the grower and not supplied by the dealer or an independent third party who paid for the seed, to any seed dealer under contract, express or implied, in addition to all other rights and remedies that are provided for by law, has a lien upon that product and upon all processed or manufactured forms of that product for his or her labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product. The lien shall be to the extent of the agreed price, if any, for that product so sold. If there is no agreed price or a method for determining it that is agreed upon, the extent of the lien is the value of that product as of the date of the delivery. Any portion of that product or the processed or manufactured forms of that product, in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the total amount owed to producers under contract, shall be free and clear of that lien.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 56109 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n56109.\n\u201cFarm product\u201d includes every agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, and vegetable product of the soil, poultry and poultry products, livestock products and livestock not for immediate slaughter, bees and apiary products, hay, dried beans, honey, and cut flowers.
