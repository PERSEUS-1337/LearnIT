    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Homecoming Enhancement Research and \nOversight (HERO) Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. STUDY ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER READJUSTMENT \n              NEEDS OF MEMBERS AND FORMER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES \n              WHO DEPLOYED IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND OPERATION \n              ENDURING FREEDOM AND THEIR FAMILIES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The order on April 11, 2007 to extend the tour of duty \n        for members of the Army on active duty in Operation Iraqi \n        Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom to 15 months is placing \n        additional strains on the wellness of members of the Armed \n        Forces and their families back home.\n            (2) 20,000 United States troops have been deployed at least \n        5 times since the war effort began. 70,000 have been deployed \n        at 3 least times.\n            (3) Sixty percent of deployed members of the Armed Forces \n        have family responsibilities.\n            (4) More than 500,000 children have one or more parents \n        deployed in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT) at any \n        given time.\n            (5) It is estimated that more than 2,700 children in the \n        United States have lost a parent in Operation Iraqi Freedom or \n        Operation Enduring Freedom.\n            (6) Women now comprise 16 percent of the all voluntary \n        military force, yet there is a lack of research on the \n        psychological needs and readjustment concerns of female \n        military personnel.\n            (7) Members of the Armed Forces who have screened positive \n        for a mental health disorder were twice as likely as members \n        who have screened negative for a mental health disorder to \n        report concern about possible stigmatization and other barriers \n        to accessing care. Among members of the Armed Forces who \n        screened positive for a mental health disorder, only between 23 \n        percent and 40 percent have sought care.\n            (8) As many as one quarter of all members of the Armed \n        Forces returning from a combat zone have less visible \n        psychological injuries.\n            (9) On average, more than 20 percent of wounded members of \n        the Armed Forces have a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).\n            (10) More than a decade passed between the end of the \n        conflict in Vietnam and the publication by the Federal \n        Government of its landmark study on the readjustment needs of \n        veterans of that conflict. The impacts of the wars in Iraq and \n        Afghanistan on members of the Armed Forces, former members of \n        the Armed Forces, and their families must be rigorously \n        researched and addressed without a wait of 10 years.\n    (b) Study Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, enter into an \nagreement with the National Academy of Sciences for a study on the \nphysical and mental health and other readjustment needs of members and \nformer members of the Armed Forces who deployed in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and their families as a result of \nsuch deployment.\n    (c) Phases.--The study required under subsection (b) shall consist \nof two phases:\n            (1) A preliminary phase, to be completed not later than 180 \n        days after the date of the enactment of this Act--\n                    (A) to identify preliminary findings on the \n                physical and mental health and other readjustment needs \n                described in subsection (b) and on gaps in care for the \n                members, former members, and families described in that \n                subsection; and\n                    (B) to determine the parameters of the second phase \n                of the study under paragraph (2).\n            (2) A second phase, to be completed not later than three \n        years after the date of the enactment of this Act, to carry out \n        a comprehensive assessment, in accordance with the parameters \n        identified under the preliminary report required by paragraph \n        (1), of the physical and mental health and other readjustment \n        needs of members and former members of the Armed Forces who \n        deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring \n        Freedom and their families as a result of such deployment, \n        including, at a minimum--\n                    (A) an assessment of the psychological, social, and \n                economic impacts of such deployment on such members and \n                former members and their families;\n                    (B) an assessment of the particular impacts of \n                multiple deployments in Operation Iraqi Freedom or \n                Operation Enduring Freedom on such members and former \n                members and their families;\n                    (C) an assessment of the full scope of the \n                neurological, psychiatric, and psychological effects of \n                Traumatic Brain Injury on members and former members of \n                the Armed Forces, including the effects of such effects \n                on the family members of such members and former \n                members, and an assessment of the efficacy of current \n                treatment approaches for Traumatic Brain Injury in the \n                United States and the efficacy of screenings and \n                treatment approaches for Traumatic Brain Injury within \n                the Department of Defense and the Department of \n                Veterans Affairs;\n                    (D) an assessment of the effects of undiagnosed \n                injuries such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) \n                and Traumatic Brain Injury, and an estimate of the \n                long-term costs associated with such injuries;\n                    (E) an assessment of the particular needs and \n                concerns of female members of the Armed Forces and \n                female veterans;\n                    (F) an assessment of the particular needs and \n                concerns of minority members of the Armed Forces and \n                minority veterans;\n                    (G) an assessment of the particular educational and \n                vocational needs of such members and former members and \n                their families;\n                    (H) the development, based on such assessments, of \n                recommendations for programs, treatments, or policy \n                remedies targeted at preventing, minimizing or \n                addressing the impacts, gaps and needs identified;
