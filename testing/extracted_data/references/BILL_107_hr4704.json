FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Approximately 7,000,000 Americans suffer from food \n        allergies. Every year roughly 30,000 people receive emergency \n        room treatment due to the ingestion of allergenic foods, and an \n        estimated 150 Americans die from anaphylactic shock caused by a \n        food allergy.\n            (2) Eight major foods--milk, egg, fish, Crustacea, tree \n        nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans--cause 90 percent of \n        allergic reactions. At present, there is no cure for food \n        allergies. A food allergic consumer depends on a product's \n        label to obtain accurate and reliable ingredient information so \n        as to avoid food allergens.\n            (3) Current Food and Drug Administration regulations exempt \n        spices, flavorings, and certain colorings and additives from \n        ingredient labeling requirements that would allow consumers to \n        avoid those to which they are allergic. Such unlabeled food \n        allergens may pose a serious health threat to those susceptible \n        to food allergies.\n            (4) A recent Food and Drug Administration study found that \n        25 percent of bakery products, ice creams, and candies that \n        were inspected failed to list peanuts and eggs, which can cause \n        potentially fatal allergic reactions. The mislabeling of foods \n        puts those with a food allergy at constant risk.\n            (5) In that study, the Food and Drug Administration found \n        that only slightly more than half of inspected manufacturers \n        checked their products to ensure that all ingredients were \n        accurately reflected on the labels. Furthermore, the number of \n        recalls because of unlabeled allergens rose to 121 in 2000 from \n        about 35 a decade earlier. In part, mislabeling occurs because \n        potentially fatal allergens are introduced into the \n        manufacturing process when production lines and cooking \n        utensils are shared or used to produce multiple products.\n            (6) Individuals who have food allergies may outgrow their \n        allergy if they strictly avoid consuming the allergen. However, \n        some scientists believe that because low levels of allergens \n        are unintentionally present in foods, those with an allergy are \n        unable to keep from being repeatedly exposed to the very foods \n        they are allergic to. Good manufacturing practices can minimize \n        the unintentional presence of food allergens. In addition, when \n        good manufacturing practices cannot eliminate the potential for \n        cross-contamination, an advisory label on the product can \n        provide additional consumer protection.\n            (7) The Food and Drug Administration is the Nation's \n        principal consumer protection agency, charged with protecting \n        and promoting public health through premarket and postmarket \n        regulation of food. The agency must have both the necessary \n        authority to ensure that foods are properly labeled and \n        produced using good manufacturing practices and the ability to \n        penalize manufacturers who violate our food safety laws.\n            (8) Americans deserve to have confidence in the safety and \n        labeling of the food on their tables.\n\nSEC. 3. FOOD LABELING; REQUIREMENT OF INFORMATION REGARDING ALLERGENIC \n              SUBSTANCES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(t)(1) If it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it \nintentionally bears or contains, a known food allergen, unless its \nlabel bears, in bold face type, the common or usual name of the known \nfood allergen and the common or usual name of the food source described \nin subparagraph (3)(A) from which the known food allergen is derived, \nexcept that the name of the food source is not required when the common \nor usual name of the known food allergen plainly identifies the food \nsource.\n    ``(2) The information required under this paragraph may appear in \nlabeling other than the label only if the Secretary finds that such \nother labeling is sufficient to protect the public health. A finding by \nthe Secretary under this subparagraph is effective upon publication in \nthe Federal Register as a notice (including any change in an earlier \nfinding under this subparagraph).\n    ``(3) For purposes of this Act, the term `known food allergen' \nmeans any of the following:\n            ``(A) Milk, egg, fish, Crustacea, tree nuts, wheat, \n        peanuts, and soybeans.\n            ``(B) A proteinaceous substance derived from a food \n        specified in clause (A), unless the Secretary determines that \n        the substance does not cause an allergic response that poses a \n        risk to human health.\n            ``(C) Other grains containing gluten (rye, barley, oats, \n        and triticale).\n            ``(D) In addition, any food that the Secretary by \n        regulation determines causes an allergic or other adverse \n        response that poses a risk to human health.\n    ``(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (g), (i), or (k), or any other law, \nthe labeling requirement under this paragraph applies to spices, \nflavorings, colorings, or incidental additives that are, or that bear \nor contain, a known food allergen.\n    ``(u) If it is a raw agricultural commodity that is, or bears or \ncontains, a known food allergen, unless it has a label or other \nlabeling that bears in bold face type the common or usual name of the \nknown food allergen and the Secretary has found that the label or other \nlabeling is sufficient to protect the public health. A finding by the \nSecretary under this paragraph is effective upon publication in the \nFederal Register as a notice (including any change in an earlier \nfinding under this paragraph).\n    ``(w) If the labeling required under paragraphs (g), (i), (k), (t), \n(u), or (v)--\n            ``(1) does not use a single, easy-to-read type style that \n        is black on a white background, using upper and lower case \n        letters and with no letters touching;\n            ``(2) does not use at least 8 point type with at least one \n        point leading (i.e., space between two lines of text), provided \n        the total surface area of the food package available to bear \n        labeling exceeds 12 square inches; or\n            ``(3) does not comply with regulations issued by the \n        Secretary to make it easy for consumers to read and use such \n        labeling by requiring a format that is comparable to the format \n        required for the disclosure of nutrition information in the \n        food label under section 101.9(d)(1) of title 21, Code of \n        Federal Regulations.''.\n    (b) Civil Penalties.--Section 303(g)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333(g)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``section 402(a)(2)(B) \n        shall be subject'' and inserting the following: ``section \n        402(a)(2)(B) or regulations under this chapter to minimize the \n        unintended presence of allergens in food, or that is misbranded \n        within the meaning of section 403(t), 403(u), 403(v), or \n        403(w), shall be subject''; and\n            (2) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``or misbranded'' \n        after ``adulterated'' each place such term appears.\n    (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(ll) The term `known food allergen' has the meaning given such \nterm in section 403(t)(3).''.\n  (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section take effect \nupon the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the \nenactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. UNINTENTIONAL PRESENCE OF KNOWN FOOD ALLERGENS.\n\n    (a) Food Labeling of Such Food Allergens.--Section 403 of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by section 3(a) of \nthis Act, is amended by inserting after paragraph (u) the following:\n    ``(v) If the presence of a known food allergen in the food is \nunintentional and its labeling bears a statement that the food may bear \nor contain the known food allergen, or any similar statement, unless \nthe statement is made in compliance with regulations issued by the \nSecretary to provide for advisory labeling of the known food \nallergen.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) takes \neffect upon the expiration of the four-year period beginning on the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, except with respect to the authority \nof the Secretary of Health and Human Services to engage in rulemaking \nin accordance with section 5.\n\nSEC. 5.
