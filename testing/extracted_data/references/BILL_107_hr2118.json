FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Lyme disease is a common but frequently misunderstood \n        illness that, if not caught early and treated properly, can \n        cause serious health problems.\n            (2) Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is \n        transmitted by a tick bite. Early signs of infection may \n        include a rash and flu-like symptoms such as fever, muscle \n        aches, headaches, and fatigue.\n            (3) Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics \n        if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it \n        mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed.\n            (4) If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive \n        treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, \n        neurological, eye, and joint problems.\n            (5) Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all \n        vector-borne infections in the United States, the ticks that \n        spread Lyme disease also spread other disorders, such as \n        ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and other strains of Borrelia. All of \n        these diseases in 1 patient makes diagnosis and treatment more \n        difficult.\n            (6) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, cases of this tick-borne disease have increased 25-\n        fold since national surveillance of it began in 1982. Although \n        tick-borne disease cases have been reported in 49 States and \n        the District of Columbia, about 90 percent of the 15,000 cases \n        have been reported in the following 10 States: Connecticut, \n        Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maryland, \n        Massachusetts, Minnesota, Delaware, and Wisconsin. Studies have \n        shown that the actual number of tick-borne disease cases are \n        approximately 10 times the amount reported due to poor \n        surveillance of the disease.\n            (7) According to studies, Lyme disease costs our Nation \n        between $1,000,000,000 to $2,000,000,000 each year in increased \n        medical costs, lost productivity, prolonged pain and suffering, \n        unnecessary testing, and costly delays in diagnosis and \n        inappropriate treatment.\n            (8) Patients with Lyme disease are increasingly having \n        difficulty obtaining diagnosis and treatment for the disease, \n        and being restored to health. Because of differences in medical \n        and scientific opinion, clinicians fear retaliation from \n        insurance companies and medical licensure boards based on their \n        diagnosis and treatment of patients.\n            (9) A number of patients have difficulties in obtaining \n        insurance coverage for treatment of Lyme disease.\n            (10) Despite 14 years of Federal funding, there is still no \n        test that can accurately determine infection so that proper \n        treatment is adequately achieved. Persistence of symptomatology \n        in many patients without reliable testing makes treatment of \n        patients more difficult.\n            (11) According to the General Accounting Office, over the \n        past 10 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        has only increased its allocation for tick-borne research and \n        education by 7 percent, from $6,900,000 to $7,400,000. Over \n        that same period, the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention's expenditures for infectious diseases rose 318 \n        percent, from $70,800,000 to $296,000,000.\n            (12) According to the General Accounting Office, over the \n        past 10 years, the National Institutes of Health have increased \n        expenditures almost every year, from $13,100,000 in fiscal year \n        1991 to $26,000,000 in fiscal year 2000.\n            (13) The Lyme disease vaccine gained approval from the Food \n        and Drug Administration in 1998. Since that time, the Food and \n        Drug Administration has received over 1,000 adverse event \nreports on the vaccine, including reports of severe arthritic symptoms \nand even Lyme disease.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a Tick-Borne Disorders \nAdvisory Committee that will--\n            (1) provide a public voice regarding the direction and \n        activities of the governmental agencies that deal with Lyme \n        disease in order to create a better understanding and response \n        by the government to the public need regarding the disease;\n            (2) assure communication and coordination regarding tick-\n        borne disorder issues between agencies of the Department of \n        Health and Human Services, the biomedical community, and \n        voluntary organizations concerned; and\n            (3) promote coordination of activities with the Social \n        Security Administration and Department of Defense.\n\nSEC. 4.
