    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``High-End Computing Revitalization \nAct of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) high-end computing is a critical component of the \n        scientific advances, defense capabilities, and commercial \n        competitiveness of the United States in the 21st century;\n            (2) with the deployment of the Earth System Simulator in \n        Japan, the United States no longer has a clear lead in high-end \n        computing worldwide;\n            (3)(A) promising new architectures should be developed that \n        increase memory and network bandwidth, minimize latency, and \n        coordinate the architectures' various components to maximize \n        application performance; and\n            (B) it is recognized that different architectures may be \n        better suited to different applications;\n            (4)(A) software that improves efficiency on and \n        accessibility to high-end systems should be developed; and\n            (B) this development effort should include research in \n        optimal algorithms, programming environments, tools, languages, \n        and operating systems for high-end computing, in collaboration \n        with architecture development efforts;\n            (5) without government support, market forces are unlikely \n        to drive sufficient innovation in high-end computing, because \n        the private sector would not capture the full value of its \n        innovations on a short enough time frame; and\n            (6) having played an important role in the development of \n        high-end computing, networking, and information technology, the \n        Department of Energy, and the research programs of the Office \n        of Science of the Department, are particularly qualified to \n        lead research in those fields.\n\nSEC. 3.
