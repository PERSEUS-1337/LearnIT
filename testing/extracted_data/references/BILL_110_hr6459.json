FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Despite the dramatic increase in the number of \n        adoptions out of foster care since the enactment of the \n        Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-89; 111 \n        Stat. 2115), there are still 114,000 children in foster care \n        with the goal of adoption. Of these, only 13 percent are \n        currently living in a preadoptive home. At the same time, in a \n        given year, 240,000 people in the United States will call for \n        information about adopting a child from foster care. \n        Ultimately, however, only a very small fraction of prospective \n        parents interested in adopting children in foster care will end \n        up doing so. As a result, thousands of needy children will \n        remain in foster care and thousands of prospective parents will \n        remain childless.\n            (2) According to a recent study conducted by Harvard \n        University and the Urban Institute in collaboration with the \n        Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, 78 percent of adults who \n        call for information about becoming adoptive parents will not \n        fill out an application or attend an orientation meeting. Only \n        6 percent of those who call for information actually complete \n        the adoption home study, a requirement for all prospective \n        parents.\n            (3) Research shows that prospective adoptive parents often \n        face a number of barriers that discourage them from adopting \n        children out of foster care, including difficulty in accessing \n        the child welfare agency and unpleasant experiences during \n        critical initial contacts with the child welfare agency, as \n        well as ongoing frustration with the agency or aspects of the \n        process. The 2 primary ways people learn about adoption from \n        foster care are the media and word of mouth. Negative \n        experiences with the adoption process have resounding effects \n        as 1 parent's frustration is expressed to friends, families, \n        and acquaintances.\n\nSEC. 3. CHILD WELFARE AGENCY DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``child welfare agency'' means an entity of a \nState, regional or local area, or Indian tribe, that has primary \nresponsibility in such a State, regional or local area, or Indian tribe \nfor the facilitation of adoptions from the child welfare system.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in this Act \nas the ``Secretary'') shall carry out, in accordance with the \nprovisions of this Act, a pilot program of making not less than 10 \ngrants to child welfare agencies that is designed to effect long-range \nimprovements in the adoption process by increasing prospective adoptive \nparent access to adoption information and strengthening such agencies \nresponsiveness to prospective adoptive parents.\n\nSEC. 5. APPLICATION.\n\n    A child welfare agency that desires to receive a grant under this \nAct shall submit an application at such time, in such manner, and \naccompanied by such information as the Secretary may require.\n\nSEC. 6.

The \n        involvement of academic institutions or nonprofit research \n        institutions in the process and follow-up design may also be \n        included.\n            (2) The child welfare agency intends to improve the first \n        contact between prospective adoptive parents and the agency \n        through the following:\n                    (A) The establishment of a specialized adoption \n                hotline for tracking incoming calls to better \n                understand the adoptive parent attrition rate.\n                    (B) The hiring of employees with a background in \n                counseling and providing specialized adoption training \n                so such employees answer callers' requests efficiently. \n                Training shall emphasize the importance of customer \n                service in addition to traditional counseling skills, \n                address the particular needs of workers and \n                supervisors, and stress the importance of reducing \n                staff turnover.\n                    (C) The establishment of a process to solicit and \n                incorporate feedback from all prospective parents, \n                including those who exit the process early on, in \n                designing and improving the adoption process.\n            (3) The child welfare agency--\n                    (A) will promote recruitment at the start of the \n                process by providing prospective parents with clear, \n                written guidelines about qualifications and grounds for \n                being screened out; and\n                    (B) will ensure that all staff are trained in \n                skills needed to engage a prospective parent in the \n                adoption process and, when possible, will separate the \n                recruitment and screening processes.\n            (4) The child welfare agency coordinates all adoption \n        sources to afford prospective parents immediate access to all \n        children available for adoption.\n            (5) The child welfare agency offers an explicit explanation \n        of the adoption process for all prospective families that \n        includes the roles that various workers play, relationships \n        among the different agencies, and the information necessary to \n        navigate through the process. This information shall include \n        the reasoning behind standard adoption procedures, such as home \n        studies, criminal background checks, and psychological and \n        health evaluations.\n            (6) The child welfare agency shall provide clear \n        information about the matching process, including expected \n        timeline, to prospective parents.\n            (7) The child welfare agency shall provide a clear overview \n        of the adoption process for all prospective families, \n        including--\n                    (A) the rewards and challenges of the process;\n                    (B) the availability of and the process of \n                accessing adoption assistance;\n                    (C) the legal process of adoption; and\n                    (D) the availability of post-permanency services.\n            (8) The child welfare agency shall make every effort to \n        involve successful adoptive parents in aspects of the adoption \n        process, including designing recruitment strategies, training, \n        and matching.\n            (9) The child welfare agency shall establish an adoption \n        advisory committee for strengthening procedures for matching \n        waiting children with adoptive parents. The committee shall be \n        composed of adoption professionals, successful adoptive \n        parents, and others with expertise in assessing a child's \n        adoption needs for the purpose of improving the matching \n        process.\n            (10) The child welfare agency shall develop a mentoring \n        system linking prospective and established adoptive parents.\n            (11) The child welfare agency agrees to comply with the \n        evaluation procedures set forth by the agencies and research \n        entity described in section 8.\n\nSEC. 7.
