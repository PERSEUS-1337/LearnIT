    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Commission on Women Act \nof 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Presidential \nCommission on Women'' (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings and statement of policy:\n            (1) It is the role of Government to examine the \n        circumstances that contribute to discrimination, inequality, \n        and economic hardship faced by women throughout the country.\n            (2) It is the role of Government to establish initiatives \n        and programs that promote equality for women, and protect \n        against discrimination of women, in all areas of public and \n        private life.\n            (3) Women in our country continue to face inequalities and \n        discrimination in many areas of public and private life, \n        including but not limited to these examples:\n                    (A) The United States ranks 71st in the world in \n                the number of women in elected office. In 2009, women \n                make up 17 percent of Congress and 24 percent of State \n                legislative office-holders. Women of color make up 4 \n                percent of Congress and 2 percent of State legislative \n                office-holders.\n                    (B) Women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to \n                men. African-American women earn 69 cents on the dollar \n                compared to men. Latinas earn 59 cents compared to men.\n                    (C) Of workers earning minimum wage, 68 percent are \n                women. Of workers earning less than the minimum wage, \n                69 percent are women. Nineteen percent of women, as \n                compared to 10 percent of men, have annual family \n                incomes of less than $19,000. Of Fortune 500 CEOs, 2 \n                percent are women.\n                    (D) With only 76 percent of women in the labor \n                force, the United States ranks sixth from the bottom \n                among industrialized nations. Among college-educated \n                women, the United States ranks last among \n                industrialized nations.\n                    (E) While 57 percent of men are employed full-time, \n                only 38 percent of women are employed full-time. Eight \n                out of ten single-parent families are headed by women; \n                28 percent of people living in female-headed households \n                are living below the poverty line.\n                    (F) There is a continuing decline in mothers' \n                employment largely due to a lack of support for working \n                parents, such as sufficient paid time off, subsidized \n                child care, or flexible working arrangements. There is \n                also discrimination in the labor market specifically \n                against mothers as well as weakness on the demand side \n                of the labor market in areas that have traditionally \n                employed large numbers of women.\n                    (G) One in every four women will experience \n                domestic violence in her lifetime. Eighty-five percent \n                of domestic violence victims are women. The cost of \n                intimate partner violence exceeds $5.8 billion each \n                year, $4.1 billion of which is for direct medical and \n                mental health services.\n                    (H) Eighteen percent of women in the United States \n                do not have health insurance; 36 percent of American \n                Indian/Native Alaskan women are uninsured; 38 percent \n                of Hispanic women do not have health insurance.\n                    (I) Women of color are disproportionately affected \n                by the inequalities women face.\n                    (J) Gender bias and discrimination remain pervasive \n                in almost all aspects of our culture, including but not \n                limited to the media, family life, the workplace, \n                sports, education, health care, the military, \n                entertainment, and financial matters.\n\nSEC. 4.
