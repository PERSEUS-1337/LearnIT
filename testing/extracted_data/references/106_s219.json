FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States and Canada share the longest \n        undefended border in the world.\n            (2) The United States and Canada enjoy the world's largest \n        bilateral trading relationship, and that relationship is \n        continuing to expand. Two-way trade between the United States \n        and Canada has more than doubled since the United States-Canada \n        Free Trade Agreement was implemented, increasing from \n        $153,000,000,000 in 1988 to $320,000,000,000 in 1997.\n            (3) On February 24, 1995, the United States and Canada \n        agreed to the Canada/United States of America Accord on Our \n        Shared Border (in this Act referred to as the ``Shared Border \n        Accord'') to promote common objectives along the border, \n        including--\n                    (A) facilitating the movement of commercial goods \n                and people between both countries;\n                    (B) reducing the costs of border management; and\n                    (C) enhancing protections against drugs, smuggling, \n                and the illegal and irregular movement of people.\n            (4) The Shared Border Accord has already resulted in \n        increased harmonization, shared training, and joint facilities \n        between United States and Canadian customs agencies.\n            (5) Increased trade has resulted in a significant increase \n        in merchandise entries and cross-border traffic between the \n        United States and Canada. For example--\n                    (A) formal entries of merchandise on the Northern \n                border have increased sixfold from 1,000,000 in 1980 to \n                6,000,000 in 1997;\n                    (B) the number of individuals crossing the Northern \n                border has more than doubled from 54,000,000 in 1989 to \n                112,000,000 in 1997; and\n                    (C) approximately 40,000,000 privately-owned \n                vehicles cross the Northern land border annually.\n            (6) The staffing and technology acquisitions of the Customs \n        Service have not kept pace with the increased trade and traffic \n        along the Northern border. For example--\n                    (A) the current number of authorized United States \n                Customs inspectors along the United States-Canadian \n                border is essentially the same as the number employed \n                in 1980;\n                    (B) United States Customs understaffing is the \n                primary cause of congestion at border crossings;\n                    (C) Customs Service acquisitions of new technology \n                for border management have been principally deployed on \n                the Southern border despite the enormous growth in \n                trade and traffic across the United States-Canadian \n                border; and\n                    (D) outmoded technologies and inadequate equipment \n                have increased congestion along the Northern border.\n            (7) Since 1952, the Customs Service has performed \n        preclearance activities in Canada, inspecting passengers and \n        baggage prior to their departure from Canada rather than upon \n        arrival in the United States. Such preclearance activities have \n        facilitated the movement of people and merchandise across the \n        United States-Canadian border.\n            (8) The Customs Service has stated that it is eliminating \n        the preclearance positions because it believes that it no \n        longer has the statutory authority to fund the positions.\n            (9) Loss of these positions would increase congestion and \n        delays at United States ports as the Customs Service would \n        require inspections to be performed in the United States, \n        rather than abroad.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate commerce and \nthe movement of people and traffic across the United States-Canadian \nborder, while maintaining enforcement, by--\n            (1) authorizing the funds necessary to open all of the \n        Customs Service's primary inspection lanes along the United \n        States-Canadian border during peak hours;\n            (2) authorizing the funds necessary to supply the Customs \n        Service with the appropriate advanced technology to conduct \n        inspections along the United States-Canadian border and to \n        participate fully in the Shared Border Accord;\n            (3) authorizing the Customs Service to pay for preclearance \n        positions in Canada out of the funds already being collected \n        from passenger processing fees; and\n            (4) authorizing the Customs Service to use a portion of the \n        funds collected from the merchandise processing fee to develop \n        automated commercial systems to facilitate the processing of \n        merchandise.\n\nTITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES CUSTOMS \nSERVICE FOR ENHANCED INSPECTION AND TRADE FACILITATION ALONG THE UNITED \n                         STATES-CANADIAN BORDER\n\nSEC. 101.
