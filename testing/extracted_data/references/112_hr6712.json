FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mental illness is the leading cause of disability, as \n        reflected in lost years of productive life, in North America, \n        in Europe, and, increasingly, in the world. By 2020, major \n        depressive illness will be the leading cause of disability in \n        the world for women and children.\n            (2) Mental illnesses strike individuals in the prime of \n        their lives, often during adolescence and young adulthood. All \n        ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially \n        vulnerable.\n            (3) Without treatment, the consequences of mental illness \n        for the individual and society are staggering, including \n        unnecessary disability, unemployment, substance abuse, \n        homelessness, inappropriate incarceration, suicide, wasted \n        lives, and an economic cost of more than $100 billion each year \n        in the United States.\n            (4) The best treatments for serious mental illnesses today \n        are highly effective so that between 70 and 90 percent of \n        individuals with serious mental illness have significant \n        reduction of symptoms and improved quality of life with a \n        combination of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments and \n        supports.\n            (5) Since early identification and treatment is of vital \n        importance in treating mental illness, especially for children \n        and young adults, the active, knowledgeable, and sympathetic \n        involvement of parents and legal guardians is to be encouraged \n        to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with generally \n        accepted and established clinical practice.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCLOSURE TO PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS OF MENTAL ILLNESS \n              TREATMENT OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 26.\n\n    (a) In General.--In the case of a covered individual (as defined in \nsubsection (e)(1)) who is being treated for mental illness by a health \ncare professional, subject to subsection (b), the health care \nprofessional shall disclose to a parent (if any) of the individual such \ninformation regarding the mental illness and treatment for mental \nillness as may be useful for the appropriate involvement of the parent \nwith respect to the treatment.\n    (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply in such exceptional \ncircumstances as the Secretary may provide by regulation where the \ninvolvement of the parent would be counter-productive to the treatment \ninvolved.\n    (c) Application of HIPAA Privacy Regulations.--For purposes of \napplying the HIPAA privacy regulations, the disclosure of information \nunder this section shall be treated as a permissible disclosure not \nrequiring the consent of the covered individual involved.\n    (d) Publication and Notice on Department Websites.--The Secretary \nshall post information on the requirements of this section on such \nwebsites of the Department of Health and Human Services as may be \nappropriate to inform the public and health care professionals.\n    (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Covered individual.--The term ``covered individual'' \n        means an individual who--\n                    (A) is--\n                            (i) a minor child;\n                            (ii) an uninsured adult under the age of \n                        26; or\n                            (iii) an adult under the age of 26 who is \n                        covered as a dependent under the health \n                        benefits coverage of a parent; and\n                    (B) is being treated for mental illness by a health \n                care professional.\n            (2) Health benefits coverage.--The term ``health benefits \n        coverage'' has the meaning given the term ``minimum essential \n        coverage'' in section 5000A(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code \n        of 1986.\n            (3) HIPAA privacy regulations.--The term ``HIPAA privacy \n        regulations'' has the meaning given the term ``HIPAA privacy \n        regulation'' in section 1180(b)(3) of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1320d-9(b)(3)).\n            (4) Mental illness.--The term ``mental illness'' means a \n        chronic illness such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective \n        disorder, bipolar disorder, and major clinical depression, and \n        such term includes other conditions contained in the Diagnostic \n        and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV published by the \n        American Psychiatric Association (or any successor publication \n        by such Association).\n            (5) Parent.--The term ``parent'' includes a legal guardian.\n            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services.\n            (7) Uninsured.--An individual shall be treated as uninsured \n        if the individual is not covered under any health benefits \n        coverage."
