FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Geospatial technologies and geospatial data can provide \n        all levels of government and the private sector with proven \n        capabilities to carry out detection, planning, preparedness, \n        mitigation, response, and recovery activities for homeland \n        security purposes that save lives and protect property.\n            (2) The completion and maintenance of the National Spatial \n        Data Infrastructure with integrated applications and systems \n        will provide the level of geospatial preparedness required to \n        protect critical infrastructure, strategic assets, the economic \n        base, and persons.\n            (3) Geospatial technology and information have proven to be \n        essential to enabling more informed decisionmaking, greater \n        efficiency, increased accountability, and better management in \n        all levels of government and the private sector.\n            (4) Building spatial data once and then sharing it many \n        times between all levels of government and the private sector \n        increases the ability of information technology applications \n        and systems to provide better services to the public in a cost-\n        effective manner.\n            (5) The use of international, national, and industry \n        consensus standards to develop and deploy interoperable \n        geospatial data and geospatial technologies assists the \n        commercial geospatial industry to provide products that make it \n        easier, faster, and less expensive for all levels of government \n        and the private sector to share, integrate, and use geospatial \n        data for decisionmaking.\n            (6) Establishing a new Federal Government program to \n        provide financial incentives to State, regional, local, and \n        tribal governments will greatly accelerate adoption of \n        international, national, and industry consensus standards.\n            (7) Geospatial technologies and geospatial data can be \n        essential tools for virtually all functions of government and \n        business.\n            (8) Geospatial preparedness in the United States is not \n        adequate due to a variety of factors including inadequate \n        geospatial data compatibility, insufficient geospatial data \n        sharing, technology interoperability barriers, institutional \n        and organizational resistance to new ways of doing business, \n        lack of financial incentives to improved use of geospatial \n        technologies, and inefficient geospatial data collection and \n        sharing.\n            (9) Interoperable geospatial technology and geospatial data \n        capabilities are emerging and incentives are needed for full \n        adoption and for collaborative use to meet community and \n        national needs.\n            (10) Geospatial technologies and geospatial data are \n        maintained by all levels of government and the private sector. \n        A comprehensive nationwide program is necessary to build and \n        maintain a standards-based geospatial spatial data \n        infrastructure and geographic information systems required to \n        respond to increasing demands.\n            (11) State, regional, local, and tribal governments, the \n        private sector, and other non-government organizations are \n        investing in geospatial technologies and geospatial data. \n        Incentives are necessary to leverage these investments for more \n        effective use to meet community and national needs.\n            (12) Establishing the Office of Geospatial Management, \n        administered by a Geospatial Information Officer, within the \n        Department of Homeland Security will ensure the most effective \n        and efficient management of programs and activities involving \n        geospatial technologies and geospatial data.\n\nSEC. 3.
