FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1968, 2nd Street of Silvis, Illinois, was renamed \n        Hero Street, a tribute to the sacrifice and patriotism of its \n        residents.\n            (2) Many Mexican families immigrated to Silvis during the \n        1920s and 1930s, seeking work with the local railroad line, and \n        settled on 2nd Street, where low-cost housing was available to \n        railroad workers and their families.\n            (3) When the United States entered World War II, the young \n        men of 2nd Street answered the Nation's call to serve. Of this \n        first generation of 2nd Street residents, six were killed in \n        World War II and two in the Korean Conflict.\n            (4) Despite tragedy, a strong tradition of military service \n        persisted within this small, historically Latino community as \n        the younger generations enlisted or were drafted.\n            (5) Today, over 100 men and women from Hero Street have \n        served in the Armed Forces of the United States, a \n        concentration higher than any other street comparable in size.\n            (6) The legacy of these brave soldiers has transformed this \n        small street into a point of national pride, and a park and \n        monument have been built in Silvis to honor the 8 deceased \n        service members as well as all who have served in the United \n        States Military.\n            (7) 2018 will mark the 50th anniversary of Hero Street's \n        renaming.\n\nSEC. 3.
