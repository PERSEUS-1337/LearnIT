FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of \n        scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and \n        improved treatment for disease.\n            (2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new \n        insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, \n        creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research.\n            (3) Clinical research includes translational research which \n        is an integral part of the research process leading to general \n        human applications. It is the bridge between the laboratory and \n        new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention and is thus \n        essential to progress against cancer and other diseases.\n            (4) The United States will spend more than $1 trillion on \n        health care in 1997, but the Federal budget for health research \n        at the National Institutes of Health was $12.7 billion, only 1 \n        percent of that total.\n            (5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National \n        Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have all \n        addressed the current problems in clinical research.\n            (6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has \n        recognized the current problems in clinical research and has \n        through the use of an advisory committee begun to evaluate \n        these problems.\n            (7) The current level of training and support for health \n        professionals in clinical research is fragmented, frequently \n        undervalued, and potentially underfunded.\n            (8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future \n        positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and ideas \n        in the day-to-day research that constitutes the scientific \n        enterprise. Serious questions about the future of life-science \n        research are raised by the following:\n                    (A) The number of young investigators applying for \n                grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.\n                    (B) The number of federally funded research (R01) \n                grants awarded to persons under the age of 36 have \n                decreased by 70 percent from 1985 to 1993.\n                    (C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected \n                to raise funds to support their new research programs \n                and a substantial proportion of their own salaries.\n            (9) The following have been cited as reasons for the \n        decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and those \n        choosing this career path:\n                    (A) A medical school graduate incurs an average \n                debt of $80,000, as reported in the Medical School \n                Graduation Questionnaire by the American Association of \n                Medical Colleges (AAMC).\n                    (B) The prolonged period of clinical training \n                required increases the accumulated debt burden.\n                    (C) The decreasing number of mentors and role \n                models.\n                    (D) The perceived instability of funding from the \n                National Institutes of Health and other Federal \n                agencies.\n                    (E) The almost complete absence of clinical \n                research training in the curriculum of training grant \n                awardees.\n                    (F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing \n                difficulties in maintaining a proper environment for \n                research in a highly competitive health care \n                marketplace, which are compounded by the decreased \n                willingness of third party payers to cover health care \n                costs for patients engaged in research studies and \n                research procedures.\n            (10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were \n        established under the Office of the Director of the National \n        Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of \n        $3,000,000.\n            (11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers \n        in fiscal year 1997 equaled $153,000,000.\n            (12) In fiscal year 1997, there were 74 general clinical \n        research centers in operation, supplying patients in the areas \n        in which such centers operate with access to the most modern \n        clinical research and clinical research facilities and \n        technologies.\n            (13) The average annual amount allocated for each general \n        clinical research center is $1,900,000, establishing a current \n        funding level of 75 percent of the amounts approved by the \n        Advisory Council of the National Center for Research Resources.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide additional \nsupport for and to expand clinical research programs.\n\nSEC. 3. INCREASING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH \n              IN CLINICAL RESEARCH.\n\n    Section 402 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 282) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(l)(1) The Director of NIH shall undertake activities to support \nand expand the involvement of the National Institutes of Health in \nclinical research.\n    ``(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Director of NIH shall--\n            ``(A) design test pilot projects and implement the \n        recommendations of the Division of Research Grants Clinical \n        Research Study Group and other recommendations for enhancing \n        clinical research, where applicable; and\n            ``(B) establish an intramural clinical research fellowship \n        program and a continuing education clinical research training \n        program at NIH.\n    ``(3) The Director of NIH, in cooperation with the Directors of the \nInstitutes, Centers, and Divisions of the National Institutes of \nHealth, shall support and expand the resources available for the \ndiverse needs of the clinical research community, including inpatient, \noutpatient, and critical care clinical research.\n    ``(4) The Director of NIH shall establish peer review mechanisms to \nevaluate applications for--\n            ``(A) clinical research career enhancement awards;\n            ``(B) innovative medical science awards;\n            ``(C) graduate training in clinical investigation awards;\n            ``(D) intramural clinical research fellowships.\nSuch review mechanisms shall include individuals who are exceptionally \nqualified to appraise the merits of potential clinical research \ntraining and research grant proposals.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
