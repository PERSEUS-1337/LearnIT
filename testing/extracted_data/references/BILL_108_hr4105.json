FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic \n        Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and \n        confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.\n            (2) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is \n        available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with \n        bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and a \n        TTY line for the hearing-impaired.\n            (3) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service \n        providers in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United \n        States Virgin Islands, the National Domestic Violence Hotline \n        provides crisis intervention and immediately connects callers \n        with sources of help in their local community.\n            (4) The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which was \n        created by the Violence Against Women Act and is located in \n        Austin, Texas, answered its first call on February 21, 1996, \n        and answered its one millionth call on August 4, 2003.\n            (5) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that \n        calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a \n        domestic violence situation and that they have not called the \n        police or any other support services.\n            (6) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase \n        in call volume.\n            (7) Due to high call volume and limited resources, \n        approximately 26,000 calls to the Hotline went unanswered in \n        2002 due to long hold times or busy signals.\n            (8) Widespread demand for the Hotline service continues. \n        The Department of Justice reported that over 18,000 acts of \n        violence were committed by intimate partners in the United \n        States each day during 2001. An average of 3 women are murdered \n        every day in the Nation by their husbands or boyfriends.\n            (9) Working with outdated telephone and computer equipment \n        creates many challenges for the National Domestic Violence \n        Hotline.\n            (10) Improving technology infrastructure at the National \n        Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, \n        and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically \n        increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly and \n        effectively.\n            (11) Partnerships between the public sector and the private \n        sector are an effective way of providing necessary technology \n        improvements to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n            (12) The Connections Campaign is a project that unites \n        nonprofit organizations, major corporations, and Federal \n        agencies to launch a major new initiative to help ensure that \n        the National Domestic Violence Hotline can answer every call \n        with upgraded, proficient, and sophisticated technology tools.\n\nSEC. 3.
