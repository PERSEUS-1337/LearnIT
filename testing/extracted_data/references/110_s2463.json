    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Alien Smuggling and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Alien smuggling by land, air, and sea is a \n        transnational crime that--\n                    (A) violates the integrity of United States \n                borders;\n                    (B) compromises the sovereignty of the United \n                States;\n                    (C) places our Nation at risk of terrorist \n                activity; and\n                    (D) contravenes the rule of law.\n            (2) Aggressive enforcement activity against alien smuggling \n        is needed to protect the borders of the United States and to \n        ensure our Nation's security. The border security and \n        antismuggling efforts of the men and women on the Nation's \n        front line of defense are commendable. Special recognition \n        should be given to the Border Patrol, the Coast Guard, United \n        States Customs and Border Protection, United States Immigration \n        and Customs Enforcement, and the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation.\n            (3) The law enforcement community must be given the \n        statutory tools necessary to address this security threat. The \n        United States Attorneys Offices and the Domestic Security \n        Section of the Criminal Division cannot prosecute these cases \n        successfully without effective alien smuggling statutes.\n            (4) Alien smuggling has a destabilizing effect on border \n        communities. State and local law enforcement, medical \n        personnel, social service providers, and the faith community \n        play important roles in combating smuggling and responding to \n        its effects.\n            (5) Existing penalties for alien smuggling are insufficient \n        to provide appropriate punishment for alien smugglers.\n            (6) Existing alien smuggling laws often fail to reach the \n        conduct of alien smugglers, transporters, recruiters, guides, \n        and boat captains.\n            (7) Existing laws concerning failure to heave to are \n        insufficient to appropriately punish boat operators and crew \n        who engage in the reckless transportation of aliens on the high \n        seas and seek to evade capture.\n            (8) Much of the conduct in alien smuggling rings occurs \n        outside of the United States. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is \n        needed to ensure that smuggling rings can be brought to justice \n        for recruiting, sending, and facilitating the movement of those \n        who seek to enter the United States without lawful authority.\n            (9) Alien smuggling can include unsafe or recklessly \n        dangerous conditions that expose individuals to particularly \n        high risk of injury or death.\n\nSEC. 3. CHECKS AGAINST TERRORIST WATCH LIST.\n\n    The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the extent \npracticable, check, against all available terrorist watch lists, alien \nsmugglers and smuggled individuals who are interdicted at the land, \nair, and sea borders of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. STRENGTHENING PROSECUTION AND PUNISHMENT OF ALIEN SMUGGLERS.\n\n    Section 274(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1324(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by amending the subsection heading to read as follows: \n        ``Bringing in, Harboring, and Smuggling of Unlawful and \n        Terrorist Aliens.--'';\n            (2) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n            ``(1)(A) A person shall be subject to the penalties \n        described in subparagraph (D) if the person, knowing or in \n        reckless disregard of the fact that an individual is an alien \n        who lacks lawful authority to come to, enter, or reside in the \n        United States, knowingly--\n                    ``(i) brings that individual to the United States, \n                regardless of any future official action which may be \n                taken with respect to that individual;\n                    ``(ii) recruits, encourages, or induces that \n                individual to come to, enter, or reside in the United \n                States;\n                    ``(iii) transports or moves that individual in the \n                United States, in furtherance of that individual's \n                unlawful presence;
