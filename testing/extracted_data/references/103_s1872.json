In making such assessment, \n                the Secretary shall consider the competitive position \n                of such goods and services in similarly developed \n                markets in other countries. Such assessment shall \n                specify the time periods within which such market \n                access opportunities should reasonably be expected to \n                be obtained.\n                    (B) Objective criteria for measuring the extent to \n                which those market access opportunities described in \n                subparagraph (A) have been obtained. The development of \n                such objective criteria may include the use of interim \n                objective criteria to measure results on a periodic \n                basis, as appropriate.\n    (b) Subsequent Annual Reports.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than the date which is 1 year \n        after the last day of the 90-day period referred to in \n        subsection (a)(1), and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall \n        submit to the Congress a report containing the following:\n                    (A) An assessment of the market access \n                opportunities that would be available in the Japanese \n                market, for goods and services produced or originating \n                in the United States in those sectors selected by the \n                Secretary, in the absence of the barriers to achieving \n                access to such market in both the public and private \n                sectors in Japan. In making such assessment, the \n                Secretary shall consider the competitive position of \n                such goods and services in similarly developed markets \n                in other countries. Such assessment shall specify the \n                time periods within which such market access \n                opportunities should reasonably be expected to be \n                obtained.\n                    (B) Objective criteria for measuring the extent to \n                which those market access opportunities described in \n                subparagraph (A) have been obtained. The development of \n                such objective criteria may include the use of interim \n                criteria described in subsection (a)(2)(B).\n                    (C) An assessment of whether, and to what extent, \n                Japan has materially complied with--\n                            (i) agreements and understandings reached \n                        between the United States and Japan pursuant to \n                        section 3, and\n                            (ii) existing trade agreements between the \n                        United States and Japan.\n                Such assessment shall include specific information on \n                the extent to which United States suppliers have \n                achieved additional access to the Japanese market and \n                the extent to which Japan has complied with other \n                commitments under such agreements and understandings.\n                    (D) An assessment of the effect of the agreements \n                and understandings described in subparagraph (C) on the \n                access to the Japanese markets of goods and services \n                produced or originating in the United States.\n            (2) Selection of sectors.--In selecting sectors that are to \n        be the subject of a report under paragraph (1), the Secretary \n        shall give priority to those sectors--\n                    (A) in which access to the Japanese market is \n                likely to have significant potential to increase \n                exports of United States goods and services;\n                    (B) in which access to the Japanese market will \n                result in significant employment benefits for producers \n                of United States goods and services; or\n                    (C) which represent critical technologies, \n                including those identified by the National Critical \n                Technologies Panel under section 603 of the National \n                Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and \n                Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6683).\n        The Secretary shall include an assessment under paragraph (1) \n        of any sector for which the Trade Representative requests such \n        assessment be made.
