STREAMLINED REFINANCING CRITERIA.\n\n    (a) In General.--In carrying out the Home Affordable Refinance \nProgram, each enterprise shall adopt and adhere to the criteria \nestablished under this section.\n    (b) Borrower Eligibility.--The enterprises shall include as \neligible borrowers in the Home Affordable Refinance Program all current \nborrowers who have an eligible mortgage and meet those underwriting \nrequirements for eligibility for same servicer refinancing in the \nProgram as of March 1, 2012, except that the enterprises may not \ndisqualify or impose varying rules within the Program for borrowers \nbased on LTV, CLTV, employment status or income.\n    (c) Representations and Warranties.--The enterprises shall not \nrequire of any lender providing a loan under the Program any \nrepresentations or warranties for such a loan--\n            (1) for the value, marketability, condition, or property \n        type, as evidenced by the appraisal or alternative valuation \n        methods, if that lender complies with the enterprises' required \n        methods and standards for ordering an appraisal under the \n        Program; or\n            (2) that are not required of same servicers under the \n        Program as of March 1, 2012, whether that loan is manually \n        underwritten or underwritten through an automated system, \n        except that, under no circumstances shall greater \n        representations and warranties be required for a loan that is \n        manually underwritten than for one that is underwritten through \n        an automated system.\n    (d) Prohibition on Up-Front Fees.--In carrying out the Program, the \nenterprises may not charge the qualified lender any loan level price \nadjustment, post settlement delivery fee, adverse delivery charge, or \nother similar up-front fee.\n    (e) Appraisals.--The enterprises shall develop and allow \nalternative streamlined methods to determine the value of the property \nfor which refinancing is sought through the Program that eliminate the \ncosts to the borrower and lender associated with such determination. \nUntil such time as such method is developed, and when the existing \nautomated valuation models of the enterprises are unable to determine \nthe value of a certain property for which refinancing is sought through \nthe Program, the enterprises shall bear the costs associated with the \nuse of manual appraisal of that property, without passing on such costs \nto the borrower or lender.\n    (f) Resubordination of Junior Liens.--\n            (1) In general.--If the holder of a junior lien fails to \n        resubordinate that lien, thereby preventing the refinancing of \n        the eligible mortgage through the Program into a new mortgage, \n        the holder of the junior lien shall be liable for an amount \n        equal to 5.0 percent of the first mortgage balance, unless--\n                    (A) the new mortgage would increase the first \n                mortgage payment;\n                    (B) the new mortgage would increase the loan \n                balance by more than 3 percent or $3,000, whichever is \n                greater;\n                    (C) the new mortgage is an adjustable rate mortgage \n                or has a term exceeding 30 years;\n                    (D) the borrower has violated the due-on-sale \n                clause at any time;\n                    (E) the subordination would put the junior lien at \n                risk of a bankruptcy strip down;\n                    (F) the lender seeking to originate the loan \n                through the Program has a lien on the original loan, or \n                services the loan for a party, that is already in a \n                junior position to the junior lien holder; or\n                    (G) the underlying trust documents for the junior \n                lien, as of March 1, 2012, explicitly prohibit the \n                servicer of the junior lien from impacting the security \n                interest of the notes through resubordination.\n            (2) FHFA authority.--At the discretion of the Director, the \n        FHFA may add to the list of exceptions in paragraph (1) \n        additional exceptions when the Director determines a refinance \n        would significantly increase the risk faced by the junior lien \n        holder, and in which a failure to resubordinate would be \n        justifiable.\n            (3) Actions by enterprises.--Upon submission to an \n        enterprise of documentation by a qualified lender or eligible \n        borrower that the holder of a junior lien has failed to \n        resubordinate its lien, thereby preventing the refinancing of \n        the eligible mortgage through the Program into a new mortgage, \n        the enterprise shall charge the junior lien holder and recoup \n        the fine described in paragraph (1), as applicable, and shall \n        apply the payment to the balance of the borrower's first \n        mortgage.\n            (4) Limitations on liabilities.--A junior lien holder shall \n        not be liable to the enterprise or to anyone else for the fine \n        described in paragraph (1) if, within 30 days of the \n        enterprise's written determination that a junior lien holder \n        has failed to resubordinate its lien for any reason other than \n        those specified in paragraph (1), that lien holder agrees to \n        resubordinate its lien in compliance with this section.\n    (g) Carryover of Mortgage Insurance.--\n            (1) In general.--If a mortgage insurer backing an eligible \n        mortgage fails to transfer coverage to a new mortgage \n        refinanced through the Program or places additional \n        underwriting criteria or fees beyond those required by the \n        Program as a condition of transfer approval, thereby preventing \n        the refinancing of the eligible mortgage through the Program, \n        that mortgage insurer shall be liable for an amount equal to \n        5.0 percent of the first mortgage balance, unless the new \n        mortgage--\n                    (A) would increase the first mortgage payment;\n                    (B) would increase the loan balance by more than 3 \n                percent or $3,000, whichever is greater;\n                    (C) is an adjustable rate mortgage or has a term \n                exceeding 30 years; or\n                    (D) the borrower has violated the due-on-sale \n                clause at any time.\n            (2) Actions by enterprises.--Upon submission to an \n        enterprise of documentation by a qualified lender or eligible \n        borrower that the mortgage insurer has prevented the refinance \n        of an eligible mortgage through the Program into a new \n        mortgage, the enterprise shall charge the mortgage insurer and \n        recoup the fine described in paragraph (1), as applicable, and \n        shall apply the payment to the balance of the borrower's first \n        mortgage.\n            (3) Limitation on liability.--A mortgage insurer shall not \n        be liable to the enterprise or to anyone else for the fine \n        described in paragraph (1) if, within 30 days of the \n        enterprise's written determination that a mortgage insurer has \n        prevented the refinancing of an eligible mortgage for any \n        reason other than those specified in paragraph (1), that \n        mortgage insurer agrees to transfer coverage in compliance with \n        this section.\n    (h) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nenterprises shall not be prevented from purchasing or guaranteeing a \nmortgage resulting from the refinancing of an eligible mortgage \npursuant to this section and subject to all other provisions of this \nsection.\n    (i) Guarantee Fees.--\n            (1) In general.--\n                    (A) Average fee.--On each mortgage refinanced under \n                the Program in accordance with this section, the \n                enterprises shall set the average fee required under \n                this Act, as determined by the Director in an amount \n                not less than the average fees imposed in 2012 for such \n                guarantees. The Director shall prohibit an enterprise \n                from offsetting the cost of the fee to the mortgage \n                originators, borrowers, and investors by decreasing \n                other charges, fees, or premiums, or in any other \n                manner.\n                    (B) Authority to limit offer of guarantee.--The \n                Director shall prohibit an enterprise from consummating \n                any offer for a guarantee to a lender for mortgage-\n                backed securities, if the guarantee is inconsistent \n                with the requirements of this section.\n            (2) Information collection and analysis.--The Director \n        shall require each enterprise to provide to the Director, as \n        part of its annual report submitted to Congress, for loans \n        refinanced under the Program--\n                    (A) a description of changes made to up-front fees \n                and annual fees as part of the guarantee fees \n                negotiated with lenders; and\n                    (B) an assessment of how the changes in the \n                guarantee fees described in subparagraph (A) met the \n                requirements of paragraph (1).\n    (j) Regulations.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Director shall issue any regulations or \nguidance necessary to carry out the changes to the Program established \nunder this section, which regulations or guidance shall be put into \neffect not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (k) Termination.--The requirements of this section shall expire \nconcurrent with the expiration of the Program.\n\nSEC. 4.
