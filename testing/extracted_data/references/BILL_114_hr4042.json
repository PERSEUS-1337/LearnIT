FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States ranks 25th in early learning \n        enrollment with fewer than 3 out of 10 four-year-olds enrolled \n        in high-quality prekindergarten programs.\n            (2) Studies show that children with access to high-quality \n        prekindergarten programs are less likely to repeat a grade or \n        drop out of high school, and more likely to succeed in their \n        careers.\n            (3) Every public dollar spent on high-quality \n        prekindergarten programs returns $7 through a reduced need for \n        spending on other services such as remedial education, grade \n        repetition, and special education.\n            (4) Children who attended prekindergarten are less likely \n        to develop drug problems, commit a felony, and go to prison, \n        and are half as likely to be arrested.\n            (5) Children who attended prekindergarten usually have \n        higher grade point averages and are more likely to attend a \n        four-year college.\n            (6) About 40 percent of school districts do not offer \n        prekindergarten programs.\n            (7) Over half of school districts that have pre-\n        kindergarten programs offer only part-day programs.\n            (8) Texas missed out on up to $118.48 million in Federal \n        funding to expand prekindergarten programs.\n            (9) Reports showed that in 2011 the Texas legislature cut \n        approximately $5.4 billion in education funding and eliminated \n        the $200 million in grants it offered to schools to expand \n        prekindergarten programs from half-day to full-day.\n            (10) In response to the State of Texas' education funding \n        cuts, certain local governments took it upon themselves to fund \n        full-day prekindergarten programs.\n            (11) For these reasons, certain localities, including local \n        governments and local educational agencies would benefit from \n        direct application prekindergarten Federal program funding.\n\nSEC. 3.
