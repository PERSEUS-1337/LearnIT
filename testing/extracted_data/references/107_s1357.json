    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Although title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n        (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) does not prohibit discrimination on \n        the basis of sexual orientation, one section of the Department \n        of Education's Office for Civil Rights' 1997 final policy \n        guidance, entitled ``Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of \n        Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third \n        Parties'' published in the Federal Register on March 13, 1997, \n        62 Fed. Reg. 12034, included a determination that ``sexual \n        harassment directed at gay or lesbian students that is \n        sufficiently serious to limit or deny a student's ability to \n        participate in or benefit from the school's program constitutes \n        sexual harassment prohibited by title IX under the \n        circumstances described in this guidance.''. This language was \n        unchanged in a 2001 update of the policy guidance entitled \n        ``Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by \n        School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties'' for which \n        a notice of availability was published in the Federal Register \n        on January 19, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 5512.\n            (2) That section of the 2001 ``Revised Sexual Harassment \n        Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other \n        Students, or Third Parties'' went on to state: ``Though beyond \n        the scope of this guidance, gender-based harassment, which may \n        include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, \n        intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, \n        but not involving conduct of a sexual nature, is also a form of \n        sex discrimination to which a school must respond, if it rises \n        to the level that denies or limits a student's ability to \n        participate in or benefit from the educational program....A \n        school must respond to such harassment in accordance with the \n        standards and procedures described in this guidance.''.\n            (3) There is evidence that brings into question the degree \n        to which the policy guidance on sexual harassment against gay, \n        lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students is being \n        implemented. For example, a 7-State study by Human Rights Watch \n        of the abuses suffered by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and \n        transgender students at the hands of their peers, published in \n        ``Hatred in the Hallways: Violence and Discrimination Against \n        Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Students in U.S. \n        Schools'' found that such students were often the victims of \n        abuses.\n            (4) A 2000 study by the American Association of University \n        Women focused on implementation of title IX of the Education \n        Amendments of 1972 more generally, and the findings of that \n        study, published in ``A License for Bias: Sex Discrimination, \n        Schools, and Title IX'', included a finding that many schools \n        and universities have not established procedures for handling \n        title IX-based grievances.\n            (5) The 2001 report of the Surgeon General, entitled \n        ``Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and \n        Responsible Sexual Behavior'' notes that ``antihomosexual \n        attitudes are associated with psychological distress for \n        homosexual persons and may have a negative impact on mental \n        health, including a greater incidence of depression and \n        suicide, lower self-acceptance and a greater likelihood of \n        hiding sexual orientation.''. It goes on to report: ``Averaged \n        over two dozen studies, 80 percent of gay men and lesbians had \n        experienced verbal or physical harassment on the basis of their \n        orientation, 45 percent had been threatened with violence, and \n        17 percent had experienced a physical attack.''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for an \nexamination of how secondary schools are implementing the policy \nguidance of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights \nrelated to sexual harassment directed against gay, lesbian, bisexual, \nand transgender students.\n\nSEC. 2.
