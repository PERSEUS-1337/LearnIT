FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Prior to the initiation of the war in Iraq, the \n        President cited concerns about weapons of mass destruction \n        programs as one justification for the use of military force in \n        Iraq. On October 6, 2004, the head of the Iraq Survey Group \n        (ISG), Charles Duelfer, announced to the Committee on Armed \n        Services of the Senate that the group found no evidence that \n        Iraq under Saddam Hussein had produced and stockpiled any \n        weapons of mass destruction since 1991.\n            (2) Prior to the initiation of the war in Iraq, the \n        President cited Saddam Hussein's role as a brutal dictator who \n        tortured and killed thousands of Iraqi civilians during his 20-\n        year rule as a justification for the use of military force in \n        Iraq. Saddam Hussein was captured by United States forces on \n        December 13, 2003, convicted of charges related to the \n        execution of 148 Iraqi civilians on November 5, 2006, and \n        executed on December 30, 2006.\n            (3) Prior to the initiation of the war in Iraq, the \n        President cited possible links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist \n        network and Saddam Hussein's government as a justification for \n        the use of military force in Iraq. Reports by the Central \n        Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the \n        Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense \n        have all concluded that there was little evidence of any such \n        links. While there is currently violence in Iraq directed \n        towards American troops, a September 2007 Congressional \n        Research Service report found that attacks by the group Al-\n        Qaeda in Iraq make up only a small percentage of the total \n        number of attacks on United States troops in Iraq.\n            (4) Prior to the initiation of the war in Iraq, the \n        President cited the importance of spreading democracy in the \n        Middle East as a justification for the use of military force in \n        Iraq. On October 15, 2005, the Iraqi people voted to ratify a \n        new constitution, on January 30, 2005, the Iraqi people elected \n        275 members of a newly created Iraqi National Assembly, and on \n        May 20, 2006, Nouri al-Maliki was approved as Prime Minister of \n        Iraq by the National Assembly and sworn in.\n            (5) The President has failed to secure international \n        support for the continuing efforts in Iraq. While the President \n        has executed a plan known as the ``troop surge'', every other \n        nation participating in the occupation of Iraq is reducing \n        troop levels. The United Kingdom has reduced its troop levels \n        from 45,000 to approximately 4,500. Twenty nations that had \n        once been members of the international coalition contributing \n        troops have completely withdrawn those troops from Iraq.\n            (6) The United States has accomplished all of the military \n        goals announced by the President at the outset of the war in \n        Iraq. The brave men and women of the Armed Forces have \n        performed admirably, showing both dedication to their mission \n        and professionalism in carrying that mission out.\n            (7) The Bush Administration has, at various times, \n        confirmed that the military goals of the war in Iraq were \n        complete. On May 1, 2003, the President stood in front of a \n        banner reading ``Mission Accomplished'' and declared an end to \n        major military operations in Iraq. On May 30, 2005, the Vice \n        President stated in a television interview that the insurgency \n        was in its ``last throes''.\n            (8) It is clear that the American people are looking for a \n        change in strategy in Iraq--one that will allow the Nation to \n        safely and responsibly bring members of the Armed Forces home \n        as quickly as possible. However, the strategy outlined by the \n        President in his September 13, 2007, address makes it clear \n        that the President has no plan for substantially reducing the \n        number of troops in Iraq while he is in office. It is \n        unconscionable for President Bush to leave this situation for \n        the next President to fix.\n\nSEC. 3. REPEAL OF PUBLIC LAW 107-243.\n\n    The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution \nof 2002 (Public Law 107-243) is hereby repealed.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) that, based upon the findings of section 1, the United \n        States has accomplished those military goals that were \n        established at the outset of the use of military force in Iraq, \n        and that it no longer benefits the national security of the \n        United States for members of the United States Armed Forces to \n        remain in Iraq;\n            (2) that the United States should begin withdrawing its \n        Armed Forces from Iraq in a safe, responsible, and orderly \n        manner, and that such withdrawal should begin no later than 30 \n        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and should be \n        accomplished by 12:00 p.m. on January 20, 2009;\n            (3) that the congressionally mandated report produced by \n        the Iraq Study Group contains a set of recommendations which, \n        if followed, would assist the United States in accomplishing a \n        troop withdrawal in the most responsible manner possible and \n        prepare the Iraqis to return to full self-government;\n            (4) that it is the moral duty of the United States to \n        continue assisting the Government of Iraq in rebuilding and \n        reconstruction efforts, as well as efforts to find a lasting \n        political solution to the ongoing sectarian conflict that has \n        occurred since the United States military invasion of Iraq, and \n        that doing so will require that the United States engage in \n        vigorous diplomatic efforts and the engagement of other \n        regional and global actors; and\n            (5) that the United States is further morally obligated to \n        provide humanitarian assistance for the millions of Iraqi \n        refugees that have been displaced since the beginning of the \n        war in Iraq, especially those Iraqi civilians who have become \n        targets for violence because they have worked with or assisted \n        the United States military or the Iraqi Government.\n\nSEC. 5. WITHDRAWAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM IRAQ.\n\n    (a) Not more than 30 days after the date of the enactment of the \nAct, the Secretary of Defense shall begin the withdrawal of members of \nthe Armed Forces from Iraq, and shall complete this withdrawal by 12:00 \np.m. January 20, 2009, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\n    (b) No funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the \nDepartment of Defense shall be expended to increase the number of \nmembers of the Armed Forces in Iraq beyond the number of such members \nin Iraq on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) No funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the \nDepartment of Defense shall be expended for the construction of \npermanent United States military installations in Iraq.\n    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Department \nof Defense may retain such members of the Armed Forces in Iraq as \nrequired for the following purposes:\n            (1) Protection of the United States Embassy, including \n        Embassy personnel.\n            (2) Limited counter-terrorism activities directed at the \n        Al-Qaeda terrorist network, provided that the members of the \n        Armed Forces carrying out such activities are not permanently \n        deployed in Iraq.\n            (3) Nonoffensive military operations designed solely to \n        address humanitarian concerns in Iraq, including assistance to \n        refugees.\n            (4) Assisting the Iraqi military in ensuring that Iraq's \n        borders are secure.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n    Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report outlining a \nstrategy to remove the United States Armed Forces from Iraq by 12:00 \np.m. on January 20, 2009."
