FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n        United States in 2005, caused over $200 billion in total \n        economic losses, including insured and uninsured losses.\n            (2) Although private sector insurance is currently \n        available to spread some catastrophe-related losses throughout \n        the Nation and internationally, most experts believe there will \n        be significant insurance and reinsurance shortages, resulting \n        in dramatic rate increases for consumers and businesses, and \n        the unavailability of catastrophe insurance.\n            (3) The Federal Government has provided and will continue \n        to provide billions of dollars and resources to pay for losses \n        from catastrophes, including hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, \n        tsunamis, tornados, and other disasters, at huge costs to \n        American taxpayers.\n            (4) The Federal Government has a critical interest in \n        ensuring appropriate and fiscally responsible risk management \n        of catastrophes. Mortgages require reliable property insurance, \n        and the unavailability of reliable property insurance would \n        make most real estate transactions impossible. In addition, the \n        public health, safety, and welfare demand that structures \n        damaged or destroyed in a catastrophe be reconstructed as soon \n        as possible. Therefore, the inability of the private sector \n        insurance and reinsurance markets to maintain sufficient \n        capacity to enable Americans to obtain property insurance \n        coverage in the private sector endangers the national economy \n        and the public health, safety, and welfare.\n            (5) Multiple proposals have been introduced in the United \n        States Congress over the past decade to address catastrophic \n        risk insurance, including the creation of a national \n        catastrophic reinsurance fund and the revision of the Federal \n        tax code to allow insurers to use tax-deferred catastrophe \n        funds, yet Congress has failed to act on any of these \n        proposals.\n            (6) To the extent the United States faces high risks from \n        catastrophe exposure, essential technical information on \n        financial structures and innovations in the catastrophe \n        insurance market is needed.\n            (7) The most efficient and effective approach to assessing \n        the catastrophe insurance problem in the public policy context \n        is to establish a bipartisan commission of experts to study the \n        management of catastrophic disaster risk, and to require such \n        commission to timely report its recommendations to Congress so \n        that Congress can quickly craft a solution to protect the \n        American people.\n\nSEC. 3.
