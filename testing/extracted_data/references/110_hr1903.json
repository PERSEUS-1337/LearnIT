SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Prostate \nCancer Treatment Equity Act of 2007''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Prostate cancer will strike about one in six men during \n        their lifetime.\n            (2) Many of these men will have a prostatectomy and about \n        half of those will experience significant complications.\n            (3) For some 6,000 of these men annually reconstructive \n        prosthetic urology surgery is their only option to address \n        these complications.\n            (4) Medicare covers reconstructive prosthetic urology \n        surgery, as does two-third of private health benefits coverage. \n        However, about one-third of private health benefits coverage \n        does not cover this surgery.\n            (5) To address a similar concern with respect to breast \n        cancer, Congress enacted the Women's Health and Cancer Rights \n        Act of 1998 that requires private health benefits coverage to \n        provide coverage for reconstructive surgery following \n        mastectomies.\n            (6) Men should have a right to access to reconstructive \n        surgery following a prostatectomy just as women have the right \n        to access to reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy.\n\nSEC. 2.
