A subpoena under this \nsection shall describe the records or items required to be produced and \nprescribe a return date within a reasonable period of time within which \nthe records or items can be assembled and made available. The \nattendance of witnesses and the production of records may be required \nfrom any place in any State or in any territory or other place subject \nto the jurisdiction of the United States at any designated place of \nhearing; except that a witness shall not be required to appear at any \nhearing more than 500 miles distant from the place where he was served \nwith a subpoena. Witnesses summoned under this section shall be paid \nthe same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of \nthe United States.\n    ``(b) Service.--A subpoena issued under this section may be served \nby any person designated in the subpoena as the agent of service. \nService upon a natural person may be made by personal delivery of the \nsubpoena to him or by certified mail with return receipt requested. \nService may be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a \npartnership or other unincorporated association that is subject to suit \nunder a common name, by delivering the subpoena to an officer, to a \nmanaging or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by \nappointment or by law to receive service of process. The affidavit of \nthe person serving the subpoena entered by him on a true copy thereof \nshall be sufficient proof of service.\n    ``(c) Enforcement.--In the case of the contumacy by, or refusal to \nobey a subpoena issued to, any person, the Attorney General may invoke \nthe aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of \nwhich the investigation is carried on or the subpoenaed person resides, \ncarries on business, or may be found, to compel compliance with the \nsubpoena. The court may issue an order requiring the subpoenaed person, \nin accordance with the subpoena, to appear, to produce records, or to \ngive testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to \nobey the order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt \nthereof. Any process under this subsection may be served in any \njudicial district in which the person may be found.\n    ``(d)(1) Nondisclosure requirement.--If the Attorney General \ncertifies that otherwise there may result a danger to the national \nsecurity, no person shall disclose to any other person that a subpoena \nwas received or records were provided pursuant to this section, other \nthan to (A) those persons to whom such disclosure is necessary in order \nto comply with the subpoena, (B) an attorney to obtain legal advice \nwith respect to testimony or the production of records in response to \nthe subpoena, or (C) other persons as permitted by the Attorney \nGeneral. The subpoena, or an officer, employee, or agency of the United \nStates in writing, shall notify the person to whom the subpoena is \ndirected of such nondisclosure requirement. Any person who receives a \ndisclosure under this subsection shall be subject to the same \nprohibition of disclosure.\n    ``(2) Enforcement of nondisclosure requirement.--Whoever knowingly \nviolates subsection (d)(1) of this section shall be imprisoned for not \nmore than one year, and if the violation is committed with the intent \nto obstruct an investigation or judicial proceeding, shall be \nimprisoned for not more than five years.\n    ``(3) Termination of nondisclosure requirement.--When the Attorney \nGeneral concludes that a nondisclosure requirement no longer is \njustified by a danger to the national security, an officer, employee, \nor agency of the United States shall notify the relevant person that \nthe prohibition of disclosure is no longer applicable.\n    ``(e) Judicial Review.--At any time before the return date \nspecified in the summons, the person or entity summoned may, in the \nUnited States district court for the district in which that person or \nentity does business or resides, petition for an order modifying or \nsetting aside the summons. Any such court may modify or set aside a \nnondisclosure requirement imposed under subsection (d) at the request \nof a person to whom a subpoena has been directed, unless there is \nreason to believe that the nondisclosure requirement is justified \nbecause otherwise there may result a danger to the national security. \nIn all proceedings under this subsection, the court shall review the \ngovernment's submission, which may include classified information, ex \nparte and in camera.\n    ``(f) Immunity From Civil Liability.--Any person, including \nofficers, agents, and employees, who in good faith produce the records \nor items requested in a subpoena shall not be liable in any court of \nany State or the United States to any customer or other person for such \nproduction or for nondisclosure of that production to the customer or \nother person.\n    ``(g) Guidelines.--The Attorney General shall issue guidelines to \nensure the effective implementation of this section.''.\n    (b) Amendment to Table of Sections.--The table of sections at the \nbeginning of chapter 113B of title 18, United States Code, is amended \nby inserting after the item relating to section 2332f the following new \nitem:\n\n``2332g.
