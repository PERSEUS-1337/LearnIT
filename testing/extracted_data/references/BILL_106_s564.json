CLASS SIZE REDUCTION.\n\n    Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 7301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                     ``PART E--CLASS SIZE REDUCTION\n\n``SEC. 6601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    ``This part may be cited as the `Class Size Reduction and Teacher \nQuality Act of 1999'.\n\n``SEC. 6602. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds as follows:\n            ``(1) Rigorous research has shown that students attending \n        small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational \n        progress than students in larger classes, and that these \n        achievement gains persist through at least the elementary \n        grades.\n            ``(2) The benefits of smaller classes are greatest for \n        lower achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. One \n        study found that urban fourth-graders in smaller-than-average \n        classes were \\3/4\\ of a school year ahead of their counterparts \n        in larger-than-average classes.\n            ``(3) Teachers in small classes can provide students with \n        more individualized attention, spend more time on instruction \n        and less on other tasks, cover more material effectively, and \n        are better able to work with parents to further their \n        children's education.\n            ``(4) Smaller classes allow teachers to identify and work \n        more effectively with students who have learning disabilities \n        and, potentially, can reduce those students' need for special \n        education services in the later grades.\n            ``(5) Students in smaller classes are able to become more \n        actively engaged in learning than their peers in large classes.\n            ``(6) Efforts to improve educational achievement by \n        reducing class sizes in the early grades are likely to be more \n        successful if--\n                    ``(A) well-prepared teachers are hired and \n                appropriately assigned to fill additional classroom \n                positions; and\n                    ``(B) teachers receive intensive, continuing \n                training in working effectively in smaller classroom \n                settings.\n            ``(7) Several States have begun a serious effort to reduce \n        class sizes in the early elementary grades, but these actions \n        may be impeded by financial limitations or difficulties in \n        hiring well-prepared teachers.\n            ``(8) The Federal Government can assist in this effort by \n        providing funding for class-size reductions in grades 1 through \n        3, and by helping to ensure that the new teachers brought into \n        the classroom are well prepared.\n\n``SEC. 6603. PURPOSE.\n\n    ``The purpose of this part is to help States and local educational \nagencies recruit, train, and hire 100,000 additional teachers over a 7-\nyear period in order to--\n            ``(1) reduce class sizes nationally, in grades 1 through 3, \n        to an average of 18 students per classroom; and\n            ``(2) improve teaching in the early grades so that all \n        students can learn to read independently and well by the end of \n        the third grade.\n\n``SEC. 6604. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    ``(a) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying \nout this part, there are authorized to be appropriated, $1,400,000,000 \nfor fiscal year 2000, $1,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, \n$1,700,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $1,735,000,000 for fiscal year \n2003, $2,300,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and $2,800,000,000 for \nfiscal year 2005.\n    ``(b) Allotments.--\n            ``(1) In general.--From the amount appropriated under \n        subsection (a) for a fiscal year the Secretary--\n                    ``(A) shall make a total of 1 percent available to \n                the Secretary of the Interior (on behalf of the Bureau \n                of Indian Affairs) and the outlying areas for \n                activities that meet the purpose of this part; and\n                    ``(B) shall allot to each State the same percentage \n                of the remaining funds as the percentage it received of \n                funds allocated to States for the previous fiscal year \n                under section 1122 or section 2202(b), whichever \n                percentage is greater, except that such allotments \n                shall be ratably decreased as necessary.\n            ``(2) Definition of state.--In this part the term ``State'' \n        means each of the several States of the United States, the \n        District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n            ``(3) State-level expenses.--Each State may use not more \n        than a total of \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the amount the State \n        receives under this part, or $50,000, whichever is greater, for \n        a fiscal year, for the administrative costs of the State \n        educational agency.\n    ``(c) Within State Distribution.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Each State that receives an allotment \n        under this section shall distribute the amount of the allotted \n        funds that remain after using funds in accordance with \n        subsection (b)(3) to local educational agencies in the State, \n        of which--\n                    ``(A) 80 percent of such remainder shall be \n                allocated to such local educational agencies in \n                proportion to the number of children, aged 5 to 17, who \n                reside in the school district served by such local \n                educational agency and are from families with incomes \n                below the poverty line (as defined by the Office of \n                Management and Budget and revised annually in \n                accordance with section 673(2) of the Community \n                Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)) applicable \n                to a family of the size involved) for the most recent \n                fiscal year for which satisfactory data is available \n                compared to the number of such individuals who reside \n                in the school districts served by all the local \n                educational agencies in the State for that fiscal year, \n                except that a State may adjust such data, or use \n                alternative child-poverty data, to carry out this \n                subparagraph if the State demonstrates to the \n                Secretary's satisfaction that such adjusted or \n                alternative data more accurately reflects the relative \n                incidence of children living in poverty within local \n                educational agencies in the State; and\n                    ``(B) 20 percent of such remainder shall be \n                allocated to such local educational agencies in \n                accordance with the relative enrollments of children, \n                aged 5 to 17, in public and private nonprofit \n                elementary schools and secondary schools in the school \n                districts within the boundaries of such agencies.\n            ``(2) Award rule.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the \n        award to a local educational agency under this section is less \n        than the starting salary for a new teacher in that agency, the \n        State shall not make the award unless--\n                    ``(A) the local educational agency agrees to form a \n                consortium with not less than 1 other local educational \n                agency for the purpose of reducing class size; or\n                    ``(B) the local educational agency agrees to \n                supplement the award with non-Federal funds sufficient \n                to pay the cost of hiring a teacher.\n\n``SEC. 6605.
