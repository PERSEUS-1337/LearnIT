FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) if a person or entity that is the subject of a civil \n        enforcement action under an environmental law has previously \n        violated an environmental law at the same site or facility or \n        for the same regulated activity, the person or entity--\n                    (A) was apparently not deterred by the previous \n                Federal or State enforcement action; and\n                    (B) should be subject to an additional penalty to \n                achieve the goal of deterrence; and\n            (2) because of the daily penalty maximums specified in \n        environmental law in effect on the date of enactment of this \n        Act, the penalty assessed for a violation that results in a \n        single catastrophic event may not be great enough to reflect \n        the serious actual or potential public health or environmental \n        consequences of the violation.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \nassessment of an increased civil penalty in a case in which--\n            (1) a person or entity that is the subject of a civil \n        environmental enforcement action has previously violated an \n        environmental law at the same site or facility or for the same \n        regulated activity; or\n            (2) a violation of an environmental law results in a \n        catastrophic event.\n\nSEC. 3.
