DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n    The Congress declares that the following is the policy of the \nUnited States:\n            (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n        based on trust, mutual respect, open communications, bilateral \n        and consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. \n        Dispute resolution procedures are fair, determinative, simple, \n        fast and inexpensive, and effectively and swiftly deal with \n        issues. Labor-management cooperation fully utilizes the \n        strengths of both parties to best serve the interests of the \n        public, operating as a team to carry out the public safety \n        mission in a quality work environment. In many public safety \n        agencies it is the union that provides the institutional \n        stability as elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n            (2) The health and safety of the Nation and the best \n        interest of public safety employers and employees can be best \n        protected by the settlement of issues through the processes of \n        collective bargaining.\n            (3) The Federal Government shall make available \n        governmental facilities for conciliation, mediation, and \n        voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage employers and the \n        representatives of their employees to reach and maintain \n        agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n        conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts to settle their \n        differences by mutual agreement reached through collective \n        bargaining or by such methods as may be provided for in any \n        applicable agreement for the settlement of disputes.\n            (4) Certain controversies which arise involving collective \n        bargaining agreements may be avoided or minimized through \n        mediations and conciliation.\n\nSEC. 3.
