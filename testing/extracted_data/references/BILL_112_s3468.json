REGULATORY ANALYSIS BY INDEPENDENT AGENCIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The President may by Executive order require an \nindependent regulatory agency to comply, to the extent permitted by \nlaw, with regulatory analysis requirements applicable to other \nagencies, including the requirements to--\n            (1) identify the problem that the agency intends to address \n        by a new rule (including, where applicable, the failures of \n        private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency \n        action) and assess the significance of that problem;\n            (2) examine whether any existing rule (or other law) has \n        created, or contributed to, the problem that a new rule is \n        intended to correct and whether the existing rule (or other \n        law) should be modified to achieve the intended goal of the new \n        rule more effectively;\n            (3) identify and assess available alternatives to direct \n        regulation, including providing economic incentives to \n        encourage the desired behavior, or providing information upon \n        which choices can be made by the public;\n            (4) consider, in setting regulatory priorities and to the \n        extent reasonable, the degree and nature of the risks posed by \n        various substances or activities within its jurisdiction;\n            (5) design its rules in the most cost-effective manner to \n        achieve the regulatory objective and, in doing so, consider \n        incentives for innovation, consistency, predictability, the \n        costs of enforcement and compliance (to the Federal Government, \n        regulated entities, and the public), flexibility, distributive \n        impacts, and equity;\n            (6) assess the costs and the benefits of the intended rule \n        and, recognizing some costs and benefits are difficult to \n        quantify, propose or adopt a rule only upon a reasoned \n        determination that the benefits of the rule justify its costs;\n            (7) base its rulemaking decisions on the best reasonably \n        obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other \n        information concerning the need for, and consequences of, the \n        intended rule;\n            (8) identify and assess alternative forms of regulation \n        and, to the extent feasible, specify performance objectives, \n        rather than specifying the behavior or manner of compliance \n        that regulated entities must adopt;\n            (9) seek the views of appropriate State, local, and tribal \n        officials before imposing regulatory requirements that might \n        significantly or uniquely affect State, local, or tribal \n        governmental entities, whenever feasible;\n            (10) avoid rules that are inconsistent or incompatible \n        with, or duplicative of, other rules of the independent \n        regulatory agency or other agencies;\n            (11) tailor rules to impose the least burden on society, \n        including individuals, businesses of differing sizes, and other \n        entities (including small communities and governmental \n        entities), consistent with achieving the regulatory objectives, \n        and taking into account, among other factors, and to the extent \n        practicable, the cost of cumulative rules;\n            (12) draft each rule to be simple and easy to understand, \n        with the goal of minimizing the potential for uncertainty and \n        litigation arising from uncertainty; and\n            (13) periodically review its existing significant rules to \n        determine whether any such rules should be modified, \n        streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency's \n        regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in \n        achieving the regulatory objectives.\n    (b) Economically Significant Rules.--For any proposed or final rule \nidentified by an independent regulatory agency as, or determined by the \nAdministrator to be, a significant rule described in subparagraph (A) \nor (B) of section 2(5), the President may by Executive order require \nthe independent regulatory agency to provide to the Administrator the \nfollowing information, to the extent permitted by law:\n            (1) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of \n        benefits anticipated from the rule together with, to the extent \n        feasible, a quantification of those benefits.\n            (2) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of \n        costs anticipated from the rule together with, to the extent \n        feasible, a quantification of those costs.\n            (3) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of \n        costs and benefits of potentially effective and reasonably \n        feasible alternatives to the rule, identified by the agencies \n        or the public, including improving existing regulations and \n        reasonable nonregulatory actions, and an explanation why the \n        planned regulatory action is preferable to the identified \n        potential alternatives.\n    (c) Review by Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.--\n            (1) Requirement to seek review.--The President may, by \n        Executive order, require an independent regulatory agency to \n        submit to the Administrator for review--\n                    (A) any proposed significant rule, prior to \n                publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking; and\n                    (B) any final significant rule, prior to \n                publication of the final rule.\n            (2) Nonbinding assessment.--An Executive order issued under \n        this Act may require that, not later than 90 days after the \n        independent regulatory agency submits a proposed or final \n        significant rule for review, the Administrator submit for \n        inclusion in the rulemaking record the Administrator's \n        assessment of the extent to which the agency has complied with \n        the regulatory analysis requirements made applicable by \n        Executive order.\n            (3) Determination and explanation by independent agency.--\n        An Executive order issued under this Act may require that, if \n        the Administrator concludes under paragraph (2) that the \n        independent regulatory agency did not comply with one or more \n        requirements of the Executive order with respect to a proposed \n        or final significant rule, the head of the agency that issued \n        the significant rule shall include with the proposed and final \n        significant rule--\n                    (A) a determination that the rule complies with the \n                requirements and an explanation of that determination;\n                    (B) if applicable, an explanation why the \n                independent regulatory agency did not comply with one \n                or more of the requirements, based on the statutory \n                provision authorizing the rule; and\n                    (C) a clear statement of the issues on which the \n                agency agrees or disagrees with the Administrator's \n                assessment of the rule.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATION ON JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n    (a) In General.--The compliance or noncompliance of an independent \nregulatory agency with the requirements of an Executive order issued \nunder this Act shall not be subject to judicial review.\n    (b) Agency Record.--When an action for judicial review of a rule \npromulgated by an independent regulatory agency is instituted, any \ndetermination, analysis, or explanation produced by the agency, and any \nassessment produced by the Administrator, pursuant to an Executive \norder issued under this Act, shall constitute part of the whole record \nof agency action in connection with the review.\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to bar judicial review of any other impact statement or \nsimilar analysis required by any other provision of law if judicial \nreview of such statement or analysis is otherwise permitted by law.\n\nSEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the authority of \nthe President with respect to independent regulatory agencies under any \nother applicable law."
