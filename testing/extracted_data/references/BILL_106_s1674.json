FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research related to school size indicates that \n        elementary and middle schools with 300-400 students, and \n        secondary schools with 400-800 students, are more effective \n        than schools with larger student populations.\n            (2) Smaller school size promotes learning and improves \n        students' grades and test scores, especially for ethnic \n        minority and low income students. Smaller school size has been \n        found to be the second most important factor, after high \n        socioeconomic status, in creating positive educational \n        outcomes.\n            (3) Students who attend smaller schools have more positive \n        personal and academic self-concepts. Students and staff at \n        smaller schools have a stronger sense of personal efficacy, and \n        the students take more of the responsibility for their own \n        learning, which includes more individualized and experimental \n        learning relevant to the world outside of school.\n            (4) Studies on school dropout rates show a decrease in the \n        rates as schools get smaller.\n            (5) Creating smaller schools and smaller learning \n        communities within larger schools promotes school safety. \n        Behavioral problems, including truancy, classroom disruption, \n        vandalism, aggressive behavior, theft, substance abuse, and \n        gang participation are greater in larger schools. Teachers in \n        smaller schools learn of disagreements between students and can \n        resolve problems before problems become severe.\n            (6) School size plays a very important role in shaping the \n        kinds of social relationships that form within schools. Smaller \n        schools and learning communities reduce the isolation that \n        causes violence. Smaller schools allow students to form closer \n        relationships with their teachers and create a sense of \n        ownership and belonging to their school. Young people who feel \n        more connected to their school are less likely to be involved \n        in violence. Smaller schools and learning communities are \n        especially effective in reducing the types of violence parents \n        fear most, particularly gang activity and serious violent \n        incidents.\n            (7) Students in smaller schools are less likely to have \n        problems with drugs or alcohol.\n            (8) Based on studies of secondary school violence, \n        researchers have concluded that the first step in ending school \n        violence must be to break through the impersonal atmosphere of \n        larger secondary schools by creating smaller communities of \n        learning within larger structures, where students and teachers \n        can come to know each other well.\n            (9) Research demonstrates that students attending smaller \n        schools are more likely to participate in extracurricular \n        activities. The students are also involved in a greater variety \n        of activities, while students in larger schools tend to be \n        polarized into a group that participates and a group that does \n        not participate in any extracurricular activities. Because \n        everyone in smaller schools is needed to populate teams, \n        offices, and clubs, even shy and less able students are \n        encouraged to participate and given a sense of belonging.\n            (10) Larger schools contribute to negative teacher \n        attitudes and low staff morale.\n            (11) Smaller schools can be established cost effectively. \n        Larger schools can be more expensive because the sheer size of \n        the larger schools requires more administrative support. More \n        importantly, additional bureaucracy translates into less \n        flexibility and innovation.\n\nSEC. 3.
