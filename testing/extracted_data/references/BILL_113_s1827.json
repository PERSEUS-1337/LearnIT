FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An American Fighter Ace is a fighter pilot who has \n        served honorably in a United States military service and who \n        has destroyed 5 or more confirmed enemy aircraft in aerial \n        combat during a war or conflict in which American armed forces \n        have participated.\n            (2) Beginning with World War I, and the first use of \n        airplanes in warfare, military services have maintained \n        official records of individual aerial victory credits during \n        every major conflict. Of more than 60,000 United States \n        military fighter pilots that have taken to the air, less than \n        1,500 have become Fighter Aces.\n            (3) Americans became Fighter Aces in the Spanish Civil War, \n        Sino-Japanese War, Russian Civil War, Arab-Israeli War, and \n        others. Additionally, American military groups' recruited \n        United States military pilots to form the American Volunteer \n        Group, Eagle Squadron, and others that produced American-born \n        Fighter Aces fighting against axis powers prior to Pearl \n        Harbor.\n            (4) The concept of a Fighter Ace is that they fought for \n        freedom and democracy across the globe, flying in the face of \n        the enemy to defend freedom throughout the history of aerial \n        combat. American-born citizens became Fighter Aces flying under \n        the flag of United States allied countries and became some of \n        the highest scoring Fighter Aces of their respective wars.\n            (5) American Fighter Aces hail from every State in the \n        Union, representing numerous ethnic, religious, and cultural \n        backgrounds.\n            (6) Fighter Aces possess unique skills that have made them \n        successful in aerial combat. These include courage, judgment, \n        keen marksmanship, concentration, drive, persistence, and \n        split-second thinking that makes an Ace a war fighter with \n        unique and valuable flight driven skills.\n            (7) The Aces' training, bravery, skills, sacrifice, \n        attention to duty, and innovative spirit illustrate the most \n        celebrated traits of the United States military, including \n        service to country and the protection of freedom and democracy.\n            (8) American Fighter Aces have led distinguished careers in \n        the military, education, private enterprise, and politics. Many \n        have held the rank of General or Admiral and played leadership \n        roles in multiple war efforts from WWI to Vietnam through many \n        decades. In some cases they became the highest ranking officers \n        for following wars.\n            (9) The extraordinary heroism of the American Fighter Ace \n        boosted American morale at home and encouraged many men and \n        women to enlist to fight for America and democracy across the \n        globe.\n            (10) Fighter Aces were among America's most-prized military \n        fighters during wars. When they rotated back to the United \n        States after combat tours, they trained cadets in fighter pilot \n        tactics that they had learned over enemy skies. The teaching of \n        combat dogfighting to young aviators strengthened our fighter \n        pilots to become more successful in the skies. The net effect \n        of this was to shorten wars and save the lives of young \n        Americans.\n            (11) Following military service, many Fighter Aces became \n        test pilots due to their superior flying skills and quick \n        thinking abilities.\n            (12) The American Fighter Aces are one of the most \n        decorated military groups in American history. Twenty-two \n        Fighter Aces have achieved the rank of Admiral in the Navy. \n        Seventy-nine Fighter Aces have achieved the rank of General in \n        the Army, Marines, and Air Force. Nineteen Medals of Honor have \n        been awarded to individual Fighter Aces.\n\nSEC. 3.
