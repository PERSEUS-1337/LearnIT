    "content": "No legislation has yet been introduced in the 111 th Congress that would amend the timing of the reporting requirements in the IRC or FECA. In the 110 th Congress, H.R. 1204 (527 Transparency Act of 2007) would have no longer allowed Section 527 political organizations to file the periodic contribution and expenditure reports with the IRS on a non-monthly basis. Instead, all political organizations that report to the IRS would have been required to file monthly reports, in addition to pre-election, post-general election, and year-end reports. An organization that failed to file in a timely fashion would have faced a penalty equal to 30% of the expenditures and contributions that were not adequately reported, with the organization's managers jointly and severally liable for the penalty. Additionally, contributions to that organization would have been subject to the gift tax. The organizations would have been required to notify their contributors about the failure within 90 days of the IRS's final determination that the failure had occurred. Finally, the bill would have required that the reports be simultaneously filed with the FEC."
