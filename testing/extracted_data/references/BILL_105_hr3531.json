FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Women with infants and toddlers are the fastest growing \n        segment of today's labor force.\n            (2) At least 50 percent of women who are employed when they \n        become pregnant return to the labor force by the time their \n        children are 3 months old.\n            (3) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends \n        breastfeeding for at least the first 12 months of a child's \n        life. The Academy also recommends that arrangements be made to \n        provide expressed breastmilk if mother and child must separate.\n            (4) Breastmilk contains all the nutrients a child needs for \n        ideal growth and development (including helpful antibodies, \n        proteins, immune cells, and growth factors that can only be \n        found in breastmilk), promotes closeness between mother and \n        child, and is easy to digest.\n            (5) Breastmilk is the first line of immunization defense \n        and enhances the effectiveness of vaccines given to infants.\n            (6) Research studies show that children who are not \n        breastfed have higher rates of mortality, meningitis, some \n        types of cancers, asthma and other respiratory illnesses, \n        bacterial and viral infections, diarrhoeal diseases, ear \n        infections, allergies, and obesity.\n            (7) Research studies have also shown that breastmilk and \n        breastfeeding have protective effects against the development \n        of a number of chronic diseases, including juvenile diabetes, \n        lymphomas, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, some chronic liver \n        diseases, and ulcerative colitis.\n            (8) A number of recent studies have shown that breastfed \n        children have higher IQs at all ages.\n            (9) Breastfeeding promotion and support are an integral \n        part of nutrition services provided by the Women, Infants, and \n        Children (WIC) program, and has been shown to reduce costs. For \n        example, in a recent cost-benefit study in the State of \n        Colorado, it was found that exclusively breastfeeding a WIC \n        infant saved $161 in the first 6 months of life when compared \n        to formula-fed infants. A Medicaid savings of $112 per infant \n        was realized by this group while pharmacy costs were \n        approximately 50 percent lower.\n            (10) In 1997 the United States had one of the lowest \n        breastfeeding rates of all industrialized nations and one of \n        the highest rates of infant mortality.\n            (11) Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the mother's \n        risk of breast and ovarian cancer, hip fractures, and \n        osteoporosis.\n            (12) Breastfeeding releases a hormone in a woman's body \n        that causes her uterus to return to its normal size and shape \n        more quickly, and reduces blood loss after delivery.\n            (13) Although title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n        U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) was amended by the Pregnancy \n        Discrimination Act in 1978 to prohibit discrimination on the \n        basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition, \n        courts have not interpreted this amendment to include \n        breastfeeding despite the intent of the Congress to include it.\n            (14) Women who wish to continue breastfeeding after \n        returning to work have relatively few needs: availability of \n        suitable, dependable, efficient breast pumps; a clean, \n        convenient, safe, private, and comfortable location to express \n        milk at the worksite; the opportunity to pump their breasts \n        frequently enough to maintain their milk supply; and an \n        adequate place to temporarily store expressed milk.\n            (15) Many employers have seen positive results from \n        facilitating lactation programs in the workplace, including low \n        absenteeism, high productivity, high company loyalty, high \nemployee morale, and lower health care costs.\n            (16) Parental absenteeism due to infant illness is 3 times \n        less among the parents of breastfed children than those that \n        are formula fed.\n            (17) Worksite programs that aim to improve infant health \n        may also bring about a reduction in parental absenteeism and \n        health insurance costs.\n            (18) Many women do not have available to them adequate \n        facilities for expressing milk at their workplace, and are \n        forced to pump in restrooms lacking privacy, comfort, and \n        cleanliness. Many employees do not have access to refrigeration \n        or other adequate storage facilities for expressed milk.\n            (19) Many employers deny women the opportunity to \n        breastfeed or express milk. Some women have been discharged for \n        requesting to breastfeed or express milk during lunch and other \n        regular breaks. Some women have been harassed or discriminated \n        against. Some women have had their pay withheld or been taken \n        off of shift work for indicating their intention to express \n        milk during the workday.\n            (20) There are numerous products on the market to assist a \n        woman in expressing milk, but not all such products are \n        effective or efficient. There have been many reports from \n        physicians and lactation consultants about breastfeeding \n        failure due to the use of ineffective breast pumps.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964.\n\n    Section 701(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e(k)) \nis amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``breastfeeding,'' after ``childbirth'', \n        and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following: ``For purposes of \n        this subsection, the term `breastfeeding' means the feeding of \n        a child directly from the breast or the expression of milk from \n        the breast by a lactating woman.''.\n\nSEC. 4. ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR EMPLOYER EXPENSES FOR PROVIDING \n              APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENT ON BUSINESS PREMISES FOR EMPLOYED \n              MOTHERS TO BREASTFEED OR EXPRESS MILK FOR THEIR CHILDREN.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to business related \ncredits) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 45D.
