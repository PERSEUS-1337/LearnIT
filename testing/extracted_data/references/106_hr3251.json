FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) American youth, up to 18 years of age, represent the \n        freest, most educated, most affluent generation this Nation has \n        known. A majority will graduate from high school, will come \n        from families in which the parents or guardians are employed \n        and own property, and will come from a society which has \n        achieved unparalleled national economic and social opportunity \n        in a world largely at peace.\n            (2) The potential for this generation of American youth to \n        make lasting contributions to freedom's cause is unparalleled. \n        Yet, despite this favorable domestic and international climate, \n        some serious flaws have appeared in America's social and \n        cultural fabric, characterized by destructive behaviors among \n        some of our youth that are damaging our Nation and the ability \n        of this generation to achieve its full potential.\n            (3) While most of America's youth are achieving \n        academically and developing wholesome constructive pursuits, \n        youth violence in places like Littleton, Colorado, Springfield, \n        Oregon, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the rash of copycat \n        incidents, threatened or real, across the Nation has brought to \n        the fore a troubling lack of respect by some for other \n        individuals that lies at the heart of a free society.\n            (4) Across our Nation, school ``pranks'' have in many cases \n        been destructive to schools and property and reveal a serious \n        lack of understanding by the perpetrators of the true costs of \n        their actions.\n            (5) Equally serious are the consistently high and \n        personally destructive levels of alcohol and drug use by \n        American youth, sometimes coupled with gun violence, as well as \n        increasing levels of teenage suicide and eating disorders, such \n        as bulimia and anorexia.\n            (6) Upholding human dignity faces challenges in the media \n        as well. By the time children in the United States have passed \n        through the eighth grade, they will have witnessed an average \n        of 8,000 murders and over 100,000 other acts of violence \n        through the media. In addition, many video games, music, films, \n        and Internet websites present material so degrading to human \n        dignity that they undermine the value of human life and elevate \n        the bizarre to normal. Some have characterized this as a \n        ``culture of death'' that permeates the consciousness of \n        American youth.\n            (7) The structure of family, neighborhoods, work, and \n        community in the United States has been transformed in the last \n        30 years as economic growth and mobility have impacted \n        families' aspirations and livelihoods. The static purchasing \n        power of families, mergers, and dislocation of production, \n        higher family mobility and suburbanization, rising levels of \n        foster children, all have contributed to a more fluid social \n        structure and less continuity for youth in permanent nurturing \n        relationships with family and community. The social \n        consequences of these changes, along with the pervasive \n        influence of media, demand attention, for developmental \n        attachments by adults toward youth that characterized previous \n        generations have become more tenuous in today's society.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``National \nCommission on the Impact of United States Culture on America's Youth'' \n(hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
