FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) arson is a serious and costly problem, and is \n        responsible for approximately 25 percent of all fires in the \n        United States;\n            (2) arson is a leading cause of fire deaths, accounting for \n        approximately 700 deaths annually in the United States, and is \n        the leading cause of property damage due to fire in the United \n        States;\n            (3) estimates of arson property losses are in the range of \n        $2,000,000,000 annually, or approximately 1 of every 4 dollars \n        lost to fire;\n            (4) the incidence of arson in the United States is \n        seriously underreported, in part because of the lack of \n        adequate participation by local jurisdictions in the National \n        Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) and the Uniform Crime \n        Reporting (UCR) program;\n            (5) there is a need for expanded training programs for \n        arson investigators;\n            (6) there is a need for improved programs designed to \n        enable volunteer firefighters to detect arson crimes and to \n        preserve evidence vital to the investigation and prosecution of \n        arson cases;\n            (7) according to the National Fire Protection Association, \n        of all the suspicious and incendiary fires estimated to occur, \n        only \\1/3\\ are confirmed as arson; and\n            (8) improved training of arson investigators will increase \n        the ability of fire departments to identify suspicious and \n        incendiary fires, and will result in increased and more \n        effective prosecution of arson offenses.\n\nSEC. 3.
