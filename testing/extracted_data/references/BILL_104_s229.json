RISK ASSESSMENT AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in \npromulgating any proposed or final major regulation relating to human \nhealth or the environment, the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency shall publish in the Federal Register along with the \nregulation a clear and concise statement that--\n            (1) describes and, to the extent practicable, quantifies \n        the risks to human health or the environment to be addressed by \n        the regulation (including, where applicable and practicable, \n        the human health risks to significant subpopulations who are \n        disproportionately exposed or particularly sensitive);\n            (2) compares the human health or environmental risks to be \n        addressed by the regulation to other risks chosen by the \n        Administrator, including--\n                    (A) at least three other risks regulated by the \n                Environmental Protection Agency or another Federal \n                agency; and\n                    (B) at least three other risks that are not \n                directly regulated by the Federal Government;\n            (3) estimates--\n                    (A) the costs to the United States Government, \n                State and local governments, and the private sector of \n                implementing and complying with the regulation; and\n                    (B) the benefits of the regulation;\n        including both quantifiable measures of costs and benefits, to \n        the fullest extent that they can be estimated, and qualitative \n        measures that are difficult to quantify; and\n            (4) contains a certification by the Administrator that--\n                    (A) the analyses performed under paragraphs (1) \n                through (3) are based on the best reasonably obtainable \n                scientific information;\n                    (B) the regulation is likely to significantly \n                reduce the human health or environmental risks to be \n                addressed;\n                    (C) there is no regulatory alternative that is \n                allowed by the statute under which the regulation is \n                promulgated and that would achieve an equivalent \n                reduction in risk in a more cost-effective manner, \n                along with a brief explanation of why other such \n                regulatory alternatives that were considered by the \n                Administrator were found to be less cost-effective; and\n                    (D) the regulation is likely to produce benefits to \n                human health or the environment that will justify the \n                costs to the United States Government, State and local \n                governments, and the private sector of implementing and \n                complying with the regulation.\n    (b) Substantially Similar Final Regulations.--If the Administrator \ndetermines that a final major regulation is substantially similar to \nthe proposed version of the regulation with respect to each of the \nmatters referred to in subsection (a), the Administrator may publish in \nthe Federal Register a reference to the statement published under \nsubsection (a) for the proposed regulation in lieu of publishing a new \nstatement for the final regulation.\n    (c) Reporting.--If the Administrator cannot certify with respect to \none or more of the matters addressed in subsection (a)(4), the \nAdministrator shall identify those matters for which certification \ncannot be made, and shall include a statement of the reasons therefor \nin the Federal Register along with the regulation. Not later than March \n1 of each year, the Administrator shall submit a report to Congress \nidentifying those major regulations promulgated during the previous \ncalendar year for which complete certification was not made, and \nsummarizing the reasons therefor.\n    (d) Other Requirements.--Nothing in this section affects any other \nprovision of Federal law, or changes the factors that the Administrator \nis authorized to consider in promulgating a regulation pursuant to any \nstatute, or shall delay any action required to meet a deadline imposed \nby statute or a court.\n    (e) Judicial Review.--Nothing in this section creates any right to \njudicial or administrative review, nor creates any right or benefit, \nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party \nagainst the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its \nofficers or employees, or any other person. If a major regulation is \nsubject to judicial or administrative review under any other provision \nof law, the adequacy of the certification prepared pursuant to this \nsection, and any alleged failure to comply with this section, may not \nbe used as grounds for affecting or invalidating such major regulation, \nalthough the statements and information prepared pursuant to this \nsection, including statements contained in the certification, may be \nconsidered as part of the record for judicial or administrative review \nconducted under such other provision of law.\n    (f) Definition of Major Regulation.--For purposes of this section, \n``major regulation'' means a regulation that the Administrator \ndetermines may have an effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more in \nany one year.\n    (g) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect 180 days after \nthe date of enactment of this Act."
