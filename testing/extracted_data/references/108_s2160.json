    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Listbroker Privacy Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Commercial list brokers routinely advertise and sell \n        detailed information on children, including names, addresses, \n        ages, and other data, for use in marketing. This data is \n        commonly available on children as young as two years old, \n        enabling marketers to target specific demographics such as \n        junior high school, elementary school, or even preschool.\n            (2) Commercially available marketing databases can be very \n        large, covering millions of children.\n            (3) Commercially available marketing databases can include \n        a variety of information on the children they cover, from \n        ethnicity to family income to hobbies and interests.\n            (4) Money spent on marketing to children has been estimated \n        at $12 billion per year.\n            (5) Several Federal statutes, including section 1061 of the \n        No Child Left Behind Act, the Children's Online Privacy \n        Protection Act, and the Family and Educational Rights and \n        Privacy Act, restrict the collection and disclosure of \n        information about children or students under specified \n        circumstances. When data on children is collected in a manner \n        that is outside the scope of those statutes, however, Federal \n        law does not significantly restrict the commercial sale or \n        resale of such data.\n            (6) The ability to sell information about children to \n        marketers for a profit creates an economic incentive to find \n        new and creative ways to collect and compile such information, \n        and possibly to circumvent or subvert the intent of those \n        federal statutes that do govern the collection of information \n        about children or students. There are a variety of means and \n        sources that marketers and list brokers can and do use to \n        compile names, addresses, and other data about children.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON SALE OR PURCHASE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL \n              INFORMATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is unlawful--\n            (1) to sell personal information about an individual the \n        seller knows to be a child;\n            (2) to purchase personal information about an individual \n        identified by the seller as a child, for the purpose of \n        marketing to that child; or\n            (3) for a person who has provided a certification pursuant \n        to subsection (b)(2), in connection with the purchase of \n        personal information about an individual identified by the \n        seller as a child, to engage in any practice that violates the \n        terms of the certification.\n    (b)  Exceptions.--\n            (1) Parental consent.--Subsection (a) does not apply to any \n        sale, purchase, or use of personal information about a child if \n        the parent of the child has granted express consent to that \n        sale, purchase, or use of the information.\n            (2) Certification.--Subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to \n        the sale of personal information about a child if the purchaser \n        certifies to the seller, electronically or in writing, before \n        the sale is completed--\n                    (A) the purpose for which the information will be \n                used by the purchaser; and\n                    (B) that the purchaser will neither--\n                            (i) use the information for marketing that \n                        child; nor\n                            (ii) permit the information to be used by \n                        others for the purpose of marketing to that \n                        child.\n\nSEC. 4.
