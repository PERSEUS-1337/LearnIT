FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Iraq has 112 billion barrels of proven oil reserves \n        along with roughly 220 billion barrels of probable resources. \n        Only Saudi Arabia's oil reserves are larger. By far, the \n        majority of petroleum reserves (67%) are found in the Middle \n        East.\n            (2) The United States has 21 billion barrels of proven oil \n        reserves, twelfth highest in the world. United States proven \n        oil reserves have declined by almost 20% since 1990.\n            (3) The United States consumes 25% of the world's oil \n        supply, the largest share; yet it holds only 2.2 percent of the \n        world's proven oil reserves.\n            (4) Numerous foreign oil companies have preliminary \n        contracts to spend billions of dollars developing Iraqi oil \n        fields. These companies originate from Algeria, Australia, \n        Britain, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, \n        Malaysia, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and Vietnam.\n            (5) According to several news accounts, the Administration \n        is conferring with energy experts, industry executives, and \n        Iraqi opposition leaders on how to revive and expand Iraq's oil \n        fields after an invasion.\n            (6) United States Special Forces have been on the ground \n        inside Iraq since September of 2002 to monitor the oil fields \n        and rigs.\n            (7) During the first war in Iraq, oil prices rose to $41 \n        per barrel, gasoline prices hit record levels, and oil \n        companies made record profits.\n            (8) According to Goldman Sachs, crude oil prices could \n        reach $45 per barrel as a result of a war in Iraq. The price of \n        oil has already increased $12 per barrel in the last year to \n        $33 per barrel.\n\nSEC. 3.
