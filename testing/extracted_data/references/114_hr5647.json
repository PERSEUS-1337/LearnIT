    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority \n        (``WMATA'') provides approximately 2.3 million Metrorail and \n        Metrobus trips per year across the National Capital Region to \n        Federal employees, commuters, and millions of visitors to the \n        Nation's capital.\n            (2) Approximately 40 percent of WMATA peak-hour commuters \n        are Federal employees.\n            (3) WMATA began building its rail system in 1969 and \n        currently serves 91 stations and has 117 miles of track.\n            (4) The Federal Transit Administration (``FTA'') and the \n        National Transportation Safety Board (``NTSB'') have found \n        significant safety concerns resulting from a backlog of \n        deferred maintenance.\n            (5) By closing the system earlier on weekends and expanding \n        weekday maintenance, SafeTrack will address FTA and NTSB safety \n        recommendations and deferred maintenance backlogs.\n            (6) The plan includes 15 ``Safety Surges'' with around-the-\n        clock single tracking or segment shutdowns that will impact \n        rush hour commutes.\n            (7) SafeTrack is scheduled to conclude in March 2017.\n            (8) During the course of SafeTrack, WMATA is encouraging \n        customers to utilize other commuting options, including ride-\n        sharing services.\n            (9) The Federal Government, which is negatively affected \n        when its employees cannot easily commute to and from work, has \n        an interest in assisting employees with alternate commuting \n        options during the course of SafeTrack.\n\nSEC. 2.
