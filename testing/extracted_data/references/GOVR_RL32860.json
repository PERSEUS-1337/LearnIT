    "content": "This report summarizes action on more than 240 energy efficiency and renewable energy billsintroduced during the 109th Congress. (1) These bills cover a wide range of policy and issue areas thatinclude appropriations, authorizations, research and development (R&D), grants, loans, financing,regulation (including a renewable portfolio standard), tax credits, funding, goals, plans, impacts, andthe environment/climate change. So far, most of these bills have focused on tax credits andincentives. The bills also cover a range of sectors that include buildings, defense, education, federallands/energy management, farms, American Indians, and international activities. Thus far, the sectorof federal lands/energy management has generated the greatest number of bills. Table 2 groups thebills by topic. The bills are also categorized by type of renewable resource, type of energy efficiencymeasure, and technology. There is a broad range of efficiency measures and technologies, includingcogeneration (combined heat and power), distributed generation, net metering, equipment andappliance standards, fuel economy standards, and transportation efficiency. The bills are fairlyevenly distributed among these areas. There is also a broad range of renewable energy resources andtechnologies, including alcohol fuels, biofuels, biodiesel, biopower, biomass, geothermal, hydrogen,hydropower, solar, and wind. So far, the areas of fuels and wind energy have generated the greatestnumber of bills. For each bill listed in this report, a brief description and a summary of action are given,including references to committee hearings and reports. Also, a selected list of hearings on energyefficiency and renewable energy is included. Action Before the Conference Report on H.R.6. In the first session, action focused on omnibus energy policy bill H.R. 6 (Energy Policy Act of 2005, P.L. 109-58 ). The House version of H.R.6 incorporated H.R. 1541 (tax provisions), H.R. 1640 (non-taxprovisions), and the Resources Committee print \"Domestic Energy Security Act\" (non-taxprovisions). The Senate version of H.R. 6 incorporated the text of S. 10 anda tax title added as an amendment on the Senate floor. The Senate-passed version of H.R.6 included a 10% renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS), a proposal to save 1 millionbarrels of oil per day through various conservation measures, and a proposal to extend the renewableenergy production tax credit (PTC) for three years instead of two. (2)  The enacted version of H.R. 6 ( H.Rept. 109-190 ) contains provisions thatauthorize or reauthorize several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. It also establishesseveral new commercial and consumer product efficiency standards, sets new goals for energyefficiency and renewable energy in federal facilities and fleets, broadens the Energy Star productsprogram, expands programs for hydrogen fuel cell buses, extends daylight savings time, and sets arenewable fuels standard for increased use of ethanol and biodiesel. Further, it extends the PTC fortwo years, but it does not include an RPS, does not include the Senate provision to conserve oil, anddoes not include the broader range of legislated efficiency standards proposed by the Senate. Other action in the first session focused on the Transportation Equity Act ( H.R. 3 ). The enacted version of H.R. 3 ( H.Rept. 109-203 ) has some provisions on clean(renewable) fuels, energy conservation, and advanced vehicle technologies. Specific provisionsinclude sections 1113, volumetric excise tax credit for alternative fuels; 1121, high occupancyvehicle (HOV) facilities; 1307, magnetic levitation transportation; 1807, nonmotorizedtransportation pilot program; 1808, additions to congestion mitigation and air quality (CMAQ);1952, congestion relief; 1954, bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways; 3005, metropolitantransportation planning; 3010, clean fuels grant program; 3016, national research and technologyprograms; 3044, clean fuels grants; 3045, national fuel cell bus technology development program;4149, office of intermodalism; 5301, intelligent transportation systems; 5502, congestion reliefresearch initiative; 6001, transportation planning; 6015, clean school buses; and 9002, study of highspeed rail.  Action on H.R. 6 , H.R. 3 , and appropriation bills is summarizedin Table 1 . Action After the Conference Report on H.R.6. After action on H.R. 6 was completed, continued highprices for oil and natural gas, combined with the huge impacts of hurricanes Katrina and Rita onmajor oil and natural gas infrastructure in the Gulf Coast region, prompted the introduction of about40 additional bills that contained provisions involving energy efficiency or renewable energy. Thegreatest number of these bills related to transportation fuel savings, alternative/renewable fuels, andinvestment tax incentives. A smaller number of bills involved provisions for R&D, buildings,federal lands/energy management, equipment, and fuel economy. The Conference Report on H.R. 6 was issued on July 27, 2005. Bills introducedafter the conference report are shown in Table 2 in italics. In February 2006, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-171 , S. 1932 )was enacted. Section 1301 amends section 9006(f) of the Farm Security Act of 2002 to set a limitof $3 million in FY2007 funding for the USDA Commodity Credit Corporation to carry outrenewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Section 1402 terminates FY2007 fundingauthorization for the USDA Value-Added Producer Program (created by section 6401 of the FarmSecurity Act of 2002) to provide grants to renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. In March 2006, the Senate passed (51-49) its version of the FY2007 Budget Resolution witha modified version of S.Amdt. 3136 . The amendment allows deficit-neutral changesin budget allocations to increase support for alternative fuels and vehicles, promote renewableenergy, and reward energy conservation and efficiency. The House version ( H.Con.Res. 376 ) was passed on May 18. In April 2006, stimulated by rising gasoline prices, dozens of new energy efficiency andrenewable energy bills were introduced. Perhaps the greatest number of these bills proposedextensions and expansions of tax incentives and the renewable fuels standard for ethanol, biodiesel,and other alternative fuels. Further, a sizable number of bills addressed federal fleet fuel use, grantsto support alternative fuel pumping equipment at gasoline stations, and the import tariff on ethanol. Also, a fair number of bills proposed to extend and/or expand tax incentives for solar equipment, fuelcells, and building energy efficiency measures. In May 2006, the House passed three appropriations bills (interior/environment, agriculture,energy & water) with funding for energy efficiency and/or renewable energy, as shown in Table 1 . In June 2006, about 25 bills were introduced with provisions for energy efficiency and/orrenewable energy. Included in this action, the House passed three additional appropriations bills(foreign operations, transportation, defense) with funding for energy efficiency and/or renewableenergy, as noted in Table 1 . Additionally, the House Energy and Commerce Committee held ahearing on a draft bill focused on boutique fuels. Other new bills were focused on alternative fuels,federal agencies, R&D, and grants. In July 2006, about 30 bills were introduced with provisions for energy efficiency and/orrenewable energy. From late June throughout July, the Senate Appropriations Committee reportedseveral appropriations bills (defense, transportation, foreign operations, energy & water,interior/environment, legislative branch, and agriculture) with provisions for energy efficiency andrenewable energy. Among other bills, the most active areas were tax incentives for alternative fuels,buildings, and solar energy. There were also several bills on public transit, federal agencies, loanprograms, the renewable energy portfolio standard, and fuel economy.   Table 1.
