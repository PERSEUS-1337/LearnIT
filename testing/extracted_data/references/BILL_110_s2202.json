RENEWABLE CONTENT OF GASOLINE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the renewable fuel standard established under section \n        211(o) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)) is one of the \n        most significant steps taken by Congress to increase domestic \n        biofuels production and decrease the dangerous dependence of \n        the United States on foreign oil;\n            (2) in the 12 years after 1992, domestic ethanol production \n        increased by 2,000,000,000 gallons;\n            (3) in only 2 years following the establishment of the \n        renewable fuel standard, ethanol production has increased by \n        5,000,000,000 gallons;\n            (4) the renewable fuel standard has spurred investment and \n        resulted in ethanol production that surpassed Federal targets 5 \n        years ahead of schedule;\n            (5) the failure of the petroleum industry to install pumps \n        so that ethanol is available to motorists and the failure of \n        the automotive industry to manufacture ethanol-capable \n        vehicles, as compared to rising ethanol production volumes, has \n        prevented fuel ethanol from reaching consumers;\n            (6) the resulting excess of ethanol in the marketplace has \n        depressed ethanol prices and jeopardized the financial \n        stability of the domestic renewable fuel infrastructure, \n        particularly smaller, local, and farmer-owned ethanol plants;\n            (7) jeopardizing the existing ethanol infrastructure will \n        put at risk 20 years of progress on a national biofuel industry \n        and destroy the bridge to next-generation biofuel made from \n        cellulosic feedstocks; and\n            (8) it is imperative for Congress to increase the renewable \n        fuel standard now to ensure the path towards cellulosic fuel \n        production is not jeopardized in the short term.\n    (b) Definitions.--Section 211(o)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(1)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) as \n        subparagraphs (F), (D), and (E), respectively, and moving those \n        subparagraphs so as to appear in alphabetical order;\n            (2) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the \n        following:\n                    ``(A) Advanced biofuel.--\n                            ``(i) In general.--The term `advanced \n                        biofuel' means fuel derived from renewable \n                        biomass other than ethanol derived from corn \n                        starch.\n                            ``(ii) Inclusions.--The term `advanced \n                        biofuel' includes--\n                                    ``(I) ethanol derived from \n                                cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin;\n                                    ``(II) ethanol derived from sugar \n                                or starch, other than ethanol derived \n                                from corn starch;\n                                    ``(III) ethanol derived from waste \n                                material, including crop residue, other \n                                vegetative waste material, animal \n                                waste, and food waste and yard waste;\n                                    ``(IV) diesel-equivalent fuel \n                                derived from renewable biomass, \n                                including vegetable oil and animal fat;\n                                    ``(V) biogas (including landfill \n                                gas and sewage waste treatment gas) \n                                produced through the conversion of \n                                organic matter from renewable biomass;\n                                    ``(VI) butanol or other alcohols \n                                produced through the conversion of \n                                organic matter from renewable biomass;
