FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the management of solid waste can pose a wide range of \n        hazards to public health and safety and to the environment;\n            (2) packaging comprises a significant percentage of the \n        overall solid waste stream;\n            (3) the presence of heavy metals in packaging is a concern \n        in light of the likely presence of heavy metals in emissions or \n        ash when packaging is incinerated, or in leachate when \n        packaging is landfilled;\n            (4) lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium, on the \n        basis of available scientific and medical evidence, are of \n        particular concern;\n            (5) it is desirable as a first step in reducing the \n        toxicity of packaging waste to eliminate the addition of these \n        heavy metals to packaging; and\n            (6) the intent of this Act is to achieve this reduction in \n        toxicity without impeding or discouraging the expanded use of \n        postconsumer materials in the production of packaging and \n        components of packaging.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Distributor.--The term ``distributor'' means any person \n        who purchases goods from a manufacturer for sale or promotional \n        use.\n            (3) Incidental presence.--The term ``incidental presence'' \n        means the presence of lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent \n        chromium in a package or packaging component if the substance \n        was not intentionally introduced into the package or packaging \n        component for its own properties or characteristics.\n            (4) Intentional introduction.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``intentional \n                introduction'' means the purposeful introduction of \n                lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium into a \n                package or packaging component with an intent that one \n                or more of the substances be present in the package or \n                packaging component.\n                    (B) Exclusion.--The term does not include--\n                            (i) the background levels of the substances \n                        that naturally occur in raw materials or are \n                        present as postconsumer additions, and that are \n                        not purposefully added to perform as part of a \n                        package or packaging component; and\n                            (ii) any trace quantities of a processing \n                        aid or similar material used to produce a \n                        product from which a package or packaging \n                        component is manufactured, if the processing \n                        aid or similar material is reasonably expected \n                        to be consumed or transformed into a \n                        nonregulated material during the process.\n            (5) Manufacturer.--The term ``manufacturer'' means any \n        person in the chain of production who makes a package or \n        packaging component for sale or promotional purposes, including \n        an importer of packages or packaging components.\n            (6) Package or packaging.--The term ``package'' or \n        ``packaging'' means a container that provides a means of \n        marketing, protecting, or handling a product.
