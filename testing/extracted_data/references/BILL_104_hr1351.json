FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Missouri River system is an integral part of a \n        broad, national, and international transportation network. As \n        such, it has played a key role in the economic growth and \n        development of the Midwest by providing a critical link both \n        into and out of America's heartland.\n            (2) The Missouri River is the largest tributary of the \n        Mississippi River, accounting for nearly half of the water \n        flowing in the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Missouri. \n        Interruptions to this delicate river system could have billions \n        of dollars in adverse effects for our transportation network \n        and for midwestern agriculture.\n            (3) An estimated 7,000,000 short tons of cargo, worth an \n        estimated $1,600,000,000, were held up by river closings which \n        resulted from the floods of 1993. More than 1,000 barges were \n        stranded on the Missouri, Upper Mississippi, and Illinois \n        Rivers, with costs to the towing industry alone estimated at \n        $700,000 per day (excluding the barges which were massed near \n        Cairo, Illinois, awaiting the resumption of navigation).\n            (4) Shifting transportation modes from barges to truck and \n        rail will have an estimated increase in costs to industry and \n        producers who rely on the barge industry to balance our \n        delicate transportation system.\n            (5) Nothing contained in the Preferred Alternative to the \n        Master Water Control Manual for the Missouri River compiled by \n        the Corps of Engineers indicates supporting data that suggests \n        the Corps of Engineers ever attempted to evaluate gross \n        revenues for navigation or any of the various industries \n        supported by navigation on the Missouri River.\n            (6) Instituting a spring rise through increased flows on \n        the Missouri River from the upstream reservoirs would not only \n        interrupt and consequently shift crop planting, production, and \n        harvesting dates along the river but would also increase \n        chances of flooding thereby jeopardizing the health, safety, \n        and livelihood of millions of Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) preserve the free flow of commerce and continued \n        success of commercial navigation, and flood control on the \n        Missouri River system;\n            (2) identify the Missouri River and our Nation's entire \n        river system network as a vital component of our Nation's food \n        supply and transportation structure;\n            (3) establish statutory language identifying recreation as \n        a low level priority relevant to the Master Water Control \n        Manual and its stated priorities of flood control, navigation, \n        hydropower, and water supply along the Missouri River system;\n            (4) combine navigation and flood control in legislation \n        aimed at treating the entire Inland Waterway System as one \n        system;\n            (5) oppose changes to the Master Water Control Manual which \n        would alter or deviate from the management practices or \n        endanger public health or safety relative to the stated \n        purposes of this Act;\n            (6) require the Secretary of the Army, acting with the \n        Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, to \n        apply cost benefit analysis to any study dedicated to reviewing \n        any portion of the Inland Waterway System; and\n            (7) provide safeguards which would allow the Secretary of \n        the Army flexibility to permit lower or higher pool levels in \n        order to provide emergency flood control to protect human \n        health, safety, or property, or to provide adequate water \n        supply levels.\n\nSEC. 4. PERMANENT POOL LEVELS.\n\n    (a) Missouri River System.--The Secretary of the Army shall not \npermit the permanent pool levels in the Missouri River system to fall \nbelow 18,000,000 acre feet at any time unless the Secretary makes a \nfinding that a lower level is required to provide necessary--\n            (1) emergency flood control to protect human health, \n        safety, and property;\n            (2) commercial navigation in the lower basin of the \n        Missouri River;\n            (3) commercial navigation on the Mississippi River;\n            (4) hydropower; or\n            (5) water supply to communities which rely on the Missouri \n        River for water supply.\n    (b) Navigation Service Levels.--To assure the permanent pool level \nreferred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Army shall maintain \nthe following full service navigation levels on the Missouri River from \nApril through November:\n            (1) 36,000 cubic feet per second at Sioux City, Iowa;\n            (2) 36,000 cubic feet per second at Omaha, Nebraska;\n            (3) 42,000 cubic feet per second at Nebraska City, \n        Nebraska; and\n            (4) 46,000 cubic feet per second at Kansas City, Missouri;\nthroughout any period that such permanent pool level is more than \n41,000,000 acre feet.\n    (c) Conservation Service Levels.--To assure the permanent pool \nlevel referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Army shall \nimplement such conservation measures as may be necessary to maintain \nnavigation levels on the Missouri River--\n            (1) of 33,000 cubic feet per second at Sioux City, Iowa;\n            (2) of 33,000 cubic feet per second at Omaha, Nebraska;\n            (3) of 35,000 cubic feet per second at Nebraska City, \n        Nebraska; and\n            (4) of 39,000 cubic feet per second at Kansas City, \n        Missouri;\nthroughout any period that such permanent pool level is less than \n41,000,000 acre feet.\n    (d) Discretionary Management.--Levels of reservoirs on the mainstem \nof the Missouri shall be at the discretion and management of the \nSecretary of the Army, but at no time shall the Secretary allow the \nreservoir configurations on the mainstem of the Missouri River to \njeopardize the discharge level of the Gavins Point Reservoir, Nebraska \nand South Dakota, required to maintain the navigation levels set forth \nin subsections (b) and (c).\n\nSEC. 5. NAVIGATION SEASON EXTENSION.\n\n    (a) Increases.--The Secretary of the Army, working with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, shall \nincrementally increase the length of each navigation season for the \nMissouri River by 15 days from the length of the previous navigation \nseason and those seasons thereafter, until such time as the navigation \nseason for the Missouri River is increased by 1 month from the length \nof the navigation season on April 1, 1995.\n    (b) Application of Increases.--Increases in the length of the \nnavigation season under subsection (a) shall be applied in calendar \nyear 1996 so that the navigation season in such calendar year for the \nMissouri River begins on March 15, 1996, and ends on December 15, 1996.\n    (c) Adjustment of Navigation Levels.--Scheduled full navigation \nlevels shall be incrementally increased to coincide with increases in \nthe navigation season under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 6. WATER CONTROL POLICIES AFFECTING NAVIGATION CHANNELS.\n\n    The Secretary of the Army may not take any action which is \ninconsistent with a water control policy of the Corps of Engineers in \neffect on January 1, 1995, if such action would result in--\n            (1) a reduction of 10 days or more in the total number of \n        days in a year during which vessels are able to use navigation \n        channels; or\n            (2) a substantial increase in flood damage to lands \n        adjacent to a navigation channel, unless such action is \n        specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of \n        enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 7. ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EVALUATION.\n\n    Whenever a Federal department, agency, or instrumentality conducts \nan environmental impact statement with respect to management of the \nMissouri River system, the head of such department, agency, or \ninstrumentality shall also conduct a cost benefit analysis on any \nchanges proposed in the management of the Missouri River."
