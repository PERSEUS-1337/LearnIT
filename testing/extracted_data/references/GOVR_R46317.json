    "content": "The President is responsible for appointing individuals to certain positions in the federal government. In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted to the President alone. Other appointments, generally referred to with the abbreviation PAS, are made by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation process. This report identifies, for the 115 th Congress, all nominations submitted to the Senate for full-time positions on 34 regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions. This report includes profiles on the leadership structures of each of these 34 boards and commissions as well as a pair of tables presenting information on each body's membership and appointment activity as of the end of the 115 th Congress.  The profiles discuss the statutory requirements for the appointed positions, including the number of members on each board or commission, their terms of office, whether they may continue in their positions after their terms expire, whether political balance is required, and the method for selecting the chair. The first table in each pair provides information on full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation as of the end of the 115 th Congress. The second table tracks appointment activity for each board or commission within the 115 th Congress by the Senate (confirmations, rejections, returns to the President, and elapsed time between nomination and confirmation), as well as further related presidential activity (including withdrawals and recess appointments).  In some instances, no appointment action occurred within a board or commission during the 115 th Congress. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database at https://www.congress.gov/ (users can click the \"nominations\" tab on the left-hand side of the page to search the database), the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents , telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code , and the 2016 Plum Book ( United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions ). Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports regarding the presidential appointments process, nomination activity for other executive branch positions, recess appointments, and other related matters are available to congressional clients at http://www.crs.gov . Federal executive branch boards and commissions discussed in this report share, among other characteristics, the following: (1) they are independent executive branch bodies located, with four exceptions, outside executive departments; (2) several board or commission members head each entity, and at least one of these members serves full time; (3) the members are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate; and (4) the members serve fixed terms of office and, except in a few bodies, the President's power to remove them is restricted.  For most of the boards and commissions included in this report, the fixed terms of office for member positions have set beginning and end dates, irrespective of whether the posts are filled or when appointments are made. In contrast, for a few agencies, such as the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the full term begins when an appointee takes office and expires after the incumbent has held the post for the requisite period of time. The end dates of the fixed terms of a board's members are staggered, so that the terms do not expire all at once. The use of terms with fixed beginning and end dates is intended to minimize the occurrence of simultaneous board member departures and thereby increase leadership continuity. Under such an arrangement, an individual is nominated to a particular position and a particular term of office. An individual may be nominated and confirmed for a position for the remainder of an unexpired term to replace an appointee who has resigned (or died). Alternatively, an individual might be nominated for an upcoming term with the expectation that the new term will be under way by the time of confirmation. Occasionally, when the unexpired term has been for a relatively short period, the President has submitted two nominations of the same person simultaneously\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first to complete the unexpired term and the second to complete the entire succeeding term of office. On some commissions, the chair is subject to Senate confirmation and must be appointed from among the incumbent commissioners. If the President wishes to appoint, as chair, someone who is not on the commission, the President simultaneously submits two nominations for the nominee\u00e2\u0080\u0094one for member and the other for chair. As independent entities with staggered membership, executive branch boards and commissions have more political independence from the President than do executive departments. Nonetheless, the President can sometimes exercise significant influence over the composition of a board or commission's membership when he designates the chair or has the opportunity to fill a number of vacancies at once. For example, President George W. Bush had the chance to shape the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the first two years of his presidency because of existing vacancies, resignations, and a member's death. Likewise, during the same time period, President Bush was able to submit nominations for all of the positions on the National Labor Relations Board because of existing vacancies, expiring recess appointments, and resignations. Simultaneous turnover of board or commission membership may result from coincidence, but it also may be the result of a buildup of vacancies after extended periods of time in which the President does not nominate, or the Senate does not confirm, members. Two other notable characteristics apply to appointments to some of the boards and commissions. First, for 26 of the 34 bodies discussed in this report, the law limits the number of appointed members who may belong to the same political party, usually to no more than a bare majority of the appointed members (e.g., two of three or three of five). Second, advice and consent requirements also apply to inspector general appointments in four of these organizations and general counsel appointments in three. During the 115 th Congress, President Donald Trump submitted nominations to the Senate for 112 of the 151 full-time positions on 34 regulatory and other boards and commissions. In attempting to fill these 112 positions, he submitted a total of 140 nominations, of which 75 were confirmed, 12 were withdrawn, and 53 were returned to the President. No recess appointments were made. Table 1 summarizes the appointment activity for the 115 th Congress. At the end of the Congress, 22 incumbents were serving past the expiration of their terms. In addition, there were 43 vacancies among the 151 positions. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate has varied widely. Some nominations have been confirmed within a few days, others have been confirmed within several months, and some have never been confirmed. In the board and commission profiles, this report provides, for each board or commission nomination confirmed in the 115 th Congress, the number of days between nomination and confirmation (\"days to confirm\").  Under Senate rules, nominations not acted on by the Senate at the end of a session of Congress (or before a recess of 30 days) are returned to the President. The Senate, by unanimous consent, often waives this rule\u00e2\u0080\u0094although not always. In cases where the President resubmits a returned nomination, this report measures the days to confirm from the date of receipt of the resubmitted nomination, not the original. For those nominations confirmed in the 115 th Congress, a mean of 121.0 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 91.0. Each of the 34 board or commission profiles in this report is organized into three parts. First, the leadership structure section discusses the statutory requirements for the appointed positions, including the number of members on each board or commission, their terms of office, whether these members may continue in their positions after their terms expire, whether political balance is required, and the method for selecting the chair. The first table lists incumbents to full-time positions as of the end of the 115 th Congress, along with party affiliation (where applicable), date of first confirmation, and term expiration date. Incumbents whose terms have expired are italicized. Most incumbents serve fixed terms of office and are removable only for specified causes. They generally remain in office when a new Administration assumes office following a presidential election.  The second table lists appointment action for vacant positions during the 115 th Congress. This table provides the name of the nominee, position title, date of nomination or appointment, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation, and notes relevant actions other than confirmation (e.g., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President).  When more than one nominee has had appointment action, the second table also provides statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. The average days to confirm are provided in the form of a mean number.   Appendix A provides two tables. Table A-1 includes information on each of the nominations and appointments to regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions during the 115 th Congress. It is alphabetically organized and follows a similar format to that of the \"Appointment Action\" sections discussed above. It identifies the board or commission involved and the dates of nomination and confirmation. It also indicates if a nomination was withdrawn, returned, rejected, or if a recess appointment was made. In addition, it provides the mean and median number of days taken to confirm a nomination.   Table A-2 contains summary information on appointments and nominations by organization. For each of the 34 independent boards and commissions discussed in this report, it shows the number of positions, vacancies, incumbents whose term had expired, nominations, individual nominees, positions to which nominations were made, confirmations, nominations returned to the President, nominations withdrawn, and recess appointments. A list of organization abbreviations can be found in Appendix B .
