    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fix And Improve Reimbursement (FAIR) \nfor Physicians Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Medicare sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula, \n        used in establishing payment rates under the physician fee \n        schedule under the Medicare program, resulted in significant \n        payment cuts to physicians and health care professionals in \n        2002.\n            (2) The Medicare SGR formula would have resulted in payment \n        cuts to physicians and health care professionals in 2003, 2004, \n        2005, and 2006 had Congress not intervened.\n            (3) The Medicare SGR formula will result in a 5 percent \n        payment cut to physicians and health care professionals \n        effective January 1, 2007.\n            (4) According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n        (MedPAC) and the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital \n        Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical \n        Insurance Trust Fund, the Medicare SGR formula will result in \n        substantial payment cuts to physicians and health care \n        professionals through at least 2015.\n            (5) MedPAC does not support the impending payment cuts \n        described in paragraphs (3) and (4) and is concerned that such \n        consecutive annual payment cuts would threaten access to \n        physician services over time, particularly primary care \n        services.\n            (6) MedPAC has raised concerns over current payment \n        policies that may discourage medical students and residents \n        from becoming primary care physicians because many Medicare \n        beneficiaries rely on primary care providers for important \n        health care management.\n            (7) According to a 2006 American Medical Association \n        survey, if payment cuts to physicians under the Medicare \n        program go into effect, 45 percent of physicians plan to \n        decrease the number of new Medicare patients they accept, 50 \n        percent of physicians plan to defer the purchase of information \n        technology, 37 percent of physicians who treat patients living \n        in rural communities will discontinue rural outreach services, \n        and 43 percent of physicians will decrease the number of new \n        TRICARE patients they accept.\n            (8) MedPAC, who considers the Medicare SGR formula a \n        flawed, inequitable mechanism for controlling the volume of \n        services, first recommended repeal of the Medicare SGR formula \n        in 2001 and since then has consistently recommended repealing \n        the formula.\n            (9) Annual actions by Congress to override the Medicare SGR \n        formula result in instability and unpredictability for \n        physicians, health care professionals, seniors, and individuals \n        with disabilities.\n            (10) Annual actions by Congress to override the Medicare \n        SGR formula do not solve the long-term problem as the formula \n        extracts the added spending in future years by imposing ever \n        more drastic cuts.\n            (11) Stable, positive updates under the Medicare physician \n        fee schedule that accurately reflect medical practice cost \n        increases are vital for encouraging and economically supporting \n        physicians' ability to make the significant financial \n        investment required for health information technology and \n        participation in quality improvement programs.\n            (12) A stable payment system for physicians is critical to \n        preserve Medicare beneficiaries' access to high-quality health \n        care.\n            (13) Adopting MedPAC's recommendation to update payments \n        for physicians' services under the Medicare program in 2007 and \n        2008 by the projected change in input prices less MedPAC's \n        expectation for productivity growth is necessary to allow \n        M.D.s, D.O.s, and health care professionals to continue to \n        provide access to high-quality Medicare services for all \n        Medicare beneficiaries while giving Congress time to develop an \n        alternative payment system that accurately reflects the costs \n        of providing care to Medicare beneficiaries\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to sunset the Medicare \nsustainable growth rate formula as of January 1, 2009, in order to \nexpedite Congressional action in establishing a new physician payment \nsystem under the Medicare program that would appropriately reimburse \nphysicians by keeping pace with increases in medical practice costs and \nproviding stable, positive Medicare updates.\n\nSEC. 3. SUNSET OF MEDICARE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH RATE FORMULA.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subsection (f) of section 1848 of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4) is repealed.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The repeal made by subsection (a) shall apply \nto services furnished on or after January 1, 2009.\n\nSEC. 4.
