FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The area of the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk \n        Rivers in the State of New York experienced rapid growth and \n        transformation from an agrarian to an industrial area in the \n        early 19th century because of its geographic location, water \n        power, and human creative genius. It has been called the \n        ``Birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution''.\n            (2) The cities and villages in the 19th century that make \n        up the Hudson and Mohawk area were commercial and industrial \n        communities that linked New England's markets with other \n        northeastern cities and Europe, spawned the collar industry, \n        the thriving iron and textile industries, and a diversified \n        economy.\n            (3) The transition from an agrarian to industrial society \n        within this area produced dramatically different relationships \n        between workers and employers and historically significant \n        examples of the Americanization of immigrant workers.\n            (4) The city of Troy was a leader nationally in the \n        development of trade unions with the Troy union of iron molders \n        being at one time the largest local in America and the Trojan \n        laundry workers organizing the first female union in the \n        Nation.\n            (5) Across the Hudson River from Troy in the city of \n        Cohoes, the Harmony Mills complex, America's largest complete \n        cotton mill in its time, made Cohoes a significant example of \n        the company town pervading almost every aspect of the life of \n        the mill workers.\n            (6) As a result of the enactment of Public Law 102-101 \n        calling for a national labor theme study, the Harmony Mills \n        complex and the Kate Mullaney house, home of the organizer of \n        the first female union in the Nation, were nominated for \n        National Historic Landmark status.\n            (7) This area exists today as a reservoir of historic and \n        cultural lands, waterways, and structures revealing the wide \n        diversity of individual and social endeavor associated with the \n        life of the American worker that created a productive urban \n        industrial society.\n            (8) Collectively, the resources of this area provide \n        opportunities for illustrating and interpreting cultural themes \n        of the heritage of the United States and unique opportunities \n        for education, public use and enjoyment.\n            (9) The seven cities, towns, and villages making up this \n        Hudson-Mohawk area have entered into a cooperative arrangement \n        to manage their valuable cultural resources, and the area has \n        been designated by the State of New York to be one of 14 urban \n        cultural parks to represent industrial development and labor \n        themes in the State's development.\n            (10) This area, known as the Hudson-Mohawk Urban Cultural \n        Park or RiverSpark, has been a pioneer in the development of \n        ``partnership parks'' where intergovernmental and public and \n        private partnerships bring about the conservation of its \n        heritage and the attainment of goals for preservation, \n        education, recreation, and economic development.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to preserve and interpret for the benefit, inspiration, \n        and education of the people of the United States significant \n        places illustrative and representative of the legacy of the \n        Hudson-Mohawk area workers;\n            (2) to help maintain the integrity of setting in the \n        Hudson-Mohawk area that reveals significant chapters in the \n        story of the American worker;\n            (3) through cooperative management, to coordinate the \n        interpretive, preservation, and recreational efforts of \n        Federal, State, and regional entities in the Hudson-Mohawk area \n        in order to enhance opportunities for education, public use, \n        and enjoyment; and\n            (4) to broaden public understanding of the Hudson-Mohawk \n        area and its role in American prehistory, history, and culture.\n\nSEC. 4.
