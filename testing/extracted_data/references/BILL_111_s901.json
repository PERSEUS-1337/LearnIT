FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) more than half of the land in the State of Oregon is \n        owned by the Federal Government;\n            (2) in many counties of the State, significant portions of \n        the land of the counties (often significantly more than half of \n        the land of the counties) is owned by the Federal Government;\n            (3) the land described in paragraph (2) includes Forest \n        Service land and Oregon and California grant land;\n            (4) the counties described in paragraph (2) are unable to \n        derive revenue from property taxes on land owned by the Federal \n        Government;\n            (5) historically, payments made by the Federal Government \n        based on revenues from harvesting timber (including Oregon and \n        California grant land and Forest Service payments) have \n        provided a revenue substitute for property taxes;\n            (6) the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n        Determination Act of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 500 note; Public Law 106-\n        393) augmented the payments described in paragraph (5) because \n        of a significant decline in timber harvest revenues;\n            (7) Congress extended the payments described in paragraph \n        (6) for 1 year in 2007, and for 4 years effective beginning in \n        2008, to provide time to develop a long-term sustainable \n        alternative to the payments described in paragraph (6);\n            (8) the prospects for a long-term extension are uncertain \n        because of concerns regarding Federal budget deficits and long-\n        term financial assistance to local governments of the State;\n            (9) counties of the State that have historically received \n        the payments described in paragraph (5) are in need of a \n        sustainable, long-term revenue source;\n            (10) there are opportunities for the conduct of activities \n        in the Federal forest land of the counties of the State that \n        could be structured to be economically and environmentally \n        sustainable, including--\n                    (A) the harvesting of timber (including thinning to \n                restore forest health) in a sustainable manner and in \n                sustainable quantities;\n                    (B) the removal of biomass material from the forest \n                land for--\n                            (i) the generation of electricity; and\n                            (ii) the production of cellulosic biofuels;\n                    (C) the conduct of activities that could--\n                            (i) increase the sequestration by the \n                        forest land of atmospheric carbon; or\n                            (ii) provide other ecosystem services for \n                        communities, such as clean water; and\n                    (D) the conduct of recreational activities;\n            (11) other sources of revenue, including State and local \n        revenue sources, should also be considered in selecting a \n        sustainable, long-term revenue source; and\n            (12) payments made by the Federal Government could be \n        continued under a variety of different payment methodologies.\n\nSEC. 3.
