FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the local community, when properly organized and \n        challenged, is one of the best sources of academic support, \n        motivation toward achievement, and financial resources for \n        aspiring college students;\n            (2) local communities, working to complement or augment \n        services currently being offered by area schools and colleges, \n        can raise the educational expectations and increase the rate of \n        college attendance of their youth by forming locally based \n        organizations that provide both academic support (including \n        guidance, counseling, mentoring, tutoring, encouragement, and \n        recognition) and tangible, locally raised, effectively \n        targeted, publicly recognized financial assistance;\n            (3) proven methods of stimulating these community efforts \n        can be promoted through Federal support for the establishment \n        of area program centers to organize and challenge community \n        efforts to develop educational incentives and support for local \n        students; and\n            (4) using Federal funds to leverage private contributions \n        to help students attain educational and career goals is an \n        efficient and effective investment of scarce taxpayer-provided \n        resources.\n\nSEC. 3.
