    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Missile Defense Act of \n1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n    (a) National Missile Defense.--It is the policy of the United \nStates to deploy by the end of 2003 a National Missile Defense system \nthat--\n            (1) is capable of defending the territory of the United \n        States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether \n        accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate); and\n            (2) could be augmented over time to provide a layered \n        defense against larger and more sophisticated ballistic missile \n        threats if they emerge.\n    (b) Cooperative Transition.--It is the policy of the United States \nto seek a cooperative transition to a regime that does not feature an \noffense-only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n    (a) Requirement for Development of System.--To implement the policy \nestablished in section 3(a), the Secretary of Defense shall develop for \ndeployment a National Missile Defense (NMD) system which shall achieve \nan initial operational capability (IOC) by the end of 2003.\n    (b) Elements of the NMD System.--The system to be developed for \ndeployment shall include the following elements:\n            (1) Interceptors.--An interceptor system that optimizes \n        defensive coverage of the continental United States, Alaska, \n        and Hawaii against limited ballistic missile attack (whether \n        accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).\n            (2) Ground-based radars.--Fixed ground-based radars.\n            (3) Space-based sensors.--Space-based sensors, including \n        the Space and Missile Tracking System.\n            (4) BM/C&lt;SUP&gt;3.--Battle management, command, control, and \n        communications (BM/C&lt;SUP&gt;3).\n\nSEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n    The Secretary of Defense shall--\n            (1) upon the enactment of this Act, promptly initiate \n        required preparatory and planning actions that are necessary so \n        as to be capable of meeting the initial operational capability \n        (IOC) date specified in section 3(a);\n            (2) not later than the end of fiscal year 1999, conduct an \n        integrated systems test which uses elements (including BM/\n        C&lt;SUP&gt;3 elements) that are representative of, and traceable to, \n        the national missile defense system architecture specified in \n        section 3(b);\n            (3) prescribe and use streamlined acquisition policies and \n        procedures to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n        developing the system specified in section 3(a); and\n            (4) develop a national missile defense follow-on program \n        that--\n                    (A) leverages off of the national missile defense \n                system specified in section 3(a); and\n                    (B) could augment that system, if necessary, to \n                provide for a layered defense.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT ON PLAN FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT \n              AND DEPLOYMENT.\n\n    Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on the \nSecretary's plan for development and deployment of a national missile \ndefense system pursuant to this Act. The report shall include the \nfollowing matters:\n            (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this Act, \n        including--\n                    (A) a detailed description of the system \n                architecture selected for development under section \n                3(b); and\n                    (B) a discussion of the justification for the \n                selection of that particular architecture.\n            (2) The Secretary's estimate of the amount of \n        appropriations required for research, development, test, \n        evaluation, and for procurement, for each of fiscal years 1998 \n        through 2003 in order to achieve the initial operational \n        capability date specified in section 3(a).\n            (3) A determination of the point at which any activity that \n        is required to be carried out under this Act would conflict \n        with the terms of the ABM Treaty, together with a description \n        of any such activity, the legal basis for the Secretary's \n        determination, and an estimate of the time at which such point \n        would be reached in order to meet the initial operational \n        capability date specified in section 3(a).\n\nSEC. 6. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY.\n\n    (a) ABM Treaty Negotiations.--In light of the findings in section \n232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 \n(Public Law 102-106; 110 Stat. 228, 10 U.S.C. 2431 note) and the policy \nestablished in section 2, Congress urges the President to pursue, if \nnecessary, high-level discussions with the Russian Federation to \nachieve an agreement to amend the ABM Treaty to allow deployment of the \nnational missile defense system being developed for deployment under \nsection 3.\n    (b) Requirement for Senate Advice and Consent.--If an agreement \ndescribed in subsection (a) is achieved in discussions described in \nthat subsection, the President shall present that agreement to the \nSenate for its advice and consent. No funds appropriated or otherwise \navailable for any fiscal year may be obligated or expended to implement \nsuch an amendment to the ABM Treaty unless the amendment is made in the \nsame manner as the manner by which a treaty is made.\n    (c) Action Upon Failure To Achieve Negotiated Changes Within One \nYear.--If an agreement described in subsection (a) is not achieved in \ndiscussions described in that subsection within one year after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the President and Congress, in \nconsultation with each other, shall consider exercising the option of \nwithdrawing the United States from the ABM Treaty in accordance with \nthe provisions of Article XV of that treaty.\n\nSEC. 7.
