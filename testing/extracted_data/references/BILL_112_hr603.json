FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Evidence-based research has conclusively documented \n        that youth with significant disabilities who were educated in \n        inclusive settings, were exposed to work experience and career \n        exploration, and participated in a paid work experience while \n        in school had better postsecondary outcomes and higher rates of \n        sustainable employment.\n            (2) Higher rates of self-determination, in which \n        individuals with significant disabilities and their families \n        have direct control over the decisionmaking process in order to \n        ensure an appropriate individualized transition strategy, lead \n        to better outcomes.\n            (3) Regulations and processes allowing for flexibility in \n        the blending and braiding of government funds to ensure \n        seamless, collaborative strategies during the transition \n        process lead to better outcomes for individuals with \n        significant disabilities.\n            (4) Agency officials involved directly in the provision of \n        supports and services during a youth's transition into \n        adulthood and beyond must be provided additional training to \n        become properly prepared to adequately address the individual \n        transition needs of students with significant disabilities.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) Create a holistic system across multiple partners \n        focused on successful transition of youth with significant \n        disabilities into adulthood.\n            (2) Create a systemic focus on achieving high expectations \n        for all youth, through equality of opportunity, full \n        participation through self-determination and informed choice, \n        outcomes related to post-secondary options that lead to \n        competitive integrated employment and economic self-\n        sufficiency.\n            (3) Promote innovative strategies to foster academic, \n        professional, and social inclusion, and the solidification of \n        long-term supports and services required to ensure full \n        integration into the community setting.\n            (4) Better define and coordinate specific services related \n        to the effective transition of youth with significant \n        disabilities.\n            (5) Eliminate barriers and promote incentives for multiple \n        stakeholders to collaborate and improve transition \n        opportunities for youth with significant disabilities.\n\nSEC. 3.
