FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has a strategic need to improve its \n        student visa screening process to protect against terrorists \n        who would abuse the system to harm the United States.\n            (2) At the same time, openness to international students \n        and exchange visitors serves longstanding and important United \n        States foreign policy, educational, and economic interests, and \n        the erosion of such exchanges is contrary to United States \n        national security interests.\n            (3) Educating successive generations of future world \n        leaders in the United States has long been an important \n        underpinning of United States international influence and \n        leadership.\n            (4) Open scientific exchange, which enables the United \n        States to benefit from the knowledge of the world's top \n        scientists, has long been an important underpinning of United \n        States scientific leadership.\n            (5) The United States has seen a dramatic increase in \n        requests for Visa Mantis checks designed to protect against \n        illegal transfers of sensitive technology, from 1,000 in fiscal \n        year 2000 to 20,000 in fiscal year 2003.\n            (6) Delays in issuing Visa Mantis security clearances have \n        discouraged some international scholars from coming to the \n        United States.\n            (7) International students and their families studying in \n        the United States contribute close to $12,000,000,000 to the \n        United States economy each year, making higher education a \n        major service sector export.\n            (8) Delays in obtaining student visas have discouraged many \n        international students from studying in the United States.\n            (9) Total international applications to graduate schools in \n        the United States for fall 2004 declined 32 percent from fall \n        2003.\n            (10) The number of international students enrolled in the \n        United States, which in raw numbers consistently increased over \n        time and grew by 6 percent during both the 2000-2001 and 2001-\n        2002 school years, leveled off dramatically during the 2002-\n        2003 school year to an increase of only .6 percent.\n            (11) Concerns related to the anticipated international \n        student monitoring system known as ``SEVIS'' have contributed \n        to the decline in the number of foreign applicants to \n        educational institutions in the United States.\n            (12) The United States requires a visa system for exchange \n        programs that maximizes United States national security.\n            (13) The United States requires a comprehensive strategy \n        for recruiting international students as well as enhancing the \n        access of international students to higher education in the \n        United States.\n\n TITLE I--NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR ENHANCING INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACCESS \n                          TO THE UNITED STATES\n\nSEC. 101. STRATEGIC PLAN.\n\n    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe President, in consultation with United States higher education \ninstitutions, organizations that participate in international exchange \nprograms, and other appropriate groups, shall submit to the Committee \non Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \nRelations of the House of Representatives a strategic plan for \nenhancing international student access to the United States for study \nand exchange activities that includes:\n            (1) A marketing plan to makes use of Internet and other \n        media resources to promote and facilitate study in the United \n        States by international students.\n            (2) A clear division of responsibility that eliminates \n        duplication and promotes inter-agency cooperation with regard \n        to the roles of the Departments of State, Commerce, Education, \n        and Homeland Security in promoting and facilitating access \nto the United States for international student and exchange visitors.\n            (3) A mechanism for institutionalized coordination of the \n        efforts of Departments of State, Commerce, Education, and \n        Homeland Security in facilitating access to the United States \n        for international student and exchange visitors.\n            (4) An effective mandate and strategic plan for use of the \n        overseas educational advising centers of the Department of \n        State to promote study in the United States and to prescreen \n        visa applicants.\n            (5) Well-defined lines of authority and responsibility for \n        international students in the Department of Commerce.\n            (6) A clear mandate related to international student access \n        for the Department of Education.\n            (7) Streamlined procedures within the Department of \n        Homeland Security related to international student and exchange \n        visitors.\n\nSEC. 102.
