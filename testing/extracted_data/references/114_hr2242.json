RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND CENSORSHIP OF THE \n              INTERNET TREATED AS A RESTRICTION ON TRADE.\n\n    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that restrictions on the activities of \nUnited States journalists and media personnel and the censorship and \nblockage of websites and the cross-border flow of information damages \nthe competitiveness of United States corporations and limits access to \ninformation critical for investors, consumers, and others making market \nand financial decisions and should be considered a restriction of trade \nand an unfair competitive advantage benefitting foreign government-\ncontrolled news organizations and other news and media corporations.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--Congress declares the following:\n            (1) The United States Government should seek as part of \n        international treaty negotiations and in negotiations and \n        bilateral discussions with China, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and \n        other countries rated ``Not Free'' by Freedom House's annual \n        ``Freedom of the Press'' survey, conditions for a free and \n        unfettered operation of websites, an end to visas restrictions \n        for journalists, an end to harassment, intimidation, and \n        surveillance of foreign journalists and an end to the abuse of \n        state secrets laws, including China's restrictions on the \n        sharing of information between Chinese and foreign journalists.\n            (2) In addition, the United States Government should seek \n        to link expansion of the free flow of information with ongoing \n        and future trade agreements, and other bilateral agreements and \n        communiques, by seeking language eliminating any and all \n        limitations on market access for news agency services and \n        eliminate any restrictions on cross-border data flows involving \n        journalists and the media, including in the Trans-Pacific \n        Partnership, Bilateral Investment Treaties, or any other trade \n        negotiations planned or in progress and seek stipulations \n        guaranteeing fair treatment of United States and other foreign \n        journalists and their publications, consistent with the \n        treatment received by foreign journalists operating in the \n        United States and free and unfettered operation of websites in \n        China and other countries where they are blocked or censored.\n    (c) Sense of Congress.--In order to promote freedom of the press \nand recognize the importance of that internationally recognized right \nto economic freedom and economic security, it is the sense of Congress \nthat--\n            (1) restrictions on journalists and media websites and the \n        censorship of the Internet are significant foreign trade \n        barriers;\n            (2) the United States Trade Representative should include a \n        list of United States websites blocked in foreign countries in \n        reporting on trade barriers in its annual report on foreign \n        trade barriers; and\n            (3) the United States Government should pursue, at the \n        World Trade Organization (WTO) , disputes to end blockage of \n        United States websites by foreign governments, which would \n        include requirements for other members of the WTO to regularly \n        publish a list of any banned or censored websites and provide \n        website owners an opportunity to appeal."
