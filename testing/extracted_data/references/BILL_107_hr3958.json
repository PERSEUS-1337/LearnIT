FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Secretary of the Interior and the State of Utah \n        have negotiated a preliminary agreement concerning the \n        ownership of lands within the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge \n        located in Bear River Bay of the Great Salt Lake, Utah.\n            (2) The State is entitled to ownership of those sovereign \n        lands constituting the bed of the Great Salt Lake, and, \n        generally, the location of the sovereign lands boundary was set \n        by an official survey of the Great Salt Lake meander line.\n            (3) The establishment of the Refuge in 1928 along the shore \n        of the Great Salt Lake, and lack of a meander line survey \n        within the Refuge, has led to uncertainty of ownership of some \n        those sovereign lands.\n            (4) In order to settle the uncertainty concerning the \n        sovereign land boundary caused by the gap in the surveyed Great \n        Salt Lake meander line within the Refuge, the Secretary and the \n        State have agreed to the establishment of a fixed sovereign \n        land boundary along the southern boundary of the Refuge and the \n        State has agreed to release any claim to the lake bed above \n        such boundary line.\n            (5) The Secretary and the State have expressed their \n        intentions to establish a mutually agreed upon procedure to \n        address the conflicting claims to ownership of the lands and \n        interests in land within the Refuge.\n\nSEC. 3.
