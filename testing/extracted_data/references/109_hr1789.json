    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Health Professionals Substance Abuse \nEducation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Illegal drugs and alcohol are responsible for thousands \n        of deaths each year, and they fuel the spread of a number of \n        communicable diseases, including AIDS and Hepatitis C, as well \n        as some of the worst social problems in the United States, \n        including child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault.\n            (2) There are an estimated 19,500,000 current drug users in \n        America, nearly 4,000,000 of whom are addicts. An estimated \n        14,800,000 Americans abuse alcohol or are alcoholic.\n            (3) There are nearly 27,000,000 children of alcoholics in \n        America, almost 11,000,000 of whom are under 18 years of age. \n        Countless other children are affected by substance abusing \n        parents or other caretakers. Health professionals are uniquely \n        positioned to help reduce or prevent alcohol and other drug-\n        related impairment by identifying affected families and youth \n        and by providing early intervention.\n            (4) Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. As with \n        other chronic relapsing diseases (such as diabetes, \n        hypertension, and asthma), there is no cure, although a number \n        of treatments can effectively control the disease. According to \n        an article published in the Journal of the American Medical \n        Association, treatment for addiction works as well as treatment \n        for other chronic relapsing diseases.\n            (5) Drug treatment is cost effective, even when compared \n        with residential treatment, the most expensive type of \n        treatment. Residential treatment for cocaine addiction costs \n        between $15,000 and $20,000 a year, a substantial savings \n        compared to incarceration (costing nearly $40,000 a year), or \n        untreated addiction (costing more than $43,000 a year). Also, \n        in 1998, substance abuse and addiction accounted for \n        approximately $10,000,000,000 in Federal, State, and local \n        government spending simply to maintain the child welfare \n        system. The economic costs associated with fetal alcohol \n        syndrome were estimated at $54,000,000,000 in 2003.\n            (6) Many doctors and other health professionals are \n        unprepared to recognize substance abuse in their patients or \n        their families and intervene in an appropriate manner. Only 56 \n        percent of residency programs have a required curriculum in \n        preventing or treating substance abuse.\n            (7) Fewer than 1 in 5 doctors (only 19 percent) feel \n        confident about diagnosing alcoholism, and only 17 percent feel \n        qualified to identify illegal drug use.\n            (8) Most doctors who are in a position to make a diagnosis \n        of alcoholism or drug addiction do not believe that treatment \n        works (less than 4 percent for alcoholism and only 2 percent \n        for drugs).\n            (9) According to a survey by the National Center on \n        Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (referred \n        to in this section as ``CASA''), 94 percent of primary care \n        physicians and 40 percent of pediatricians presented with a \n        classic description of an alcoholic or drug addict, \n        respectively, failed to properly recognize the problem.\n            (10) Another CASA report revealed that fewer than 1 percent \n        of doctors presented with the classic profile of an alcoholic \n        older woman could diagnose it properly. Eighty-two percent \n        misdiagnosed it as depression, some treatments for which are \n        dangerous when taken with alcohol.\n            (11) Training can greatly increase the degree to which \n        medical and other health professionals screen patients for \n        substance abuse. It can also increase the manner by which such \n        professionals screen children and youth who may be impacted by \n        the addiction of a parent or other primary caretaker. Boston \n        University Medical School researchers designed and conducted a \n        seminar on detection and brief intervention of substance abuse \n        for doctors, nurses, physician's assistants, social workers and \n        psychologists. Follow-up studies reveal that 91 percent of \n        those who participated in the seminar report that they are \n        still using the techniques up to 5 years later.\n            (12) The total economic costs of untreated addiction is \n        estimated to be $274,800,000,000. Arming health care \n        professionals with the information they need in order to \n        intervene and prevent further substance abuse could lead to a \n        significant cost savings.\n            (13) A study conducted by doctors at the University of \n        Wisconsin found a $947 net savings per patient in health care, \n        accident, and criminal justice costs for each individual \n        screened and, if appropriate, for whom intervention was made, \n        with respect to alcohol problems.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) improve the ability of health care professionals to \n        identify and assist their patients in obtaining appropriate \n        treatment for substance abuse;\n            (2) improve the ability of health care professionals to \n        identify and refer children and youth affected by substance \n        abuse in their families for effective treatment; and\n            (3) help establish an infrastructure to train health care \n        professionals about substance abuse issues and the impact on \n        families.\n\nSEC. 3.
