    "content": "The 116 th Congress began with 57 African American Members, the highest number ever at the beginning of a Congress. After the death of an African American House Member in October 2019, the current 56 African American Members represent the following proportions of the entire Congress, and of the House and Senate separately: 10.1% of voting Members in the Congress (54 of 535, does not include the Delegates and Resident Commissioner); 10.4% of total Members in the Congress (56 of 541, includes the Delegates and Resident Commissioner); 11.7% of voting Members in the House (51 of 435, does not include the Delegates and Resident Commissioner); 12.0% of total Members in the House (53 of 441, includes the Delegates and Resident Commissioner); and 3.0% of total Members in the Senate (3 of 100).  Table 1 provides more detail on these African American Members across the 116 th Congress. In addition to data for the 116 th Congress, this report provides historical information. The report also includes an appendix with an alphabetical listing of African American Members, selected biographical information, and committee assignments during their tenure in Congress. Inclusion in this report, and related data, is based on entry in Black Americans in Congress, 1870-2007 , the Black Americans in Congress, 1870-2019 e-book, and the accompanying website maintained by the House Office of the Historian and Office of Art and Archives ( http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Black-Americans-in-Congress/ ) . According to that office, the website  is based on the 2008 print edition but updated to reflect the entry of new African Americans into Congress. In 2018, at the direction of the Committee on House Administration, the Historian's Office revised and updated the contextual essays of the 2008 print edition in order to prepare the 2019 e-book edition of Black Americans in Congress.  This report does not include additional Members who might identify as African American, or as having African ancestry, but are not included in these sources. Additional historical information, including committee assignments, leadership positions, and dates of service, is based on Biographical Directory of the American Congress ( http://bioguide.congress.gov ), various editions of the Congressional Directory , and a broad range of Congressional Quarterly Inc. and Leadership Directories Inc. publications.  Numerous studies of Congress have examined the role and impact of African Americans in Congress. Many of these studies relate to larger questions about the nature of representation or about Congress as an institution.  Central to these studies have been questions about the following: Descriptive representation (i.e., representation by those who share demographic characteristics with their constituents) and substantive representation (i.e., representation of policy preferences and a linkage to policy outcomes) in the representation of minority electoral and policy interests, as well as any linkage or trade-offs between the two. While the former concentrates on election outcomes (e.g., percentages of congressional seats), the latter focuses on behaviors and actions once an elected official is in office. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, impact of majority-minority districts in representing minority interests in a district, and influence of majority-minority districts on electoral and policy preferences in surrounding districts. These studies have also examined recent court rulings. The relationship of minority Members of Congress with their constituents, including any impact on turnout, electoral competitiveness or strategies, hiring of minority staff, communication styles, constituency services, and voter satisfaction and engagement. Legislative activities and influence, including work in committees, floor speeches, bill introduction and passage, cosponsorship, coalition formation, career progression and seniority, and relations with congressional leadership. Roll-call voting behavior, including voting cohesion compared to party or state delegations. Positions on various domestic or international issues. The first African American to serve in the Senate, Hiram Revels of Mississippi, was sworn in on February 23, 1870. The first African American to serve in the House, Joseph Rainey of South Carolina, was sworn in on December 12, 1870.  Both chambers subsequently had periods without any African American Members. The longest period for the House stretched from the 57 th Congress (1901-1903) until the beginning of the 71 st Congress (1929-1931), or 28 years. The longest period for the Senate stretched from the beginning of the 47 th Congress (1881-1883) until the beginning of the 90 th Congress (1967-1968), or 86 years.  African American membership in the House first reached 10 Members during the 91 st Congress (1969-1970), and voting membership first exceeded 5% during the 100 th Congress (1987-1988). Another large increase occurred during the 103 rd Congress (1993-1994), which was the first Congress after the redistricting that followed the 1990 U.S. Census.  The 116 th Congress began with the highest number of African American Members ever for the start of a Congress: 57 (52 Representatives, 2 Delegates, and 3 Senators).   Table 2 provides a summary of the 162 African Americans who have served in the House, Senate, and both chambers. Of these 162 Members, 22 began their service after the Civil War but prior to the start of the 20 th century (2 in the Senate, 20 in the House). Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution requires that all Members of the House of Representatives must be \"chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.\"  Therefore, all 153 of the African Americans who have served in the House entered office through election, even those who entered after a seat became open during a Congress.  By contrast, the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1913, gives state legislatures the option to empower governors to fill congressional Senate vacancies by temporary appointment. The Seventeenth Amendment also provides for direct elections of Senators by the \"people\" of a state. Previously, Senators were elected by legislative selection rather than through the direct elections by which Representatives to Congress were elected. Of the 10 African Americans who have served in the Senate, two were elected prior to the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution; four initially entered Senate service by winning a regular election; one initially entered Senate service by winning a special election and was subsequently reelected; and three were appointed. Of these three, one was a candidate for reelection and served in more than one Congress. In 1971, the 13 African Americans then serving in the House established the Congressional Black Caucus.  In the 116 th Congress, the CBC is one of more than 270 registered congressional member organizations (CMOs) in the House. House CMOs are required to register with the Committee on House Administration. CMOs do not receive separate funding, and they have not since a change in the Rules of the House adopted for the 104 th Congress. Members may use their Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) to support staff, including shared staff, assigned to CMO duties. Members, rather than the CMO, remain the employing authority, and the CMO is not an independent entity. The committee's Members' Congressional Handbook lists a number of additional regulations related to the staffing and funding of CMOs.  CMOs are not required to register in the Senate. As in the House, informal congressional groups or organizations do not receive separate funding.  The CBC CMO is distinct from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, which was established in 1976 and is a \u00c2\u00a7501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. A number of African Americans in Congress, listed in Table 5 , have held positions in their party's leadership. All of these party leadership positions have been in the House. The first African American Member to be elected to any party leadership position was Shirley Chisholm (D-NY), who served as House Democratic Caucus Secretary in the 95 th and 96 th Congresses (1977-1980). As chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Levees of the Mississippi River (45 th Congress), Blanche K. Bruce was the first African American to chair any congressional committee. As chair of the House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments (81 st Congress), William L. Dawson was the first African American to chair a House committee. In total,  23 African Americans have chaired a House committee; 1 African American has chaired a Senate committee; and 2 African American Representatives have chaired a joint committee. These chairmanships include standing, special, and select committees. Some African Americans have chaired multiple committees in the House. In the 116 th Congress, four African American Representatives currently chair four different House standing committees. A total of 47 African American women have served in Congress. Of these, 25 serve in the 116 th Congress (including 2 Delegates), a record number. The previous record was 22 (including 2 Delegates), which was reached at the end of the 115 th Congress. The African American women Members of the 116 th Congress are listed in Table 7 . African American women comprise 25 of the 131 women currently serving in the 116 th Congress (19.1%) and 25 of the 57 African Americans currently serving in the 116 th Congress (43.9%).
