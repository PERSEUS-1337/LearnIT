    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Recycled Roads Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 2000, there were more than 3,951,000 miles of \n        highways in the United States;\n            (2) in the early 1990s, as much as 350,000,000 tons of raw \n        and recyclable material were used annually for highway \n        construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance;\n            (3) in 2002, the Federal Government provided \n        $26,348,000,000, or more than 34 percent of funding, for \n        highways in the United States;\n            (4) at least 45 States recycle a total of 73,000,000 tons \n        of reclaimed asphalt pavement annually, the use of which \n        results in an annual savings of approximately $300,000,000 as \n        compared with the cost of using raw material;\n            (5) in 2002, the Federal Highway Administration issued a \n        policy encouraging States to use recycled material in highway \n        construction because recycling and reuse can offer engineering, \n        economic, and environmental benefits;\n            (6) greater incorporation of recyclable material in highway \n        construction would--\n                    (A) provide a significant new national market for \n                the use of recyclable material;\n                    (B) create new markets and incentives for recycling \n                in small communities;\n                    (C) conserve raw material; and\n                    (D) reduce the quantities of waste deposited in \n                landfills in the United States (which would produce an \n                additional savings for the Federal Government and State \n                governments); and\n            (7) the increased use of recyclable material in highway \n        construction could--\n                    (A) provide additional opportunities for rural \n                economic development; and\n                    (B) encourage expanded use of biomass products.\n\nSEC. 3.
