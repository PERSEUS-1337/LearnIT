Ahmed is an innocent Bangladeshi \n        citizen living in exile in the United States. In 1996, a \n        Bangladeshi court erroneously convicted Mr. Ahmed of murder and \n        sentenced him to death in connection with a 1975 coup. Having \n        exhausted all available legal avenues, Ahmed now sits in U.S. \n        custody awaiting his deportation and subsequent execution.\n            (2) The circumstances surrounding the trial in absentia and \n        subsequent conviction of Mohiuddin ``Din'' Ahmed, are \n        sufficiently suspect as to warrant the immediate intervention \n        on the part of the United States Government to prevent his \n        planned deportation, which as of now is imminent.\n            (3) If the United States Congress, the United States State \n        Department, or the United States Department of Homeland \n        Security fail to intervene on his behalf, or favorably exercise \n        their discretion in this matter, Ahmed will face certain \n        execution by hanging upon his arrival in Bangladesh.\n            (4) Following its split from Pakistan in 1971, the newly \n        sovereign nation of Bangladesh experienced a period of violent \n        civil unrest, culminating in the violent coup to overthrow the \n        nation's first Prime Minister, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib) on \n        August 15, 1975. Ahmed had been commissioned as an officer in \n        the East Pakistani military before Bangladesh declared its \n        independence, and he continued to serve during the Pakistani \n        civil war and after independence. On the night of August 15, \n        1975, Ahmed was ordered to station his men at a roadblock \n        roughly one mile from the home of then Prime Minister of \n        Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. That night, a violent coup \n        erupted, and individuals stormed the home of the Prime \n        Minister, killing him and the rest of his family.\n            (5) Ahmed, like most Bangladeshis and many international \n        observers at the time, was concerned with Mujib's policies of \n        political suppression and his repeated violations of the civil \n        rights of the Bangladeshi people. However, he had no knowledge \n        of, nor did he support, the violent coup that erupted that \n        night.\n            (6) Following the coup, Ahmed went on to serve as a \n        diplomat in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere, until 1996, when \n        Sheikh Hasina Wajed, daughter of the assassinated Prime \n        Minister, came to power, and then broke her promise to respect \n        the Bangladeshi constitutional amendment which provided \n        immunity to officers involved in the 1975 coup. Rather, Sheikh \n        Hasina Wajed orchestrated the repeal of the constitutional \n        amendment, and the arrest of the men she believed were \n        responsible for the death of her father. Under these orders, \n        Ahmed, who had been living in Los Angeles, was tried in \n        absentia, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He will \n        not be allowed to reopen the in absentia conviction. As such, \n        he will not be provided the opportunity to question the \n        fairness of the trial, confront witnesses against him, nor \n        present exculpatory evidence on his behalf which has recently \n        been uncovered, i.e., eyewitness testimony affirming Ahmed's \n        innocence.\n            (7) Soon after Din arrived in the United States he applied \n        for asylum but was denied by both the Immigration Court and the \n        Board of Immigration appeals. By the time his trial began in \n        Bangladesh he had already filed a request for political asylum \n        under the provisions of the United Nations Convention Against \n        Torture. But after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, \n        immigration law had changed and Ahmed, accused of taking part \n        in killing a head of state, was no longer entitled to relief \n        from deportation. Last February, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n        the 9th Circuit affirmed the immigration judge's denial of \n        asylum and related relief.\n            (8) It is incumbent upon us to find a country where Ahmed \n        might be granted safe-haven, that does not condone death \n        penalty, and that respects human rights.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFERRAL OF ACTION ON DEPORTATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for \npurposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et \nseq.), Mohuiddin A.K.M.

Ahmed will not be \ndeported to Bangladesh, or any country, which maintains an extradition \ntreaty with Bangladesh or which condones the death penalty.\n    (c) Preferential Immigration Treatment for Certain Relatives.--The \nspouse and children of Mohuiddin A.K.M. Ahmed shall, by virtue of such \nrelationship, be accorded the same rights, privileges, or status under \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act as Mohuiddin A.K.M. Ahmed.\n\nSEC. 3.
