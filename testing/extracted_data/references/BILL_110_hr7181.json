FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Serious illness, death, and dying are often difficult \n        subjects to talk about for individuals, their families, and \n        health care professionals.\n            (2) Poor communication about preferences for care at the \n        end of life can cause distress for both patients and their \n        families.\n            (3) As individuals approach the last chapter of their life, \n        more can be done to educate them about treatment choices and \n        help individuals communicate to health providers what care they \n        want or do not want to receive.\n            (4) A decade of research has demonstrated that orders for \n        life sustaining treatment effectively convey treatment \n        preferences, guiding medical personnel in providing or \n        withholding interventions.\n            (5) Orders for life sustaining treatment differ from \n        advance directives. Advance directives (including living wills \n        and durable powers of attorney for health care) must be \n        completed while individuals have the capacity to complete them \n        and generally apply to future, hypothetical medical \n        circumstances when decisionmaking capacity is lost. Patients' \n        values, goals, and preferences, as expressed in advance \n        directives, require a thoughtful interpretive process to apply \n        to specific medical circumstances in real time. Yet, patients \n        and proxy decisionmakers are often uncertain how to apply and \n        implement patients' values and goals in unfamiliar health care \n        settings when real treatment plans and complicated decisions \n        need to be made.\n            (6) Orders for life sustaining treatment complement \n        advances directives by providing a process to focus patients' \n        values, goals, and preferences on current medical circumstances \n        and to translate them into visible and portable medical orders \n        applicable across care settings, including home, long-term \n        care, emergency medical services, and hospitals. Without such \n        medical orders emergency medical personnel may be required to \n        provide treatments that may not be consistent with the \n        individual's preferences. Completion of such an order is \n        equally valuable to patients who have not executed advance \n        directives.\n            (7) The following States have implemented or are developing \n        statewide programs for orders for life sustaining treatment: \n        California, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, \n        Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New \n        York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, \n        Washington, and West Virginia. Localities within Maine, \n        Minnesota, Nevada, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \n        have implemented or are developing programs for orders for life \n        sustaining treatment.\n            (8) Programs for orders for life sustaining treatment \n        provide valuable services to individuals, their families, and \n        health care providers through educational materials, \n        professional training on advance care planning, coordinating \n        and collaborating with hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, \n        hospice programs, home health agencies, and emergency medical \n        services to implement such orders across the continuum of care, \n        and monitoring the success of the program.\n            (9) Medicare pays for acute care services provided to \n        beneficiaries, but does not pay for informed discussions \n        between beneficiaries and health providers to allow \n        beneficiaries the opportunity to determine if they desire such \n        acute care in the last months and years of life.\n\nSEC. 3.
