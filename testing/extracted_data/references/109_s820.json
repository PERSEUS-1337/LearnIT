FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Health care spending in the United States has reached \n        15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United States, \n        yet 45,000,000 people, or 15.6 percent of the population, \n        remains uninsured.\n            (2) After nearly a decade of manageable increases in \n        commercial insurance premiums, many employers are now faced \n        with consecutive years of double digit premium increases.\n            (3) Purchasing cooperatives owned by participating \n        businesses are a proven method of achieving the bargaining \n        power necessary to manage the cost and quality of employer-\n        sponsored health plans and other employee benefits.\n            (4) The Employer Health Care Alliance Cooperative has \n        provided its members with health care purchasing power through \n        provider contracting, data collection, activities to enhance \n        quality improvements in the health care community, and \n        activities to promote employee health care consumerism.\n            (5) According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \n        there are nearly 80 employer-led coalitions across the United \n        States that collectively purchase health care, proactively \n        challenge high costs and the inefficient delivery of health \n        care, and share information on quality. These coalitions \n        represent more than 10,000 employers.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to build off of \nsuccessful local employer-led health insurance initiatives by improving \nthe value of their employees' health care.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS TO SELF INSURED BUSINESSES TO FORM HEALTH CARE \n              COOPERATIVES.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Secretary''), acting through the Director \nof the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, is authorized to \naward grants to eligible groups that meet the criteria described in \nsubsection (d), for the development of health care purchasing \ncooperatives.
