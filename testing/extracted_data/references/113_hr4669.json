FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) When servicemembers move from one State to another they \n        are required to go through a burdensome process of changing \n        their auto insurance policies.\n            (2) The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. App. 501 \n        et seq.) allows the men and women serving in the United States \n        Armed Forces to keep a stable domicile with respect to auto \n        licensing and fees even if they are forced to move temporarily \n        in compliance with military orders.\n            (3) The Federal Insurance Office of the U.S. Department of \n        the Treasury, in its report of December 12, 2013, on how to \n        modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the \n        United States, found that ``an individual on active duty can \n        transfer credit cards, checking accounts, and other financial \n        services simply by submitting a change of address form. By \n        contrast, an individual moving from one state to another may be \n        required to obtain a new auto insurance policy on each \n        transfer''. Furthermore the report called on interested parties \n        ``to identify a more accommodating approach for service members \n        who have personal auto policies and are required to move across \n        state lines''.\n            (4) Relief should be provided with respect to auto \n        insurance policies for servicemembers and their families that \n        are required to move in compliance with any temporary duty or \n        permanent change of station order.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reduce the burdens and \nincrease the protections involved in changing auto insurance policies \nfor servicemembers and their families who are required to move in \ncompliance with a temporary duty or permanent change of station order.\n\nSEC. 3.
