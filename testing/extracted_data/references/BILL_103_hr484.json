STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Statement of Finding.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the objective of enhancing long-term economic growth is \n        not well served by a budget process focused on short-term \n        results,\n            (2) long-term economic growth depends not only upon a \n        stable social, political, and economic environment and a higher \n        level of national savings, but also upon a sound public \n        infrastructure, an educated citizenry and workforce, an \n        investment in research and the discovery of knowledge, and the \n        harnessing of inventive genius into the workplace and \n        marketplace,\n            (3) the existing presentation of the Federal Budget \n        obscures the distinctions between long-term capital \n        investments, expenditures of a developmental character, and \n        current operational spending, and\n            (4) the public interest will be served by a Federal Budget \n        presentation which presents information showing long-term \n        effects of expenditures.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to require that the \nunified budget present--\n            (1) an operating budget, and\n            (2) an investment budget divided into--\n                    (A) federally-owned capital, and\n                    (B) developmental investments,\n        for each of the 3 major components of the budget (general, \n        trust, and enterprise funds) in order to ensure a continued \n        focus on the Government's total financial operations, while \n        providing better and more relevant information upon which to \n        base both overall fiscal policy as well as program priorities \n        within the Federal Budget.\n\nSEC. 3. CAPITAL AND OPERATING BUDGETS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title 31, United States Code, is amended by \ninserting after section 1105 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 1105A.
