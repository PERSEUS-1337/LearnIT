FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) conditions inherent to traveling performances, \n        including constant travel, temporary and collapsible \n        facilities, and the prolonged confinement and physical coercion \n        of animals, subject exotic and wild animals to compromised \n        welfare and chronic stress, and present public and worker \n        health and safety risks not adequately addressed by current \n        regulation;\n            (2) current regulatory oversight of traveling performances \n        is complex and costly, and these costs are not typically \n        recouped via licensing fees, but are left to the American \n        taxpayer;\n            (3) the frequent mobility of traveling performances \n        complicates oversight such that agencies and authorities cannot \n        properly monitor, evaluate, or follow through regarding the \n        condition of animals or facilities, or their history of \n        potential injuries, incidents, illnesses, violations, or other \n        issues, and so cannot properly protect animals, workers, or the \n        public;\n            (4) traveling exotic and wild animal performances use \n        collapsible, temporary, mobile facilities, which risk escape \n        and serious harm to animals, workers, and the public;\n            (5) traveling exotic and wild animal performances present \n        safety risks by permitting or not preventing public contact and \n        by displaying animals in inappropriate, uncontrolled areas in \n        dangerous proximity to humans and other animals;\n            (6) exotic and wild animals have intrinsic value; their \n        wild instincts and needs are unpredictable and are not \n        naturally suited to traveling performances, and they suffer as \n        a result of being unable to fulfill instinctive natural \n        behaviors;\n            (7) exotic and wild animals used in traveling performances \n        suffer severe and extended confinement, and, deprived of \n        natural movements and behaviors, are prone to chronic stress, \n        behavioral, health, and psychological problems;\n            (8) exotic and wild animals are forced to perform unnatural \n        tricks requiring extreme physical coercion, including, but not \n        limited to the use of food and water restrictions, electric \n        shock devices, bullhooks, metal bars, whips, shovels, and \n        pitchforks, among other abuses;\n            (9) it is not necessary to use exotic or wild animals in \n        traveling performances to experience the circus or similar \n        events;\n            (10) using exotic or wild animals as commodities traded for \n        traveling performances adds nothing to the understanding and \n        conservation of such animals and the natural environment, and \n        actually undermines conservation efforts necessary to protect \n        threatened and endangered species;\n            (11) it is not possible to provide or ensure public and \n        worker safety or appropriate physical and mental welfare for \n        exotic and wild animals under the traveling performance \n        business model, which inherently and significantly restricts \n        animals' natural movements and behaviors, and where abuse is \n        prevalent and oversight problematic;\n            (12) the use of exotic or wild animals in traveling \n        performances is or substantially affects interstate or foreign \n        commerce, or the free flow thereof; it is essential to regulate \n        such activities to assure animals' humane care and treatment; \n        and\n            (13) restricting the use of exotic and wild animals in \n        traveling performances is the most cost-effective and efficient \n        way to safeguard animals, workers, and the public.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF EXOTIC OR WILD ANIMALS IN TRAVELING PERFORMANCES.\n\n    Section 13 of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2143) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(i)(1) No person shall cause a performance of, or allow for the \nparticipation of, an exotic animal or wild animal in a traveling animal \nact.\n    ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the use of an exotic animal \nor wild animal--\n            ``(A) in an exhibition at a nonmobile, permanent \n        institution, facility, zoo, or aquarium accredited by the \n        Association of Zoos & Aquariums or the Global Federation of \n        Animal Sanctuaries, or a wildlife sanctuary;\n            ``(B) as part of an environmental education program by a \n        facility accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, if \n        the animal used for such purposes is not so used for more than \n        6 months in any year and is not kept in a mobile or traveling \n        housing facility for more than 12 hours in any day;\n            ``(C) by a university, college, laboratory, or other \n        research facility registered with the Secretary pursuant to \n        section 6 for the purpose of conducting research;\n            ``(D) in film, television, or advertising, if such use does \n        not involve a live animal exhibition conducted before a public \n        studio audience; or\n            ``(E) in a rodeo.\n    ``(3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to domestic animals or farm \nanimals.\n    ``(4) For the purposes of this subsection:\n            ``(A) Cause a performance.--The term `cause a performance' \n        means to be responsible for a performance, to financially \n        benefit as an owner or operator from a performance, or to \n        sponsor a performance.\n            ``(B) Domestic animal.--The term `domestic animal' means \n        any animal that is normally maintained as a companion or pet \n        animal in or near the household of the owner or person who \n        cares for the animal, such as a domestic dog (including a \n        service dog), domestic cat, ferret, gerbil, horse, mouse, rat, \n        guinea pig, rabbit, or hamster, but does not include any exotic \n        animal or wild animal.\n            ``(C) Environmental education program.--The term \n        `environmental education program' means an animal exhibition \n        that is professionally designed to impart knowledge or \n        information for educational or conservation purposes about that \n        animal's natural behavior, habitat, life cycle, or similar \n        pedagogical information, conducted by an individual qualified \n        to impart such information, which does not include any \n        performance of behavior that does not naturally occur for that \n        animal in the wild state.\n            ``(D) Exotic animal.--The term `exotic animal' means any \n        animal that is not a domestic animal or farm animal, that is \n        native to a foreign country or of foreign origin or character, \n        is not native to the United States, or was introduced from \n        abroad, whether wild-born or captive-bred, and any hybrid of \n        such an animal, including hybrid crosses with a domestic animal \n        or farm animal, including but not limited to animals such as--\n                    ``(i) cetartiodactyla (excepting alpacas, bison, \n                cattle, deer, elk, goats, llamas, reindeer, swine, and \n                sheep);\n                    ``(ii) felidae (excepting domestic cats);\n                    ``(iii) marsupialia;\n                    ``(iv) nonhuman primates;\n                    ``(v) perissodactyla (excepting horses, donkeys, \n                and mules);\n                    ``(vi) pinnipedia;\n                    ``(vii) proboscidea;\n                    ``(viii) ratites (excepting ostriches, emus, and \n                rheas); and\n                    ``(ix) ursidae.\n            ``(E) Farm animal.--The term `farm animal' means any \n        domestic species of alpacas, cattle, sheep, swine, goats, \n        llamas, poultry, or horses, which are normally and have \n        historically, been kept and raised on farms in the United \n        States, and used or intended for use as food or fiber, or for \n        improving animal nutrition, breeding, management, or production \n        efficiency, or for improving the quality of food or fiber.
