FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) for fiscal year 1965, 5.7 percent of the Federal budget \n        was expended for nondefense research and development \n        activities;\n            (2) for fiscal year 1997, the percentage of the Federal \n        budget allocated for nondefense research and development \n        activities is 1.9 percent, which is 67 percent less than the \n        percentage in fiscal year 1965;\n            (3) for the first time in 25 years during the period \n        beginning with fiscal year 1992 and ending with fiscal year \n        1995, the amount of funds expended by the Federal Government on \n        research (expressed in real dollars) declined each year;\n            (4) during the period beginning with fiscal year 1970, and \n        ending with fiscal year 1995, the United States had not, during \n        any fiscal year, expended an amount for nondefense research and \n        development activities, that, expressed as a percentage of the \n        Gross Domestic Product, was greater than or equal to the \n        percentage expended by Japan or Germany for that fiscal year; \n        and\n            (5) an increased level of investment in basic science and \n        medical research by the Federal Government is essential to \n        maintaining the position of the United States as the \n        technological leader of the world.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To double the annual authorized amount of Federal \n        funding for basic science and medical research over the 10-year \n        period following the date of enactment of this Act, so that the \n        amount of Federal funding for fiscal year 2007 is equal to \n        $65,000,000,000.\n            (2) To restore the high priority that science and \n        technology had previously been afforded in the Federal budget.\n            (3) To invest in the future of the United States and the \n        people of the United States by expanding the research \n        activities referred to in paragraph (1).\n            (4) To enhance the quality of life for all the people of \n        the United States.\n            (5) To guarantee the leadership of the United States in \n        science and medicine.\n\nSEC. 3.
