FINDINGS.\n\n    ``The Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Having access and being able to effectively use new \n        technologies, such as computers and the Internet, will be \n        critical to the economic and overall success of American \n        businesses, communities, and individuals in the 21st century.\n            ``(2) It is estimated that every 3 out of 5 jobs created \n        during the next 5 years will have relatively high skills \n        requirements.\n            ``(3) The information technology industry indicates that it \n        will be unable to fill more than 800,000 this year.\n            ``(4) The E-Rate program has connected 95 percent of all \n        public schools to the Internet.\n            ``(5) A digital divide exists and has grown and for the \n        poorest Americans has grown by 29 percent since 1997.\n            ``(6) White families are more than twice as likely to have \n        access to a computer and the Internet than Black and Hispanic \n        families.\n            ``(7) 4 to 5 students per computer is the ratio that many \n        experts consider to represent a reasonable level for the \n        effective use of computers within schools. The national average \n        student to computer ratio is 6 to 1. In schools with the \n        highest concentrations of poverty, the average student to \n        computer ratio is 16 to 1.\n            ``(8) According to a number of experts, a baseline model \n        for Internet connection that provides students and teachers \n        with the ability to fully engage in telecommunications \n        opportunities would cost between $9,350,000,000 to \n        $22,050,000,000 with an additional annual cost of \n        $1,750,000,000 to $4,600,000,000.\n\n``SEC. 3602.
