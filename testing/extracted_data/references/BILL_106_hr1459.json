FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) since 1982 the Occupational Safety and Health \n        Administration has conducted voluntary protection programs \n        designed to recognize excellence in occupational safety and \n        health;\n            (2) Such programs have fostered partnerships between \n        employers, employees and the Occupational Safety and Health \n        Administration to improve workplace safety and health through \n        the implementation of effective safety and health programs;\n            (3) employers participating in such programs provide their \n        employees with a level of protection that substantially exceeds \n        the level of protection provided by compliance with the \n        requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970; \n        and\n            (4) as a result of these efforts, employers participating \n        in such programs have experienced injury and illness rates that \n        are on average less than half of their respective industry \n        averages, sparing thousands of America's working families \n        needless workplace tragedies.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) recognize the exemplary leadership of voluntary \n        protection programs participants in improving occupational \n        safety and health at workplaces;\n            (2) encourage other employers to adopt such approaches to \n        protect their workers; and\n            (3) to codify such programs to ensure that the Occupational \n        Safety and Health Administration continues to develop them in \n        the future.\n\nSEC. 3.

The Secretary shall encourage the participants in the \nprograms to share occupational safety and health expertise with other \nemployers. The Secretary shall also encourage the participation of \nsmall business (as that term is defined by the Administrator of the \nSmall Business Administration) in the programs by implementing outreach \nand assistance initiatives in cooperation with program participants and \nshall develop program requirements that address the needs of small \nbusinesses. The Secretary may provide for the development of equivalent \nprograms in State plan States.\n    (b) Program Requirements.--A program shall include the following:\n            (1) Application.--Applications for participation in the \n        programs must be signed by the worksite's management and to \n        demonstrate sufficient employee support.

Requirements for excellence shall \n        include demonstrations of exemplary comprehensive programs to \n        assure--\n                    (A) top level management leadership and active and \n                meaningful employee involvement;\n                    (B) systematic assessment of hazards;\n                    (C) comprehensive hazard prevention, mitigation, \n                and control programs;\n                    (D) employee safety and health training; and\n                    (E) safety and health program evaluation.\n            (2) Onsite evaluations.--There shall be onsite evaluations \n        of each permanent worksite by representatives of the Secretary \n        and others from the private and public sector as determined by \n        the Secretary.\n            (3) Information.--Employers who are approved by the \n        Secretary for participation in a program shall assure the \n        Secretary that such information as is necessary to evaluate the \n        employer's application and continued participation in the \n        program is made available to the Secretary.\n            (4) Reevaluations.--Periodic reevaluations by the Secretary \n        shall be required for continued participation in a program.\n    (c) Program Administration.--\n            (1) Exemptions.--A worksite which has been selected to \n        participate in a program shall, while participating in the \n        program, be exempt from inspections or investigations under the \n        Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, except that the \n        exemption shall not apply to inspections or investigations \n        arising from employee complaints, fatalities, catastrophes, or \n        significant toxic releases.\n            (2) Program acceptance and continued participation.--\n        Decisions regarding acceptance into the program and continued \n        participation in the program will be based on the applicant's \n        superior safety and health performance, as determined by the \n        Secretary or the Secretary's authorized representatives.\n            (3) Program participation.--Decisions regarding \n        participation in a program are in the sole discretion of the \n        Secretary or an authorized representative of the Secretary."
