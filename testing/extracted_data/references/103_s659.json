    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Radio Free Asia Act of 1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is the policy of the United States to promote the \n        right of all people, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of \n        Human Rights, to ``seek, receive and impart information and \n        ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers'';\n            (2) pursuant to this policy, the United States has for \n        decades actively supported the dissemination of accurate \n        information and the promotion of democratic ideals among the \n        peoples of nations throughout the world;\n            (3) prominent in the implementation of this policy has been \n        United States support for the Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, \n        and Radio Marti, which have broadcast accurate and timely \n        information to the oppressed people of Eastern Europe, the \n        former Soviet Union, and Cuba, respectively, about events in \n        those countries;\n            (4) the introduction of similar radio broadcasting to the \n        People's Republic of China, a country where all media remain \n        under strict government control, would sharply increase the \n        dissemination among China's citizens of accurate information \n        and ideas relating to developments within China itself;\n            (5) the establishment of similar broadcasting to the other \n        totalitarian states of Asia would also increase the \n        dissemination of news and information to the people of those \n        countries; and\n            (6) such broadcasting to the totalitarian nations of Asia, \n        conducted in accordance with the highest professional \n        standards, would serve the goals of United States foreign \n        policy by promoting freedom in those nations and would bring \n        closer the day when all the world's major powers are \n        cooperating democracies.\n\nSEC. 3.
