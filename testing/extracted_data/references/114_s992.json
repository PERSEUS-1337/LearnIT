FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the use of firearms and archery equipment for target \n        practice and marksmanship training activities on Federal land \n        is allowed, except to the extent specific portions of that land \n        have been closed to those activities;\n            (2) in recent years preceding the date of enactment of this \n        Act, portions of Federal land have been closed to target \n        practice and marksmanship training for many reasons;\n            (3) the availability of public target ranges on non-Federal \n        land has been declining for a variety of reasons, including \n        continued population growth and development near former ranges;\n            (4) providing opportunities for target practice and \n        marksmanship training at public target ranges on Federal and \n        non-Federal land can help--\n                    (A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, recreational, \n                and hunting activities; and\n                    (B) to ensure safe and convenient locations for \n                those activities;\n            (5) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment of this \n        Act, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act \n        (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support for \n        construction and expansion of public target ranges by making \n        available to States amounts that may be used for construction, \n        operation, and maintenance of public target ranges; and\n            (6) it is in the public interest to provide increased \n        Federal support to facilitate the construction or expansion of \n        public target ranges.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate the \nconstruction and expansion of public target ranges, including ranges on \nFederal land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC TARGET RANGE.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``public target range'' means a specific \nlocation that--\n            (1) is identified by a governmental agency for recreational \n        shooting;\n            (2) is open to the public;\n            (3) may be supervised; and\n            (4) may accommodate archery or rifle, pistol, or shotgun \n        shooting.\n\nSEC. 4.
