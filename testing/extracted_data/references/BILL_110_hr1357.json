UNITED STATES PENSION PLANS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States and the international community face \n        no greater threat to their security than the prospect of rogue \n        regimes who support international terrorism obtaining weapons \n        of mass destruction, and particularly nuclear weapons.\n            (2) Iran is the leading state sponsor of international \n        terrorism and is close to achieving nuclear weapons capability \n        but has paid no price for nearly 20 years of deception over its \n        nuclear program. Foreign entities that have invested in Iran's \n        energy sector, despite Iran's support of international \n        terrorism and its nuclear program, have afforded Iran a free \n        pass while many United States entities have unknowingly \n        invested in those same foreign entities.\n            (3) United States investors have a great deal at stake in \n        preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n            (4) United States investors can have considerable influence \n        over the commercial decisions of the foreign entities in which \n        they have invested.\n    (b) Publication in Federal Register.--Not later than six months \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act and every six months \nthereafter, the President shall ensure publication in the Federal \nRegister of a list of all United States and foreign entities that have \ninvested more than $20,000,000 in Iran's energy sector between August \n5, 1996, and the date of such publication.

Such \n        notification shall contain the following information:\n                    (A) The name or other identification of the entity.\n                    (B) The amount of the investment in the entity.\n                    (C) The potential liability to the entity if \n                sanctions are imposed by the United States on Iran or \n                on the entity.\n                    (D) The potential liability to investors if such \n                sanctions are imposed.\n                    (E) The measures being undertaken by the managers \n                to divest from such investments.\n            (2) Follow-up notification.--\n                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph \n                (C), in addition to the notification required under \n                paragraph (1), such managers shall also include such \n                notification in every prospectus and in every regularly \n                provided quarterly, semi-annual, or annual report \n                provided to investors, if the funds of such investors \n                are invested in an entity included on the list.\n                    (B) Contents of notification.--The notification \n                described in subparagraph (A) shall be displayed \n                prominently in any such prospectus or report and shall \n                contain the information described in paragraph (1).\n                    (C) Good-faith exception.--If, upon publication of \n                a list in the relevant Federal Register under \n                subsection (b), such managers verifiably divest all \n                investments of such plans or funds in any entity \n                included on the list and such managers do not initiate \n                any new investment in any other such entity, such \n                managers shall not be required to include the \n                notification described in subparagraph (A) in any \n                prospectus or report provided to investors.\n    (d) Divestiture From Iran.--Upon notification under subsection (c), \nmanagers of United States Government pension plans or thrift savings \nplans, shall take, to the extent consistent with the legal and \nfiduciary duties otherwise imposed on them, immediate steps to divest \nall investments of such plans or funds in any entity included on the \nlist.\n    (e) Sense of Congress Relating to Further Divestiture From Iran.--\nIt is the sense of Congress that upon publication of a list in the \nrelevant Federal Register under subsection (b), managers of pension \nplans maintained in the private sector by plan sponsors in the United \nStates and managers of mutual funds sold or distributed in the United \nStates should take immediate steps to divest all investments of such \nplans or funds in any entity included on the list.\n    (f) Prohibition on Future Investment.--Upon publication of a list \nin the relevant Federal Register under subsection (b), there shall be, \nto the extent consistent with the legal and fiduciary duties otherwise \nimposed on them, no future investment in any entity included on the \nlist by managers of United States Government pension plans or thrift \nsavings plans, managers of pension plans maintained in the private \nsector by plan sponsors in the United States, or managers of mutual \nfunds sold or distributed in the United States.\n\nSEC. 2.
