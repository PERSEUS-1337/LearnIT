FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress hereby finds that--\n            (1) public confidence in the old-age, survivors, and \n        disability insurance program under the Social Security Act has \n        been undermined by the nature of the political debate which \n        attends the major decisions affecting the program; and\n            (2) that the treatment of the old-age, survivors, and \n        disability insurance program under the Social Security Act as a \n        political issue is of grave concern to--\n                    (A) working Americans who bear the ever-increasing \n                social security tax burden and have growing doubts \n                about the program's stability; and\n                    (B) young Americans, who object to the social \n                security tax altogether because they do not believe it \n                will survive long enough for them to derive any \n                benefits from it.\n    (b) Additional Findings.--Congress further finds that--\n            (1) under current projections through the year 2025, \n        surplus income for the old-age, survivors, and disability \n        insurance program will grow to an amount equal to two years of \n        outlays by the year 2000, and to an amount equal to three and \n        one-third years of outlays by 2015;\n            (2) at the current rate of social security outlays, a \n        reserve of three and one-third years would total over \n        $1,000,000,000,000;\n            (3) a reserve in that amount would be unnecessary, and \n        would be viewed by both the Congress and the American people as \n        excessive taxation.\n    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to permanently ensure the viability and certainty of \n        the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program;\n            (2) to guarantee that social security taxes be no more than \n        necessary to meet the program's current obligations, plus an \n        appropriate reserve.\n\nSEC. 3.
