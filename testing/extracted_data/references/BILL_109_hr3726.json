FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The effect of the intrastate production, \n        transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and \n        possession of child pornography on interstate market in child \n        pornography.\n                    (A) The illegal production, transportation, \n                distribution, receipt, advertising and possession of \n                child pornography, as defined in section 2256(8) of \n                title 18, United States Code, as well as the transfer \n                of custody of children for the production of child \n                pornography, is harmful to the physiological, \n                emotional, and mental health of the children depicted \n                in child pornography and has a substantial and \n                detrimental effect on society as a whole.\n                    (B) A substantial interstate market in child \n                pornography exists, including not only a multimillion \n                dollar industry, but also a nationwide network of \n                individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit \n                children and to traffic in child pornography. Many of \n                these individuals distribute child pornography with the \n                expectation of receiving other child pornography in \n                return.\n                    (C) The interstate market in child pornography is \n                carried on to a substantial extent through the mails \n                and other instrumentalities of interstate and foreign \n                commerce, such as the Internet. The advent of the \n                Internet has greatly increased the ease of \n                transporting, distributing, receiving, and advertising \n                child pornography in interstate commerce. The advent of \n                digital cameras and digital video cameras, as well as \n                videotape cameras, has greatly increased the ease of \n                producing child pornography. The advent of inexpensive \n                computer equipment with the capacity to store large \n                numbers of digital images of child pornography has \n                greatly increased the ease of possessing child \n                pornography. Taken together, these technological \n                advances have had the unfortunate result of greatly \n                increasing the interstate market in child pornography.\n                    (D) Intrastate incidents of production, \n                transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and \n                possession of child pornography, as well as the \n                transfer of custody of children for the production of \n                child pornography, have a substantial and direct effect \n                upon interstate commerce because:\n                            (i) Some persons engaged in the production, \n                        transportation, distribution, receipt, \n                        advertising, and possession of child \n                        pornography conduct such activities entirely \n                        within the boundaries of one State. These \n                        persons are unlikely to be content with the \n                        amount of child pornography they produce, \n                        transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or \n                        possess. These persons are therefore likely to \n                        enter the interstate market in child \n                        pornography in search of additional child \n                        pornography, thereby stimulating demand in the \n                        interstate market in child pornography.\n                            (ii) When the persons described in \n                        subparagraph (D)(i) enter the interstate market \n                        in search of additional child pornography, they \n                        are likely to distribute the child pornography \n                        they already produce, transport, distribute, \n                        receive, advertise, or possess to persons who \n                        will distribute additional child pornography to \n                        them, thereby stimulating supply in the \n                        interstate market in child pornography.\n                            (iii) Much of the child pornography that \n                        supplies the interstate market in child \n                        pornography is produced entirely within the \n                        boundaries of one State, is not traceable, and \n                        enters the interstate market surreptitiously. \n                        This child pornography supports demand in the \n                        interstate market in child pornography and is \n                        essential to its existence.\n                    (E) Prohibiting the intrastate production, \n                transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and \n                possession of child pornography, as well as the \n                intrastate transfer of custody of children for the \n                production of child pornography, will cause some \n                persons engaged in such intrastate activities to cease \n                all such activities, thereby reducing both supply and \n                demand in the interstate market for child pornography.\n                    (F) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of \n                the production, transportation, distribution, receipt, \n                advertising, and possession of child pornography, as \n                well as the intrastate transfer of children for the \n                production of child pornography, is essential to the \n                effective control of the interstate market in child \n                pornography.\n            (2) The importance of protecting children from repeat \n        exploitation in child pornography:\n                    (A) The vast majority of child pornography \n                prosecutions today involve images contained on computer \n                hard drives, computer disks, and related media.\n                    (B) Child pornography is not entitled to protection \n                under the First Amendment and thus may be prohibited.\n                    (C) The Government has a compelling State interest \n                in protecting children from those who sexually exploit \n                them, and this interest extends to stamping out the \n                vice of child pornography at all levels in the \n                distribution chain.\n                    (D) Every instance of viewing images of child \n                pornography represents a renewed violation of the \n                privacy of the victims and a repetition of their abuse.\n                    (E) Child pornography constitutes prima facie \n                contraband, and as such should not be distributed to, \n                or copied by, child pornography defendants or their \n                attorneys.\n                    (F) It is imperative to prohibit the reproduction \n                of child pornography in criminal cases so as to avoid \n                repeated violation and abuse of victims, so long as the \n                Government makes reasonable accommodations for the \n                inspection, viewing, and examination of such material \n                for the purposes of mounting a criminal defense.\n\nSEC. 3. STRENGTHENING SECTION 2257 TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT \n              EXPLOITED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PORNOGRAPHY.\n\n    Section 2257 of title 18 of the United States Code is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(l), by striking ``actual'';\n            (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``actual'';\n            (3) in subsection (f)(4)(A), by striking ``actual'';\n            (4) by amending paragraph (1) of subsection (h) to read as \n        follows:\n            ``(1) the term `sexually explicit conduct' has the meaning \n        set forth in subparagraphs (A)(i) through (v) of paragraph (2) \n        of section 2256 of this title;'';\n            (5) in subsection (h)(4), by striking ``actual.'';\n            (6) in subsection (f)--\n                    (A) at the end of paragraph (3), by striking \n                ``and'';\n                    (B) at the end of paragraph (4)(B), by striking the \n                period and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by inserting after paragraph (4)(B) the \n                following new paragraph:\n            ``(5) for any person to whom subsection (a) applies to \n        refuse to permit the Attorney General or his or her delegee to \n        conduct an inspection under subsection (c).''.\n            (7) in subsection (h)(3), by striking ``to produce, \n        manufacture, or publish any book, magazine, periodical, film, \n        video tape, computer generated image, digital image, or \n        picture, or other similar matter and includes the duplication, \n        reproduction, or reissuing of any such matter, but does not \n        include mere distribution or any other activity which does not \n        involve hiring, contracting for managing or otherwise arranging \n        for the participation of the performers depicted'' and \n        inserting ``actually filming, videotaping, photographing; \n        creating a picture, digital image, or digitally- or computer-\n        manipulated image of an actual human being; or digitizing an \n        image, of a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct; or, \n        assembling, manufacturing, publishing, duplicating, \n        reproducing, or reissuing a book, magazine, periodical, film, \n        videotape, digital image, or picture, or other matter intended \n        for commercial distribution, that contains a visual depiction \n        of sexually explicit conduct; or, inserting on a computer site \n        or service a digital image of, or otherwise managing the \n        sexually explicit content, of a computer site or service that \n        contains a visual depiction of, sexually explicit conduct'';\n            (8) in subsection (a), by inserting after ``videotape,'' \n        the following: ``digital image, digitally- or computer-\n        manipulated image of an actual human being, or picture,''; and\n            (9) in subsection (f)(4), by inserting after ``video'' the \n        following: ``digital image, digitally- or computer-manipulated \n        image of an actual human being, or picture,''.\n\nSEC. 4.
