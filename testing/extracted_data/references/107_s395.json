PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure that the Office has the statutory \n        independence and adequate financial resources to advocate for \n        and on behalf of small business concerns;\n            (2) to require that the Office report to the Chairmen and \n        Ranking Members of the Committees on Small Business of the \n        Senate and the House of Representatives and the Administrator \n        of the Small Business Administration in order to keep them \n        fully and currently informed about issues and regulations \n        affecting small business concerns and the necessity for \n        corrective action by the regulatory agency or the Congress;\n            (3) to provide a separate authorization for appropriations \n        for the Office;\n            (4) to authorize the Office to report to the President and \n        to the Congress regarding agency compliance with chapter 6 of \n        title 5, United States Code; and\n            (5) to enhance the role of the Office pursuant to chapter 6 \n        of title 5, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 4.
