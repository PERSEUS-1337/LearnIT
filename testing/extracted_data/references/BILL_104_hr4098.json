FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the provision of culturally sensitive curricula for \n        higher education programs at Haskell Indian Nations University \n        is consistent with the commitment of the Federal Government to \n        the fulfillment of treaty obligations to Indian tribes through \n        the principle of self-determination and the use of Federal \n        resources; and\n            (2) giving a greater degree of autonomy to Haskell Indian \n        Nations University, while maintaining it as an integral part of \n        the Bureau of Indian Affairs, will facilitate the transition of \n        the university to a 4-year university.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) University.--The term ``Haskell Indian Nations \n        University'' or ``university'' means the Haskell Indian Nations \n        University, located in Lawrence, Kansas.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 4.
