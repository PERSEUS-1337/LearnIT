    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Department of State Rewards Program \nUpdate and Technical Corrections Act of 2012''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of State's existing rewards programs \n        permit the payment of reward for information leading to the \n        arrest or conviction of--\n                    (A) individuals who have committed, or attempted or \n                conspired to commit, certain acts of international \n                terrorism;\n                    (B) individuals who have committed, or attempted or \n                conspired to commit, certain narcotics-related \n                offenses; and\n                    (C) individuals who have been indicted by certain \n                international criminal tribunals.\n            (2) The Department of State considers the rewards program \n        to be ``one of the most valuable assets the U.S. Government has \n        in the fight against international terrorism.''. Since the \n        program's inception in 1984, the United States has rewarded \n        over 60 people who provided actionable information that, \n        according to the Department of State, prevented international \n        terrorist attacks or helped convict individuals involved in \n        terrorist attacks.\n            (3) The program has been credited with providing \n        information in several high-profile cases, including the arrest \n        of Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted in the 1993 bombing of the \n        World Trade Center, the deaths of Uday and Qusay Hussein, who \n        United States military forces located and killed in Iraq after \n        receiving information about their locations, and the arrests or \n        deaths of several members of the Abu Sayyaf group, believed to \n        be responsible for the kidnappings and deaths of Americans and \n        Filipinos in the Philippines.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nrewards program of the Department of State should be expanded in order \nto--\n            (1) address the growing threat to important United States \n        interests from transnational criminal activity, such as \n        intellectual property rights piracy, money laundering, \n        trafficking in persons, arms trafficking, and cybercrime; and\n            (2) target other individuals indicted by international, \n        hybrid, or mixed tribunals for genocide, war crimes, or crimes \n        against humanity.\n\nSEC. 3. ENHANCED REWARDS AUTHORITY.\n\n    Section 36 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 \n(22 U.S.C. 2708) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting ``serious violations \n        of international humanitarian law, transnational organized \n        crime,'' after ``international narcotics trafficking,'';\n            (2) in subsection (b)--\n                    (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by \n                striking ``Attorney General'' and inserting ``heads of \n                other relevant departments or agencies'';\n                    (B) in paragraphs (4) and (5), by striking \n                ``paragraph (1), (2), or (3)'' each place it appears \n                and inserting ``paragraph (1), (2), (3), (8), or (9)'';\n                    (C) in paragraph (6)--\n                            (i) by inserting ``or transnational \n                        organized crime group'' after ``terrorist \n                        organization''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``or'' at the end;\n                    (D) in paragraph (7)--\n                            (i) in the matter preceding subparagraph \n                        (A), by striking ``, including the use by the \n                        organization of illicit narcotics production or \n                        international narcotics trafficking'' and \n                        inserting ``or transnational organized crime \n                        group, including the use by such organization \n                        or group of illicit narcotics production or \n                        international narcotics trafficking'';\n                            (ii) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``or \n                        transnational organized crime'' after \n                        ``international terrorism''; and\n                            (iii) in subparagraph (B)--\n                                    (I) by inserting ``or transnational \n                                organized crime group'' after \n                                ``terrorist organization''; and\n                                    (II) by striking the period at the \n                                end and inserting a semicolon; and\n                    (E) by adding at the end the following new \n                paragraphs:\n            ``(8) the arrest or conviction in any country of any \n        individual for participating in, primarily outside the United \n        States, transnational organized crime;\n            ``(9) the arrest or conviction in any country of any \n        individual conspiring to participate in or attempting to \n        participate in transnational organized crime; or\n            ``(10) the arrest or conviction in any country, or the \n        transfer to or conviction by an international criminal tribunal \n        (including a hybrid or mixed tribunal), of any foreign national \n        accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide, as \n        defined under the statute of such tribunal.''; and\n            (3) in subsection (k)--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (5) and (6) as \n                paragraphs (7) and (8), respectively; and\n                    (B) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following \n                new paragraphs:\n            ``(5) Transnational organized crime.--The term \n        `transnational organized crime' means--\n                    ``(A) racketeering activity (as such term is \n                defined in section 1961 of title 18, United States \n                Code) that involves at least one jurisdiction outside \n                the United States; or\n                    ``(B) any other criminal offense punishable by a \n                term of imprisonment of at least four years under \n                Federal, State, or local law that involves at least one \n                jurisdiction outside the United States and that is \n                intended to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial \n                or other material benefit.\n            ``(6) Transnational organized crime group.--The term \n        `transnational organized crime group' means a group of persons \n        that includes one or more citizens of a foreign country, exists \n        for a period of time, and acts in concert with the aim of \n        engaging in transnational organized crime.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
