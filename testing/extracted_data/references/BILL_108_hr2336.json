FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Given the increased threat to American ideals in the \n        trying times in which we live, it is important to preserve and \n        defend our common heritage of freedom and civilization and to \n        ensure that future generations of Americans understand the \n        importance of traditional American history and the principles \n        of free government on which this Nation was founded in order to \n        provide the basic knowledge that is essential to full and \n        informed participation in civic life and to the larger vibrancy \n        of the American experiment in self-government, binding together \n        a diverse people into a single Nation with a common purposes.\n            (2) However, despite its importance, most of the Nation's \n        colleges and universities no longer require United States \n        history or systematic study of Western civilization and free \n        institutions as a prerequisite to graduation.\n            (3) In addition, too many of our Nation's elementary and \n        secondary history teachers lack the training necessary to \n        effectively teach these subjects--due largely to the inadequacy \n        of their teacher preparation.\n            (4) Distinguished historians and intellectuals fear that \n        without a common civic memory and a common understanding of the \n        remarkable individuals, events, and ideals that have shaped our \n        Nation and its free institutions, the people in the United \n        States risk losing much of what it means to be an American, as \n        well as the ability to fulfill the fundamental responsibilities \n        of citizens in a democracy.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purpose of this act is to promote and sustain \npost-secondary academic centers, institutes, and programs that offer \nundergraduate and graduate courses, support research, and develop \nteaching materials for the purpose of developing and imparting a \nknowledge of traditional American history, the American Founding, the \nhistory and nature of, and threats to, free institutions, or of the \nnature, history and achievements of Western Civilization, particularly \nfor--\n            (1) undergraduate students enrolled in teacher education \n        programs, or who may consider becoming school teachers, or who \n        wish to enhance their civic competence;\n            (2) elementary, middle, and high school teachers in need of \n        additional training in order to effectively teach in these \n        subject area; and\n            (3) graduate students and post-secondary faculty who wish \n        to teach about these subject areas with greater knowledge and \n        effectiveness.\n\nSEC. 3.
