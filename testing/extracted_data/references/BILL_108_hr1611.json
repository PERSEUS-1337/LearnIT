FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) High-quality teaching is essential to improving the \n        Nation's educational system.\n            (2) High teacher turnover rates severely hamper the ability \n        to create and maintain a high-quality teaching and learning \n        environment.\n            (3) Approximately one-third of the Nation's new teachers \n        leave the teaching profession during their first 3 years of \n        teaching, and almost one-half leave during their first 5 years \n        of teaching.\n            (4) Turnover is highest in low-income schools, where the \n        turnover rate is almost one-third higher than the corresponding \n        rate for all teachers in all schools.\n            (5) Teachers who have left the profession report that \n        better support for beginning teachers is among the 5 top policy \n        reforms that would help school systems retain more teachers.\n            (6) Teachers without mentoring programs have been shown to \n        leave the profession at a rate almost 70 percent higher than \n        those with mentoring programs.\n            (7) It is in the best interest of the United States to \n        ensure that all students have access to a high-quality \n        education through the promotion of mentoring programs that \n        assist in the development of highly qualified teachers, \n        particularly in low-income areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
