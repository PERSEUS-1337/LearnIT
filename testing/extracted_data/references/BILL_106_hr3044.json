SMALLER SCHOOLS.\n\n    Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 8001 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \npart:\n\n                       ``PART L--SMALLER SCHOOLS\n\n``SEC. 10995. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Since World War II, the conventional wisdom among \n        educators has been that larger schools are better and \n        accordingly the number of secondary schools in the United \n        States has declined by 70 percent, while average school size \n        has grown by 5 times. But over the past few years, educators \n        have begun to question the approach that bigger schools are \n        always better.\n            ``(2) The National Association of Secondary School \n        Principals (referred to in this section as the NAASP) recently \n        recommended that the high school of the 21st Century be ``much \n        more student-centered and above all much more personalized in \n        programs, support services and intellectual rigor.'' The NAASP \n        stated that students take more interest in school when they \n        experience a sense of belonging and that students benefit from \n        a more intimate setting in which their presence is more readily \n        and repeatedly acknowledged.\n            ``(3) The NAASP also warns that the ``bigness'' of high \n        schools shrouds many young people ``in a cloak of anonymity'' \n        and recommends that high schools should restructure the space \n        and time of high schools so that students are no longer \n        ``invisible and melt into their surroundings''. NAASP \n        recommends that high schools change their structure to limit \n        their enrollments to self-operating units of not more than 600 \n        students, either through constructing new buildings or through \n        creating ``school-within-school'' units. It also suggests \n        changing the relationship between teachers and students by \n        reducing the number of class changes students make each day and \n        allowing teachers to have more time with smaller numbers of \n        students.\n            ``(4) Research shows that larger school size tends to \n        stratify students into different tracks which are often based \n        on children's educational and social backgrounds. Larger \n        schools foster inequitable educational outcomes, where there \n        are great differences between the educational achievement of \n        students within the same school.\n            ``(5) Research shows that in smaller, more personalized, \n        and less bureaucratic schools, inequities between student \n        achievement are smaller and that students in smaller schools \n        perform better in the core subjects of reading, math, history, \n        and science and are more engaged in their courses. In addition, \n        smaller schools have higher attendance rates and higher \n        participation in school activities.\n            ``(6) Research shows that because achievement levels in \n        smaller schools are more equitably distributed, students who \n        come from more disadvantaged economic and educational \n        backgrounds show the greatest achievement gains in smaller \n        schools.\n\n``SEC. 10996. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary is authorized to provide flexible \nchallenge grants to local educational agencies to implement and \nadminister plans to create smaller schools.\n    ``(b) Consideration; Assurance; and Priority.--The Secretary, in \nawarding grants under this part to local educational agencies shall--\n            ``(1) consider the number of students served and the \n        number, location, and size of the schools which serve such \n        students; and\n            ``(2) assure, to the extent practicable, an equitable \n        distribution of assistance among urban and rural areas of the \n        United States and among urban and rural areas of a State.\n            ``(3) give priority to local educational agencies that \n        establish a target number for attendance at--\n                    ``(A) each high school of not more than 600 \n                students or create self-operating academic units within \n                a high school of not more than 600; and\n                    ``(B) each elementary school or middle school of \n                not more than 400 students.\n    ``(c) Limitation.--The Secretary may award not more than $2,000,000 \nto any local educational agency selected to receive a grant award under \nthis part.\n\n``SEC. 10997.
