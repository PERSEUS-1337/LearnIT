FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Individual incomes taxes amount to one of the greatest \n        annual expenses for many Americans.\n            (2) There is a great deal of uncertainty on the part of \n        taxpayers concerning where and how their income tax dollars are \n        spent.\n            (3) Taxpayers do not receive any acknowledgment of payment \n        from the Internal Revenue Service nor any explanation itemizing \n        how their tax payments are spent.\n            (4) There presently exists no straightforward way for a \n        taxpayer to determine exactly how much he or she paid for \n        specific governmental activities.\n            (5) The failure to provide taxpayers with an itemized \n        listing showing how their tax dollars are spent contributes to \n        a lack of knowledge about the Government and subsequently to a \n        less informed electorate.\n            (6) The Internal Revenue Service must update its technology \n        and treat taxpayer information as a strategic asset to improve \n        customer service.\n            (7) Taxpayer education by the Internal Revenue Service \n        aimed at showing taxpayers how their tax dollars are spent \n        leads to increased compliance.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To educate individual income tax filers about how much \n        they contribute annually, in actual dollars and cents, to \n        various governmental programs, projects, and activities.\n            (2) To improve the public's understanding of the Federal \n        Government.\n            (3) To enhance the public's level of satisfaction with the \n        Internal Revenue Service.\n\nSEC. 3.
