POTENTIAL PROBLEM OFFICER EARLY WARNING PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Declarations.--The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) police brutality is a problem of deep concern; and\n            (2) the Congress has an interest in assisting local units \n        in creating early warning systems that are effective, \n        resilient, and affordable to the local units.\n    (b) Definition.--In this Act, ``potential problem officer early \nwarning program'' means a system of procedures that is designed to--\n            (1) identify police officers who have been the subject of \n        an excessive number of legitimate complaints of excessive use \n        of force by members of the public or have otherwise \n        demonstrated the potentiality of having difficulty dealing \n        appropriately with members of the public;\n            (2) provide assistance to such officers in avoiding such \n        difficulty in the future, including the provision of training \n        in communication techniques, conflict resolution, and stress \n        management; and\n            (3) apply discipline where appropriate.\n    (c) Evaluation and Report.--\n            (1) Evaluation.--The Attorney General, acting through the \n        Director of the National Institute of Justice, shall--\n                    (A) conduct an evaluation of potential problem \n                officer early warning programs that are being or have \n                been utilized by units of local government, including \n                analyses of--\n                            (i) the effect on such programs of factors \n                        such as the population and geographic size and \n                        characteristics of a jurisdiction and the \n                        ability of such programs to adjust in a \n                        resilient manner to changes in such factors;\n                            (ii) the potential savings that local \n                        governments can realize from the operation of \n                        such programs as a result of the reduction in \n                        the number of citizen complaints, the reduction \n                        in the number of occasions in which it is \n                        necessary to change the duty assignments of or \n                        to dismiss (and replace) problem officers, and \n                        other beneficial effects;\n                            (iii) the positive and negative effects \n                        that such programs may have on the law \n                        enforcement system, such as their effect on \n                        police morale and the ability of police \n                        officers to perform their law enforcement \n                        duties;\n                            (iv) the ability of such programs to ensure \n                        the exoneration of officers whose conduct is \n                        proper while identifying those whose conduct \n                        indicates the necessity or desirability of \n                        prophylactic action; and\n                            (v) the costs of establishing such programs \n                        and of operating and monitoring the \n                        effectiveness of such programs on a permanent \n                        basis;\n                    (B) develop a model early warning system that is \n                effective, capable of adjusting to changing \n                circumstances, and affordable to units (or combinations \n                of units) of local government of jurisdictions (or \n                combinations of jurisdictions) with populations of \n                50,000 or more; and\n                    (C) prepare and disseminate to the law enforcement \n                community, including Federal, State and local law \n                enforcement agencies, findings and recommendations made \n                as a result of the evaluation for the establishment of \n                such programs.\n            (2) Report.--On or before October 1, 1994, the Attorney \n        General shall submit to Congress a report addressing the \n        matters described in paragraph (1), with recommendations \n        concerning the need or appropriateness of further action by the \n        Federal Government.\n            (3) Expenses.--Expenses incurred in conducting the \n        evaluation and developing a model potential problem officer \n        early warning system under paragraph (1) shall be paid out of \n        funds that are available to the National Institute of Justice \n        and not specifically appropriated for other purposes, to the \n        extent that such funds can be made available without increasing \n        the amount of appropriations for the National Institute of \n        Justice for any fiscal year over the amount appropriated for \n        fiscal year 1993.\n    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Attorney General should, under existing authorities \n        and using appropriations available for those authorities and \n        funds otherwise available to the Attorney General, make seed \n        money grants of up to $25,000 each to units (or combinations of \n        units) of local government of jurisdictions (or combinations of \n        jurisdictions) of a population of 50,000 or more for the \n        purpose of assisting the police department (or other entity \n        that performs the functions of a police department) in \n        establishing a potential problem officer early warning program;\n            (2) a unit of local government should be eligible to \n        receive a grant described in subsection (c) if--\n                    (A) its police department (or other entity that \n                performs the functions of a police department) adopts \n                and enforces--\n                            (i) a written policy prohibiting the use of \n                        unreasonable or unnecessary physical force by \n                        law enforcement officers;

and\n                    (C) the grant recipient demonstrates a commitment \n                to the long-term continuance of the program and the \n                reduction of the incidence of police brutality;\n            (3) a policy described in paragraph (2)(A) should--\n                    (A) restrict the use of force to circumstances \n                authorized by law and to the degree minimally necessary \n                to accomplish a lawful law enforcement purpose;
