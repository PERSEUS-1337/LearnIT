FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) From September 2001 through November 2004, \n        approximately 410,000 members of the reserve components of the \n        Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserves, have \n        been mobilized in support of United States military operations.\n            (2) According to 2004 data from the Manpower Data Center of \n        the Department of Defense, an estimated 35 percent of Guard \n        members and Reservists are either self-employed or own or are \n        employed by a small business.\n            (3) The majority of privately employed National Guard and \n        Reserve members either work for a small business or are self-\n        employed.\n            (4) As a result of activations, many small businesses have \n        been forced to go without their owners and key personnel for \n        months, and sometimes years, on end.\n            (5) The effects have been devastating to such patriotic \n        small businesses.\n            (6) The Office of Veterans Business Development of the \n        Small Business Administration has made a concerted effort to \n        reach out to small businesses affected by deployments, but \n        given the sheer numbers of those deployed, their resources have \n        been stretched thin.\n            (7) In addition, the Office of Veterans Business \n        Development has been required to broaden its delivery of \n        services, as directed by Executive Order 13360, to provide \n        procurement training programs for service-disabled veterans.\n            (8) This Act will help to stem the effects of National \n        Guard and Reservist deployments on small businesses, and better \n        assist veterans and service-disabled veterans with their \n        business needs.\n\nSEC. 3.
