SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Sterling Forest Protection Act of \n1994''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was \n        established pursuant to a joint resolution of the 75th Congress \n        approved in 1937 (Public Resolution No. 65; ch. 706; 50 Stat. \n        719), and chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New \n        York and chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New \n        Jersey;\n            (2) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is responsible \n        for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York \n        and New Jersey, comprising over 82,000 acres;\n            (3) over 8 million visitors annually seek outdoor \n        recreational opportunities within the Palisades Park System;\n            (4) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse open space on \n        the New Jersey border comprising approximately 17,500 acres, \n        and is a highly significant watershed area for the State of New \n        Jersey, providing the source for clean drinking water for 25 \n        percent of the State;\n            (5) Sterling Forest is an important outdoor recreational \n        asset in the northeastern United States, within the most \n        densely populated metropolitan region in the Nation;\n            (6) Sterling Forest supports a mixture of hardwood forests, \n        wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys, is strategically located on \n        a wildlife migratory route, and provides important habitat for \n        27 rare or endangered species;\n            (7) the protection of Sterling Forest would greatly enhance \n        the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, a portion of which \n        passes through Sterling Forest, and would provide for enhanced \n        recreational opportunities through the protection of lands \n        which are an integral element of the trail and which would \n        protect important trail viewsheds;\n            (8) stewardship and management costs for units of the \n        Palisades Park System are paid for by the States of New York \n        and New Jersey; thus, the protection of Sterling Forest through \n        the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve a minimum \n        of Federal funds; and\n            (9) given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor \n        recreational, and wildlife qualities of Sterling Forest; the \n        demand for open space in the northeastern United States; the \n        lack of open space in the densely populated Tri-State region; \n        there is a clear Federal interest in acquiring the Sterling \n        Forest for permanent protection of the watershed, outdoor \n        recreational, flora and fauna, and open space; which is a cost \n        effective investment compared to the costs which would be \n        required to protect drinking water for the region should the \n        Sterling Forest be developed.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    Subject to the requirements of this Act, the purposes of this Act \nare--\n            (1) to establish the Sterling Forest Reserve in the State \n        of New York to protect the significant watershed, wildlife, and \n        recreational resources within the New York-New Jersey highlands \n        region;\n            (2) to authorize Federal funding, through the Department of \n        the Interior, for a portion of the acquisition costs for the \n        Sterling Forest Reserve;\n            (3) to direct the Palisades Interstate Park Commission to \n        convey to the Secretary of the Interior certain interests in \n        lands acquired within the Reserve; and\n            (4) to provide for the management of the Sterling Forest \n        Reserve by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act, the term--\n            (1) ``Commission'' means the Palisades Interstate Park \n        Commission established pursuant to Public Resolution No. 65 \n        approved August 19, 1937 (ch. 707; 50 Stat. 719);\n            (2) ``Reserve'' means the Sterling Forest Reserve; and\n            (3) ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STERLING FOREST RESERVE.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--Upon the certification by the Commission to the \nSecretary that the Commission has acquired sufficient lands or \ninterests therein to constitute a manageable unit, there is hereby \nestablished the Sterling Forest Reserve in the State of New York.\n    (b) Map.--(1) The Reserve shall consist of lands and interests \ntherein acquired by the Commission within the approximately 17,500 \nacres of lands as generally depicted on the map entitled ``Boundary \nMap, Sterling Forest Reserve, numbered SFR-60,001 and dated July 1, \n1994.\n    (2) The map referred to in paragraph (1) shall be on file and \navailable for public inspection in the offices of the Commission and \nthe appropriate offices of the National Park Service, Department of the \nInterior.\n    (c) Transfer of Funds.--Subject to the conditions set forth in \nsubsection (d), the Secretary shall transfer to the Commission such \nfunds as are appropriated for the acquisition of lands and interests \ntherein within the Reserve.\n    (d) Conditions of Funding.--(1) Prior to the receipt of any Federal \nfunds authorized by this Act, the Commission shall agree to the \nfollowing terms and conditions:\n            (A) If the Commission fails to manage the lands acquired \n        within the Reserve in a manner consistent with this Act, the \n        Commission shall convey fee title to such lands to the United \n        States. Such agreement to convey to the United States shall be \n        recorded at the time of purchase.\n            (B) No lands or interests therein may be acquired with any \n        Federal funds authorized or transferred pursuant to this Act \n        except with the consent of the owner thereof.\n            (C) If the Commission is unable to acquire all of the lands \n        within the Reserve, to the extent Federal funds are utilized \n        pursuant to this Act, the Commission shall acquire all or a \n        portion of the lands identified as ``National Park Service \n        Wilderness Easement Lands'' and ``National Park Service \n        Conservation Easement Lands'' on the map referred to in section \n        5(b) before proceeding with the acquisition of any other lands \n        within the Reserve.\n            (D) Within 30 days after acquiring the lands identified as \n        ``National Park Service Wilderness Easement Lands'' and \n        ``National Park Service Conservation Easement Lands'' on the \n        map referred to in section 5(b), the Commission shall convey to \n        the United States the following:\n                    (i) Conservation easement(s) on those lands \n                described as ``National Park Service Wilderness \n                Easement Lands'' on the map referred to in section \n                5(b). Such easement(s) shall provide that the lands \n                shall be managed to protect their wilderness character.\n                    (ii) Conservation easement(s) on those lands \n                described as ``National Park Service Conservation \n                Easement Lands'' on the map referred to in section \n                5(b). Such easement(s) shall restrict and limit \n                development and use of the property to that compatible \n                with the protection of the Appalachian National Scenic \n                Trail. Any such development and use shall be consistent \n                with the general management plan prepared pursuant to \n                section 6(b).\n    (2) Funds may be transferred to the Commission only to the extent \nthat they are matched from funds contributed by non-Federal sources.\n\nSEC. 6.
