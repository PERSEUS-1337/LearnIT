FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) section 203(j) of the Federal Property and \n        Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(j)) \n        established a system to ensure the fair and equitable \n        allocation of Federal surplus personal property to eligible \n        recipients including law enforcement agencies, school systems, \n        medical institutions, libraries, homeless assistance providers, \n        and units of local government;\n            (2) the benefits of the Federal Personal Property \n        Utilization and Donation Program is measured in terms of \n        American taxpayer dollars not spent from budgets on new and \n        expensive property;\n            (3) Members of Congress and State and local officials all \n        have an obligation to oversee the fair and equitable \n        distribution of Government property, thereby ensuring \n        accountability to the American taxpayers;\n            (4) the owners of surplus Federal property are the American \n        people and the Federal Government is merely its public \n        custodian;\n            (5) the efforts of the State agencies in distributing \n        surplus property have enabled thousands of American taxpayers \n        to acquire items such as office equipment, clothing, furniture, \n        motor vehicles, forklifts, aircraft, boats and generators which \n        have been declared surplus to the needs of the Federal \n        Government;\n            (6) the effectiveness of the current system for donation of \n        surplus Federal personal property has been undermined by \n        programs which mandate that property is made available on a \n        priority basis to foreign entities before the safety, health, \n        education, and training needs of American taxpayers are met; \n        and\n            (7) new legislation is needed to move the priority for \n        property transfers through foreign assistance programs to a \n        level below that for domestic use transfers of excess personal \n        property to Federal agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIORITY TO STATES AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE TRANSFER OF \n              NONLETHAL EXCESS SUPPLIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n    Section 2547 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``The Secretary of \n        Defense'' and inserting ``Subject to subsection (d), the \n        Secretary of Defense'';\n            (2) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e); and\n            (3) by inserting after subsection (c), the following:\n    ``(d)(1) Nonlethal excess supplies of the Department of Defense \nshall be made available to a State or a local government of a State \nupon the request of the State or local government pursuant to authority \nprovided in another provision of law, before such supplies are made \navailable for humanitarian relief purposes under this section. The \nPresident may make such supplies available for humanitarian purposes \nbefore such supplies are made available to a State or local government \nunder this subsection in order to respond to an emergency precipitated \nby a natural disaster.''.\n    ``(2) In this subsection, the term `State' means a State of the \nUnited States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico, and any possession of the United States.''.\n\nSEC. 4. TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN FOREIGN \n              COUNTRIES.\n\n    Section 607 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n2357(d)) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (d)--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) \n                as subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), respectively;\n                    (B) by striking ``(d) The'' and inserting ``(d)(1) \n                Except as provided in paragraph (3), the''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end of the following:\n    ``(2) No property may be transferred under paragraph (1) unless the \nAdministrator of General Services determines that there is no Federal \nor State use requirements for the property under any other provision of \nlaw.'';\n        and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(e) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the transfer of \nconfiscated property to foreign countries.''.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT ON DISPOSAL AND DONATION SURPLUS PERSONAL PROPERTY.\n\n    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Administrator of General Services shall review all statutes \nrelating to the disposal and donation of surplus personal property and \nsubmit to Congress a report on such statutes including--\n            (1) the effectiveness of programs administered under such \n        statutes (except for any program that grants access to personal \n        property by local communities impacted by the closure of a \n        military base), and the amount and type of property \n        administered under each such program during fiscal years 1997 \n        and 1998; and\n            (2) legislative recommendations to integrate and \n        consolidate all such programs to be administered by a single \n        Federal authority working with State agencies while \n        accomplishing the purposes of such programs."
