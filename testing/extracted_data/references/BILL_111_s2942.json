NANOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n    Chapter X of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n391 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 1011. NANOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of the Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of \nAgriculture, shall establish within the Food and Drug Administration a \nprogram for the scientific investigation of nanoscale materials \nincluded or intended for inclusion in FDA-regulated products, to \naddress the potential toxicology of such materials, the effects of such \nmaterials on biological systems, and interaction of such materials with \nbiological systems.\n    ``(b) Program Purposes.--The purposes of the program established \nunder subsection (a) shall be to--\n            ``(1) assess scientific literature and data on general \n        nanoscale material interactions with biological systems and on \n        specific nanoscale materials of concern to Food and Drug \n        Administration;\n            ``(2) develop and organize information using databases and \n        models that will enable the formulation of generalized \n        principles for the behavior of classes of nanoscale materials \n        with biological systems;\n            ``(3) promote intramural Administration programs and \n        participate in collaborative efforts, to further the \n        understanding of the science of novel properties at the \n        nanoscale that might contribute to toxicity;\n            ``(4) promote and participate in collaborative efforts to \n        further the understanding of measurement and detection methods \n        for nanoscale materials;\n            ``(5) collect, synthesize, interpret, and disseminate \n        scientific information and data related to the interactions of \n        nanoscale materials with biological systems;\n            ``(6) build scientific expertise on nanoscale materials \n        within such Administration;\n            ``(7) ensure ongoing training, as well as dissemination of \n        new information within the centers of such Administration, and \n        more broadly across such Administration, to ensure timely, \n        informed consideration of the most current science;\n            ``(8) encourage such Administration to participate in \n        international and national consensus standards activities; and\n            ``(9) carry out other activities that the Secretary \n        determines are necessary and consistent with the purposes \n        described in paragraphs (1) through (8).\n    ``(c) Program Administration.--\n            ``(1) Program manager.--In carrying out the program under \n        this section, the Secretary shall designate a program manager \n        who shall supervise the planning, management, and coordination \n        of the program.\n            ``(2) Duties.--The program manager shall--\n                    ``(A) develop a detailed strategic plan for \n                achieving specific short- and long-term technical goals \n                for the program;\n                    ``(B) coordinate and integrate the strategic plan \n                with investments by the Food and Drug Administration \n                and other departments and agencies participating in the \n                National Nanotechnology Initiative; and\n                    ``(C) develop intramural Administration programs, \n                contracts, memoranda of agreement, joint funding \n                agreements, and other cooperative arrangements \n                necessary for meeting the long-term challenges and \n                achieving the specific technical goals of the program.\n    ``(d) Reports.--Not later than March 1, 2012, and March 1, 2014, \nthe Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \nand the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on \nAppropriations of the House of Representatives a report on the program \ncarried out under this section. Such report shall include--\n            ``(1) a review of the specific short- and long-term goals \n        of the program;\n            ``(2) an assessment of current and proposed funding levels \n        for the program, including an assessment of the adequacy of \n        such funding levels to support program activities; and\n            ``(3) a review of the coordination of activities under the \n        program with other departments and agencies participating in \n        the National Nanotechnology Initiative.\n    ``(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section, $25,000,000 for each of fiscal \nyears 2011 through 2015.
