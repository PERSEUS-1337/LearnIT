The Congress hereby finds and declares--\n            (a) that the estimated total number of handguns in private \n        hands has more than doubled since 1978, bringing the total to \n        sixty-six million;\n            (b) that handguns play a major role, and a role \n        disproportionate to their number in comparison with long guns, \n        in the commission of homicide, aggravated assault, and armed \n        robbery, and that the percentage of violent crimes in which \n        handguns are used is increasing;\n            (c) that more than one-half of all handguns are acquired \n        secondhand and that licensing and restrictions on sale of new \n        handguns will not significantly reduce handgun crime and \n        handgun violence;\n            (d) that with few exceptions handguns are not used for \n        sporting or recreational purposes and that such purposes do not \n        require keeping of handguns in private homes;\n            (e) that handguns in the home are of less value than is \n        commonly thought in defending against intruders and that such \n        defensive purposes can be adequately accomplished by other \n        means;\n            (f) that violent crimes perpetrated with handguns \n        constitute a burden upon and interfere with interstate and \n        foreign commerce and threaten the internal security and \n        domestic tranquillity of the Nation; and\n            (g) that a national firearms policy which restricts the \n        availability of handguns for nonlaw enforcement and nonmilitary \n        purposes will significantly reduce violent crime, reduce deaths \n        from handguns, and reduce other handgun violence in the United \n        States.\n    Sec. 2. Title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting \nimmediately after chapter 50 thereof the following new chapter:\n\n                        ``CHAPTER 50A.--HANDGUNS\n\n``Sec.\n``1091.
