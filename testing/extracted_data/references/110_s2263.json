    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Mine Communications Technology \nInnovation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The failure of miner tracking and communications \n        devices or lack thereof in mines severely hampers rescue \n        efforts in the event of emergencies.\n            (2) Mines, particularly underground mines, have properties \n        that present unique technical challenges for the integration of \n        currently available tracking and communications systems. These \n        properties include the lack of a clear path or open air which \n        is required for radio signals and WiFi. Additionally, because \n        coal is an absorptive material, less than 10 percent of the \n        radio spectrum that is used above ground can be used \n        underground. A fraction of that (only about 1 percent) radio \n        spectrum is actually allocated for commercial communications \n        purposes. As a consequence, the availability of miner \n        communication equipment is severely limited.\n            (3) Research and experience have shown that communications \n        and tracking systems may not work equally well in every mine or \n        in every emergency situation, and therefore several different \n        systems may be necessary for development and integration.\n            (4) Because of the serious challenges of the mine \n        environment and the limited market provided by the mining \n        industry, much needed technology has not yet been developed by \n        the private sector or is not commercially available in the \n        United States.\n            (5) Furthermore, due to the regulatory structure of the \n        industry and the lengthy approval process for mine tracking and \n        communications systems, research must be accelerated so that \n        next generation technology can be quickly and efficiently \n        integrated into mines to protect the safety of miners.\n            (6) The National Institute of Standards and Technology is \n        well positioned to help accelerate the development of mining \n        tracking and communications technology. The National Institute \n        of Standards and Technology has a long history of working in \n        conjunction with industry to invest in longer-term, high-risk \n        research which yields national benefits far beyond private \n        payoff. Further, the National Institute of Standards and \n        Technology builds partnerships with industry to leverage \n        existing research and development to drive next generation \n        technology.\n            (7) The National Institute of Standards and Technology is \n        well-positioned to accelerate development of consensus mining \n        communications standards given the extensive work that the \n        organization has done in the field of emergency communications \n        to develop standards and technologies for interoperable \n        wireless telecommunications and information systems.\n            (8) In developing such standards, the National Institute of \n        Standards and Technology should work in cooperation with the \n        National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the \n        Mine Safety and Health Administration, and other relevant \n        public and private stakeholders, to build on existing \n        technology and knowledge regarding mine communications systems.\n\nSEC. 3. MINE COMMUNICATIONS AND TRACKING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n              PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Director of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology shall provide for the establishment of a \nprogram of research, development, and demonstration that includes the \nestablishment of best practices, adaptation of existing technology, and \nefforts to accelerate the development of next generation technology and \ntracking systems for mine communications.\n    (b) Coordination.--In carrying out this section, the Director shall \ncoordinate with relevant Federal agencies and industry to evaluate \nareas of research and development and best practices that will be most \npromising in protecting miner safety.\n    (c) Optional Focus.--In establishing this program, the Director may \nfocus on the following communications and tracking system \ncharacteristics:\n            (1) Systems that are likely to work in emergency \n        situations.\n            (2) Systems that work in coal mines, with special attention \n        paid to deep underground coal mines.\n            (3) Systems that provide coverage throughout all areas of \n        the mine.\n            (4) Hybrid systems that use both wireless and \n        infrastructure based systems.\n            (5) Functionality for 2-way and voice communications.\n            (6) Systems that serve emergency and routine communications \n        needs.\n            (7) The ability to work with existing legacy systems and to \n        be quickly integrated.\n            (8) Propagation environment characterization, performance \n        metrics, and independently derived validation tests to verify \n        performance for standards development.\n\nSEC. 4. STANDARDS REGARDING UNDERGROUND COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n    Consistent with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119, the \nDirector of the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall \nwork with industry and relevant Federal agencies to develop consensus \nindustry standards for communications in underground mines. The \nDirector shall also develop and provide any needed measurement services \nto support implementation of these standards. In their efforts to help \ndevelop these standards and related measurement services, the following \nissues should be addressed:\n            (1) The appropriate use of frequency bands and power \n        levels.\n            (2) Matters related to interoperability of systems, \n        applications, and devices.\n            (3) Technology to prevent interference.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Director of the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology such sums as are \nnecessary for carrying out this Act for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, to \nbe derived from amounts authorized under section 3001 of the America \nCOMPETES Act."
