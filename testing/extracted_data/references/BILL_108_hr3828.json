FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) United States university nuclear science, engineering, \n        and health programs are in a state of serious decline. The \n        supply of bachelor degree nuclear science, engineering, and \n        health physics personnel in the United States is lower than the \n        number of jobs available, resulting in a shortage of these \n        critical professionals. The number of 4-year degree nuclear \n        engineering programs has declined 50 percent to approximately \n        25 programs nationwide. Over \\2/3\\ of the faculty in these \n        programs are 45 years or older and there are few tenure track \n        junior faculty positions available.\n            (2) Universities are finding it increasingly difficult to \n        fund the operational costs of their research and training \n        reactors. Since 1980, the number of small training reactors in \n        the United States has declined by over 50 percent to 27 \n        reactors. Most of these reactors were built in the late 1950's \n        and 1960's with 30- to 40-year operating licenses, and will \n        require relicensing in the next several years.\n            (3) The neglect in human investment and training \n        infrastructure is affecting 50 years of national research and \n        development investment. The decline in a competent nuclear \n        workforce, and the lack of adequately trained nuclear \n        scientists, engineers, and health physicists, will affect the \n        ability of the United States to solve future waste storage \n        issues, operate existing and design future fission reactors in \n        the United States, respond to future nuclear events worldwide, \n        help stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and design and \n        operate naval nuclear reactors.\n            (4) Future neglect in the Nation's investment in human \n        resources for the nuclear sciences will lead to a downward \n        spiral. As the number of nuclear science departments shrinks, \n        faculties age, and training reactors close, the appeal of \n        nuclear science will be lost to future generations of students.\n            (5) Current projections are that 50 percent of industry's \n        nuclear workforce can retire in 10 to 15 years, and 76 percent \n        of the nuclear workforce at our national labs can retire in the \n        next 5 years. A new supply of trained scientists and engineers \n        to replace this retiring workforce is urgently needed.\n            (6) The Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy, \n        Science, and Technology is well suited to help maintain \n        tomorrow's human resource and training investment in the \n        nuclear sciences. Through its support of research and \n        development pursuant to the Department's statutory authorities, \n        the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology is the \n        principal Federal agent for civilian research in the nuclear \n        sciences for the United States. The Office maintains the \n        Nuclear Engineering and Education Research Program which funds \n        basic nuclear science and engineering. The Office funds the \n        Nuclear Energy and Research Initiative which funds applied \n        collaborative research among universities, industry, and \n        national laboratories in the areas of proliferation-resistant \n        fuel cycles and future fission power systems. The Office funds \n        universities to refuel training reactors from highly enriched \n        to low-enriched proliferation-tolerant fuels, performs \n        instrumentation upgrades, and maintains a program of student \n        fellowships for nuclear science, engineering, and health \n        physics.\n\nSEC. 3.
