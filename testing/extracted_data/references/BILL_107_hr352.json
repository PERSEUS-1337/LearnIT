No disclosure of information pursuant to a \nconfidentiality agreement in a business or financial transaction shall \nbe considered to be an express written statement waiving the privileges \nunder this section.\n    (d) In Camera Hearing.--Whenever any person seeks to obtain any \ninformation described in subsection (a) from any other entity for use \nin any administrative or judicial proceeding, if such other entity \nrefuses to disclose the information on the basis of a privilege under \nsubsection (a), the person seeking disclosure may request an \nadministrative law judge (in the case of an administrative proceeding) \nor the court (in the case of any civil or criminal proceeding) to \nconvene an in camera proceeding to determine the application of the \nprivilege. The administrative law judge or the court shall initiate \nsuch a proceeding and require disclosure of such information to the \ncourt under seal for purposes of making such determination. In any such \nhearing, the entity asserting the privilege shall have the burden of \nasserting a prima facie basis for the privilege and the person seeking \ndisclosure shall have the burden of persuasion that the privilege \nshould not apply.\n    (e) Civil Proceedings.--The privilege under subsection (a) shall \nnot apply in any civil proceeding if the administrative law judge (in \nthe case of an administrative proceeding) or the court (in the case of \na judicial proceeding) determines, in an in camera proceeding under \nsubsection (d), that--\n            (1) the report, finding, opinion, or other document or \n        communication or testimony indicates noncompliance with an \n        environmental law by such entity, and such entity failed to \n        initiate efforts to achieve compliance with the law within a \n        reasonable period of time in a manner consistent with \n        applicable provisions of law;\n            (2) such entity is asserting the applicability of the \n        privilege under this section for a fraudulent purpose; or\n            (3) the report was prepared for the purpose of avoiding \n        disclosure of information required for a then pending or \n        imminent specific investigative, administrative, or judicial \n        proceeding of which the regulated entity had knowledge.\nWhenever an administrative law judge or a court has ruled under this \nsubsection that the privilege does or does not apply to any report, \nfinding, opinion, or other document or communication or testimony of \nany entity, such entity may appeal such ruling to the appropriate \nUnited States district court (in the case of an administrative law \njudge) or to the appropriate court of appeals (in the case of a ruling \nby a court) and such court shall review such ruling and issue a \ndecision on the appeal within 30 days after the filing of the appeal.\n    (f) Criminal Proceedings.--The privilege under subsection (a) shall \nnot apply in any criminal proceeding if the court, in an in camera \nhearing, makes any determination referred to in subsection (e). A law \nenforcement official, having probable cause (based upon information \nobtained from a source independent of a voluntary environmental self-\nevaluation report) to believe that a criminal offense has been \ncommitted under any of the covered environmental laws and that the \nreport constitutes evidence of such offense, may obtain the report \npursuant to a lawful search and seizure. However, upon taking \npossession of the report, the law enforcement official shall \nimmediately place it under seal and shall not review, disclose, or \notherwise use the contents of the report in any way, unless the person \nor entity for whom the report was prepared expressly waives its \nprotected status pursuant to subsection (c) or the court determines \nthat the report is subject to disclosure in an in camera hearing under \nsubsection (d). During any such hearing, the court shall permit the \nagency to review, but not to disclose or use the information for \npurposes of any investigation or proceeding.\n\nSEC. 4. IMMUNITY FOR CERTAIN VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Whenever any entity has disclosed to the Federal \nor State agency administering any environmental law information \nrelating to the violation by such entity of such environmental law as a \nresult of a voluntary environmental self-evaluation performed by such \nentity or an environmental compliance management system used by such \nentity, such entity and officers, employees, and agents of such entity \nshall be immune from prosecution in any Federal or State \nadministrative, civil, or criminal proceeding regarding such violation \n(other than a criminal proceeding for conduct involving specific intent \nto violate the law), and the information disclosed shall not be \nadmissible in any court or administrative proceeding, if--\n            (1) such entity (or officer, employee, or agent) ensures \n        that the disclosure is made promptly after receiving knowledge \n        of the information;\n            (2) such entity (or officer, employee, or agent) initiates \n        efforts to achieve compliance in a manner consistent with \n        applicable provisions of law;\n            (3) such entity (or officer, employee, or agent) is not \n        asserting the applicability of the immunity under this section \n        for a fraudulent purpose;\n            (4) such information is not disclosed for the purpose of \n        avoiding penalties in an investigative, administrative, or \n        judicial proceeding that, at the time of disclosure, was \n        imminent or in progress; and\n            (5) such entity (or officer, employee, or agent) discloses \n        such other information relating to the violation as the agency \n        concerned reasonably requests, other than information subject \n        to a nondisclosure privilege under section 3 or under any other \n        authority of law.\n    (b) Exclusions.--The immunity under subsection (a) shall not apply \nto an entity if the violation concerned is part of a pattern of \nsignificant violations (counting any multiday occurrence stemming from \nthe same cause as a single violation) that has occurred within the past \n3 years at the same facility or at different facilities under the \ncommon control of a regulated entity whose senior management had actual \nknowledge of the violations and failed to take timely corrective \naction. For purposes of this section, a violation is any violation of \nan environmental law identified in a judicial or administrative order, \nconsent agreement or order, conviction, or plea agreement.\n    (c) Procedure.--\n            (1) Presumption.--Whenever a regulated entity voluntarily \n        discloses to a Federal or State agency information relating to \n        the violation by such entity of an environmental law, if such \n        information was obtained as a result of a voluntary \n        environmental self-evaluation, or from an environmental \n        compliance management system, the entity shall be presumed to \n        be entitled to immunity under this section with respect to such \n        violation if the entity provides information supporting a claim \n        that the entity is qualified for such immunity at the time the \n        entity makes the disclosure. Such presumption shall be \n        conclusive unless challenged by the agency within 60 days of \n        the disclosure.\n            (2) Judicial determination.--An entity may request the \n        appropriate United States district court for a determination \n        regarding whether or not the immunity under subsection (a) is \n        applicable to such entity (or officer or employee or agent) \n        with respect to any violation.\n\nSEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n    (a) Authority To Issue Certain Orders.--Nothing in this Act shall \nbe construed to affect the authority of a Federal or State agency \nresponsible for administering an environmental law to issue a cease and \ndesist order or to seek a temporary restraining order or injunction for \nany violation of an environmental law.\n    (b) State Privileges and Immunities.--Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued to limit any privilege against disclosure in effect under \nState law. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit any immunity \navailable to any person under State law.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act shall take effect with respect to civil and criminal \nproceedings commenced after the enactment of this Act."
