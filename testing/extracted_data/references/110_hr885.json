FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since the United States Baruch Plan of 1946, the United \n        States has believed that an increase in the number of countries \n        that possess nuclear weapons and the means to create such \n        weapons makes the world less secure and stable by increasing \n        the chances that nuclear weapons would be used. A world in \n        which nuclear weapons are used again is less secure for all \n        concerned, and could well trigger a global arms race, as more \n        countries will be tempted to arm themselves with nuclear \n        weapons to prevent attacks by countries that possess nuclear \n        weapons.\n            (2) It is therefore in the general security interest of all \n        countries, and in the vital national security interest of the \n        United States, that the number of countries that possess a \n        nuclear weapons capability necessarily be kept to a minimum and \n        ultimately reduced.\n            (3) Uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing \n        facilities produce nuclear material that can either be used for \n        peaceful purposes in electricity-generating reactors, or can be \n        used to produce uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons. As \n        such, these facilities are inherently a proliferation risk, \n        allowing their possessor to be just months away from the \n        production of a nuclear explosive device.\n            (4) It is also therefore in the general security interest \n        of all countries that the number of countries that operate \n        uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities also \n        be kept to a minimum, consistent with the global demand for \n        nuclear power reactor fuel.\n            (5) The financing and construction of additional uranium \n        enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities in additional \n        states around the world is indefensible on economic grounds \n        alone, given current and future supplies of uranium and \n        existing providers of uranium enrichment and spent-fuel \n        reprocessing services to the world market.\n            (6) The desire to construct uranium enrichment and spent-\n        fuel reprocessing facilities by additional countries, \n        therefore, is often based upon considerations other than \n        economic calculations. The possession of such facilities is \n        often elevated to a matter of national pride--a demonstration \n        to the world that the country that possesses this technology \n        has arrived at a level of technological development comparable \n        to that of the United States and other countries with advanced \n        civil nuclear power programs.\n            (7) Furthermore, the acquisition of uranium enrichment and \n        spent-fuel reprocessing facilities can be perceived as a \n        demonstration of the developing world's independence from \n        technological domination by the more developed states. Article \n        IV of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (21 \n        UST 483; commonly referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-\n        Proliferation Treaty'' or the ``NPT'') recognizes that State \n        Parties have an ``inalienable right . . . to develop research, \n        production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes \n        without discrimination.''. However, this is a qualified right \n        conditioned by a State Party acting in conformity with the \n        NPT's obligation for such countries not to acquire, possess, or \n        develop nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices.\n            (8) It has been long recognized that the proliferation of \n        national uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing \n        facilities would increase the likelihood of the emergence of \n        new nuclear weapon states. Concerned governments, \n        nongovernmental organizations, and individual experts have for \n        decades recognized the need to address this problem through \n        multilateral assurances of the uninterrupted supply of nuclear \n        fuel, the sharing of peaceful application of nuclear energy, an \n        international fuel bank to provide fuel if the fuel supply to a \n        country is disrupted, and even multilateral participation in \n        international uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing \n        facilities, as a means of reducing incentives of countries to \n        develop and construct such facilities themselves.\n            (9) Until recently, such efforts have produced little more \n        than reports. However, the revelations of a nuclear black-\n        market in uranium enrichment technology and equipment, combined \n        with the attempt by North Korea and Iran to possess such \n        technology and equipment to provide the basis for nuclear \n        weapons programs, have rekindled this debate with a new \n        urgency.\n            (10) Iran has used the specter of a potentially unreliable \n        international supply of nuclear reactor fuel as a pretext for \n        developing its own uranium enrichment and spent-fuel \n        reprocessing capability, which would enable Iran to also \n        produce weapons-grade uranium and plutonium for nuclear \n        weapons.\n            (11) Several initiatives have been proposed over the last \n        year to address these concerns. The United States has proposed \n        the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), which envisions a \n        consortium of countries with advanced nuclear capabilities \n        providing nuclear fuel services--fresh fuel and recovery of \n        used fuel--to other countries that agree to employ nuclear \n        energy only for power generation purposes, without possessing \n        national uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing \n        facilities.\n            (12) The United States also joined France, the Russian \n        Federation, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands on \n        May 31, 2006, in proposing a ``Concept for a Multilateral \n        Mechanism for Reliable Access to Nuclear Fuel'' that would \n        facilitate or create new arrangements between suppliers and \n        recipients to provide fuel to countries with good \n        nonproliferation credentials in case of market failure.\n            (13) Any assurance of the supply of nuclear fuel should \n        meet the condition outlined by President George W. Bush on \n        February 11, 2004, that ``The world's leading nuclear exporters \n        should ensure that states have reliable access at reasonable \n        cost to fuel for civilian reactors, so long as those states \n        renounce enrichment and reprocessing.''.\n            (14) The Russian Federation has proposed that one of its \n        uranium enrichment facilities be placed under international \n        management and oversight, as part of a ``Global Nuclear Power \n        Infrastructure'' proposal to create international nuclear fuel \n        cycle centers.\n            (15) In conclusion, the creation of a multi-tiered system \n        to assure the supply of nuclear reactor fuel at current market \n        prices, under appropriate safeguards and conditions, could \n        reassure countries that are dependent upon or will construct \n        nuclear power reactors that they will have an assured supply of \n        nuclear fuel at current market prices, so long as such \n        countries forgo national uranium enrichment and spent-fuel \n        reprocessing facilities and are committed to the \n        nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\nSEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the ``Concept for a Multilateral Mechanism for Reliable \n        Access to Nuclear Fuel'', proposed by the United States, \n        France, the Russian Federation, Germany, the United Kingdom, \n        and the Netherlands on May 31, 2006, is welcomed and should be \n        expanded upon at the earliest possible opportunity;\n            (2) the proposal by the Government of the Russian \n        Federation to bring one of its uranium enrichment facilities \n        under international management and oversight is also a welcome \n        development and should be encouraged by the United States;\n            (3) the offer by the Nuclear Threat Institute (NTI) of \n        $50,000,000 in funds to support the creation of an \n        international nuclear fuel bank by the International Atomic \n        Energy Agency (IAEA) is also welcomed, and the United States \n        and other member states of the IAEA should pledge collectively \n        at least an additional $100,000,000 in matching funds to \n        fulfill the NTI proposal; and\n            (4) the governments, organizations, and experts currently \n        engaged in developing the initiatives described in paragraphs \n        (1) through (3) and other initiatives should seek to identify \n        additional incentives to be included in an international regime \n        for the assured supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful means at \n        current market prices, including participation in non-weapons-\n        relevant technology development and fuel leasing to further \n        persuade countries that participation in such a multilateral \n        arrangement far outweighs the temptation and expense of \n        developing national uranium enrichment and plutonium \n        reprocessing facilities.\n\nSEC. 103. STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) General Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \nStates to support the establishment of an international regime for the \nassured supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful means under multilateral \nauthority, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n    (b) Additional Statement of Policy.--It is further the policy of \nthe United States to--\n            (1) oppose the development of a capability to produce \n        nuclear weapons by any non-nuclear weapon state, within or \n        outside of the NPT;\n            (2) encourage states party to the NPT to interpret the \n        right to ``develop research, production and use of nuclear \n        energy for peaceful purposes,'' as described in Article IV of \n        the NPT, as being a qualified right that is conditioned by the \n        overall purpose of the NPT to prevent the spread of nuclear \n        weapons and nuclear weapons capability, including by refraining \n        from all nuclear cooperation with any state party that has not \n        demonstrated that it is in full compliance with its NPT \n        obligations, as determined by the International Atomic Energy \n        Agency; and\n            (3) strengthen the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines \n        concerning consultation by members regarding violations of \n        supplier and recipient understandings by instituting the \n        practice of a timely and coordinated response by Nuclear \n        Suppliers Group members to all such violations, including \n        termination of nuclear transfers to an involved recipient, that \n        discourage individual Nuclear Suppliers Group members from \n        continuing cooperation with such recipient until such time as a \n        consensus regarding a coordinated response has been achieved.\n\nSEC. 104. REPORT.\n\n    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the President shall transmit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs \nof the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations \nof the Senate a report on the activities of the United States to \nsupport the establishment of an international regime for the assured \nsupply of nuclear fuel for peaceful means at current market prices \nunder multilateral authority, such as the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. The report shall include an assessment of the feasibility of \nestablishing an international fuel services center within the United \nStates.\n\n               TITLE II--INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR FUEL BANK\n\nSEC. 201.
