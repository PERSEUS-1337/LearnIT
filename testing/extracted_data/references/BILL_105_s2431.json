FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The American people abhor torture by any government or \n        person. The existence of torture creates a climate of fear and \n        international insecurity that affects all people.\n            (2) Torture is the deliberate mental and physical damage \n        caused by governments to individuals to destroy individual \n        personality and terrorize society. The effects of torture are \n        long term. Those effects can last a lifetime for the survivors \n        and affect future generations.\n            (3) By eliminating the leadership of their opposition and \n        frightening the general public, repressive governments often \n        use torture as a weapon against democracy.\n            (4) Torture survivors remain under physical and \n        psychological threats, especially in communities where the \n        perpetrators are not brought to justice. In many nations, even \n        those who treat torture survivors are threatened with \n        reprisals, including torture, for carrying out their ethical \n        duty to provide care. Both the survivors of torture and their \n        treatment providers should be accorded protection from further \n        repression.\n            (5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering \n        the United States have been victims of torture. Those claiming \n        asylum deserve prompt consideration of their applications for \n        political asylum to minimize their insecurity and sense of \n        danger. Many torture survivors now live in the United States. \n        They should be provided with the rehabilitation services which \n        would enable them to become productive members of our \n        communities.\n            (6) The development of a treatment movement for torture \n        survivors has created new opportunities for action by the \n        United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored and \n        other acts of torture.\n            (7) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect \n        and support torture victims and their treatment providers, \n        together with overall efforts to eliminate torture.\n            (8) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect \n        their families, the United States can help to heal the effects \n        of torture and prevent its use around the world.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    As used in this Act, the term ``torture'' has the meaning given the \nterm in section 2340(1) of title 18, United States Code, and includes \nthe use of rape and other forms of sexual violence by a person acting \nunder the color of law upon another person under his custody or \nphysical control.\n\nSEC. 4.
