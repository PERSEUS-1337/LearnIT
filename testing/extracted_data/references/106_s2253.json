    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Rails to Resources Act of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) rail transportation is an essential component of the \n        North American intermodal transportation system;\n            (2) the development of economically strong and socially \n        stable communities in the western United States and Canada was \n        encouraged significantly by government policies promoting the \n        development of integrated transcontinental, interstate and \n        interprovincial rail systems in the states, territories and \n        provinces of the two countries;\n            (3) United States and Canadian federal support for the \n        completion of new elements of the transcontinental, interstate \n        and interprovincial rail systems was halted before rail \n        connections were established to the state of Alaska and the \n        Yukon Territory;\n            (4) both public and private lands in Alaska, the Yukon \n        Territory and northern British Columbia, including lands held \n        by aboriginal peoples, contain extensive deposits of oil, gas, \n        coal and other minerals as well as valuable forest products \n        which presently are inaccessible, but which could provide \n        significant economic benefit to local communities and to both \n        nations if an economically efficient transportation system was \n        available;\n            (5) rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas \n        facilitates controlled access and reduced overall impact to \n        environmentally sensitive areas;\n            (6) the extension of the continental rail system through \n        northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory to the \n        current terminus of the Alaska Railroad would significantly \n        benefit the U.S. and Canadian visitor industries by \n        facilitating the comfortable movement of passengers over long \n        distances while minimizing effects on the surrounding areas; \n        and\n            (7) ongoing research and development efforts in the rail \n        industry continue to increase the efficiency of rail \n        transportation, ensure safety, and decrease the impact of rail \n        service on the environment.\n\nSEC. 3. AGREEMENT FOR A UNITED STATES-CANADA BILATERAL COMMISSION.\n\n    The President is authorized and urged to enter into an agreement \nwith the Government of Canada to establish a joint commission to study \nthe feasibility and advisability of linking the rail system in Alaska \nto the nearest appropriate point on the North American continental rail \nsystem.\n\nSEC. 4.
