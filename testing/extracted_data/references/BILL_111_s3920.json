COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC SECURITY.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Economic \nSecurity Defense Act of 2010''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the recent financial crisis could serve as a road map \n        for actors seeking to destabilize economic systems;\n            (2) the economy's growing interconnectedness increases \n        vulnerabilities;\n            (3) the ability of malevolent actors to rapidly network and \n        mask their activities undermines the fundamentals of the \n        financial markets and economy;\n            (4) as it is reported that a recent war game of the \n        Department of Defense--\n                    (A) exposed the seriousness of threats to our \n                economy;\n

across the divides between the national \n                security and financial communities;\n            (5) a leading financial executive recently noted that the \n        financial crisis, sparked by the September 15th, 2008, collapse \n        of Lehman Brothers, could serve as a road map for actors \n        seeking to destabilize economic systems;\n            (6) prominent counterterrorism expert Professor Bruce \n        Hoffman of Georgetown University has stated that al Qaeda and \n        other terrorists groups were devoting new attention to \n        derailing our financial system in the wake of that crisis;\n            (7) foreign governments have developed economic warfare \n        capabilities or organizations, such as an economic warfare \n        bureau in China; and\n            (8) former Directors of National Intelligence and other top \n        experts have warned of cybersecurity and other threats capable \n        of disrupting our financial institutions or critical \n        infrastructure, such as the national power grid.\n    (c) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be known \nas the ``Security Threats to Financial Markets and Economic

               and economic concerns; and\n                    (D) national security vulnerabilities associated \n                with current Federal debt levels.\n            (2) Policy
