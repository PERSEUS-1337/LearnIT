SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Leadership Invests \nin the Future Through Helping Individuals Gain Higher Education and \nRetraining Act of 2012'' or as the ``LIFT HIGHER Act of 2012''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The median student loan debt for students who graduated \n        from college between 2006 and 2010 is $20,000.\n            (2) Application fees for individual schools range from $40 \n        to $140. The cost of taking the Graduate Record Exam once is \n        $150. Law school admission test preparation courses cost \n        upwards of $1,500.
