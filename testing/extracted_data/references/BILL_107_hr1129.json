FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on \n        energy costs, which is more than is spent on books and \n        computers combined.\n            (2) Educators teach and students learn best in an \n        environment that is comfortable, healthy, naturally lit where \n        possible, and in good repair, and studies have indicated that \n        student achievement is greater and attendance higher when those \n        conditions are met.\n            (3) Over half of our Nation's K-12 schools are more than 40 \n        years old and in need of renovation to reach such standard of \n        efficiency and comfort, and 6,000 new schools will be required \n        over the next 10 years to accommodate the growing number of \n        students.\n            (4) Inadequate ventilation in school buildings, poor \n        lighting and acoustical quality, and uncomfortable temperatures \n        can diminish students' capacity to concentrate and excel.\n            (5) Inefficient use of water, either in consumption or from \n        poorly maintained systems, is prevalent in older schools.\n            (6) Using a whole building approach in the design of new \n        schools and the renovation of existing schools--considering how \n        materials, systems, and products connect and overlap and also \n        how a school is integrated on its site and within the \n        surrounding community--will result in high performance school \n        buildings.\n            (7) Adoption of whole building concepts has been shown to \n        result in dramatic improvements in student and teacher \n        performance.\n            (8) Adopting a whole building approach usually results in a \n        lower life cycle cost for the school building than for a \n        conventionally designed and built building.\n            (9) Systematic use of energy conservation in school \n        construction and renovation projects can save at least one \n        quarter of current energy costs, leaving more money for \n        teachers and educational materials.\n            (10) The use of renewable energy sources such as \n        daylighting, passive solar heating, photovoltaics, wind, \n        geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power in a building already \n        designed to be low-energy can help meet the building's energy \n        needs without added emissions.\n            (11) Using environmentally preferable products and \n        providing for adequate supplies of fresh air will improve \n        indoor air quality and provide healthful school buildings.\n            (12) Most school districts do not have the knowledge of \n        cutting-edge design and technologies to implement optimum \n        efficiency into new school construction or into school \n        renovations.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to assist school \ndistricts in the production, through construction or renovation, of \nhigh performance elementary and secondary school buildings that are \nhealthful, productive, energy efficient, and environmentally sound.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAM ESTABLISHMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Department of \nEnergy the High Performance Schools Program (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Program'').\n    (b) In General.--The Secretary of Energy may, through the Program, \nmake grants--\n            (1) to be provided to school districts to implement the \n        purpose of this Act for new and existing school buildings;\n            (2) to State energy offices to administer the program of \n        assistance to school districts pursuant to this Act; and\n            (3) to State energy offices to promote participation by \n        school districts in the program established by this Act.\n    (c) Grants To Assist School Districts.--Grants under subsection \n(b)(1) for new school buildings shall be used to achieve energy \nefficiency performance that reduces energy use at least 30 percent \nbelow that of a school constructed in compliance with standards \nprescribed in Chapter 8 of the 2000 International Energy Conservation \nCode, or a similar State code intended to achieve substantially \nequivalent results.
