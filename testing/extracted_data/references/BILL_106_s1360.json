FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The physical safety of the Nation's top elected \n        officials is a public good of transcendent importance.\n            (2) By virtue of the critical importance of the Office of \n        the President, the President and those in direct line of the \n        Presidency are subject to unique and mortal jeopardy--jeopardy \n        that in turn threatens profound disruption to our system of \n        representative government and to the security and future of the \n        Nation.\n            (3) The physical safety of visiting heads of foreign states \n        and foreign governments is also a matter of paramount \n        importance. The assassination of such a person while on \n        American soil could have calamitous consequences for our \n        foreign relations and national security.\n            (4) Given these grave concerns, Congress has provided for \n        the Secret Service to protect the President and those in direct \n        line of the Presidency, and has directed that these officials \n        may not waive such protection. Congress has also provided for \n        the Secret Service to protect visiting heads of foreign states \n        and foreign governments.\n            (5) The protective strategy of the Secret Service depends \n        critically on the ability of its personnel to maintain close \n        and unremitting physical proximity to the protectee.\n            (6) Secret Service personnel must remain at the side of the \n        protectee on occasions of confidential conversations and, as a \n        result, may overhear top secret discussions, diplomatic \n        exchanges, sensitive conversations, and matters of personal \n        privacy.\n            (7) The necessary level of proximity can be maintained only \n        in an atmosphere of complete trust and confidence between the \n        protectee and his or her protectors.\n            (8) If a protectee has reason to doubt the confidentiality \n        of actions or conversations taken in sight or hearing of Secret \n        Service personnel, the protectee may seek to push the \n        protective envelope away or undermine it to the point at which \n        it could no longer be fully effective.\n            (9) The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be \n        compelled to testify against their protectees could induce \n        foreign nations to refuse Secret Service protection in future \n        state visits, making it impossible for the Secret Service to \n        fulfill its important statutory mission of protecting the life \n        and safety of foreign dignitaries.\n            (10) A privilege protecting information acquired by Secret \n        Service personnel while performing their protective function in \n        physical proximity to a protectee will preserve the security of \n        the protectee by lessening the incentive of the protectee to \n        distance Secret Service personnel in situations in which there \n        is some risk to the safety of the protectee.\n            (11) Recognition of a protective function privilege for the \n        President and those in direct line of the Presidency, and for \n        visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments, will \n        promote sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need \n        for probative evidence.\n            (12) Because Secret Service personnel retain law \n        enforcement responsibility even while engaged in their \n        protective function, the privilege must be subject to a crime/\n        treason exception.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to facilitate the relationship of trust and confidence \n        between Secret Service personnel and certain protected \n        officials that is essential to the ability of the Secret \n        Service to protect these officials, and the Nation, from the \n        risk of assassination; and\n            (2) to ensure that Secret Service personnel are not \n        precluded from testifying in a criminal investigation or \n        prosecution about unlawful activity committed within their view \n        or hearing.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTECTIVE FUNCTION PRIVILEGE.\n\n    (a) Admissibility of Information Acquired by Secret Service \nPersonnel While Performing Their Protective Function.--Chapter 203 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after section \n3056 the following:\n``Sec. 3056A.
