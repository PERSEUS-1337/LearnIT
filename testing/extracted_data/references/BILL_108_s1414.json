CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n        shall not be infringed.\n            (2) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        protects the rights of individuals, including those who are not \n        members of a militia or engaged in military service or \n        training, to keep and bear arms.\n            (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia \n        are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns \n        that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the \n        rest of the United States for sporting use and for lawful \n        defense of persons, homes, and families.\n            (4) The District of Columbia has the highest per capita \n        murder rate in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to \n        local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding \n        persons who would otherwise be able to defend themselves and \n        their loved ones in their own homes and businesses.\n            (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the \n        Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady Handgun \n        Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide comprehensive Federal \n        regulations applicable in the District of Columbia as \n        elsewhere. In addition, existing District of Columbia criminal \n        laws punish possession and illegal use of firearms by violent \n        criminals and felons. Consequently, there is no need for local \n        laws which only disarm law-abiding citizens.\n            (6) Legislation is required to correct the District of \n        Columbia's law in order to restore the rights of its citizens \n        under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        and thereby enhance public safety.\n\nSEC. 3. REFORM D.C. COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT FIREARMS.\n\n    Section 303.43 of title 1, District of Columbia Code, is amended by \nadding at the end the following: ``This section shall not be construed \nto permit the Council, the Mayor, or any governmental or regulatory \nauthority of the District of Columbia to prohibit, constructively \nprohibit, or unduly burden the ability of persons otherwise permitted \nto possess firearms under Federal law from acquiring, possessing in \ntheir homes or businesses, or using for sporting, self-protection or \nother lawful purposes, any firearm neither prohibited by Federal law \nnor regulated by the National Firearms Act. The District of Columbia \nshall not have authority to enact laws or regulations that discourage \nor eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REPEAL D.C. SEMIAUTOMATIC BAN.\n\n    Section 2501.01(10) of title 7, District of Columbia Code, is \namended to read as follows:\n            ``(10) Machine gun means any firearm which shoots, is \n        designed to shoot, or can be readily converted or restored to \n        shoot automatically, more than 1 shot by a single function of \n        the trigger.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
