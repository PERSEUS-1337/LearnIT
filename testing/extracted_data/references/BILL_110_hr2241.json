FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States has \n        more than doubled in the past quarter-century.\n            (2) The American Diabetes Association reports that there \n        are now more than 20,000,000 people in the United States living \n        with diabetes, with 6,000,000 of these cases not yet diagnosed. \n        Another 54,000,000 people in the United States have ``pre-\n        diabetes'', which means that they have higher than normal blood \n        glucose levels, and are at increased risk of developing \n        diabetes.\n            (3) In 2002, the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program study \n        found that lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, can \n        prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes, and that \n        participants who made such lifestyle changes reduced their risk \n        of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent.\n            (4) The New York Times has reported that lifestyle-based \n        interventions to control diabetes have resulted in positive \n        outcomes for patients, yet despite these successes, such \n        interventions were often unsustainable. While insurance \n        companies cover the treatments of complications of unchecked \n        diabetes, they tend not to cover the cheaper interventions to \n        prevent such complications.\n            (5) According to the American Diabetes Association, in \n        2002, direct medical expenditures for diabetes totaled \n        $91,800,000,000, including $23,200,000,000 for diabetes care, \n        and $24,600,000,000 for chronic complications attributable to \n        diabetes. In that year, approximately 1 out of every 10 health \n        care dollars was directed to diabetes.\n            (6) There is a need to increase the availability of \n        effective community-based lifestyle programs for diabetes \n        prevention and the ability of health care providers to refer \n        patients for enrollment in such programs to prevent diabetes, \n        reduce complications, and lower the costs associated with \n        diabetes treatment in the United States, and the Federal \n        government should encourage efforts to replicate the results of \n        the Diabetes Prevention Program on a wider scale.\n\nSEC. 3.
