FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease \n        increase with age. Alzheimer's disease is currently the seventh \n        leading cause of death of all ages in the United States (and \n        the fifth leading cause of death for people over 65 years of \n        age), with 5.2 million individuals in the United States living \n        with Alzheimer's disease. Currently, one of each eight \n        individuals in the United States over age 65 has Alzheimer's \n        disease. Every 71 seconds, an individual in the United States \n        develops Alzheimer's disease, and by 2050, every 33 seconds an \n        individual in the United States will develop this disease. By \n        2050, the number of individuals in the United States age 65 and \n        over with Alzheimer's disease will range from 11 million to 16 \n        million individuals. It is projected that by 2050, more than 60 \n        percent of individuals in the United States with Alzheimer's \n        disease will be age 85 or older.\n            (2) The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and dementia \n        seems to be higher among individuals with fewer years of \n        education. Individuals with fewer than 12 years of education \n        have a 15 percent greater risk of developing dementia than \n        individuals with 12 to 15 years of education and a 35 percent \n        greater risk of developing dementia than individuals with more \n        than 15 years of education.\n            (3) Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the \n        Nation and by 2050, will have a life expectancy of 87 years, \n        longer than any other ethnic or racial group. The Hispanic \n        community in the United States is projected to experience a \n        six-fold increase in Alzheimer's disease (from fewer than \n        200,000 to as many as 1.3 million) by 2050.\n            (4) Hispanics may be at a greater risk of developing \n        dementia than other ethnic or racial groups: Hispanics' 64-\n        percent higher incidence of diabetes than non-Hispanic white \n        Americans is of particular concern in light of new findings \n        that diabetes is the one vascular risk factor that, in the \n        absence of stroke, is related to an increased risk of \n        Alzheimer's disease.\n            (5) Research on disparities in Alzheimer's risk factors \n        between Hispanic and other ethnic and racial groups is only \n        beginning to sort out complex differences: for example, even in \n        the absence of the APOE-e4 allele, the one known genetic risk \n        factor for late onset Alzheimer's, Caribbean Hispanics have a \n        cumulative risk for Alzheimer's twice that of non-Hispanic \n        whites.\n            (6) The shortage of bilingual health professionals, \n        combined with the large population of monolingual Spanish-\n        speaking seniors, make adequate testing and diagnosis of \n        Alzheimer's among elderly Hispanics difficult and may lead to \n        cultural biases in cognitive testing. Moreover, inadequate \n        translation of diagnostic tools can lead to improper diagnoses, \n        and there may be poor understanding of recommended treatment \n        and self-care even among those who are properly diagnosed.\n            (7) Hispanics are far more likely to be uninsured than any \n        other ethnic group: the Bureau of the Census reports that 34.1 \n        percent of the Hispanic population in the United States is \n        uninsured, compared to 10.8 percent for non-Hispanic whites and \n        15.3 percent for all United States residents.\n            (8) Lack of access to health care and a strong cultural \n        commitment to caring for one's elders within the family are \n        among the factors that make Hispanics with dementia less likely \n        than non-Hispanics to see a physician and use related services \n        provided by formal health professionals: delays in diagnosis \n        and lack of early and consistent treatment can lead to higher \n        levels of impairment and increased stress on family caregivers.\n            (9) Hispanic elders are second most likely, after Asian \n        Americans, to live with their families rather than in long term \n        care facilities. More research is needed to better understand \n        the effects of differing care settings on family caregivers and \n        Alzheimer's patients.\n            (10) Alzheimer's disease costs the United States $148 \n        billion each year in direct and indirect costs to business, the \n        Medicare program, and the Medicaid program (not including \n        private health insurance costs).\n\nSEC. 3. NIH RESEARCH AND EDUCATION ON ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.\n\n    Subpart 5 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285e et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \nnew section:\n\n``SEC. 445J.
