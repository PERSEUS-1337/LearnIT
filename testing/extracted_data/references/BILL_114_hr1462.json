FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Opioid prescription rates have risen dramatically over \n        the past several years. According to the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention, in some States, there are as many as 96 \n        to 143 prescriptions for opioids per 100 adults per year.\n            (2) In recent years, there has been a steady rise in the \n        number of overdose deaths involving heroin. According to the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the death rate for \n        heroin overdose doubled from 2010 to 2012.\n            (3) At the same time, there has been an increase in cases \n        of neonatal abstinence syndrome (referred to in this section as \n        ``NAS''). In the United States, the incidence of NAS has risen \n        from 1.20 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 3.39 per 1,000 \n        hospital births in 2009.\n            (4) NAS refers to medical issues associated with drug \n        withdrawal in newborns due to exposure to opioids or other \n        drugs in utero.\n            (5) The average cost of treatment in a hospital for NAS \n        increased from $39,400 in 2000 to $53,400 in 2009. Most of \n        these costs are born by the Medicaid program.\n            (6) Preventing opioid abuse among pregnant women and women \n        of childbearing age is crucial.\n            (7) Medically appropriate opioid use in pregnancy is not \n        uncommon, and opioids are often the safest and most appropriate \n        treatment for moderate to severe pain for pregnant women.\n            (8) Addressing NAS effectively requires a focus on women of \n        childbearing age, pregnant women, and infants from \n        preconception through early childhood.\n            (9) NAS can result from the use of prescription drugs as \n        prescribed for medical reasons, from the abuse of prescription \n        drugs, or from the use of illegal opioids like heroin.\n            (10) For pregnant women who are abusing opioids, it is most \n        appropriate to treat and manage maternal substance use in a \n        non-punitive manner.\n            (11) According to a report of the Government Accountability \n        Office (referred to in this section as the ``GAO report''), \n        more research is needed to optimize the identification and \n        treatment of babies with NAS and to better understand long-term \n        impacts on children.\n            (12) According to the GAO report, the Department of Health \n        and Human Services does not have a focal point to lead planning \n        and coordinating efforts to address prenatal opioid use and NAS \n        across the department.\n            (13) According to the GAO report, ``given the increasing \n        use of heroin and abuse of opioids prescribed for pain \n        management, as well as the increased rate of NAS in the United \n        States, it is important to improve the efficiency and \n        effectiveness of planning and coordination of Federal efforts \n        on prenatal opioid use and NAS''.\n\nSEC. 3.
