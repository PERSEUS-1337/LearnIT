SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Target Practice \nand Marksmanship Training Support Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Use of firearms for target practice and marksmanship \n        training on Federal lands is allowed except to the extent \n        specific portions of such lands have been closed to such \n        activities.\n            (2) In recent years, considerations of public safety have \n        made it necessary to close additional portions of Federal lands \n        to target practice and marksmanship training, especially in \n        States that have experienced significant population growth.\n            (3) Use of public target ranges on Federal lands is often \n        more consistent with public safety and convenience than use of \n        undeveloped Federal lands for target practice and marksmanship \n        training.\n            (4) It is in the public interest for the Federal Government \n        to provide support for construction or expansion of public \n        target ranges, especially in States where population growth and \n        patterns of settlement in recent years have made it necessary \n        to prohibit such activities on Federal lands where target \n        practice and marksmanship training were formerly allowed.\n            (5) Current law, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife \n        Restoration Act, provides Federal support for construction or \n        expansion of public target ranges by making available to States \n        funds that can be used for construction, operation, and \n        maintenance of public target ranges.\n            (6) It is in the public interest to provide greater Federal \n        support to facilitate construction or expansion of public \n        target ranges in States that have experienced population growth \n        and a reduction in the number of such target ranges on Federal \n        lands.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate the \nconstruction and expansion of public target ranges, including ranges on \nFederal lands managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land \nManagement, in States that have experienced population growth and a \nreduction in the extent to which target practice and marksmanship \ntraining are permitted on Federal lands in such States.\n\nSEC. 2. FUNDING.\n\n    (a) Cost Sharing and Availability of Funds.--Section 10 of the \nPittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669h-1) is \namended as follows:\n            (1) By amending subsection (b) to read as follows:\n    ``(b) Cost Sharing.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided by paragraph (2), the \n        Federal share of the cost of any activity carried out with a \n        grant under this section shall not exceed 75 percent of the \n        total cost of the activity.\n            ``(2) Public target range construction or expansion.--\n                    ``(A) The Federal share of the cost of acquiring \n                land for, or construction or expansion of, a public \n                target range in an eligible State shall not exceed 90 \n                percent of such cost.\n                    ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n                `eligible State' means a State that, since the most \n                recent decennial census, has experienced--\n                            ``(i) at least a 2 percent growth in \n                        population, as demonstrated by the State to the \n                        satisfaction of the Secretary; and\n                            ``(ii) a reduction in the acreage of \n                        Federal lands in such State where target \n                        practice and marksmanship training are \n                        permitted, as determined by the Secretary.''.\n            (2) In subsection (c)(1), by striking the final period and \n        inserting the following: ``except that amounts provided for \n        acquiring land for, or construction or expansion of, public \n        target ranges shall remain available until expended in the case \n        of a State that, since the most recent decennial census, has \n        experienced--\n                    ``(A) at least a 2 percent growth in population, as \n                demonstrated by the State to the satisfaction of the \n                Secretary; and\n                    ``(B) a reduction in the acreage of Federal lands \n                in such State where target practice and marksmanship \n                training are permitted, as determined by the \n                Secretary.''.\n    (b) Use of Wildlife Conservation Funds.--Section 4 of the Pittman-\nRobertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669c) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (c) (relating to \n        apportionment of Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account) \n        as subsection (d) and subsection (d) (relating to Wildlife \n        Conservation and Restoration Programs) as subsection (e);\n            (2) in subsection (e)(3), as redesignated by paragraph (1), \n        by striking ``subsection (c)'' and inserting ``subsection \n        (d)''; and\n            (3) in subsection (e)(4)(B), as redesignated by paragraph \n        (1), by--\n                    (A) inserting ``(i)'' after ``(B)''; and\n                    (B) adding at the end the following new clauses:\n                            ``(ii) During the first fiscal year \n                        beginning after the date of enactment of the \n                        Target Practice and Marksmanship Training \n                        Support Act and each of the 9 subsequent fiscal \n                        years, not more than 10 percent of the amounts \n                        apportioned to an eligible State under this \n                        section for such State's wildlife conservation \n                        and restoration program may be used for \n                        acquiring land for, or construction or \n                        expansion of, public target ranges or for \n                        assisting a Federal land-management agency with \n                        environmental remediation or other steps needed \n                        to allow for public target ranges on Federal \n                        lands.\n                            ``(iii) As used in clause (ii), the term \n                        `eligible State' means a State that, since the \n                        most recent decennial census, has experienced--\n                                    ``(I) at least a 2 percent growth \n                                in population, as demonstrated by the \n                                State to the satisfaction of the \n                                Secretary; and\n                                    ``(II) a reduction in the acreage \n                                of Federal lands in such State where \n                                target practice and marksmanship \n                                training are permitted, as determined \n                                by the Secretary.''.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITS ON LIABILITY.\n\n    (a) Discretionary Function.--For purposes of the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671-2680), any action by an agent or \nemployee of the United States to authorize use of Federal land for \npurposes of target practice or marksmanship training by members of the \npublic shall be considered to constitute the exercise or performance of \na discretionary function.\n    (b) Civil Action or Claims.--Except to the extent provided in the \nFederal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671-2680), the United \nStates shall not be subject to any civil action or claim for money \ndamages for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death \ncaused by any activity occurring at a public target range that is \nwholly or partially funded by the United States pursuant to this Act or \nlocated on Federal land.\n\nSEC. 4. COOPERATION.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that, consistent with applicable laws \nand regulations, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management \nshould cooperate with State and local authorities and other entities to \ncarry out environmental remediation or other activities on Federal \nlands used as public target ranges in order to avoid closing such lands \nto use for target practice or marksmanship training."
