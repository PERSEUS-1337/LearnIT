    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Over-Classification Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A key conclusion in the Final Report of the National \n        Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States \n        (commonly known as the ``9/11 Commission'') was the need to \n        prevent over-classification by the Federal Government.\n            (2) The 9/11 Commission and others have observed that the \n        over-classification of homeland security information interferes \n        with accurate, actionable, and timely homeland security \n        information sharing, increases the cost of information \n        security, and needlessly limits public access to information.\n            (3) The over-classification problem, which has worsened \n        since the 9/11 attacks, causes considerable confusion about \n        what information can be shared with whom both internally at the \n        Department of Homeland Security and with its external partners. \n        This problem negatively impacts the dissemination of homeland \n        security information to the Department's State, local, tribal, \n        and territorial homeland security and law enforcement partners, \n        private sector customers, and the public.\n            (4) Excessive government secrecy stands in the way of a \n        safer and more secure homeland. This trend is antithetical to \n        the creation and operation of the information sharing \n        environment established under section 1016 of the Intelligence \n        Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (6 U.S.C. 485), and \n        must be halted and reversed.\n            (5) To do so, the Department should start with the \n        understanding that all departmental information that is not \n        properly classified, or marked as controlled unclassified \n        information and otherwise exempt from disclosure, should be \n        made available to members of the public pursuant to section 552 \n        of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n        ``Freedom of Information Act'').\n            (6) The Department should also develop and administer \n        policies, procedures, and programs that promote compliance with \n        applicable laws, executive orders, and other authorities \n        pertaining to the proper use of classification markings and the \n        United States National Archives and Records Administration \n        policies implementing them.\n\nSEC. 3. OVER-CLASSIFICATION PREVENTION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF \n              HOMELAND SECURITY.\n\n    Subtitle A of title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 \nU.S.C. 121 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 210F.
