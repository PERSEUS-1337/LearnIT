FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A community garden improves the quality of life, \n        encourages self-reliance, produces highly nutritious food, \n        reduces family food budgets, and creates opportunities for \n        recreation, social interaction, exercise, education, and \n        economic development for people participating in the garden.\n            (2) The creation of community gardens has been an effective \n        approach to cleaning up and maintaining abandoned vacant lots.\n            (3) Many community gardens donate fresh fruits and \n        vegetables to local food pantries, cooperatives, and homeless \n        members of the community, and provide for a source of fresh \n        fruits and vegetables for participants of the gardens.\n            (4) An August 2013 report by the Union of Concerned \n        Scientists entitled ``The $11 Trillion Reward'' concluded that \n        if Americans were to eat 2.5 cups of vegetables and 2 cups of \n        fruit daily, as recommended by Federal dietary guidelines, \n        nearly 130,000 deaths could be prevented and $17 billion could \n        be saved in medical costs.\n            (5) The Department of Health and Human Services recommends \n        eating more dark green vegetables, legumes, and fruits; and \n        eating fewer refined grains, less fat, and fewer calories.\n            (6) A 2010 review of the Nutritional Implications of \n        Farmers' Markets and Community Gardens published by the Journal \n        of the American Dietetic Association found that community \n        gardens promote healthy behaviors.\n            (7) A 2011 pilot study entitled ``LA Sprouts'' published by \n        the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that \n        teaching gardening and nutrition improved the dietary intakes \n        of children and reduced childhood obesity.\n\nSEC. 3.
