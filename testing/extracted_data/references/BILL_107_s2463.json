However, savings in \nadministrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute, for such \npurposes, a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract \nrequirements in a procurement unless the total amount of the cost \nsavings is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of \nthe procurement.\n    ``(3) Benefits considered for the purposes of paragraphs (1) and \n(2) may include cost and, regardless of whether quantifiable in dollar \namounts--\n            ``(A) quality;\n            ``(B) acquisition cycle;\n            ``(C) terms and conditions; and\n            ``(D) any other benefit.\n    ``(c) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) The terms `consolidation of contract requirements' \n        and `consolidation', with respect to contract requirements of a \n        military department, Defense Agency, or Department of Defense \n        Field Activity, mean a use of a solicitation to obtain offers \n        for a single contract or a multiple award contract to satisfy \n        two or more requirements of that department, agency, or \n        activity for goods or services that have previously been \n        provided to, or performed for, that department, agency, or \n        activity under two or more separate contracts smaller in cost \n        than the total cost of the contract for which the offers are \n        solicited.\n            ``(2) The term ``multiple award contract'' means--\n                    ``(A) a contract that is entered into by the \n                Administrator of General Services under the multiple \n                award schedule program referred to in section \n                2302(2)(C) of this title;\n                    ``(B) a multiple award task order contract or \n                delivery order contract that is entered into under the \n                authority of sections 2304a through 2304d of this title \n                or sections 303H through 303K of the Federal Property \n                and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253h \n                through 253k); and\n                    ``(C) any other indeterminate delivery, \n                indeterminate quantity contract that is entered into by \n                the head of a Federal agency with two or more sources \n                pursuant to the same solicitation.\n            ``(3) The term `senior procurement executive concerned' \n        means--\n                    ``(A) with respect to a military department, the \n                official designated under section 16(3) of the Office \n                of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 414(3)) as \n                the senior procurement executive for the military \n                department; or\n                    ``(B) with respect to a Defense Agency or a \n                Department of Defense Field Activity, the official so \n                designated for the Department of Defense.\n            ``(4) The term `small business concern' means a business \n        concern that is determined by the Administrator of the Small \n        Business Administration to be a small-business concern by \n        application of the standards prescribed under section 3(a) of \n        the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)).''.\n            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the \n        beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the \n        item relating to section 2381 the following new item:\n\n``2382.
