FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the area surrounding the Colorado River in Grand \n        County, Utah, and Dinosaur National Monument and the Book \n        Cliffs in Uintah County, Utah, contains nationally recognized \n        scenic values, significant archaeological and historic \n        resources, valuable wildlife habitat, and outstanding \n        opportunities for public recreation that are enjoyed by \n        hundreds of thousands of people annually;\n            (2) the State of Utah owns multiple parcels of land in the \n        area that were granted to the State under the Act of July 16, \n        1894 (28 Stat. 107, chapter 138), to be held in trust for the \n        benefit of the public school system and other public \n        institutions of the State;\n            (3) the parcels of State trust land are largely scattered \n        in checkerboard fashion amid the Federal land comprising the \n        area of the Colorado River corridor, the Dinosaur National \n        Monument, and the Book Cliffs;\n            (4) the State trust land in the area of the Colorado River \n        corridor, Dinosaur National monument, and the Book Cliffs \n        contains significant natural and recreational values, \n        including--\n                    (A) portions of Westwater Canyon of the Colorado \n                River;\n                    (B) the nationally recognized Kokopelli and \n                Slickrock trails;\n                    (C) several of the largest natural rock arches in \n                the United States;\n                    (D) multiple wilderness study areas and proposed \n                wilderness areas; and\n                    (E) viewsheds for Arches National Park and Dinosaur \n                National Monument;\n            (5) the large presence of State trust land located in the \n        Colorado River corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and the \n        Book Cliffs area makes land and resource management in the area \n        more difficult, costly, and controversial for the United States \n        and the State of Utah;\n            (6) although the State trust land was granted to the State \n        to generate financial support for public schools in the State \n        through the sale or development of natural resources, \n        development of those resources in the Colorado River corridor, \n        Dinosaur National Monument, and the Book Cliffs area would be \n        incompatible with managing the area for recreational, natural, \n        and scenic values;\n            (7) the United States owns land and interests in land in \n        other parts of the State of Utah that can be transferred to the \n        State in exchange for the State trust land without jeopardizing \n        Federal management objectives or needs; and\n            (8) it is in the public interest to exchange federally-\n        owned land in the State for the Utah State trust land located \n        in the Colorado River Corridor, Dinosaur National Monument, and \n        the Book Cliffs area, on terms that are fair to the United \n        States and the State of Utah.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize, \nfacilitate, and expedite the exchange of certain Federal land and non-\nFederal land in the State to further the public interest by--\n            (1) exchanging Federal land that has limited recreational \n        and conservation values; and\n            (2) acquiring State trust land with important recreational, \n        scenic, and conservation values for permanent public management \n        and use.\n\nSEC. 3.
