FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Schools and other public education facilities are \n        critical societal institutions for the education of children, \n        and parents are primarily responsible for the care, health, and \n        education of their children.\n            (2) Teachers, administrators, and other educational \n        laypersons may significantly impact the educational development \n        of the children in their care. The responsibility of teachers, \n        administrators, and other educational laypersons is limited to \n        their instructional interaction with the child, while a \n        parent's responsibilities do not end with the ring of a bell or \n        the end of the school year.\n            (3) Schools and other public education facilities serve a \n        wide array of children, each with their own unique social \n        maturity level. Schools are not adequately equipped to properly \n        ascertain an individual child's readiness for certain types of \n        information.\n            (4) Parents are primarily responsible for the educational, \n        societal, and personal development of their children, and \n        parents are best suited for determining the appropriate time, \n        manner, and context for conveying sensitive information to \n        their children.\n            (5) Schools, in the discharge of their educational duties, \n        may impart information of a sensitive nature to children \n        regarding a variety of issues. Parents should be informed by \n        the schools as to the full content of the information to be \n        conveyed, the context of the instruction, and methods for \n        conveying the information.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--In this Act, the terms ``elementary school'', \n``local educational agency'', ``parent'', ``secondary school'', and \n``State educational agency'' have the meanings given the terms in \nsection 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 7801).\n    (b) Additional Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) Child.--The term ``child'' means a human being who has \n        not reached the age of majority as determined under applicable \n        State law.\n            (2) Educational institution.--The term ``educational \n        institution'' means any public or private preschool, elementary \n        school, or secondary school, except that in the case of an \n        educational institution composed of more than 1 school or \n        department which are administratively separate units, such term \n        means each such school or department.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION OF INSTRUCTION WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF A PARENT.\n\n    (a) Consent Required.--Each educational institution that receives \nFederal funds or Federal financial assistance shall obtain the \naffirmative, informed, written consent of the parent of a child in the \ncare of the educational institution prior to requesting information \nfrom the child, or conveying information to the child, on subjects \nconcerning sex, sexuality, or related topics, regardless of whether \nsuch information--\n            (1) is gender specific;\n            (2) is related to sexual orientation; or\n            (3) conforms with other elements of the instructional \n        materials of the educational institution.\n    (b) Notice.--Upon the request of a parent of a child attending such \nan educational institution, the educational institution shall provide \nto the parent--\n            (1) an opportunity to review the information described in \n        subsection (a); and\n            (2) a description of--\n                    (A) the context and setting in which the \n                information will be requested, broached, discussed, or \n                otherwise conveyed to the child; and\n                    (B) the educational necessity of the information.\n    (c) Prohibition Regarding Absence of Consent.--In no event shall an \neducational institution consider a parent's lack of denial of the \nconsent required by subsection (a), or lack of such consent, to be \nconsent.\n    (d) Immediate Health Issues.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to limit a school nurse or another school health official \nfrom responding to a child's immediate health issues.\n    (e) Civil Action for Failure To Obtain Parental Consent.--Every \nperson or educational institution who or that, under color of any \nstatute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or \nterritory of the United States, or the District of Columbia, violates \nthis section, shall be liable to the party injured in a civil action in \nan appropriate district court of the United States.
