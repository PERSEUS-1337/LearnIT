FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n        inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.\n            (2) Crohn's disease may occur in any section of the \n        gastrointestinal tract but is predominately found in the lower \n        part of the small intestine and the large intestine. Ulcerative \n        colitis is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the \n        innermost lining of the colon. Complete removal of the colon in \n        patients with ulcerative colitis can potentially alleviate and \n        cure symptoms.\n            (3) Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis behave \n        similarly, they are collectively known as inflammatory bowel \n        disease. Both diseases present a variety of symptoms, including \n        severe diarrhea, abdominal pain with cramps, fever, and rectal \n        bleeding. There is no known cause of inflammatory bowel \n        disease, or medical cure.\n            (4) It is estimated that up to 1,400,000 people in the \n        United States suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, 30 \n        percent of whom are diagnosed during their childhood years.\n            (5) Children with inflammatory bowel disease miss school \n        activities because of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, and \n        many adults who had onset of inflammatory bowel disease as \n        children had delayed puberty and impaired growth and have never \n        reached their full genetic growth potential.\n            (6) Inflammatory bowel disease patients are at high risk \n        for developing colorectal cancer.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY \n              DISEASES; INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE RESEARCH EXPANSION.\n\n    Subpart 3 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285c et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 434B. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Director of the Institute shall expand, \nintensify, and coordinate the activities of the Institute with respect \nto research on inflammatory bowel disease. Such research may be focused \non, but not limited to, the following areas:\n            ``(1) Genetic research on susceptibility for inflammatory \n        bowel disease, including the interaction of genetic and \n        environmental factors in the development of the disease.\n            ``(2) Research targeted to increase knowledge about the \n        causes and complications of inflammatory bowel disease in \n        children.\n            ``(3) Animal model research on inflammatory bowel disease, \n        including genetics in animals.\n            ``(4) Clinical inflammatory bowel disease research, \n        including clinical studies and treatment trials.\n            ``(5) Expansion of the Institute's Inflammatory Bowel \n        Disease Centers program with a focus on pediatric research.\n            ``(6) The training of qualified health professionals in \n        biomedical research focused on inflammatory bowel disease, \n        including pediatric investigators.\n            ``(7) Other research priorities identified by the \n        scientific agendas `Challenges in Inflammatory Bowel Disease \n        Research' (Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America) and \n        `Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease' (North American Society \n        for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition).\n    ``(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out subsection \n(a), there are authorized to be appropriated $80,000,000 for fiscal \nyear 2008, $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, and $100,000,000 for \nfiscal year 2010.''.\n\nSEC. 4. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION; EXPANSION OF \n              INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n    Part A of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 310A. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION; EXPANSION OF \n              INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention shall expand the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology \nProgram within the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and \nHealth Promotion to include additional studies focused on--\n            ``(1) the incidence and prevalence of pediatric \n        inflammatory bowel disease in the United States;\n            ``(2) genetic and environmental factors associated with \n        pediatric inflammatory bowel disease;\n            ``(3) age, race or ethnicity, gender, and family history of \n        individuals diagnosed with pediatric inflammatory bowel \n        disease; and\n            ``(4) treatment approaches and outcomes in pediatric \n        inflammatory bowel disease.\n    ``(b) Consultation.--The Director shall carry out subsection (a) in \nconsultation with a national voluntary patient organization with \nexperience serving the population of individuals with pediatric \ninflammatory bowel disease and organizations representing physicians \nand other health professionals specializing in the treatment of such \npopulations.\n    ``(c) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this section, \nthere are authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 for fiscal year \n2008, and such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2009 \nand 2010.''."
