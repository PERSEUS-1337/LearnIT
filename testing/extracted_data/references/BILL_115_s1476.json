DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--The term ``appropriate \ncongressional committees'' means--\n            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n        Armed Services, the Committee on Appropriations, and the Select \n        Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n            (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on \n        Armed Services, the Committee on Appropriations, and the \n        Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n        Representatives.\n    (b) INF Treaty.--The term ``INF Treaty'' means the Treaty between \nthe United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-\nRange Missiles, signed at Washington, DC, December 8, 1987, and entered \ninto force June 1, 1988.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The INF Treaty, which entered into force on June 1, \n        1988, banned the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) \n        from possessing ground-launched nuclear and conventional \n        missiles and launchers retaining ranges between 500 and 5,500 \n        kilometers (km).\n            (2) Implementation of the INF Treaty led to the \n        dismantlement of 2,692 short-, medium-, and intermediate-range \n        missiles between the United States and the USSR, representing a \n        major reduction in both nuclear arsenals and evidencing key \n        efforts to safeguard the United States and its allies from \n        nuclear weapons.\n            (3) Since concerns regarding a noncompliant ground-launched \n        cruise missile (GLCM) were first raised in 2008, the Russian \n        Federation has developed and tested a GLCM (currently \n        designated ``SSC-8'') that has a range violating the \n        fundamental stipulations of the INF Treaty.\n            (4) In 2014, the United States labeled the Russian \n        Federation to be ``in violation'' of the INF Treaty in the \n        Department of State Report entitled, ``Adherence to and \n        Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament \n        Agreements and Commitments'', and has maintained Russia's \n        noncompliant status in each subsequent report due to the \n        development and testing of the SSC-8.\n            (5) During a March 2017 hearing at the Committee on Armed \n        Services of the House of Representatives, the Vice Chairman of \n        the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Paul Selva, asserted that \n        ``we believe that the Russians have deployed a land-based \n        cruise missile that violates the spirit and intent of the \n        Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty'' and that such a system \n        poses ``a threat to NATO and to facilities within the NATO area \n        of responsibility.''\n            (6) When examining the response options at the United \n        States disposal, the Department of Defense stated in its 2016 \n        Plan for Military Response Options to Russian Federation \n        Violations of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) \n        Treaty that ``Russia's return to compliance with its \n        obligations under the INF Treaty remains the preferable \n        outcome.''\n            (7) United States allies in Europe do not currently have \n        sufficient defensive articles and material to properly defend \n        against the Russian Federation's new GLCM.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nto--\n            (1) protect the United States interests and assets abroad \n        and our allies from the burgeoning threat stemming from \n        Russia's development of a new GLCM that violates the INF \n        Treaty;\n            (2) promote and expand cooperation and mutual defense with \n        European and Asian allies through--\n                    (A) strengthening the United States offensive \n                posture and defensive infrastructure on the European \n                continent; and\n                    (B) enhancing military to military coordination \n                with key allies in Europe and Asia;\n            (3) pressure the Russian Federation to abide by its \n        commitments regarding the INF Treaty and discontinue engaging \n        in hostile activities regarding its missile program by--\n                    (A) diplomatically engaging the Russian Federation \n                within the Special Verification Commission;\n                    (B) articulating that the Russian Federation is in \n                material breach of the INF Treaty; and\n                    (C) communicating to the Russian Federation that if \n                they remain in non-compliance with the INF Treaty by \n                January 1, 2019, the United States will--\n                            (i) take military actions to improve our \n                        European deterrence and defense capabilities, \n                        including the development of a conventional \n                        variant of the Long Range Stand-off system \n                        (LRSO);\n                            (ii) assist United States allies in \n                        improving their air- and sea-launched \n                        conventional strike capabilities by \n                        facilitating sales of the extended-range \n                        variant of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff \n                        Missile (JASSM-ER) and sea-based Tomahawk \n                        cruise missile; and\n                            (iii) deploy limited defenses against \n                        cruise missiles to protect key alliance assets; \n                        and\n            (4) not precipitously withdraw from the INF Treaty without \n        fully consulting and coordinating with European allies.\n\nSEC. 4.
