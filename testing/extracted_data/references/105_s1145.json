FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) information regarding the solvency of the social \n        security trust funds, and personal earnings and benefits \n        estimates is vital for working Americans to plan a financially \n        secure retirement;\n            (2) over the next 35 years, the number of American people \n        age 65 and older will double, while the number of people age 20 \n        to 64 will increase by only 20 percent, and these demographic \n        changes will have a significant impact on the future of the \n        social security system;\n            (3) simplified and accurate information regarding the \n        social security system is needed to enable working Americans to \n        understand and adjust to those demographic changes;\n            (4) more than 50 percent of the workers in the United \n        States do not have a pension and that percentage is increasing \n        for younger age groups, 50 percent of families in the United \n        States have less than $1,000 in net financial assets, and the \n        median amount of savings among adults who are in their late \n        50s, the age of a worker facing immediate retirement, is still \n        less than $10,000;\n            (5) lack of information has, in part, caused poor financial \n        planning for future retirement, resulting in insufficient \n        savings;\n            (6) the General Accounting Office reports that the Personal \n        Earnings and Benefits Estimate Statements (PEBES) initiative is \n        an important step towards better informing the public about the \n        programs and benefits under the social security system, but \n        extensive revisions to the PEBES are needed to ensure better \n        understanding of that system and effective communication to the \n        general public about that system; and\n            (7) public awareness of the long-term financial soundness \n        of the social security system will facilitate necessary reform \n        of that system and increase public confidence in the system.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to require the Commissioner of Social Security to \n        provide simple and accurate information on the fiscal status of \n        the social security trust funds and on the personal earnings \n        and benefits estimates of all eligible individuals in order to \n        allow working Americans to better plan their retirement;\n            (2) to prohibit the use of any message or design relating \n        to such information that may mislead or confuse the general \n        public; and\n            (3) to build public confidence in the social security \n        system through the requirement of full disclosure and increased \n        awareness of the fiscal soundness of the system.\n\n SEC. 4.
