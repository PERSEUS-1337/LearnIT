RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.\n\n    (a) Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Commerce shall, within 90 \ndays after the date of enactment of this Act, report to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the \nCommittee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of \nRepresentatives--\n            (1) identifying current governmental and nongovernmental \n        research activities on Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly \n        migratory species;\n            (2) describing the personnel and budgetary resources \n        allocated to such activities; and\n            (3) explaining how each activity contributes to the \n        conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other \n        highly migratory species.\n    (b) Research Program.--Section 3 of the Act of September 4, 1980 \n(16 U.S.C. 971i) is amended--\n            (1) by amending the section heading to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 3.

ACTIONS TO IMPROVE CONSERVATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory \n        species are valuable commercial and recreational fisheries of \n        the United States.\n            (2) The vessels of many countries, including the United \n        States, fish for Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly \n        migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean \n        Sea.\n            (3) The International Commission for the Conservation of \n        Atlantic Tunas (hereinafter referred to as the ``Commission'') \n        is the international entity established to adopt \n        recommendations and develop international agreements for the \n        conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other \n        highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and the \n        Mediterranean Sea.\n            (4) In the last 25 years Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks and \n        other stocks of highly migratory species have declined from \n        historic levels.\n            (5) Countries that are not members of the Commission are \n        having a detrimental impact on the recovery of Atlantic bluefin \n        tuna stocks and other stocks of highly migratory species by \n        fishing throughout the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea \n        without regard for conservation and management recommendations \n        and agreements adopted by the Commission.\n            (6) For management purposes, the Commission has adopted a \n        working hypothesis of two stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna: a \n        western stock found in the Atlantic Ocean west of 45 degrees \n        west longitude (hereinafter referred to as the ``45 degree \n        line''), and an eastern stock found in the Atlantic Ocean east \n        of the 45 degree line and in the Mediterranean Sea.\n            (7) The existing scientific evidence is inconclusive with \n        respect to the working hypothesis of two stocks, and the extent \n        to which each of the hypothesized stocks migrates across the 45 \n        degree line is unknown.\n            (8) The Commission adopted conservation and management \n        recommendations and agreements in 1974 to ensure the recovery \n        and sustainability of all Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the \n        Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.\n            (9) In recent years, the Commission has adopted additional, \n        more restrictive conservation and management recommendations \n        and agreements for Atlantic bluefin tuna, for countries that \n        fish for Atlantic bluefin tuna west of the 45 degree line.\n            (10) The United States and other countries that are members \n        of the Commission and that fish west of the 45 degree line have \n        implemented all conservation and management recommendations and \n        agreements for Atlantic bluefin tuna adopted by the Commission \n        that apply west of the 45 degree line. The implementing \n        regulations have been vigorously enforced by the Secretary of \n        Commerce and the Coast Guard.\n            (11) Many other countries that are members of the \n        Commission do not comply with conservation and management \n        recommendations and agreements for Atlantic bluefin tuna \n        adopted by the Commission that apply east of the 45 degree line \n        and in the Mediterranean Sea. This noncompliance undermines the \n        recovery of Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks.\n            (12) Recent large increases in the catch of Atlantic \n        bluefin tuna within 100 miles east of the 45 degree line by \n        countries that are members of the Commission may be having a \n        detrimenal impact on the recovery of Atlantic bluefin tuna and \n        probably do not comply with recommendations and agreements of \n        the Commission.\n    (b) Objectives.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the United States and the Commission should continue to \n        promote the conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin \n        tuna and other highly migratory species throughout the Atlantic \n        Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea;\n            (2) the United States should obtain commitments through the \n        Commission, from all countries that are signatories to the \n        International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas \n        and that are not in compliance with all of the conservation and \n        management recommendations and agreements for Atlantic bluefin \n        tuna and all other highly migratory species that have been \n        adopted by the Commission, that those countries will \n        immediately comply with those recommendations and agreements;\n            (3) the United States should continue to encourage all \n        other countries whose vessels fish for Atlantic bluefin tuna \n        and other highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean or the \n        Mediterranean Sea to comply with the conservation and \n        management recommendations and agreements adopted for those \n        species by the Commission;\n            (4) if vessels of a country fish in the Atlantic Ocean or \n        the Mediterranean Sea for Atlantic bluefin tuna or another \n        highly migratory species without complying with conservation \n        and management recommendations and agreements of the \n        Commission, such fishing will be considered by the Congress to \n        diminish the effectiveness of an international fishery \n        conservation program, and as such will be considered by the \n        Congress to be certifiable under section 8(a)(1) of the \n        Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978(a)(1));\n            (5) the United States should encourage countries that have \n        significant markets for Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly \n        migratory species to prohibit the importation of those species \n        from countries whose vessels fish for such species without \n        regard for the conservation and management recommendations and \n        agreements adopted by the Commission;\n            (6) the United States should continue to explore, through \n        the Commission, the appropriateness of working hypotheses of \n        the Commission that Atlantic stocks of highly migratory species \n        can be delineated by lines of latitude or longitude and, \n        specifically, that there are two stocks of Atlantic bluefin \n        tuna delineated by the 45 degree line; and\n            (7) the United States should seek through the Commission an \n        agreement to ensure that if the Commission uses any line to \n        divide stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna for management purposes \n        and adopts for that stock conservation and management \n        recommendations and agreements for one side of the line that \n        are more restrictive than the conservation and management \n        recommendations and agreements adopted by the Commission for \n        the other side of the line, then any fishing for Atlantic \n        bluefin tuna within 10 degrees of the line shall be conducted \n        in compliance with those more restrictive recommendations and \n        agreements."
