FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The first-ever Surgeon General's report on oral health, \n        released in May 2000, identified a ``silent epidemic'' of \n        dental and oral diseases that burdens some population groups, \n        and calls for a national partnership to provide opportunities \n        for individuals, communities, and the health professions to \n        work together to maintain and improve the nation's oral health.\n            (2) The Government Accountability Office has determined \n        that dental disease is a chronic problem among many low-income \n        and other vulnerable populations.\n            (3) The National Institutes of Health 2001 Consensus \n        Development Conference on Diagnosis and Management of Dental \n        Caries Throughout Life found that dental decay is the most \n        common chronic childhood disease among children in the United \n        States.\n            (4) Research in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine \n        determined that dental disease affects 1 in 5 children aged 2 \n        to 4, half of those aged 6 to 8, and nearly three-fifths of 15 \n        year olds.\n            (5) ``Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon \n        General'' published in April 2002 found that tooth decay is 5 \n        times more common than asthma among school age children.\n            (6) In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        estimated that 43 percent of black children have untreated \n        tooth decay in permanent teeth, and that children living in \n        poverty suffer twice as much tooth decay as middle and upper \n        income children.\n            (7) The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry has \n        reported that 80 percent of all dental problems are found in 25 \n        percent of children, primarily those from lower-income \n        families.\n            (8) Researchers have determined that preventive dental \n        interventions, including early and routine preventive care, \n        fluoridation, and sealants are cost effective in reducing \n        disease and associated expenditures.\n            (9) A broad array of programs exists, totaling more than \n        $45,000,000 annually, excluding National Institutes of Health \n        research of $300,000,000 a year and Medicaid and SCHIP funding \n        of $4,700,000,000 a year, within several agencies of the \n        Department of Health and Human Services to address oral health \n        needs, yet serious access problems remain for underserved \n        populations.\n            (10) The 110th Congress has recognized the importance of \n        dental care by adding a guaranteed dental benefit to the \n        Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n        2007.\n            (11) The Senate Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2009 \n        supports funding for improved access to oral health care in the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
