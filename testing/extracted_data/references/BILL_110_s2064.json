FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) America's healthcare system depends on an adequate \n        supply of trained nurses to deliver quality patient care.\n            (2) Over the next 15 years, this shortage is expected to \n        grow significantly. The Health Resources and Services \n        Administration has projected that by 2020, there will be a \n        shortage of nurses in every State and that overall only 64 \n        percent of the demand for nurses will be satisfied, with a \n        shortage of 1,016,900 nurses nationally.\n            (3) To avert such a shortage, today's network of healthcare \n        workers should have access to education and support from their \n        employers to participate in educational and training \n        opportunities.\n            (4) With the appropriate education and support, incumbent \n        healthcare workers and incumbent bedside nurses are untapped \n        sources which can meet these needs and address the nursing \n        shortage and provide quality care as the American population \n        ages.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this section to authorize \ngrants to--\n            (1) address the projected shortage of nurses by funding \n        comprehensive programs to create a career ladder to nursing \n        (including Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical \n        Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses) for \n        incumbent ancillary healthcare workers;\n            (2) increase the capacity for educating nurses by \n        increasing both nurse faculty and clinical opportunities \n        through collaborative programs between staff nurse \n        organizations, healthcare providers, and accredited schools of \n        nursing; and\n            (3) provide training programs through education and \n        training organizations jointly administered by healthcare \n        providers and healthcare labor organizations or other \n        organizations representing staff nurses and frontline \n        healthcare workers, working in collaboration with accredited \n        schools of nursing and academic institutions.\n    (b) Grants.--Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary of Labor (referred to in this section as the \n``Secretary'') shall establish a partnership grant program to award \ngrants to eligible entities to carry out comprehensive programs to \nprovide education to nurses and create a pipeline to nursing for \nincumbent ancillary healthcare workers who wish to advance their \ncareers, and to otherwise carry out the purposes of this section.\n    (c) Eligible Entities.--To be eligible to receive a grant under \nthis section an entity shall--\n            (1) be--\n                    (A) a healthcare entity that is jointly \n                administered by a healthcare employer and a labor union \n                representing the healthcare employees of the employer \n                and that carries out activities using labor management \n                training funds as provided for under section 302 of the \n                Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947 (18 U.S.C. \n                186(c)(6));\n                    (B) an entity that operates a training program that \n                is jointly administered by--\n                            (i) one or more healthcare providers or \n                        facilities, or a trade association of \n                        healthcare providers;
