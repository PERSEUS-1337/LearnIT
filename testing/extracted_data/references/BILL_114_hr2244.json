STRATEGIC TRANSFORMER RESERVE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the storage of strategically \nlocated spare large power transformers will diminish the vulnerability \nof the United States to multiple risks facing electric grid \nreliability, including physical attack, cyber attack, electromagnetic \npulse, geomagnetic disturbances, severe weather, and seismic events.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Bulk-power system.--The term ``bulk-power system'' has \n        the meaning given such term in section 215(a) of the Federal \n        Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824o(a)).\n            (2) Critically damaged large power transformer.--The term \n        ``critically damaged large power transformer'' means a large \n        power transformer that--\n                    (A) has sustained extensive damage such that--\n                            (i) repair or refurbishment is not \n                        economically viable; or\n                            (ii) the extensive time to repair or \n                        refurbish the large power transformer would \n                        create an extended period of instability in the \n                        bulk-power system; and\n                    (B) prior to sustaining such damage was part of the \n                bulk-power system.\n            (3) Large power transformer.--The term ``large power \n        transformer'' means a power transformer, including related \n        critical equipment, that is, or is intended to be, a part of \n        the bulk-power system, with a maximum nameplate rating of 100 \n        megavolt-amperes or higher.\n            (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n            (5) Spare large power transformer.--The term ``spare large \n        power transformer'' means a large power transformer that is \n        stored within the Strategic Transformer Reserve to be available \n        to temporarily replace a critically damaged large power \n        transformer.\n    (c) Strategic Transformer Reserve Plan.--\n            (1) Plan.--Not later than one year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary, acting through the Office \n        of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, shall prepare \n        and submit to Congress for approval a plan to establish a \n        Strategic Transformer Reserve for the storage, in strategically \n        located facilities, of spare large power transformers in \n        sufficient numbers to temporarily replace critically damaged \n        large power transformers.\n            (2) Inclusions.--The Strategic Transformer Reserve plan \n        shall include a description of--\n                    (A) the appropriate number of spare large power \n                transformers and total capacity in megawatts necessary \n                in the Strategic Transformer Reserve to provide or \n                restore sufficient resiliency to the bulk-power system \n                to mitigate significant impacts to the electric grid \n                resulting from--\n                            (i) physical attack;\n                            (ii) cyber attack;\n                            (iii) electromagnetic pulse attack;\n                            (iv) geomagnetic disturbances;\n                            (v) severe weather;
