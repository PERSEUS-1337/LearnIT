FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A unique legal and political relationship exists \n        between the United States and Indian tribes that is reflected \n        in article I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution, various \n        treaties, Federal statutes, Supreme Court decisions, executive \n        agreements, and course of dealing.\n            (2) Native Americans continue to rank at the bottom of \n        nearly every indicator of social and economic well-being in \n        America:\n                    (A) Unemployment rates average near 50 percent in \n                Indian country and hover well over 90 percent on many \n                reservations.\n                    (B) While the national poverty rate is only 11 \n                percent, over 26 percent of all Native Americans live \n                in poverty.\n                    (C) In addition, Native Americans have some of the \n                lowest levels of educational attainment in the United \n                States.\n            (3) Numerous external efforts at economic development in \n        Indian Country have proven unsuccessful. The most successful \n        efforts have been initiated from within the Native communities \n        themselves. Efforts that empower the communities and give them \n        the tools to make their own decisions should be encouraged and \n        pursued.\n            (4) Educational achievement continues to be a cyclical \n        obstacle to economic development in Indian Country. Businesses \n        are often unwilling to locate to Indian Country because of the \n        lack of an educated workforce. Over a quarter of all Americans \n        have a bachelors degree or higher. However, only 12 percent of \n        all Native Americans nationwide have such a degree, and only 6 \n        percent of those who actually live in Indian Country have a \n        bachelors or higher. Once Natives are finally able to obtain \n        higher education, many are not able to return to their \n        communities because there are no jobs. There needs to be an \n        intervening factor to help break this damaging cycle.\n\nSEC. 3. LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN COUNTRY.\n\n    Part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended \nby inserting after section 428K (20 U.S.C. 1078-11) the following:\n\n``SEC. 428L.
