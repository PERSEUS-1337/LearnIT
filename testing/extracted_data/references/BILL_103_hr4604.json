SHORT TITLE; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Budget Control Act \nof 1994''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a mechanism to \nmonitor total costs of direct spending programs, and, in the event that \nactual or projected costs exceed targeted levels, to require the \nPresident and Congress to address adjustments in direct spending.\n\nSEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF DIRECT SPENDING TARGETS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The initial direct spending targets for each of \nfiscal years 1994 through 1997 shall equal total outlays for all direct \nspending except net interest and deposit insurance as determined by the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget (hereinafter referred \nto in this Act as the ``Director'') under subsection (b).\n    (b) Initial Report by Director.--\n            (1) Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, the Director shall submit a report to Congress \n        setting forth projected direct spending targets for each of \n        fiscal years 1994 through 1997.\n            (2) The Director's projections shall be based on \n        legislation enacted as of 5 days before the report is submitted \n        under paragraph (1). To the extent feasible, the Director shall \n        use the same economic and technical assumptions used in \n        preparing the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n        year 1994 (H. Con. Res. 64, One Hundred Third Congress).\n    (c) Adjustments.--Direct spending targets shall be subsequently \nadjusted by the Director under section 6.\n\nSEC. 3. ANNUAL REVIEW OF DIRECT SPENDING AND RECEIPTS BY PRESIDENT.\n\n    As part of each budget submitted under section 1105(a) of title 31, \nUnited States Code, the President shall provide an annual review of \ndirect spending and receipts, which shall include (1) information \nsupporting the adjustment of direct spending targets pursuant to \nsection 6, (2) information on total outlays for programs covered by the \ndirect spending targets, including actual outlays for the prior fiscal \nyear and projected outlays for the current fiscal year and the 5 \nsucceeding fiscal years, and (3) information on the major categories of \nFederal receipts, including a comparison between the levels of those \nreceipts and the levels projected as of the date of enactment of this \nAct.\n\nSEC. 4. SPECIAL DIRECT SPENDING MESSAGE BY PRESIDENT.\n\n    (a) Trigger.--In the event that the information submitted by the \nPresident under section 3 indicates--\n            (1) that actual outlays for direct spending in the prior \n        fiscal year exceeded the applicable direct spending target, or\n            (2) that outlays for direct spending for the current or \n        budget year are projected to exceed the applicable direct \n        spending targets,\nthe President shall include in his budget a special direct spending \nmessage meeting the requirements of subsection (b).\n    (b) Contents.--(1) The special direct spending message shall \ninclude:\n            (A) An explanation of any adjustments to the direct \n        spending targets pursuant to section 6.\n            (B) An analysis of the variance in direct spending over the \n        adjusted direct spending targets.\n            (C) The President's recommendations for addressing the \n        direct spending overages, if any, in the prior, current, or \n        budget year.\n    (2) The President's recommendations may consist of any of the \nfollowing:\n            (A) Proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays, \n        increase revenues, or both, in order to recoup or eliminate the \n        overage for the prior, current, and budget years in the current \n        year, the budget year, and the 4 outyears.\n            (B) Proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays, \n        increase revenues, or both, in order to recoup or eliminate \n        part of the overage for the prior, current, and budget year in \n        the current year, the budget year, and the 4 outyears, \n        accompanied by a finding by the President that, because of \n        economic conditions or for other specified reasons, only some \n        of the overage should be recouped or eliminated by outlay \n        reductions or revenue increases, or both.\n            (C) A proposal to make no legislative changes to recoup or \n        eliminate any overage, accompanied by a finding by the \n        President that, because of economic conditions or for other \n        specified reasons, no legislative changes are warranted.\n    (3) Except as provided by paragraph (4), any proposed legislative \nchange under paragraph (2) to reduce outlays may include reductions in \ndirect spending or in the discretionary spending limits under section \n601 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n    (4) The President's recommendations may not consist of any proposed \nlegislative changes under the old-age, survivors, and disability \ninsurance program established under title II of the Social Security \nAct.\n    (c) Proposed Special Direct Spending Resolution.--\n            (1) President's recommendations to be submitted as draft \n        resolution.--If the President recommends reductions consistent \n        with subsection (b)(2)(A) or (B), the special direct spending \n        message shall include the text of a special direct spending \n        resolution implementing the President's recommendations through \n        reconciliation directives instructing the appropriate \n        committees of the House of Representatives and Senate to \n        determine and recommend changes in laws within their \n        jurisdictions to reduce outlays or increase revenues by \n        specified amounts. If the President recommends no reductions \n        pursuant to (b)(2)(C), the special direct spending message \n        shall include the text of a special resolution concurring in \n        the President's recommendation of no legislative action.\n            (2) Resolution to be introduced in house.--Within 10 days \n        after the President's special direct spending message is \n        submitted, the text required by paragraph (1) shall be \n        introduced as a concurrent resolution in the House of \n        Representatives by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n        of the House of Representatives without substantive revision. \n        If the chairman fails to do so, after the tenth day the \n        resolution may be introduced by any Member of the House of \n        Representatives. A concurrent resolution introduced under this \n        paragraph shall be referred to the Committee on the Budget.\n\nSEC. 5.

If this \nseparate title recommends that no legislative changes be made to recoup \nor eliminate an overage, then a statement to that effect shall be set \nforth in that title.\n    (c) Requirement for Separate Vote to Increase Targets.--If the \nseparate title of a concurrent resolution on the budget proposes to \nrecoup or eliminate less than the entire overage for the prior, \ncurrent, and budget years, then the Committee on the Budget of the \nHouse of Representatives shall report a resolution directing the \nCommittee on Government Operations to report legislation increasing the \ndirect spending targets for each applicable year by the full amount of \nthe overage not recouped or eliminated.

Such motion shall be \n        highly privileged and not debatable.\n    (f) Application of Congressional Budget Act.--To the extent that \nthey are relevant and not inconsistent with this Act, the provisions of \ntitle III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 shall apply in the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate to special direct spending \nresolutions, resolutions increasing targets under subsection (c), and \nreconciliation legislation reported pursuant to directives contained in \nthose resolutions.\n    (g) Limitation on Changes to the Social Security Act.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, it shall not be in order in \nthe Senate or the House of Representatives to consider any \nreconciliation bill reported pursuant to a concurrent resolution on the \nbudget agreed to under section 301 or 304 or reconciliation legislation \nreported pursuant to directives contained in any special direct \nspending resolution, or any amendment thereto or conference report \nthereon, that contains recommendations to make any legislative changes \nunder the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program \nestablished under title II of the Social Security Act.\n\nSEC. 6.
