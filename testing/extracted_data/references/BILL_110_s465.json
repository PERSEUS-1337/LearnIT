ADVANCE DIRECTIVES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Every year 2,500,000 people die in the United States. \n        Eighty percent of those people die in institutions such as \n        hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. Chronic \n        illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, account for 2 out \n        of every 3 deaths.\n            (2) In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its \n        decisions in Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, \n        reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to \n        refuse unwanted medical treatment. In those cases, the Court \n        stressed the use of advance directives as a means of \n        safeguarding that right should those adults become incapable of \n        deciding for themselves.\n            (3) A survey published in 2005 estimated that the overall \n        prevalence of advance directives is 29 percent of the general \n        population, despite the passage of the Patient Self-\n        Determination Act in 1990, which requires that health care \n        providers tell patients about advance directives.\n            (4) Competent adults should complete advance care plans \n        stipulating their health care decisions in the event that they \n        become unable to speak for themselves. Through the execution of \n        advance directives, including living wills and durable powers \n        of attorney for health care according to the laws of the State \n        in which they reside, individuals can protect their right to \n        express their wishes and have them respected.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to improve access \nto information about individuals' health care options and legal rights \nfor care near the end of life, to promote advance care planning and \ndecisionmaking so that individuals' wishes are known should they become \nunable to speak for themselves, to engage health care providers in \ndisseminating information about and assisting in the preparation of \nadvance directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \nattorney for health care, and for other purposes.\n    (c) Medicare Coverage of End-of-Life Planning and Consultations as \nPart of Initial Preventive Physical Examination.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1861(ww) of the Social Security \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(ww)) is amended--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraph \n                (2),'' and inserting ``paragraph (2) and an end-of-life \n                planning consultation (as defined in paragraph (3)),''; \n                and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following new \n                paragraph:\n    ``(3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term `end-of-life planning \nconsultation' means a consultation between the physician and an \nindividual regarding--\n            ``(A) the importance of preparing advance directives in \n        case an injury or illness causes the individual to be unable to \n        make health care decisions;\n            ``(B) the situations in which an advance directive is \n        likely to be relied upon;\n            ``(C) the reasons that the development of a comprehensive \n        end-of-life plan is beneficial and the reasons that such a plan \n        should be updated periodically as the health of the individual \n        changes;\n            ``(D) the identification of resources that an individual \n        may use to determine the requirements of the State in which \n        such individual resides so that the treatment wishes of that \n        individual will be carried out if the individual is unable to \n        communicate those wishes, including requirements regarding the \n        designation of a surrogate decision maker (health care proxy); \n        and\n            ``(E) whether or not the physician is willing to follow the \n        individual's wishes as expressed in an advance directive.''.\n            (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) \n        shall apply to initial preventive physical examinations \n        provided on or after January 1, 2008.\n    (d) Improvement of Policies Related to the Use and Portability of \nAdvance Directives.--\n            (1) Medicare.--Section 1866(f) of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(f)) is amended--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1)--\n                            (i) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``and \n                        if presented by the individual (or on behalf of \n                        the individual), to include the content of such \n                        advance directive in a prominent part of such \n                        record'' before the semicolon at the end;\n                            (ii) in subparagraph (D), by striking \n                        ``and'' after the semicolon at the end;\n                            (iii) in subparagraph (E), by striking the \n                        period at the end and inserting ``;

Nothing in this paragraph shall be \nconstrued to authorize the administration of medical treatment \notherwise prohibited by the laws of the State in which the directive is \npresented.\n    ``(B) The provisions of this paragraph shall preempt any State law \nto the extent such law is inconsistent with such provisions. The \nprovisions of this paragraph shall not preempt any State law that \nprovides for greater portability, more deference to a patient's wishes, \nor more latitude in determining a patient's wishes.''.\n            (2) Medicaid.--Section 1902(w) of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1396a(w)) is amended--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1)--\n                            (i) in subparagraph (B)--\n                                    (I) by striking ``in the \n                                individual's medical record'' and \n                                inserting ``in a prominent part of the \n                                individual's current medical record''; \n                                and\n                                    (II) by inserting ``and if \n                                presented by the individual (or on \n                                behalf of the individual), to include \n                                the content of such advance directive \n                                in a prominent part of such record'' \n                                before the semicolon at the end;\n                            (ii) in subparagraph (D), by striking \n                        ``and'' after the semicolon at the end;\n                            (iii) in subparagraph (E), by striking the \n                        period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and\n                            (iv) by inserting after subparagraph (E) \n                        the following new subparagraph:\n            ``(F) to provide each individual with the opportunity to \n        discuss issues relating to the information provided to that \n        individual pursuant to subparagraph (A) with an appropriately \n        trained professional.'';\n                    (B) in paragraph (4), by striking ``a written'' and \n                inserting ``an''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following paragraph:\n    ``(6)(A) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), a \nprovider or organization (as the case may be) shall give effect to an \nadvance directive executed outside the State in which such directive is \npresented, even one that does not appear to meet the formalities of \nexecution, form, or language required by the State in which it is \npresented to the same extent as such provider or organization would \ngive effect to an advance directive that meets such requirements, \nexcept that a provider or organization may decline to honor such a \ndirective if the provider or organization can reasonably demonstrate \nthat it is not an authentic expression of the individual's wishes \nconcerning his or her health care.
