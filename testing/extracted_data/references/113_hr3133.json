FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Leading legal scholars concur that conflicts between \n        same-sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be \n        legislatively addressed.\n            (2) As the President stated in response to the decision of \n        the United States Supreme Court on the Defense of Marriage Act \n        in 2013, ``Americans hold a wide range of views'' on the issue \n        of same-sex marriage, and ``maintaining our Nation's commitment \n        to religious freedom'' is ``vital''.\n            (3) Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion \n        is a Government interest of the highest order. Legislatively \n        enacted measures advance this interest by remedying, deterring, \n        and preventing Government interference with religious exercise \n        in a way that complements the protections mandated by the First \n        Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n            (4) Laws that protect the free exercise of religious \n        beliefs about marriage will encourage private citizens and \n        institutions to demonstrate similar tolerance and therefore \n        contribute to a more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Federal Government shall not take an adverse \naction against a person, on the basis that such person acts in \naccordance with a religious belief that marriage is or should be \nrecognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that sexual \nrelations are properly reserved to such a marriage.\n    (b) Adverse Action Defined.--As used in subsection (a), an adverse \naction means any action taken by the Federal Government--\n            (1) acting through the Administrator of the Internal \n        Revenue Service, to--\n                    (A) deny or revoke an exemption from taxation under \n                section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of \n                such person; or\n                    (B) disallow a deduction for Federal tax purposes \n                of any charitable contribution made to or by such \n                person;\n            (2) to deny or exclude such person from receiving any \n        Federal grant, contract, cooperative agreement, loan, license, \n        certification, accreditation, employment, or other similar \n        position or status;\n            (3) to deny or withhold from such person any benefit under \n        a Federal benefit program; or\n            (4) to otherwise discriminate against such person.\n\nSEC. 4. JUDICIAL RELIEF.\n\n    (a) Cause of Action.--A person may assert an actual or threatened \nviolation of this Act as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding \nand obtain compensatory damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, \nor any other appropriate relief against the Federal Government. \nStanding to assert a claim or defense under this section shall be \ngoverned by the general rules of standing under article III of the \nConstitution.\n    (b) Attorneys' Fees.--Section 722(b) of the Revised Statutes (42 \nU.S.C. 1988(b)) is amended by inserting ``Marriage and Religious \nFreedom Act,'' after ``the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \nPersons Act of 2000,''.\n    (c) Authority of United States To Enforce This Act.--The Attorney \nGeneral of the United States may bring an action for injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief to enforce compliance with this Act. Nothing in this \nsubsection shall be construed to deny, impair, or otherwise affect any \nright or authority of the Attorney General, the United States, or any \nagency, officer, or employee of the United States, acting under any law \nother than this subsection, to institute or intervene in any \nproceeding.\n\nSEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) Broad Construction.--This Act shall be construed in favor of a \nbroad protection of religious beliefs, to the maximum extent permitted \nby the terms of this Act and the Constitution.\n    (b) No Preemption, Repeal, or Narrow Construction.--Nothing in this \nAct shall be construed to preempt State law, or repeal Federal law, \nthat is equally as protective of religious beliefs as, or more \nprotective of religious beliefs than, this Act. Nothing in this Act \nshall be considered to construe any State or Federal law protecting \nreligious beliefs more narrowly than such law otherwise would be \nconstrued.\n    (c) Severability.--If any provision of this Act or any application \nof such provision to any person or circumstance is held to be \nunconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the application of the \nprovision to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Federal benefit program.--The term ``Federal benefit \n        program'' has the meaning given that term in section 552a of \n        title 5, United States Code.\n            (2) Federal government.--The term ``Federal Government'' \n        includes a branch, department, agency, instrumentality, or \n        official of the United States.\n            (3) Person.--The term ``person'' has the meaning given such \n        term in section 1 of title 1, United States Code, and includes \n        any person regardless of religious affiliation or lack thereof, \n        and regardless of for-profit or nonprofit status."
