FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While landslides can and do occur in every State and \n        territory of the United States, the type, including sink holes, \n        ground fissures, and subsidence, the severity, and frequency of \n        landslides vary from place to place, depending on the terrain, \n        geology, seismicity and climate.\n            (2) Landslides in the United States cause an estimated \n        $3,000,000,000 in damage each year, and that estimation could \n        be improved through better tracking of landslide occurrences \n        and losses.\n            (3) The most recent official estimate of deaths from \n        landslides in the United States was in 1985, and it found that \n        landslides kill an estimated 25 to 50 people each year.\n            (4) On March 22, 2014, a massive landslide near Oso, \n        Washington, killed 43 people, engulfed 42 homes, and severely \n        damaged public infrastructure and private property.\n            (5) There is no collective landslide inventory for most \n        counties, States, or the United States, nor is there an agreed-\n        upon methodology for creating one, since the availability of \n        Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), a powerful tool for \n        creating landslide inventories, is uneven and the quality is \n        highly variable.\n            (6) Because landslide hazard analysis continues to evolve, \n        developing analysis methods is an important element of \n        technical assistance for nongovernmental entities and State and \n        local governments.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL LANDSLIDE HAZARDS REDUCTION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting through \nthe Director of the United States Geological Survey, shall establish a \nnational program to identify landslide hazards and reduce losses from \nlandslides through activities under this section.\n    (b) USGS Program Activities.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Director of the United States Geological Survey, shall--\n            (1) develop a national strategy for research on landslides \n        and landslide hazards;\n            (2) develop and maintain a landslide hazard assessment \n        system to identify, map, and assess landslide hazards;\n            (3) in coordination with the State Geological Surveys, USGS \n        shall conduct Federal-State working groups to establish \n        regional priorities for identifying, mapping, and assessing \n        landslide hazards as well as develop and implement guidelines \n        for geologists and geological and geotechnical engineers;\n            (4) develop and maintain a national landslide hazard \n        inventory database;\n            (5) compile, maintain, and evaluate data on--\n                    (A) the nationwide impact of landslides on health \n                and safety, the economy, and the environment;
