DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Tribe'' means the Swan Creek and Black River \n        Confederated Ojibwa Tribes of Michigan;\n            (2) the term ``member'' means an individual who is eligible \n        for enrollment in the Tribe pursuant to section 4; and\n            (3) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n        Interior.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Tribe is the descendant of, and political successor \n        to, the signatories of the 1785 Treaty of McIntosh (7 Stat. \n        16); the 1789 Treaty of Fort Harmar (7 Stat. 28); the 1795 \n        Treaty of Greenville (7 Stat. 49); the 1805 Treaty with the \n        Wyandot (7 Stat. 87); the 1807 Treaty of Detroit (7 Stat. 105); \n        the 1808 Treaty of Detroit (7 Stat. 112); the Treaty of 1815 (7 \n        Stat. 131); the Treaty of 1816 (7 Stat. 146); the Treaty of \n        1817 (7 Stat. 160); the Treaty of 1833 (7 Stat. 431); the 1836 \n        Treaty of Washington (7 Stat. 503); the 1855 Treaty of Detroit \n        (11 Stat. 633); and the Treaty of 1864 (14 Stat. 657).\n            (2) The aboriginal lands of the Tribe comprise the area \n        which is now known as Monroe, Shiawassee, Lenawee, Wayne, \n        Oakland, Macomb, St. Clair, Lapeer, Sanilac, Livingston, \n        Washtenaw, Genesee, and Tuscola Counties in southeastern lower \n        Michigan. The boundaries of the Tribe's aboriginal lands extend \n        from Monroe County in the Southeast, to Sanilac County in the \n        North, to Genesee County in the West.\n            (3) The cession treaties, from the 1807 Treaty of Detroit \n        through the 1836 Treaty of Washington, legitimated seizure of \n        tribal lands by settlers, forced the Tribe to relinquish most \n        of its rich aboriginal lands in southeastern Michigan, \n        relegating the Tribe to small tracts of land in Macomb, Wayne, \n        Washtenaw, and St. Clair counties in Michigan, and its members \n        to small annuity payments by the United States.\n            (4) The 1836 Treaty of Washington compelled the Tribe to \n        relinquish the small tracts of land granted in the 1807 Treaty \n        of Detroit, purportedly in exchange for future annuity payments \n        and an equivalent amount of land in Kansas. The 1807 treaty did \n        not require the Tribe to relocate to the lands in Kansas and \n        only 51 members actually did so. According to the 1845 United \n        States Richmond census documents, the majority of the Tribe \n        migrated north to Lapeer County, Michigan or remained in the \n        counties of Macomb, Wayne, Washtenaw, and St. Clair.\n            (5) Pursuant to the 1855 Treaty of Detroit, members of the \n        Tribe were requested to relocate from their homes in Lapeer, \n        Macomb, Wayne, Washtenaw, and St. Clair counties in Michigan to \n        non-aboriginal lands further north in Isabella County, \n        Michigan, where tribal members were entitled to individual land \n        allotments. Many members remained in Lapeer, Macomb, Wayne, \n        Washtenaw, and St. Clair counties. For the administrative \n        convenience of the Federal Government, the 1855 Treaty of \n        Detroit also relocated the Saginaw Band of Chippewa Indians, \n        including some Potowatomis and Ottawas to the newly-established \n        reservation lands in Isabella County. Article 6 of that treaty \n        also provided that the organization of the Tribe and of the \n        Saginaw Band of Chippewa Indians was dissolved, ``except so far \n        as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect'' \n        the provisions of the treaty.\n            (6) Another 1855 Treaty of Detroit (11 Stat. 624) similarly \n        grouped different bands of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians for \n        administrative convenience. Article 5 of that treaty provided \n        for dissolution of the organization of these bands except so \n        far as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect \nthe provisions of that treaty. Subsequent judicial interpretation of \nthat article determined that its intent was to dissolve the Federal \nGovernment's fictional coupling of these tribes, not to destroy their \nindependent sovereign existence. Public Law 103-324 confirmed this \ninterpretation by reaffirming the Federal recognition of the Little \nRiver Band of Ottawa Indians as a tribe separate and distinct from the \nChippewa Indians.\n            (7) The Treaty of 1864 confirmed continued Federal \n        acknowledgement of the Tribe by specifically naming the Swan \n        Creek and Black River Chippewas in that treaty's preamble.\n            (8) Over time and without justification, the Federal \n        Government unilaterally withdrew from the Federal relationship \n        established with the Tribe through the aforementioned treaties. \n        The Tribe brought suit against the Federal Government for \n        amounts past due under the treaties. In 1910 and 1924, the \n        Congress enacted jurisdictional acts (36 Stat. 829 and 43 Stat. \n        137, respectively) to enable the Tribe and the Saginaw Band of \n        Chippewa to file their respective claims against the United \n        States. These claims, filed in 1927, were later incorporated \n        into Indian Claims Commission Dockets 57, 59, and 13-E, and \n        United Claims Court Docket 13-F.\n            (9) Beginning in 1935, the Tribe petitioned for \n        reorganization and assistance pursuant to the Act of June 18, \n        1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq., commonly referred to as the \n        ``Indian Reorganization Act''). Due to misinterpretation of \n        Article 6 of the 1855 Treaty of Detroit, the Commissioner of \n        Indian Affairs concluded that the Tribe could not organize \n        separately from the Saginaw Band of Chippewa Indians. Due to \n        the lack of funding available for tribal land acquisition, the \n        Swan Creek Black River Ojibwa Bands were unable to purchase \n        their own reservation lands.\n            (10) In 1939, agents of the Federal Government made an \n        administrative decision not to provide services or extend the \n        benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act to any additional \n        Indian tribes located in Michigan's lower peninsula, as \n        recognized by the 1807 Treaty of Detroit (7 Stat. 105), the \n        1819 Treaty of Saginaw (7 Stat. 203), the March 28, 1836 Treaty \n        of Washington (7 Stat. 491), and the May 9, 1836 Treaty of \n        Washington (7 Stat. 503).\n            (11) In 1986, Congress enacted Public Law 99-346 (100 Stat. \n        674) to distribute judgment funds awarded in settlement of the \n        claims brought by the Tribe and the Saginaw Band in Dockets 57, \n        59, 13-E, and 13-F in a nondiscriminatory manner to the \n        claimants and their descendants. This Act, like the \n        jurisdictional Acts of 1910 and 1924, contained no clear and \n        unambiguous intent to terminate the Federal relationship with \n        the Tribe. To the contrary, these Acts acknowledged that the \n        Tribe possessed collective sovereign rights in tribal lands and \n        funds, a primary criterion for Federal recognition.\n            (12) Despite administrative denials of requests by the \n        Tribe to organize its own federally recognized tribal \n        government, the Tribe continued to carry out its governmental \n        functions through various formal and informal political and \n        social structures, including a Tribal Council. Between 1937 and \n        1991, the Tribe conducted many of its government functions \n        through associations organized by Swan Creek members, including \n        the Saginaw Rural and Urban Indian Association. In 1991, the \n        Tribe chartered a State-sanctioned, non-profit tribal \n        government and agreed to seek Federal recognition of its \n        confederation of Swan Creek and Black River Ojibwa Bands as a \n        distinct tribe.\n            (13) Other tribes in Michigan, whose members are \n        descendants of the signatories to one or more of the treaties \n        listed in paragraph (1) have been recognized by the Federal \n        Government as distinct Indian tribes, including the Pokagon \n        Band of Potawatomi Indians, the Huron Potawatomi Band of \n        Indians, the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa \n        Indians, the Sault St. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, the Bay \n        Mills Band of Chippewa Indians, the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe of \n        Michigan, and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians.\n            (14) The Tribe has at least 300 eligible members who \n        continue to reside close to what was recognized in the 1807 \n        Treaty of Detroit as their ancestral homelands in southeastern \n        lower Michigan.\n            (15) The United States Government, the government of the \n        State of Michigan, and local governments have had continuous \n        dealings with the recognized political leaders of the Tribe \n        since 1785.\n            (16) In light of the treaty relations between the Tribe and \n        the United States, the Tribe's recognition as a tribe in Acts \n        of Congress, and Federal recognition of the Tribe's rights in \n        tribal lands and funds, it is appropriate for Congress to \n        reaffirm and clarify the Federal relationship of the Tribe in \n        the same manner as Congress has reaffirmed Federal recognition \n        of the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, \nthe Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, the Little Traverse Bay Bands \nof Odawa Indians, and the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians.\n\nSEC. 4.
