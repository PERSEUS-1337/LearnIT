FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2002, 44,000,000 Americans were without health \n        insurance for the entire year, and the vast majority of these \n        uninsured people are in working families.\n            (2) The number of employees in a business greatly affects \n        the likelihood of whether or not its employees are offered \n        health insurance. In 2003, 98 percent of firms with over 200 \n        employees offered health benefits, while only 55 percent of \n        firms with under 10 workers did.\n            (3) Among uninsured workers in 2001, over half held jobs \n        with companies having fewer than 100 employees.\n            (4) The cost of health insurance for employers is very \n        high. On average, in 2003, the total cost of an individual \n        health plan was $3,383, of which the employee paid an average \n        of $508 and the employer paid an average of $2875. For a family \n        policy, the average cost was $9,068, with the employer bearing \n        $6,656 and the employee shouldering $2,412.\n\nSEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE \n              EXPENSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to refundable credits) \nis amended by redesignating section 36 as section 37 and inserting \nafter section 35 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 36. SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES.\n\n    ``(a) Determination of Amount.--In the case of a qualified small \nemployer, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by
