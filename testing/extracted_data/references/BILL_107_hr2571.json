FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since World War II, the conventional wisdom among \n        educators has been that larger schools are better than smaller \n        schools, and as a result the number of secondary schools in the \n        United States has declined by 70 percent and the average school \n        size has grown to 5 times the previous average size. According \n        to the Department of Education, 70 percent of high school \n        students in 2000 attended schools with more than 1,000 \n        students.\n            (2) Over the past few years, educators have begun to \n        question the belief that larger schools are always better. The \n        National Association of Secondary School Principals recently \n        recommended that the high school of the 21st century be much \n        more student-centered and, above all, much more personalized in \n        programs, support services, and intellectual rigor. Underlying \n        this recommendation are the Association's beliefs that students \n        take more interest in school when they have a sense of \n        belonging and that students benefit from a more intimate \n        setting in which their presence is more readily and repeatedly \n        acknowledged.\n            (3) The National Association of Secondary School Principals \n        warns that the ``bigness'' of high schools shrouds many young \n        people in what the Association calls ``a cloak of anonymity''. \n        To counteract this effect, the Association recommends that high \n        schools--\n                    (A) restructure their layouts and schedules so that \n                students are no longer invisible and able to ``melt \n                into their surroundings'';\n                    (B) limit their enrollments to units of not more \n                than 600 students, either by constructing new buildings \n                or by creating schools-within-a-school; and\n                    (C) change the relationship between teachers and \n                students by reducing the number of class changes \n                students are required to make each day and by allowing \n                teachers to spend more time with smaller numbers of \n                students.\n            (4) Research shows that larger schools tend to stratify \n        students into different tracks, which are often based on \n        children's educational and social backgrounds. The result is \n        inequitable educational outcomes, because at larger schools the \n        gap between the educational achievement of high-achieving and \n        low-achieving students is greater than at smaller schools.\n            (5) Research shows that--\n                    (A) in smaller, more personalized, and less \n                bureaucratic schools, the gap between high-achieving \n                and low-achieving students is smaller;\n                    (B) students in smaller schools perform better in \n                the core subjects of reading, mathematics, history, and \n                science;\n                    (C) students in smaller schools are more engaged in \n                their courses;\n                    (D) smaller schools have higher attendance rates \n                and higher rates of participation in school activities; \n                and\n                    (E) because achievement levels in smaller schools \n                are more equitably distributed, students who come from \n                more disadvantaged economic and educational backgrounds \n                show the greatest achievement gains in smaller schools.\n            (6) In 2000, the Bank Street College of Education conducted \n        a study, entitled ``Small Schools: Great Strides'', of more \n        than 150 small schools in Chicago, Illinois. In the study, \n        researchers found the following:\n                    (A) Small schools generated measurable benefits \n                (including higher attendance rates, grade point \n                averages, and graduation rates) even among the most \n                academically disadvantaged students.\n                    (B) Teachers and parents reported greater \n                satisfaction with small schools.\n                    (C) Teachers found that small schools offer a \n                stronger, more collaborative professional learning \n                community and provide opportunities to know students \n                better and to take greater responsibility for their \n                achievement.\n                    (D) Parents found that small schools are more \n                accessible, more responsive, and safer.\n            (7) According to a recent study of 13,600 schools in \n        Georgia, Montana, Ohio, and Texas--\n                    (A) in smaller schools the harmful effects of \n                poverty on student achievement were greatly reduced; \n                and\n                    (B) in poorer Texas communities, larger schools had \n                significantly lower test scores than smaller schools.\n            (8) Research shows that smaller schools are safer and that \n        students in smaller schools are less likely to join gangs. \n        According to the 1999 report entitled ``Indicators of School \n        Crime and Safety'' issued by the National Center for Education \n        Statistics and the Bureau of Justice Statistics--\n                    (A) the number of criminal acts committed at school \n                and number of incidents of school violence were much \n                lower in schools enrolling between 300 to 1,000 \n                students than in larger schools regardless of location \n                in urban, suburban, or rural areas; and\n                    (B) on the urban fringe, at schools within \n                metropolitan areas but not in the areas' central \n                cities, larger schools experienced as many as 4 times \n                as many incidents of serious violence per 1,000 \n                students than smaller schools.\n            (9) Many States and local educational agencies are \n        implementing strategies to reduce the size of their schools, \n        including Florida, where in 2000 Governor Jeb Bush signed a \n        school safety bill that required new schools to serve smaller \n        student populations. The legislation limited new high schools \n        to 900 students.\n\nSEC. 3.
