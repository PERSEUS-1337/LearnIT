FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in section 1103(a)(2) of the Water Resources \n        Development Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 4225), Congress recognized \n        the Upper Mississippi River System as ``a nationally \n        significant ecosystem and a nationally significant commercial \n        navigation system'' and declared that the system ``shall be \n        administered and regulated in recognition of its several \n        purposes'';\n            (2) inaction on construction of new locks will lead to \n        economic decline, and inaction on implementation of an enhanced \n        ecosystem restoration program will lead to further \n        environmental decline;\n            (3) the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway carry \n        approximately 60 percent of the corn exports of the United \n        States and 45 percent of the soybean exports of the United \n        States, providing a significant positive balance of trade \n        benefit for the Nation;\n            (4) the movement of more than 100,000,000 tons of product \n        supports 400,000 full- and part-time jobs in the United States, \n        generating over $4,000,000,000 in income and $12,000,000,000 to \n        $15,000,000,000 in economic activity;\n            (5) Midwestern utilities use coal, the second largest \n        category of cargo shipped on the Upper Mississippi River \n        System, to produce cost-efficient energy;\n            (6) keeping the cost of transportation lower through \n        competition between transportation modes is the United States \n        farmer's competitive advantage in capturing future global \n        growth in agricultural exports;\n            (7) United States farm and trade policies work to open \n        world markets and promote United States exports, and water \n        resource policy has provided a low-cost transportation \n        alternative to other modes;\n            (8) the Department of Agriculture projects that corn \n        exports will grow 44 percent over the next decade, with a \\1/3\\ \n        increase in growth exported through the Gulf of Mexico;\n            (9) United States exports of soybeans and soybean products \n        topped 1,000,000,000 bushels for the third straight year in \n        2003, with roughly 75 percent exported through the Port of New \n        Orleans via the Mississippi waterways and its tributaries;\n            (10) those transportation savings--\n                    (A) provide higher income to farmers and rural \n                communities; and\n                    (B) generate Federal and State taxes to support \n                community activities, quality of life, and national \n                benefits;\n            (11) the construction of new 1,200-foot locks and lock \n        extensions will provide more than 48,000,000 man-hours of \n        employment over 10 to 15 years;\n            (12) foreign competitors have worked over the last 10 years \n        to improve foreign transportation infrastructure to compete \n        more effectively with United States production;\n            (13) the inland waterway transportation system moves 16 \n        percent of the freight in the United States for 2 percent of \n        the cost, including more than 100,000,000 tons on the Upper \n        Mississippi River System;\n            (14) the Department of Transportation projects that freight \n        congestion on the roads and rails in the United States will \n        double in the next 25 years and that water transportation will \n        need to play an increasing role in moving freight;\n            (15) the movement of 100,000,000 tons on the river system \n        in 4,400 15-barge tows out of harms way would require an \n        equivalent of 4,000,000 trucks or 1,000,000 rail cars moving \n        directly through our communities;\n            (16) econometric models are useful analytic tools to \n        provide valuable information, but are unable to account for \n        every market trend, development, and public policy impact;\n            (17) the current capacity of the Upper Mississippi River \n        System is--\n                    (A) declining by 10 percent annually because of \n                unplanned closures of a 70-year old infrastructure; and\n                    (B) reducing the potential for sustained growth;\n            (18) the current 600-foot lock system was designed for \n        steamboats, at a time when 4,000,000 tons moved on the \n        Mississippi River and a total of 2,000,000,000 bushels of corn \n        were produced nationally, compared to today, when 100,000,000 \n        to 120,000,000 tons are shipped and the national production of \n        corn exceeds 10,000,000,000 bushels;\n            (19) the 600-foot locks at Locks and Dam Nos. 20, 21, 22, \n        24, and 25 on the Upper Mississippi River and LaGrange and \n        Peoria on the Illinois Waterway are operating at 80 percent \n        utilization and are unable to provide for or process \n        effectively the volatile growth of traditional export grain \n        markets;\n            (20) based on the current construction schedule of new \n        locks and dams on the inland system, lock modernization will \n        need to take place over 30 years, starting immediately, as an \n        imperative to avoid lost export grain sales and diminished \n        national competitiveness;\n            (21) the Corps of Engineers has been studying the needs for \n        national investments on the Upper Mississippi River System for \n        the last 15 years and has based initial recommendations on the \n        best available information and science;\n            (22) the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers ecosystem \n        consists of hundreds of thousands of acres of bottomland \n        forests, islands, backwaters, side channels, and wetlands;\n            (23) the river ecosystem is home to 270 species of birds, \n        57 species of mammals, 45 species of amphibians and reptiles, \n        113 species of fish, and nearly 50 species of mussels;\n            (24) more than 40 percent of migratory waterfowl and \n        shorebirds in North America depend on the river for food, \n        shelter, and habitat during migration;\n            (25) the annual operation of the Upper Mississippi River \n        Basin needs to take into consideration opportunities for \n        ecosystem restoration;\n            (26) development since the 1930s has altered and reduced \n        the biological diversity of the large flood plain river systems \n        of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers;\n            (27) Congress recognizes the need for significant Federal \n        investment in the restoration of the Upper Mississippi and \n        Illinois River ecosystems;\n            (28) the Upper Mississippi River System provides important \n        economic benefits from recreational and tourist uses, resulting \n        in the basin's receiving more visitors annually than most \n        National Parks, with the ecosystems and wildlife being the main \n        attractions;\n            (29) the Upper Mississippi River System--\n                    (A) includes 284,688 acres of National Wildlife \n                Refuge land that is managed as habitat for migratory \n                birds, fish, threatened and endangered species, and a \n                diverse assortment of other species and related \n                habitats; and\n                    (B) provides many recreational opportunities; and\n            (30) the Upper Mississippi River System also includes over \n        975,000 acres of land protected by levees and needs a balanced \n        ecosystem restoration program that adequately considers the \n        existing network of flood control infrastructure that protects \n        thousands of homes and businesses.\n\nSEC. 2.
