FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young \n        children require access to specialized early intervention \n        providers and programs in order to help them meet their \n        linguistic and cognitive potential.\n            (2) Families of deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, \n        and young children benefit from comprehensive early \n        intervention programs that assist them in supporting their \n        child's development in all domains.\n            (3) Best practices principles for early intervention for \n        deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children \n        have been identified in a range of areas, including listening \n        and spoken language and visual and signed language acquisition, \n        family-to-family support, support from individuals who are deaf \n        or hard-of-hearing, progress monitoring, and others.\n            (4) Effective hearing screening and early intervention \n        programs must be in place to identify hearing levels in deaf \n        and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children so \n        that they may access appropriate early intervention programs in \n        a timely manner.\n\nSEC. 3.
