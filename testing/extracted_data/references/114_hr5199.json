Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Congressional findings.\nSec. 3. Design-build construction process improvement.\nSec. 4. Prohibition on the use of a reverse auction for the award of a \n                            contract for design and construction \n                            services.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The acquisition procedures that are often used \n        effectively to procure products and other forms of services are \n        not always appropriate for procurement of design and \n        construction services.\n            (2) Federal procurement officials often adopt contracting \n        techniques from the private sector and have used those \n        techniques effectively to procure products and services.\n            (3) Design-build is a procurement technique Federal \n        officials have adopted from the private sector that has worked \n        well for procurement of design and construction services.\n            (4) The current statutory framework for design-build could \n        benefit from legislative refinement.\n            (5) Reverse auctions are another procurement technique \n        Federal officials have adopted from the private sector and used \n        successfully to award contracts for the purchase of products \n        that are commercially equivalent to commodities.\n            (6) Despite their success in other contexts, reverse \n        auctions are generally inappropriate for procurement of design \n        and construction services, given the unique nature of each such \n        project.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION PROCESS IMPROVEMENT.\n\n    (a) Civilian Contracts.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 3309(b) of title 41, United States \n        Code, is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(b) Criteria for Use.--\n            ``(1) Contracts with a value of at least $750,000  \n        $3,000,000.--Two-phase selection procedures shall be used for \n        entering into a contract for the design and construction of a \n        public building, facility, or work when a contracting officer \n        determines that the project has a value of $750,000 $3,000,000 \n        or greater, as adjusted for inflation in accordance with \n        section 1908 of this title.\n            ``(2) Contracts with a value less than $750,000 \n        $3,000,000.--For projects that a contracting officer determines \n        have a value of less than $750,000 $3,000,000, the contracting \n        officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection \n        procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract \n        for the design and construction of a public building, facility, \n        or work when--\n                    ``(A) the contracting officer anticipates that 3 or \n                more offers will be received for the contract;\n                    ``(B) design work must be performed before an \n                offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for the \n                contract;\n                    ``(C) the offeror will incur a substantial amount \n                of expense in preparing the offer; and\n                    ``(D) the contracting officer has considered \n                information such as--\n                            ``(i) the extent to which the project \n                        requirements have been adequately defined;\n                            ``(ii) the time constraints for delivery of \n                        the project;\n                            ``(iii) the capability and experience of \n                        potential contractors;\n                            ``(iv) the suitability of the project for \n                        use of the two-phase selection procedures;\n                            ``(v) the capability of the agency to \n                        manage the two-phase selection process; and\n                            ``(vi) other criteria established by the \n                        agency.''.\n            (2) Annual reports.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than November 30 of \n                2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, the head of each \n                agency shall compile an annual report of each instance \n                in which the agency awarded a design-build contract \n                pursuant to section 3309 of title 41, United States \n                Code, during the fiscal year ending in such calendar \n                year, in which--\n                            (i) more than 5 finalists were selected for \n                        phase-two requests for proposals; or\n                            (ii) the contract or order was awarded \n                        without using two-phase selection procedures.\n                    (B) Public availability.--The Director of the \n                Office of Management and Budget shall facilitate public \n                access to the reports, including by posting them on a \n                publicly available Internet website.
