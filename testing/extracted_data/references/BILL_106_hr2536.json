FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) San Francisco Bay is a vital environmental, industrial, \n        and recreational resource to the San Francisco Bay area and to \n        the Nation.\n            (2) Over 800 tank vessels enter San Francisco Bay each \n        year, carrying hundreds of millions of gallons of oil and other \n        hazardous substances.\n            (3) The small oil spill of October 28, 1996, showed that \n        even small oil spills in San Francisco Bay are both costly to \n        mitigate and harmful to the environment, including fish, \n        mammals, and birds.\n            (4) Because of the bathymetry of San Francisco Bay, the \n        Coast Guard has been unable to make needed improvements in the \n        routing of tankers and other deep draft vessels.\n            (5) The presence of multiple underwater hazards less than \n        40 feet below the surface and in close proximity to shipping \n        lanes, combined with increased traffic of tankers with drafts \n        in excess of 45 feet, significantly increase the likelihood of \n        collisions or groundings that would result in the release of \n        substantial amounts of oil or other hazardous substances, \n        severely damaging both the economy and the environment of the \n        San Francisco Bay area.\n            (6) Removing hazards to navigation to allow greater \n        separation of vessels carrying oil or other hazardous \n        substances is a simple and economical step that can be taken to \n        reduce substantially the risk of oil pollution, improve the \n        safety of navigation, and reduce threats to the fish, wildlife, \n        and environment of San Francisco Bay.\n\nSEC. 3. NAVIGATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Army shall develop and carry \nout in accordance with this section a navigation project in San \nFrancisco Bay, California, to remove underwater hazards to navigation \nin the vicinity of Alcatraz Island.\n    (b) Rerouting of Vessel Traffic.--In consultation with the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard, the Secretary shall design the \nnavigation project under this section to facilitate the rerouting of \nvessel traffic in San Francisco Bay to minimize the risk of an oil or \nhazardous substance spill resulting from collisions between vessels or \nwith an underwater hazard.\n    (c) Minimization of Impact.--In developing and carrying out the \nnavigation project under this section, the Secretary shall minimize, to \nthe maximum extent practicable, impacts on the environment and on \ncommercial and recreational fisheries.\n    (d) Plan.--\n            (1) General requirement.--In consultation with appropriate \n        Federal, State, and local government agencies and in accordance \n        with applicable Federal and State environmental laws, the \n        Secretary shall develop a plan for implementation of the \n        navigation project under this section.\n            (2) Contents.--The plan shall include initial design and \n        engineering, underwater hazard removal, and, if needed, \n        environmental mitigation.\n            (3) Target dates.--\n                    (A) Feasibility study.--The first phase of the plan \n                shall be completed within 2 years of the date of the \n                enactment of this Act and shall consist of a \n                feasibility study for the project described in \n                subsection (a). The feasibility study shall include \n                scoping, development of alternative designs for the \n                project, cost-benefit analysis, and selection of final \n                project design. In conducting the cost-benefit analysis \n                and selecting a final project design, the Secretary \n                shall consider the economic and environmental benefits \n                of oil spill aversion reasonably to be expected from \n                the completion of the project.\n                    (B) Implementation.--The second phase of the plan \n                shall be completed not later than 4 years after the \n                date of the enactment of this Act and shall consist of \n                underwater hazard removal, transportation, and disposal \n                of the removed material in accordance with the final \n                project design.\n                    (C) Mitigation and monitoring.--The final phase of \n                the plan shall consist of any mitigation needed due to \n                environmental impacts, and environmental monitoring of \n                removal, disposal, and mitigation sites (if different \n                from the disposal site or sites), shall commence as \n                soon as is practicable after the completion of the \n                implementation phase and shall continue for not less \n                than 5 years thereafter.\n    (e) Non-Federal Participation.--\n            (1) Feasibility study.--The non-Federal share of the cost \n        of the feasibility study under this section shall be 50 \n        percent.\n            (2) Implementation.--The non-Federal share of the cost of \n        implementation of the project under this section shall be 25 \n        percent.\n    (f) Reports to Congress.--Not later than the last day of each of \nthe time periods referred to in subsection (d)(3), the Secretary shall \nreport to Congress on the progress being made toward development and \nimplementation of the project under this section.\n\nSEC. 4. MODIFICATION OF NAVIGATION LANES.\n\n    The Commandant of the Coast Guard shall modify navigation lanes and \nreroute vessel traffic after the completion of the second phase of the \nnavigation project under section 3 to improve the safety and efficiency \nof vessel traffic in San Francisco Bay, California. In carrying out \nthis section, the Commandant shall develop a vessel routing program \nthat minimizes the risk of an oil or hazardous substance spill in San \nFrancisco Bay.\n\nSEC. 5. OIL SPILL RISK ASSESSMENT.\n\n    (a) Survey.--In consultation with the Commandant of the Coast \nGuard, the Maritime Administrator shall ensure that operational vessels \nowned by, or vessels under contract to, the Maritime Administration are \nsurveyed for risks for oil spills or other hazards to human health or \nthe environment.\n    (b) Standards and Procedures.--In surveying vessels under this \nsection, the Commandant shall use the same standards and procedures as \nare used in inspecting similarly situated private vessels.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, the Commandant shall submit to Congress and the \nAdministrator of the Federal Maritime Administration a report \ndescribing any oil spill risks determined in the survey conducted under \nthis section and making recommendations for corrective actions for such \nrisks, including estimates of the costs of those actions.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    For fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1999, there are \nauthorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Army and the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard such sums as may be necessary to carry \nout their respective duties under this Act. Such sums shall remain \navailable until expended."
