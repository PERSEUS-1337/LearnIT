FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Diabetes self-management training, also called diabetes \n        education, provides critical knowledge and skills training to \n        patients with diabetes, helping them manage medications, \n        address nutritional issues, facilitate diabetes related problem \n        solving, and make other critical lifestyle changes to \n        effectively manage their diabetes.\n            (2) A certified diabetes educator is a State licensed or \n        registered health care professional who specializes in helping \n        people with diabetes develop the self-management skills needed \n        to stay healthy and avoid costly acute complications and \n        emergency care, as well as debilitating secondary conditions \n        caused by diabetes.\n            (3) Diabetes self-management training has been proven \n        effective in helping to reduce the risks and complications of \n        diabetes and is a vital component of an overall diabetes \n        treatment regimen. Patients under the care of a certified \n        diabetes educator are better able to control their diabetes and \n        improve their health status.\n            (4) Lifestyle changes, such as those taught by certified \n        diabetes educators, directly contribute to better glycemic \n        control and reduced complications from diabetes. Evidence shows \n        that the potential for prevention of the most serious medical \n        complications caused by diabetes to be as high as 90 percent \n        (blindness), 85 percent (amputations), and 50 percent (heart \n        disease and stroke) with proper medical treatment and active \n        self-management.\n            (5) Despite its effectiveness in reducing diabetes related \n        complications and associated costs, diabetes self-management \n        training has been recognized by policymakers as an \n        underutilized Medicare benefit. Enhancing access to diabetes \n        self-management training programs that are taught by Certified \n        Diabetes Educators is an important public policy goal that can \n        help improve health outcomes, ensure quality, and reduce \n        escalating diabetes-related health costs.\n\nSEC. 3.
