FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The States should recognize that the terms ``acquired \n        immune deficiency syndrome'' and ``AIDS'' are obsolete. In the \n        case of individuals who are infected with the human \n        immunodeficiency virus (commonly known as HIV), the more \n        important medical fact for the individuals and for the \n        protection of the public health is the fact of infection, and \n        not just the later development of AIDS (the stage at which the \n        infection causes symptoms). The term ``HIV disease'', meaning \n        infection with HIV regardless of whether the infection has \n        progressed to AIDS, more correctly defines the medical \n        condition.\n            (2) The medical, public health, political, and community \n        leadership must focus on the full course of HIV disease rather \n        than concentrating on later stages of the disease. Continual \n        focus on AIDS rather than the entire spectrum of HIV disease \n        has left our Nation unable to deal adequately with the \n        epidemic. Federal and State data collection efforts should \n        focus on obtaining data as early as possible after infection \n        occurs, while continuing to collect data on the symptomatic \n        stage of the disease.\n            (3) Recent medical breakthroughs may enable doctors to \n        treat HIV disease as a chronic disease rather than as a \n        terminal disease. Early intervention in the progression of the \n        infection is imperative to prolonging and improving the lives \n        of individuals with the disease.\n            (4) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        recommended partner notification as a primary prevention \n        service. The health needs of the general public, and the care \n        and protection of those who do not have the disease, should be \n        balanced with the needs of individuals with the disease in a \n        manner that allows for the infected individuals to receive \n        optimal medical care and for public health services to protect \n        the uninfected.\n            (5) Individuals with HIV disease have an obligation to \n        protect others from being exposed to HIV by avoiding behaviors \n        that place others at risk of becoming infected. The States \n        should have in effect laws providing that intentionally \n        infecting others with HIV is a felony.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF HIV-RELATED REQUIREMENTS IN MEDICAID PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1396 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in section 1902(a)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (61), by striking ``and'' after \n                the semicolon at the end;\n                    (B) in paragraph (62), by striking the period at \n                the end and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by inserting after paragraph (62) the following \n                paragraph:\n            ``(63) meet the requirements of section 1930A (relating to \n        the prevention of the transmission of the human \n        immunodeficiency virus, commonly known as HIV).''; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 1930 the following section:\n\n                  ``prevention of transmission of hiv\n\n    ``Sec. 1930A. (a) For purposes of section 1902(a)(63), a State plan \nmeets the requirements of this section if the plan demonstrates to the \nsatisfaction of the Secretary that the law or regulations of the State \nare in accordance with the following:\n            ``(1) The State requires that, in the case of a health \n        professional or other entity that provides for the performance \n        of a test for HIV on an individual, the entity confidentially \n        report positive test results to the State public health \n        officer, together with any additional necessary information, in \n        order to carry out the following purposes:\n                    ``(A) The performance of statistical and \n                epidemiological analyses of the incidence in the State \n                of cases of such disease.\n                    ``(B) The performance of statistical and \n                epidemiological analyses of the demographic \n                characteristics of the population of individuals in the \n                State who have the disease.\n                    ``(C) The assessment of the adequacy of preventive \n                services in the State with respect to the disease.\n                    ``(D) The performance of the functions required in \n                paragraph (2).\n            ``(2)(A) The State requires that the public health officer \n        of the State carry out a program of partner notification to \n        inform individuals that the individuals may have been exposed \n        to HIV. For purposes of this paragraph, the term `partner' \n        includes the sexual partners of individuals with HIV disease; \n        the partners of such individuals in the sharing of hypodermic \n        needles for the intravenous injection of drugs; and the \n        partners of such individuals in the sharing of any drug-related \n        paraphernalia determined by the Secretary to place such \n        partners at risk of HIV infection.\n            ``(B) The State requires that any information collected for \n        purposes of partner notification be sufficient for the \n        following purposes:\n                            ``(i) To provide the partners of the \n                        individual with HIV disease with an appropriate \n                        opportunity to learn that the partners have \n                        been exposed to HIV.\n                            ``(ii) To provide the partners with \n                        counseling and testing for HIV disease.\n                            ``(iii) To provide the individual who has \n                        the disease with information regarding \n                        therapeutic measures for preventing and \n                        treating the deterioration of the immune system \n                        and conditions arising from the disease, and to \n                        provide the individual with other preventive \n                        information.\n                            ``(iv) With respect to an individual who \n                        undergoes testing for HIV disease but does not \n                        seek the results of the testing, and who has \n                        positive test results for the disease, to \n                        recall and provide the individual with \n                        counseling, therapeutic information, and other \ninformation regarding preventative health services appropriate for the \nindividual.\n            ``(C) The State cooperates with the Director of the Centers \n        for Disease Control and Prevention in carrying out a national \n        program of partner notification, including the sharing of \n        information between the public health officers of the States.\n            ``(3) With respect to a defendant against whom an \n        information or indictment is presented for a crime in which by \n        force or threat of force the perpetrator compels the victim to \n        engage in sexual activity, the State requires as follows:\n                    ``(A) That the defendant be tested for HIV disease \n                if--\n                            ``(i) the nature of the alleged crime is \n                        such that the sexual activity would have placed \n                        the victim at risk of becoming infected with \n                        HIV;

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INTENTIONAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the States should have in \neffect laws providing that, in the case of an individual who knows that \nhe or she has HIV disease, it is a felony for the individual to infect \nanother with HIV if the individual engages in the behaviors involved \nwith the intent of so infecting the other individual.\n\nSEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that strict confidentiality should \nbe maintained in carrying out the provisions of section 1930A of the \nSocial Security Act (as added by section 3(a) of this Act)."
