FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Career members of the uniformed services and their \n        families endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n        extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-year \n        careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n            (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n        are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the current \n        Global War on Terrorism, but also during the wars of the last \n        60 years when current retired members of the Armed Forces were \n        on continuous call to go in harm's way when and as needed.\n            (3) The demands and sacrifices are such that few Americans \n        are willing to bear or accept them for a multi-decade career.\n            (4) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n        sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n        extraordinary retirement benefits that a grateful Nation \n        provides for those who choose to subordinate much of their \n        personal life to the national interest for so many years.\n            (5) Many private sector firms are curtailing health \n        benefits and shifting significantly higher costs to their \n        employees, and one effect of such curtailment is that retired \n        members of the uniformed services are turning for health care \n        services to the Department of Defense, and its TRICARE program, \n        for the health care benefits in retirement that they earned by \n        their service in uniform.\n            (6) In some cases, civilian employers establish financial \n        incentives for employees who are also eligible for \n        participation in the TRICARE program to receive health care \n        benefits under that program rather than under the health care \n        benefits programs of such employers.\n            (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n        to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, a \n        large part of those efforts has been devoted to shifting a \n        larger share of the costs of benefits under that program to \n        retired members of the uniformed services.\n            (8) The cumulative increase in enrollment fees, \n        deductibles, and copayments being proposed by the Department of \n        Defense for health care benefits under the TRICARE program far \n        exceeds the 33-percent increase in military retired pay since \n        such fees, deductibles, and copayments were first required on \n        the part of retired members of the uniformed services 11 years \n        ago.\n            (9) Proposals of the Department of Defense for increases in \n        the enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments of retired \n        members of the uniformed services who are participants in the \n        TRICARE program fail to recognize adequately that such members \n        paid the equivalent of enormous in-kind premiums for health \n        care in retirement through their extended sacrifices by service \n        in uniform.\n            (10) Some of the Nation's health care providers refuse to \n        accept participants in the TRICARE program as patients because \n        that program pays them significantly less than commercial \n        insurance programs, and imposes unique administrative \n        requirements, for health care services.\n            (11) The Department of Defense has chosen to count the \n        accrual deposit to the Department of Defense Military Retiree \n        Health Care Fund against the budget of the Department of \n        Defense, contrary to the requirements of section 1116 of title \n        10, United States Code.\n            (12) Senior officials of the Department of Defense leaders \n        have reported to Congress that counting such deposits against \n        the budget of the Department of Defense is impinging on other \n        readiness needs of the Armed Forces, including weapons \n        programs, an inappropriate situation which section 1116 of \n        title 10, United States Code, was intended expressly to \n        prevent.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n        committed obligation to provide health care benefits to retired \n        members of the uniformed services that exceeds the obligation \n        of corporate employers to provide health care benefits to their \n        employees;\n            (2) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n        to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that do \n        not disadvantage retired members of the uniformed services who \n        participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE program, and \n        should pursue any and all such options rather than seeking \n        large increases for enrollment fees, deductibles, and \n        copayments for such retirees, and their families or survivors, \n        who do participate in that program;\n            (3) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n        copayments that may be considered under the TRICARE program for \n        retired members of the uniformed services and their families or \n        survivors should not in any case exceed the percentage increase \n        in military retired pay; and\n            (4) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n        copayments under the TRICARE program that may be considered for \n        members of the uniformed services who are currently serving on \n        active duty or in the Selected Reserve, and for the families of \n        such members, should not exceed the percentage increase in \n        basic pay for such members.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR \n              MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Pharmacy Benefits Program.--Section 1074g(a)(6) of title 10, \nUnited Stated Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubparagraph:\n    ``(C) The amount of any cost sharing requirements under this \nparagraph may not be increased in any year by a percentage that exceeds \nthe percentage increase of the most recent increase in retired pay for \nmembers of the armed forces under section 1401a(b)(2) of this title. To \nthe extent that such increase for any year is less than one dollar, the \naccumulated increase may be carried over from year to year, rounded to \nthe nearest dollar.''.\n    (b) Premiums for TRICARE Standard for Reserve Component Members Who \nCommit to Service in the Selected Reserve.--Section 1076d(d)(3) of such \ntitle is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``The monthly amount'' and inserting ``(A) \n        Subject to subparagraph (B), the monthly amount''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n    ``(B) Effective as of October 1, 2007, the percentage increase in \nthe amount of the premium in effect for a month for TRICARE Standard \ncoverage under this section may not exceed a percentage equal to the \npercentage of the most recent increase in the rate of basic pay \nauthorized for members of the uniformed services for a year.''.\n    (c) Copayments Under CHAMPUS.--Paragraph (3) of section 1086(b) of \nsuch title is amended in the first sentence by striking ``during the \nperiod beginning on April 1, 2006, and ending on September 30, 2007.'' \nand inserting ``after March 31, 2006''.\n    (d) Prohibition on Enrollment Fees for Certain Persons Under \nCHAMPUS.--Section 1086(b) of such title is further amended by adding at \nthe end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(5) A person covered by subsection (c) may not be charged \n        an enrollment fee for coverage under this section.''.\n    (e) Automatic Enrollment for Certain Persons Under CHAMPUS.--\nSection 1086(b) of such title is further amended by adding at the end \nthe following new paragraph:\n            ``(6) A person covered by subsection (c) shall not be \n        subject to denial of claims for coverage under this section for \n        failure to enroll for such coverage. To the extent enrollment \n        may be required, enrollment shall be automatic for any such \n        person filing a claim under this section.''.\n    (f) Premiums and Other Charges Under TRICARE.--Section 1097(e) of \nsuch title is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary of \n        Defense''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(2) Effective as of October 1, 2007, the percentage increase in \nthe amount of any premium, deductible, copayment or other charge \nprescribed by the Secretary under this subsection may not exceed the \npercentage increase of the most recent increase in retired pay for \nmembers and former members of the armed forces under section \n1041a(b)(2) of this title.''."
