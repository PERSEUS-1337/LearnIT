    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Consent Decree Fairness \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that the United States Supreme Court, in its \nunanimous decision in Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431 (2004), found the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Consent decrees may ``lead to federal court oversight \n        of state programs for long periods of time even absent an \n        ongoing violation of federal law,''. 540 U.S. 431, 441.\n            (2) ``If not limited to reasonable and necessary \n        implementations of federal law, remedies outlined in consent \n        decrees involving state officeholders may improperly deprive \n        future officials of their designated legislative and executive \n        powers.''. 540 U.S. 431, 441.\n            (3) ``The federal court must exercise its equitable powers \n        to ensure that when the objects of the decree have been \n        attained, responsibility for discharging the State's \n        obligations is returned promptly to the State and its \n        officials.''. 540 U.S. 431, 442.\n            (4) ``As public servants, the officials of the State must \n        be presumed to have a high degree of competence in deciding how \n        best to discharge their governmental responsibilities.''. 540 \n        U.S. 431, 442.\n            (5) ``A State, in the ordinary course, depends upon \n        successor officials, both appointed and elected, to bring new \n        insights and solutions to problems of allocating revenues and \n        resources. The basic obligations of federal law may remain the \n        same, but the precise manner of their discharge may not.''. 540 \n        U.S. 431, 442.\n\nSEC. 3.
