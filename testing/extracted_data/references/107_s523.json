    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Building Better Health Centers Act \nof 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many health care experts believe that Americans' lack \n        of access to basic health services is our single most pressing \n        health care problem. Nearly 50,000,000 Americans do not have \n        access to a primary care provider, whether they are insured or \n        not. In addition, 43,000,000 Americans lack health insurance \n        and have difficulty accessing care due to the inability to pay.\n            (2) Health centers, including community health centers, \n        migrant health centers, health centers for the homeless, and \n        public housing health centers, address the health care access \n        problem by providing primary care services in thousands of \n        rural and urban medically-underserved communities throughout \n        the United States.\n            (3) Health centers provide basic health care services to \n        more than 11,000,000 Americans, at least 7,000,000 minorities, \n        more than 600,000 farmworkers, and at least 600,000 homeless \n        individuals each year.\n            (4) Studies show that health centers provide high-quality \n        and cost-effective health care. The average yearly cost for a \n        health center patient is less than $1 per day.\n            (5) One of the most effective ways to address America's \n        health care access problem is by dramatically expanding access \n        to health centers, as both the Senate and the President have \n        proposed.\n            (6) Many existing health centers operate in facilities that \n        desperately need renovation or modernization. Thirty percent of \n        health centers are located in buildings that are more than 30 \n        years old, with 12 percent of such centers operating of \n        facilities that are more than 50 years old. In a recent survey \n        of health centers in 11 States, \\2/3\\ of those centers \n        identified a need to improve, expand, or replace their current \n        facility. An extrapolation based on this survey indicates there \n        may be as much as $1,200,000,000 in unmet capital needs in our \n        nation's health centers.\n            (7) Dramatically increasing access to health centers \n        requires building new facilities in communities that have \n        access problems and lack a health center right now.\n            (8) Health centers often do not have the means to pay for \n        capital improvements or new facilities. While most health \n        centers raise some funds through private donations, it is \n        difficult to raise sufficient amounts for capital needs without \n        a middle- and upper-class donor base similar to other nonprofit \n        organizations like universities and hospitals.\n            (9) Health centers also have a limited ability to support \n        loan payments. Due to an increasing number of uninsured \n        patients and the fact that many health care reimbursements are \n        less than the cost of care, health centers rarely have more \n        than minimal positive operating margins. Yet banks are rarely \n        willing to take risks on nonprofit organizations without these \n        positive margins.\n            (10) While the Federal government currently provides grants \n        to health centers to assist with operational expenses used to \n        provide care to a medically-underserved population, it does not \n        have the authority to provide grants to assist health centers \n        meet capital needs such as new facilities or renovation.\n            (11) To assist health centers with their mission of \n        providing health care to the medically underserved, the Federal \n        government should supplement local efforts to meet health \n        centers' capital needs.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 2546) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(r) Health Care Facility Grants and Loan Guarantees.--\n            ``(1) Program authorized.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary may award grants \n                to eligible health centers to pay for the costs \n                described in subparagraph (C).\n                    ``(B) Eligible health centers.--The term `eligible \n                health center' means any health center that is \n                receiving a grant under subsections (c)(1)(A), (e), \n                (f), (g), (h), or (i) on or after the date of enactment \n                of this subsection.\n                    ``(C) Limitation.--\n                            ``(i) In general.--A grant awarded under \n                        subparagraph (A) to expand or replace an \n                        existing facility or construct a new facility \n                        shall not exceed 75 percent of the total cost \n                        of the project (including interest payments) \n                        proposed by the eligible health center.\n                            ``(ii) Exception.--Clause (i) shall not \n                        apply if the total cost of the project proposed \n                        by the eligible health center is less than \n                        $750,000, or the Secretary waives the \n                        limitation described such clause upon a showing \n                        of good cause.\n                    ``(D) Use of funds.--An eligible health center that \n                receives a grant under subparagraph (A) shall use funds \n                received through such grant to--\n                            ``(i) acquire, lease, modernize, expand and \n                        replace existing facilities;\n                            ``(ii) construct new facilities; and\n                            ``(iii) purchase or lease equipment \n                        (including paying the costs of amortizing the \n                        principal of, and paying the interest on, leans \n                        for facilities and equipment) to support or \n                        further the operation of such center.\n            ``(2) Facility loan guarantees.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a \n                program under which the Secretary may guarantee 100 \n                percent of the principal and interest on loans made by \n                non-Federal lenders to health centers to pay for the \n                costs of acquiring, leasing, modernizing, expanding, or \n                replacing existing facilities, constructing new \n                facilities, or purchasing or leasing equipment, or \n                refinancing loans made for any of the purposes listed \n                above.
