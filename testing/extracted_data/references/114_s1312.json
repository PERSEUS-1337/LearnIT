    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Supply and Distribution Act \nof 2015''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to adopt certain recommendations of the Quadrennial \n        Energy Review of 2015;\n            (2) to enhance the integration of energy markets;\n            (3) to improve the collection of energy data and analysis; \n        and\n            (4) to promote the production and distribution of energy in \n        the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n     (a) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \nAdministrator of the Energy Information Administration.\n    (b) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \nEnergy.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO DOMESTIC ENERGY.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the production and distribution of \nenergy in the United States requires access to infrastructure and \nmarkets.\n\nSEC. 5. ENERGY SECURITY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary--\n            (1) shall collaborate with the heads of other Federal \n        agencies to improve the conceptual development of energy \n        security; and\n            (2) may consult with allies and key trading partners of the \n        United States with respect to energy security issues resulting \n        from changes in the energy marketplace.\n    (b) Considerations.--At a minimum, the Secretary shall ensure that, \nas part of the collaboration required under subsection (a)(1), the \nfollowing are considered:\n            (1) The development of flexible, transparent, and \n        competitive energy markets, including natural gas and oil \n        markets\n            (2) The diversification of energy fuels, sources, and \n        routes.\n            (3) The encouragement of indigenous sources of energy \n        supply.\n\nSEC. 6. SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n    The Secretary shall lead an interagency effort to improve and \ncoordinate data collection and analytical and modeling capabilities for \nenergy distribution on shared energy infrastructure.\n\nSEC. 7. ENERGY MARKET INTEGRATION.\n\n    The Secretary shall coordinate the training of, and enhanced \ndialogue among, technical staff in applicable Federal agencies that are \nresponsible for evaluating and implementing cross-border energy \nprojects.\n\nSEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that, as stated in the Annual Energy \nOutlook of 2015 of the Energy Information Administration, growth in \ncrude oil and dry natural gas production varies significantly across \noil and natural gas supply regions--\n            (1) forcing shifts in crude oil and natural gas flows \n        between regions of the United States; and\n            (2) requiring investment in or realignment of pipelines and \n        other midstream infrastructure.\n\nSEC. 9. ENERGY DATA COLLABORATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Administrator shall collaborate with the \nappropriate officials in Canada and Mexico, as determined by the \nAdministrator, to improve--\n            (1) the quality and transparency of North American energy \n        data through reconciliation of data on energy trade flows among \n        the United States, Canada, and Mexico;\n            (2) the extension of energy mapping capabilities in the \n        United States, Canada, and Mexico; and\n            (3) the development of common energy data terminology among \n        the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n    (b) Periodic Updates.--The Administrator shall periodically inform \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives \nregarding--\n            (1) the extent to which energy data is being shared under \n        subsection (a); and\n            (2) whether forward-looking projections for regional energy \n        flows are improving in accuracy as a result of the energy data \n        sharing under that subsection.\n\nSEC. 10. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO PROCESSED CONDENSATE.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that processed condensate is a \npetroleum product.\n\nSEC. 11. DEVELOPMENT OF DEFINITION OF CONDENSATE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall--\n            (1) develop a standard definition of the term \n        ``condensate''; and\n            (2) advise relevant Federal agencies to adopt that \n        definition for the purpose of clarifying energy policy in the \n        United States.\n    (b) Office of Fossil Energy Assessment.--The Assistant Secretary \nfor Fossil Energy may assess the suitability of condensate separately \nfrom crude oil for use in strategic reserves, as determined necessary \nby the Secretary.\n    (c) Energy Information Administration Data Collection.--The \nAdministrator may collect data regarding condensate and crude oil \nproduction in the United States.\n\nSEC. 12. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR ASSESSMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall direct the \nappropriate agencies within the Department of the Interior to assess \ncondensate separately from crude oil, in accordance with this section.\n    (b) Office of Natural Resources Revenue.--The Director of the \nOffice of Natural Resources Revenue may collect data regarding \ncondensate separately from crude oil produced in the United States.\n    (c) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.--The Director of the Bureau \nof Ocean Energy Management may estimate condensate separately from \ncrude oil as part of the resource assessments regarding geological \nformations in the United States.\n    (d) United States Geological Survey.--The Director of the United \nStates Geological Survey may include estimates of condensate separately \nfrom crude oil as part of the resource assessments regarding geological \nformations in the United States.\n\nSEC. 13. ACCESS TO MARKETS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to \npromote the efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, and \ndistribution of energy resources, any domestic crude oil or condensate \n(other than crude oil stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) may be \nexported without a Federal license to countries not subject to \nsanctions by the United States.\n    (b) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section limits the authority \nof the President under the Constitution, the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies \nAct (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or part B of title II of the Energy \nPolicy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.) to prohibit \nexports."
