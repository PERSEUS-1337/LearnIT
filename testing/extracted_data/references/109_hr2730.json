FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the highest national security interests of the \n        United States to ensure secure access to reliable energy \n        sources;\n            (2) the United States relies heavily on the foreign supply \n        of crude oil to meet the energy needs of the United States, \n        currently importing 58 percent of the total oil requirements of \n        the United States, of which 45 percent comes from member states \n        of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);\n            (3) revenues from the sale of oil by some of these \n        countries directly or indirectly provide funding for terrorism \n        and propaganda hostile to the values of the United States and \n        the West;\n            (4) in the past, these countries have manipulated the \n        dependence of the United States on the oil supplies of these \n        countries to exert undue influence on United States policy, as \n        during the embargo of OPEC during 1973 on the sale of oil to \n        the United States, which became a major factor in the ensuing \n        recession;\n            (5) research by the Energy Information Administration of \n        the Department of Energy has shown that the dependence of the \n        United States on foreign oil will increase by 33 percent over \n        the next 20 years;\n            (6) a rise in the price of imported oil sufficient to \n        increase gasoline prices by 10 cents per gallon at the pump \n        would result in an additional outflow of $18,000,000,000 from \n        the United States to oil-exporting nations;\n            (7) for economic and national security reasons, the United \n        States should reduce, as soon as practicable, the dependence of \n        the United States on nations that do not share the interests \n        and values of the United States;\n            (8) the State of Israel has been a steadfast ally and a \n        close friend of the United States since the creation of Israel \n        in 1948;\n            (9) like the United States, Israel is a democracy that \n        holds civil rights and liberties in the highest regard and is a \n        proponent of the democratic values of peace, freedom, and \n        justice;\n            (10) cooperation between the United States and Israel on \n        such projects as the development of the Arrow Missile has \n        resulted in mutual benefits to United States and Israeli \n        security;\n            (11) the special relationship between Israel and the United \n        States has been and continues to be manifested in a variety of \n        jointly-funded cooperative programs in the field of scientific \n        research and development, such as--\n                    (A) the United States-Israel Binational Science \n                Foundation (BSF);\n                    (B) the Israel-United States Binational \n                Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD); and\n                    (C) the Israel-United States Binational Industrial \n                Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation;\n            (12) these programs, supported by the matching \n        contributions from the Government of Israel and the Government \n        of the United States and directed by key scientists and \n        academics from both countries, have made possible many \n        scientific breakthroughs in the fields of life sciences, \n        medicine, bioengineering, agriculture, biotechnology, \n        communications, and others;\n            (13) on February 1, 1996, United States Secretary of Energy \n        Hazel R. O'Leary and Israeli Minister of Energy and \n        Infrastructure Gonen Segev signed the Agreement Between the \n        Department of Energy of the United States of America and the \n        Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure of Israel Concerning \n        Energy Cooperation, to establish a framework for collaboration \n        between the United States and Israel in energy research and \n        development activities;\n            (14) Israeli scientists and researchers have long been at \n        the forefront of research and development in the field of \n        alternative renewable energy sources;\n            (15) many of the top corporations of the world have \n        recognized the technological and scientific expertise of Israel \n        by locating important research and development facilities in \n        Israel;\n            (16) among the technological breakthroughs made by Israeli \n        scientists and researchers in the field of alternative, \n        renewable energy sources are--\n                    (A) the development of a cathode that uses \n                hexavalent iron salts that accept 3 electrons per ion \n                and enable rechargeable batteries to provide 3 times as \n                much electricity as existing rechargeable batteries;\n                    (B) the development of a technique that vastly \n                increases the efficiency of using solar energy to \n                generate hydrogen for use in energy cells; and\n                    (C) the development of a novel membrane used in new \n                and powerful direct-oxidant fuel cells that is capable \n                of competing favorably with hydrogen fuel cells and \n                traditional internal combustion engines; and\n            (17) cooperation between the United States and Israel in \n        the field of research and development of alternative renewable \n        energy sources would be in the interests of both countries, and \n        both countries stand to gain much from such cooperation.\n\nSEC. 3.
