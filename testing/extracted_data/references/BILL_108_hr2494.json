FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Trademarks and trade names are vital assets of the many \n        United States companies that engage in international trade.\n            (2) Worldwide sales of branded products of United States \n        companies contribute in important ways to the livelihood of \n        American workers and the well-being and continued healthy \n        growth of numerous United States businesses. These sales \n        depend, in turn, on the security of the United States \n        trademarks and trade names protected by reciprocal treaties and \n        agreements for the protection of intellectual property.\n            (3) Among such treaties and agreements are the Agreement on \n        Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) \n        of the World Trade Organization, the Inter-American Convention \n        for Trademark and Commercial Protection, and the Madrid \n        Protocol.\n            (4) The United States should ensure that the trademark and \n        trade names of United States companies continue to be protected \n        abroad by working to ensure that countries comply with \n        intellectual property rights treaties and agreements. At the \n        same time, the United States should adhere to its obligations \n        under such treaties and agreements.\n            (5) Hundreds of United States companies have registered \n        their trademarks in Cuba in order to ensure the exclusive right \n        to use those trademarks when the United States trade embargo on \n        that country is lifted. Indeed, following the enactment of the \n        Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, many \n        United States companies are already exporting branded food \n        products to Cuba.\n            (6) The United States District Court for the Southern \n        District of New York ruled that section 211 of the Department \n        of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 \n        abrogates, with respect to Cuba, the Inter-American Convention \n        on Trademarks and Commercial Protection, and the court's ruling \n        was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the \n        Second Circuit.\n            (7) Cuba's international remedy under customary \n        international law, as codified by Article 60 of the 1969 Vienna \n        Convention on Treaties, for a breach by the United States of \n        the Inter-American Convention, is to suspend or revoke the \n        protections Cuba currently affords United States trademarks and \n        trade names.\n            (8) In order to preserve the rights of United States \n        nationals holding trademarks in Cuba, the United States must \n        repeal section 211 of the Department of Commerce and Related \n        Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999, and should take the \n        necessary steps to promote the long-term protection of \n        trademarks, trade names, and domain names held by United States \n        nationals in that country.\n            (9) The recent actions by the Government of Cuba to \n        prosecute and imprison unfairly critics of the government are \n        unacceptable and should be met with strong condemnation.\n            (10) Promoting greater respect for the rule of law in Cuba, \n        including through the provisions of this Act, will it is hoped \n        diminish the likelihood for actions taken in the future that \n        undermine operation of the rule of law or disregard fundamental \n        fairness in administrative and juridical proceedings.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote global \nintellectual property rights protections by ensuring that the United \nStates and the Republic of Cuba continue to comply with their \nobligations under international trademark agreements and \nunderstandings.\n\nSEC. 3.
