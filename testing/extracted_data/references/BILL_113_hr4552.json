FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Head injuries are the number one reason for hospital \n        admissions of horseback riders and the leading cause of death \n        following a horseback riding injury.\n            (2) Over 100 deaths per year are estimated to result from \n        equestrian related activities, with head injuries accounting \n        for 3 of every 5 of these deaths.\n            (3) Nearly 68,000 people visited the emergency room in 2012 \n        as a result of horseback riding related injuries, with head \n        injuries accounting for 22 percent and concussions accounting \n        for 7 percent of these visits.\n            (4) Horseback riding causes 11.7 percent of sports-related \n        traumatic brain injuries, which is the largest percentage of \n        any recreational sport.\n            (5) Between 2001 and 2009, children under 19 made 3,638 \n        emergency room visits per year for traumatic brain injuries \n        resulting from horseback riding accidents.\n            (6) Between 75 and 80 percent of head injuries occur while \n        physically mounted on a horse--when a rider would normally be \n        wearing his or her helmet.\n            (7) Racing organizations require helmets, and as a result \n        jockeys now sustain fewer head injuries than pleasure riders.\n            (8) The U.S. Pony Clubs lowered head injury rates by 29 \n        percent through mandatory helmet use.\n            (9) Properly fitted ASTM/SEI certified helmets can reduce \n        head injury-related deaths by 70 to 80 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.
