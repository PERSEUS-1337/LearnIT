PROMOTING YOUTH FINANCIAL LITERACY.\n\n    Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 8001 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \npart:\n\n              ``PART L--PROMOTING YOUTH FINANCIAL LITERACY\n\n``SEC. 10993. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    ``(a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the `Youth Financial \nEducation Act'.\n    ``(b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) In order to succeed in our dynamic American economy, \n        young people must obtain the skills, knowledge, and experience \n        necessary to manage their personal finances and obtain general \n        financial literacy. All young adults should have the \n        educational tools necessary to make informed financial \n        decisions.\n            ``(2) Despite the critical importance of financial literacy \n        to young people, the average student who graduates from high \n        school lacks basic skills in the management of personal \n        financial affairs. A nationwide survey conducted in 1997 by the \n        Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy examined \n        the financial knowledge of 1,509 12th graders. On average, \n        survey respondents answered only 57 percent of the questions \n        correctly, and only 5 percent of the respondents received a `C' \n        grade or better.\n            ``(3) An evaluation by the National Endowment for Financial \n        Education High School Financial Planning Program undertaken \n        jointly with the United States Department of Agriculture \n        Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service \n        demonstrates that as little as 10 hours of classroom \n        instruction can impart substantial knowledge and affect \n        significant change in how teens handle their money.\n            ``(4) State educational leaders have recognized the \n        importance of providing a basic financial education to students \n        in grades kindergarten through 12 by integrating financial \n        education into State educational standards, but by 1999 only 14 \n        States required schools to implement personal finance standards \n        into the academic curriculum.\n            ``(5) Teacher training and professional development are \n        critical to achieving youth financial literacy. Teachers \n        confirm the need for professional development in personal \n        finance education. In a survey by the National Institute for \n        Consumer Education, 77 percent of a State's economics teachers \n        revealed that they had never had a college course in personal \n        finance.\n            ``(6) Personal financial education helps prepare students \n        for the workforce and for financial independence by developing \n        their sense of individual responsibility, improving their life \n        skills, and providing them with a thorough understanding of \n        consumer economics that will benefit them for their entire \n        lives.\n            ``(7) Financial education integrates instruction in \n        valuable life skills with instruction in economics, including \n        income and taxes, money management, investment and spending, \n        and the importance of personal savings.\n            ``(8) The consumers and investors of tomorrow are in our \n        schools today. The teaching of personal finance should be \n        encouraged at all levels of our Nation's educational system, \n        from kindergarten through grade 12.\n\n``SEC. 10994.
