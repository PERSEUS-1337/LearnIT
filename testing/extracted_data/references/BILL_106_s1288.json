FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A century of fire suppression, logging, and livestock \n        grazing has altered the ecological balance of New Mexico's \n        forests.\n            (2) Some forest lands in New Mexico contain an unnaturally \n        high number of small diameter trees that are subject to large, \n        high intensity wildfires that can endanger human lives, \n        livelihoods, and ecological stability.\n            (3) Forest lands that contain an unnaturally high number of \n        small diameter trees have reduced biodiversity and provide \n        fewer benefits to human communities, wildlife, and watersheds.\n            (4) Healthy and productive watersheds minimize the threat \n        of large, high intensity wildfires, provide abundant and \n        diverse wildlife habitat, and produce a variety of timber and \n        non-timber products including better quality water and \n        increased water flows.\n            (5) Restoration efforts are more successful when there is \n        involvement from neighboring communities and better stewardship \n        will evolve from more diverse involvement.\n            (6) Designing demonstration restoration projects through a \n        collaborative approach may--\n                    (A) lead to the development of cost effective \n                restoration activities;\n                    (B) empower diverse organizations to implement \n                activities which value local and traditional knowledge;\n                    (C) build ownership and civic pride; and\n                    (D) ensure healthy, diverse, and productive forests \n                and watersheds.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote healthy watersheds and reduce the threat of \n        large, high intensity wildfires, insect infestation, and \n        disease in the forests in New Mexico;\n            (2) to improve the functioning of forest ecosystems and \n        enhance plant and wildlife biodiversity by reducing the \n        unnaturally high number and density of small diameter trees on \n        Federal, Tribal, State, County, and Municipal forest lands;\n            (3) to improve communication and joint problem solving \n        among individuals and groups who are interested in restoring \n        the diversity and productivity of forested watersheds in New \n        Mexico;\n            (4) to improve the use of, or add value to, small diameter \n        trees;\n            (5) to encourage sustainable communities and sustainable \n        forests through collaborative partnerships, whose objectives \n        are forest restoration; and\n            (6) to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate ecologically \n        sound forest restoration techniques.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture acting through the Chief of the Forest Service; and\n            (2) the term ``stakeholder'' includes: tribal governments, \n        educational institutions, landowners, and other interested \n        public and private entities.\n\nSEC. 5.
