    "content": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the federal legislation that establishes the general minimum wage that must be paid to all covered workers. The FLSA mandates broad minimum wage coverage. It also specifies certain categories of workers who are not covered by general FLSA wage standards, such as workers with disabilities or certain youth workers. In 1938, the FLSA established a minimum wage of $0.25 per hour. The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA have been amended numerous times since then, typically to expand coverage or raise the wage rate. Since its establishment, the minimum wage rate has been raised 22 separate times. The most recent change was enacted through P.L. 110-28 in 2007, which increased the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in three steps (the final step occurring in 2009). States generally have three options in setting their minimum wage policies: (1) they can set their own minimum wage provisions that differ from those in the FLSA, (2) they can explicitly tie their minimum wage provisions to the FLSA, or (3) they can include no specific minimum wage provisions in state law. This report begins with a brief discussion of FLSA minimum wage coverage. It then provides a summary of state minimum wage laws, followed by an examination of rates and mechanisms of adjustments in states with minimum wage levels above the FLSA rate ( Table 1 provides summary data). Next, the report discusses the interaction of federal and state minimum wages over time, and finally, the Appendix provides detailed information on the major components of minimum wage policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The state policies covered in this report include currently effective policies and policies enacted with an effective date at some point in 2019. While most states' scheduled state minimum wage rate changes (due to inflation adjustments or statutorily scheduled changes) occurred on January 1 of each year, a few states have rate increases scheduled for later in the year. Effective dates of rate increases are noted in Table 1 and in the Appendix . The FLSA extends two types of minimum wage coverage to individuals: \"enterprise coverage\" and \"individual coverage.\" An individual is covered if they meet the criteria for either category. To be covered by the FLSA at the enterprise or business level, an enterprise must have at least two employees and annual sales or \"business done\" of at least $500,000. Annual sales or business done includes all business activities that can be measured in dollars. Thus, for example, retailers are covered by the FLSA if their annual sales are at least $500,000. In non-sales cases, a measure other than sales must be used to determine business done. For example, for enterprises engaged in leasing property, gross amounts paid by tenants for property rental will be considered business done for purposes of determining enterprise coverage. In addition, regardless of the dollar volume of business, the FLSA applies to hospitals or other institutions primarily providing medical or nursing care for residents; schools (preschool through institutions of higher education); and federal, state, and local governments. Thus, regardless of how enterprise coverage is determined (by business done or by specified institutional type), all employees of a covered enterprise are considered to be covered by the FLSA. Although an enterprise may not be subject to minimum wage requirements if it has less than $500,000 in annual sales or business done, employees of the enterprise may be covered if they are individually engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce. To be engaged in interstate commerce\u2014the definition of which is fairly broad\u2014employees must produce goods (or have indirect input to the production of those goods) that will be shipped out of the state of production, travel to other states for work, make phone calls or send emails to persons in other states, handle records that are involved in interstate transactions, or provide services to buildings (e.g., janitorial work) in which goods are produced for shipment outside of the state. While individual coverage is broad under the FLSA, there are also specific exemptions from the federal rate, including individuals with disabilities; youth workers; tipped workers; and executive, administrative, and professional workers, among others. In 1938, the FLSA established a minimum wage of $0.25 per hour. The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA have been amended numerous times since then, typically for the purpose of expanding coverage or raising the wage rate. Since its establishment, the minimum wage rate has been raised 22 separate times. The most recent change was enacted in 2007 ( P.L. 110-28 ), which increased the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in three steps.  Figure 1 shows the nominal and real (inflation-adjusted) value of the federal minimum wage from its enactment in 1938 through 2018. The real value of the minimum wage generally rose from 1938 to 1968, after which it has generally fallen in real terms, with some brief increases in value following periodic statutory rate changes. From an initial rate of $0.25 per hour in 1938 ($4.43 in inflation-adjusted terms), the minimum wage increased to $1.60 per hour in 1968 ($11.50 in inflation-adjusted terms, a peak value to date). The real value of the minimum wage has fallen by $1.20 since it was increased to $7.25 in 2009. State policymakers may also choose to set labor standards that are different from federal statutes. The FLSA establishes that if a state enacts minimum wage, overtime, or child labor laws more protective of employees than those provided in the FLSA, then state law applies. In the case of minimum wages, this means FLSA-covered workers are entitled to the higher state minimum wage in those states with rates above the federal minimum. On the other hand, FLSA-covered workers would receive the FLSA minimum wage in states that have set minimum wages lower than the federal rate. Given the generally broad minimum wage coverage of the FLSA, it is likely that most workers in states with minimum wages below the federal rate are covered by the FLSA rate. In 2019, the range of state minimum wage rates is as follows: 29 states and the District of Columbia have enacted minimum wage rates above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour; 2 states have minimum wage rates below the federal rate; 5 states have no state minimum wage requirement; and the remaining 14 states have minimum wage rates equal to the federal rate. In the states with no minimum wage requirements or wages lower than the federal minimum wage, only individuals who are not covered by the FLSA are subject to those lower rates. The Appendix provides detailed information on state minimum wage policy in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including the legislation authorizing the state minimum wage and the relevant legislative language regarding the rate and mechanism of adjustment. The remainder of this report focuses on states with minimum wages above the federal rate. In states with minimum wage rates above the federal rate, variation occurs mainly across two dimensions: the rate and the mechanism of adjustment to the rate. This section (including data in Table 1 ) summarizes these two dimensions for the states with rates currently above the federal minimum. State rates range from $0.25 to $6.75 above the federal rate, with a majority of these states using some sort of inflation measure to index the state minimum wage. In the 29 states and the District of Columbia with minimum wage rates above the federal rate in 2019, minimum hourly rates range from $7.50 per hour in New Mexico to $12.00 per hour in Massachusetts and Washington and $14.00 in the District of Columbia. Of the states with minimum wage rates above $7.25: 3 states have minimum wages within $1 of the federal rate of $7.25 per hour; 10 states have rates between $1.00 and $2.00 per hour above the federal rate; and 16 states and the District of Columbia have rates greater than $2.00 per hour above the federal rate (i.e., $9.26 or higher).  Figure 2 shows the geographic and rate dispersion of state minimum wages. In terms of coverage, a majority of the civilian labor force is in states with a minimum wage rate above the federal rate of $7.25. Specifically, the 29 states and the District of Columbia with minimum wage rates above $7.25 represent about 61% of the total civilian labor force, which means the federal rate is the wage floor in states representing 39% of the labor force. In any given year, the exact number of states with a minimum wage rate above the federal rate may vary, depending on what mechanism is in place to adjust the state minimum wage. Some states specifically set rates above the federal rate. Other states have rates above the federal minimum wage because the state minimum wage rate is indexed to a measure of inflation or is increased in legislatively scheduled increments, and thus the state rate changes even if the federal minimum wage stays unchanged. Below are the two main approaches to regulating the adjustment of state minimum wage rates in states with rates above the federal minimum: legislatively scheduled increases and indexing to inflation. In this section, states are counted by the primary method of adjustment. While most states use only one of these methods, some states combine a series of scheduled increases followed by indexing the state rate to a measure of inflation. In these cases, states are counted as \"indexing to inflation,\" as that is the long-term mechanism of adjustment in place. If a state adopts a minimum wage higher than the federal rate, the state legislature may specify a single rate in the enacting legislation and then choose not to address future rates. In these cases, the only mechanism for future rate changes is future legislative action. Alternatively, a state may specify future rates in legislation through a given date. Rhode Island in 2017, for example, set a rate of $10.10 per hour beginning January 1, 2018, and $10.50 beginning January 1, 2019. After the final increase, the rate will remain at $10.50 per hour until further legislative action. This is the same approach taken in the most recent federal minimum wage increase ( P.L. 110-28 ), which increased the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour in 2007 to $7.25 per hour in 2009 in three phases. Of the 29 states and the District of Columbia with minimum wage rates above the federal rate, 9 currently have no scheduled increases beyond 2019, while Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Michigan have legislatively scheduled rate increases after 2019. If a minimum wage rate is established as a fixed amount and not increased, its value will erode over time due to inflation. For this reason, several states have attempted to maintain the value of the minimum wage over time by indexing the rate to some measure of inflation. This mechanism provides for automatic changes in the minimum wage over time and does not require legislative action to make annual adjustments. Currently, nine states index state minimum wages to a measure of inflation. In addition, another eight states and the District of Columbia are scheduled in a future year to index state minimum wage rates to a measure of inflation. Thus, of the total of 17 states and the District of Columbia that currently or are scheduled to index minimum wage rates, seven states\u2014Arizona, Montana, Nevada, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, and Vermont\u2014index the state minimum wage to the national Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U); five states\u2014California, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, and Washington\u2014index the state minimum wage to the national Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W); two states\u2014Alaska and Colorado\u2014and the District of Columbia use a subnational version of the CPI-U to index the state minimum wage; two states\u2014Florida and Maine\u2014use a regional version of the CPI-W to index the minimum wage; and one state (Minnesota) uses the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) to index the minimum wage. While scheduled increases and indexation are the two main ways that states adjust their minimum wage rates, a few states also add a reference to the federal minimum wage rate as a possible mechanism of adjustment. Thus any time the federal rate changes, the state rate may change. Currently, Alaska, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, and Massachusetts use this federal reference to supplement their primary mechanisms of adjusting state minimum wage rates. In Alaska, the state minimum wage rate is indexed to the CPI-U for Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area. However, Alaska state law requires that the state minimum wage must be at least $1.00 per hour higher than the federal rate. So it is possible that a federal wage increase could trigger an increase in the Alaska minimum wage, but the main mechanism is indexation to inflation. Although Connecticut does not currently include scheduled rate increases in the minimum wage, Connecticut state law requires that the state rate must exceed the federal minimum wage rate by 0.5% if the federal rate becomes greater than or equal to the state rate. The District of Columbia's minimum wage rate is the higher of the level required by the District of Columbia statute or the federal rate plus $1.00. Starting in 2021, the District of Columbia minimum wage will be indexed to inflation and the reference to the federal rate will no longer be in effect. While Massachusetts law includes scheduled rate increases in the minimum wage through 2023, the law also requires that the state rate must be at least $0.50 above federal minimum wage rate. Because federal and state minimum wages do not change in regular intervals or by regular increments, the number of states and the share of the labor force covered by higher minimum wages changes annually. In general, during periods in which the federal minimum wage remains constant, more states enact higher minimum wages and the share of the workforce for which the federal rate serves as the floor likewise decreases. When the federal rate increases, some state rates become equal to or less than the federal rate.  Table 1 presents a snapshot of minimum wage rates in the 29 states and the District of Columbia with minimum wages above the federal rate from 2018 through 2024, while Figure 3 shows the changes in the coverage of the federal minimum wage. Specifically, Figure 3 plots the percentage of the civilian labor force residing in states in which the federal wage serves as the floor. If no state had a minimum wage above the federal rate, then the federal minimum wage would be the floor for states in which 100% of the labor force resides. Similarly, if every state had a minimum wage above the current rate of $7.25, then the federal rate would not be binding for the labor force. Instead the interaction of federal and state rates has led to the federal minimum wage playing a fluctuating, but generally decreasing, role in establishing a wage floor for the civilian labor force, particularly during periods in which the federal rate is not increased. Examining the specific time periods around changes in the federal minimum wage (see Figure 1 for the history of federal minimum wage rate changes), data in Figure 3 show a general trend toward a lower share of the labor force being covered by the federal minimum wage only. Federal rate increases in 2007 through 2009 mitigated this reduction, as did earlier changes in the federal rate. In the period from 1983 through 1989, the federal minimum wage remained constant at $3.35 per hour. Prior to the federal increases in 1990 and 1991, the number of states with higher minimum wages rose from 3 in 1984 to 16 in 1989 and the share of the U.S. civilian labor force in states for which the federal rate was the floor fell from 98% to 70%. Following a two-step federal increase in 1990 and 1991 from $3.35 to $4.25 per hour, the number of states with higher minimum wages fell to 8 in 1992, which meant that the federal rate was the floor for states comprising 92% of the civilian labor force. The next federal minimum wage increase occurred in two steps in 1996 and 1997, increasing from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour. Prior to that increase, in 1995, there were 10 states, representing 10% of the civilian labor force, with minimum wages above the federal rate. After the second increase in 1997, the number of states with higher minimum wages dropped to 8, but the share of the labor force in states for which the federal rate served as a floor decreased to 82%. The federal minimum wage did not increase after 1997 until 2007. During much of that period the number of states with higher minimum wages stayed somewhat steady, increasing from 8 (comprising 18% of the civilian labor force) in 1998 to 12 (comprising 21% of the civilian labor force) in 2003. However, by 2006, 22 states representing 50% of the civilian labor force had minimum wage rates above the federal rate. This increase was due in part to a few populous states, such as Florida, Michigan, and New York, adopting minimum wage rates above the federal rate in this period. Following the three-step increase in the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to the current $7.25 (2007-2009), 15 states, comprising 33% of the civilian labor force, had rates above the federal minimum wage in 2010. By 2019, this rose to 29 states and the District of Columbia, which means that the federal rate is the wage floor in states representing 39% of the civilian labor force. For the 29 states and the District of Columbia with state minimum wage rates above the federal rate as of 2019, Table 1 and much of the text above summarizes information on those states' minimum wage policies, highlighting minimum wage rates and mechanisms used to establish and adjust wage rates. As discussed previously, for those states with current or scheduled minimum wages above the federal rate, three main mechanisms are in place to adjust future rates: (1) scheduled increases, (2) indexation to inflation, or (3) reference to the federal rate plus an add-on (i.e., a state minimum wage is a percentage or dollar amount above the federal rate). For the 21 states with minimum wage rates equal to or below the federal rate, however, there are no mechanisms in place to move rates above the federal rate. Thus, the main difference within this group of states is the relationship of the state rate, if any, to the federal rate. For those 21 states with minimum wages equal to or below the federal rate, the state rate may be set in four ways: No state minimum wage provisions: In five states\u2014Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee\u2014there are no provisions for state minimum wage rates. In practice, this means that most workers in these states are covered by the FLSA minimum wage provisions since coverage is generally broad. State minimum wage provisions with no reference to the FLSA: Five states have state minimum wage rates but do not reference the FLSA. Two of these states\u2014Georgia and Wyoming\u2014have state rates below $7.25, while three of these states\u2014Kansas, North Dakota, and Wisconsin\u2014have rates equal to $7.25. However, because there is no reference to the FLSA rate or other provision for adjustment in any of these states, the state rate does not change unless the state policy is changed. State minimum wage equals the FLSA rate: Six states\u2014Idaho, Indiana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia\u2014set the state rate equal to the FLSA rate. Thus, when the FLSA rate changes, the state rates in these six states change to equal the FLSA rate. State minimum wage equals FLSA rate if FLSA is greater: In four states\u2014Iowa, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania\u2014the state rate is specified separately but includes a provision to equal the FLSA rate if the latter is above the state specified rate.   Table A-1 provides detailed information about minimum wage policies in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, including those summarized in a more concise manner in Table 1 . "
