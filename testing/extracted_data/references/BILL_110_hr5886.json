SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Limiting the Intrusive Miles of \nInternational Terrorist Sponsors Act of 2008'' or the ``LIMITS Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism \n        represent a threat to the national security of the United \n        States.\n            (2) The United States is obligated to permit officials and \n        other representatives of countries designated as state sponsors \n        of terrorism to travel to New York City to attend meetings and \n        conduct official business at the United Nations.\n            (3) Individuals from countries not otherwise legally \n        permitted to travel to the United States are given visas for \n        delegates and representatives to the United Nations and other \n        related diplomatic purposes.\n            (4) In connection with the September 2007 meeting of the \n        United Nations General Assembly, 21 delegates from Cuba, 144 \n        delegates from Iran, 6 delegates from North Korea, 7 delegates \n        from Syria, and 16 delegates from Sudan were issued visas by \n        the Department of State for travel to New York City.\n            (5) These delegates and representatives are in addition to \n        the number of domestically assigned nationals assigned to the \n        United States.\n            (6) Between 2002 and 2007, the Department of State issued, \n        with full diplomatic immunity, 1823 visas to delegates and \n        representatives from Cuba, 2782 visas to delegates and \n        representatives from Iran, 132 visas to delegates and \n        representatives from North Korea, 1242 visas to delegates and \n        representatives from Sudan, and 706 visas to delegates and \n        representatives from Syria.\n            (7) The delegates and representatives from Iran, North \n        Korea, and Cuba, which are all state sponsors of terrorism, are \n        currently permitted to travel up to 25 miles from Columbus \n        Circle in New York City for United Nations activities, far \n        beyond the necessary working vicinity of the United Nations, \n        giving them access not only to Manhattan, but to surrounding \n        cities and States.\n            (8) The delegates and representatives from Syria and Sudan, \n        both state sponsors of terrorism, are currently permitted to \n        travel throughout the United States without any mileage \n        restrictions.\n            (9) In June 2002, November 2003, and June 2004, Iranian \n        diplomatic personnel from the Iranian Mission to the United \n        Nations were caught photographing and videotaping the New York \n        City subway and other popular landmarks.\n            (10) The Department of State expelled these individuals for \n        being engaged in activities not consistent with their duties.\n            (11) Issuing approximately 6685 visas over the past 5 years \n        to personnel from countries designated as state sponsors of \n        terrorism, without proper boundaries, creates a major security \n        vulnerability within the United States.\n            (12) The presence of hundreds of individuals with \n        diplomatic immunity from countries designated as state sponsors \n        of terrorism is overwhelming United States counterterrorism and \n        intelligence resources.\n            (13) The United States has an obligation to protect the \n        American people against such threats.\n\nSEC. 3.
