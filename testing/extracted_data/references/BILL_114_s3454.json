FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Eighty to ninety percent of the means by which we \n        prevent and control chronic disease is with medications. \n        Assuring the most appropriate and effective medications are \n        used to optimize patient outcomes is a national priority. The \n        ability of patients to then adhere to the medication regimen \n        becomes vital.\n            (2) Between \\1/2\\ and \\2/3\\ of individuals with chronic \n        diseases in the United States do not take medications as \n        prescribed.\n            (3) Suboptimal medication use, including untreated \n        indications (such as failure to immunize), over or under dosing \n        of medications, safety issues, and low rates of medication \n        adherence result in higher health care costs, reduced \n        effectiveness of health care treatments and regimes, negative \n        health effects for patients, and tens of thousands of deaths on \n        an annual basis.\n            (4) Appropriate medication use and adherence may be lowest \n        among individuals with chronic diseases.\n            (5) Improving medication adherence would reduce unnecessary \n        hospital admissions and emergency room visits.\n            (6) Drug therapy problems including underuse and \n        nonadherence is estimated to cost the healthcare system in the \n        United States over $290,000,000,000 each year.\n            (7) Improving appropriate medication adherence could \n        improve patient health outcomes, reduce health care costs, and \n        lead to productivity gains.\n\nSEC. 2.
