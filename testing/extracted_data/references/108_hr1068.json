SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Pancreatic Islet \nCell Transplantation Act of 2003''.\n    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Organ procurement organization certification.\nSec. 4. Interagency Committee on Islet Cell Transplantation.\nSec. 5. Study of islet cell transplantation.\nSec. 6. Medicare pancreatic islet cell transplant demonstration \n                            project.\nSec. 7. Authorization of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United \n        States have juvenile, or Type 1, diabetes.\n            (2) In individuals with juvenile diabetes, the body's \n        immune system attacks the pancreas and destroys islet cells \n        that produce insulin.\n            (3) Insulin is not a cure, and individuals with juvenile \n        diabetes face the constant threat of devastating complications, \n        a drastic reduction in quality of life, and a shortened life \n        span.\n            (4) The development of the ``Edmonton Protocol'' and \n        subsequent variations of that protocol, involving the \n        transplant of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells into \n        individuals with juvenile diabetes, have brought us within \n        reach of a cure.\n            (5) Islet cell transplants have been hailed as the most \n        promising development in diabetes since the discovery of \n        insulin.\n            (6) Currently 80 percent of the approximately 200 patients \n        who have received islet cell transplants using variations of \n        the Edmonton Protocol have maintained normal glucose levels \n        without insulin injections after 1 year.\n            (7) One of the key hurdles in expanding the number of \n        patients enrolled in these protocols is the insufficient number \n        of pancreases available for islet cell transplantation.\n            (8) While a significant percentage of individuals with type \n        1 diabetes will experience kidney failure and become Medicare-\n        eligible through the end stage renal disease program, \n        insufficient data exist to conduct an assessment to determine \n        the efficacy of simultaneous islet-kidney transplants and islet \n        transplants after kidney transplants for individuals with type \n        1 diabetes.\n            (9) The Federal Government should promote policies and \n        regulations to increase the supply of pancreases for research, \n        to coordinate efforts and information in the emerging area of \n        islet cell transplantation, to collect the data necessary to \n        move islet cell transplantation from an experimental procedure \n        to a standard therapy covered by insurance, and to create a \n        medicare demonstration project to determine the efficacy of \n        simultaneous islet-kidney transplants and islet transplants \n        after kidney transplants for medicare beneficiaries with type 1 \n        diabetes.\n\nSEC. 3. ORGAN PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATION CERTIFICATION.\n\n    Section 371 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 273) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Pancreases procured by an organ procurement organization and \nused for islet cell transplantation or research shall be counted for \npurposes of certification or recertification under subsection (b).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
