Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n5122))), or significant pricing anomalies in national or regional \nenergy markets for crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, or petroleum \ndistillates of a more than transient nature, the President may declare \nthat a Federal energy emergency exists.\n    (b) Scope and Duration.--The declaration shall apply to the Nation, \na geographical region, or 1 or more States, as determined by the \nPresident, but may not be in effect for a period of more than 45 days.\n    (c) Extensions.--The President may--\n            (1) extend a declaration under subsection (a) for a period \n        of not more than 45 days; and\n            (2) extend such a declaration more than once.\n\nSEC. 4.
