FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Two-thirds of all Medicare spending involves \n        beneficiaries living with 5 or more chronic conditions.\n            (2) Eighty-four percent of people ages 65 to 70 live with \n        at least one of the following chronic conditions: hypertension, \n        heart disease or heart attack, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, or \n        high cholesterol.\n            (3) Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions are more \n        likely to undergo duplicative tests, receive contradictory \n        information from their health care providers, experience \n        adverse responses to medications, and undergo hospital visits \n        that could have been prevented.\n            (4) Both traditional fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare \n        Advantage are not currently configured to meet the unique needs \n        of beneficiaries living with multiple chronic conditions.\n            (5) Care for these patients is typically fragmented and \n        delivered by multiple providers working at multiple sites.\n            (6) Medicare has implemented a number of demonstration \n        projects focused on ways to improve care for beneficiaries with \n        multiple chronic conditions, yet there has been limited \n        translation of evidence-based results to the wider chronic care \n        community in a timely manner.\n            (7) Using evidence-based approaches to care coordination \n        and care management have shown promise in reducing illness \n        burden and improving health for at-risk patients, but the \n        evidence is not easy to consistently translate into practice.\n            (8) As the population of Medicare beneficiaries living with \n        multiple chronic conditions continues to increase, the Centers \n        for Medicare & Medicaid Services should seek more effective \n        actions to test various care models, analyze the outcomes, and \n        implement evidence-based best practices as soon as possible.\n            (9) The United States Government should partner with \n        qualified and experienced health care institutions and \n        universities already serving these beneficiaries to effectively \n        and efficiently develop, evaluate, and translate improvements \n        in coordinated care for them. Generating this information and \n        supporting its translation into clinical practice will serve \n        beneficiaries far more effectively.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE CHRONIC CARE RAPID LEARNING NETWORK TO DEVELOP AND \n              APPLY IMPROVED PRACTICES IN COORDINATED CARE FOR MEDICARE \n              BENEFICIARIES WITH MULTIPLE, CHRONIC CONDITIONS.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n        shall establish in accordance with this section a Medicare \n        Chronic Care Rapid Learning Network (in this section referred \n        to as the ``Network'').\n            (2) Duration.--The initial period of the Network shall be \n        not less than five years. The Secretary may extend or make \n        permanent the Network if the Network's performance demonstrates \n        benefit to the Medicare program. The Secretary may continue or \n        make permanent any network project site if--\n                    (A)(i) the costs to the Medicare program resulting \n                from activities carried out by such site pursuant to \n                this section are not more than the costs to such \n                program without application of this section; and\n                    (ii) such activities result in improved quality of \n                care furnished to Medicare beneficiaries who have two \n                or more chronic illnesses; or\n                    (B) the costs to the Medicare program resulting \n                from activities carried out by such site pursuant to \n                this section are less than the costs to such program \n                without application of this section.\n    (b) Purpose and Duties of Network.--\n            (1) Purpose.--The purpose of the Network is to enable \n        highly qualified health care organizations and universities to \n        form a stable and flexible research infrastructure that \n        accelerates the development and deployment of evidence-based \n        chronic care management practices for Medicare beneficiaries \n        with multiple, chronic conditions.\n            (2) Duties of the network.--\n                    (A) In general.--The Network shall develop and \n                evaluate evidence-based chronic care management \n                practices for Medicare beneficiaries who have two or \n                more chronic illnesses, with a focus on such \n                beneficiaries who are provided benefits under the \n                Medicare fee-for-service program and whose care is most \n                costly. In carrying out its duties, the Network shall \n                use and build upon applicable interventions that have \n                been proven successful through demonstrations carried \n                out by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \n                including the Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration \n                project.\n                    (B) Specific duties.--The Network shall--\n                            (i) research, design, implement, test, and \n                        validate specific interventions designed to \n                        improve care management for Medicare \n                        beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions;\n                            (ii) provide a reproducible, reliable, and \n                        scalable framework to standardize and translate \n                        best practices for all Medicare beneficiaries; \n                        and\n                            (iii) not later than 90 days after the date \n                        of the enactment of this Act, establish target \n                        enrollment numbers and capitated payment rates \n                        for care management interventions to be \n                        established for each Medicare Chronic Care \n                        Rapid Learning Network site.\n    (c) Membership.--\n            (1) Initial sites.--The network shall initially consist of \n        not less than 12 network project sites.
