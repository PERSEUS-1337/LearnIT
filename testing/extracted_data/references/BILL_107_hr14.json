FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 2000 Report of the Social Security Board of \n        Trustees projects that the receipts financing the Social \n        Security trust funds will fall below its outgo in 2015 and the \n        trust funds will be depleted in 2037. At that time only 72 \n        percent of Social Security benefits would be payable then with \n        incoming receipts.\n            (2) The primary reason is demographic: the post-World War \n        II baby boomers will begin retiring in less than a decade and \n        life expectancy is rising. By 2025 the number of people age 65 \n        and older is predicted to grow by 75 percent. In contrast, the \n        number of workers supporting the system would grow by 13 \n        percent.\n            (3) If there are no other surplus governmental receipts, \n        policymakers would have 3 choices: raise taxes or other income, \n        cut spending, or borrow the money. Mirroring this adverse \n        outlook are public opinion polls showing that fewer than 50 \n        percent of respondents are confident that Social Security can \n        meet its long-term commitments. There also is a widespread \n        perception that Social Security may not be as good a value in \n        the future as it is today.\n            (4) While it is accepted that Social Security reform is \n        needed without undue delay, there clearly is no consensus on \n        how this should be accomplished. This was evident by the Report \n        of the 1994-1996 Social Security Advisory Council, which \n        provided 3 very different plans but none of which received a \n        majority's endorsement. It also is reflected by the many bills \n        introduced in the 105th Congress and the 106th Congress and \n        proposals by the administration that represent a diversity of \n        approaches to Social Security reform. As a result of \n        differences within Congress and with the administration, there \n        has been no movement on Social Security reform.\n            (5) This state of affairs shows the need to develop \n        consensus legislation between Congress and the administration \n        that can be enacted into law without undue delay. To accomplish \n        this there is to be established a Bipartisan Commission on \n        Social Security Reform charged with developing a unified \n        proposal to ensure the long-term retirement security of \n        Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n    There is established in the legislative branch a Bipartisan \nCommission on Social Security Reform (in this Act referred to as the \n``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
