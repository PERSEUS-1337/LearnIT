FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following--\n            (1) As a tool to justify Federal actions by the Department \n        of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter \n        in this section referred to as the ``EPA'') addressing \n        greenhouse gas emissions, including those regulating or \n        prohibiting the exploration, mining, production, and use of \n        coal as well as other fossil fuels as energy sources, the \n        Social Cost of Carbon (hereinafter in this section referred to \n        as the ``SCC'') and the Social Cost of Methane (hereinafter in \n        this section referred to as the ``SCM'') in theory represent \n        the hypothetical cost of an incremental ton of carbon dioxide \n        (CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt;) or methane emissions in a given year.\n            (2) Office of Management and Budget (hereinafter in this \n        section referred to as the ``OMB'') Circular A-4 guides Federal \n        agencies on the development of regulatory impact analysis \n        required under Executive Order 12866 as well as other \n        authorities, instructing agencies to include discount rates of \n        3 and 7 percent while also evaluating the cost and benefits \n        that accrue to citizens and residents of the United States.\n            (3) First developed in 2009 by an interagency working \n        group, including the Department of Energy and the EPA, the SCC \n        estimates fail to comply with OMB Circular A-4 prescribed \n        discount rates of 3 and 7 percent.\n            (4) While OMB Circular A-4 specifies that an evaluation of \n        the global effects, when undertaken, is to be reported \n        separately from domestic costs and benefits, the SCC instead \n        calculated the global benefits in lieu of and not in addition \n        to the domestic effects.\n            (5) The use of the SCC estimates in Department of Energy \n        and EPA rulemakings prior to any opportunity for public notice \n        and comment violated not only scientific peer-review \n        requirements but also the President's commitment to transparent \n        and open government as outlined in his January 21, 2009, \n        memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies.\n            (6) In July 2015, as part of a revision of the SCC in \n        response to over 150 substantive comments and in acknowledgment \n        of the faulty process by which the SCC estimates were \n        developed, the OMB requested the National Academies of Science, \n        Engineering and Medicine (hereinafter in this section referred \n        to as the ``NAS'') review and make recommendations for the \n        improvement of the SCC estimates.\n            (7) Shortly after the commencement of the NAS review, the \n        EPA, without appropriate peer review and an opportunity for \n        public notice and comment, utilized the EPA-developed SCM \n        estimates in justifying the costs and benefits of the September \n        2015 proposed and recently finalized rules under the Clean Air \n        Act for methane emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed \n        sources in the oil and gas sector.\n            (8) Continued use by the Department of Energy and the EPA \n        of the SCC and the SCM ignores sound science in order to \n        eliminate the exploration, mining, production, and use of our \n        abundant domestic sources of fossil fuel energy.\n            (9) The Department of Energy and EPA regulations, which are \n        costing American families billions of dollars per year, are \n        being justified in large part by SCC and SCM estimates.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CONSIDERING THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON AND THE \n              SOCIAL COST OF METHANE.\n\n    The Secretary of Energy, when acting under any authority, and the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, when acting under \nthe authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), may not \nconsider the social cost of carbon or the social cost of methane as \npart of any cost benefit analysis required under law or under Executive \nOrder 12866 or 13563, in any rulemaking, in the issuance of any \nguidance, or in taking any other agency action, or as a justification \nfor any rulemaking, guidance document, or agency action, unless a \nFederal law is enacted, after the date of enactment of this Act, \nexplicitly authorizing such consideration.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE EPA.\n\n    Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in \ncoordination and consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the \nSecretary of the Interior, and the Council on Environmental Quality \nshall submit a report to the Committees on Energy and Commerce and on \nNatural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committees on \nthe Environment and Public Works and on Energy and Natural Resources of \nthe Senate, detailing the number of proposed and final rulemakings, \nguidance documents, and agency actions since January 2009 that use the \nsocial cost of carbon or the social cost of methane, including as part \nof any cost benefit analysis required under Executive Order 12866 and \nother relevant authorities.\n\nSEC. 5.
