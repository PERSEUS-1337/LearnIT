    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There are approximately 100,000,000 unexploded \n        antipersonnel landmines strewn in more than 60 countries around \n        the world, and tens of millions of antipersonnel landmines are \n        stored in stockpiles. The Department of State reports that \n        ``landmines may be the most toxic and widespread pollution \n        facing mankind''.\n            (2) Like chemical and biological weapons, landmines kill \n        and maim indiscriminately.\n            (3) After the United States adopted a unilateral moratorium \n        on the export of antipersonnel landmines, the United Nations \n        General Assembly unanimously called for an international \n        moratorium on such exports, and the Governments of France, \n        Germany, Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, \n        and South Africa have announced export moratoria. The \n        Government of Cambodia has stated that it will no longer use or \n        purchase antipersonnel landmines.\n            (4) Despite such actions, far more antipersonnel landmines \n        are being strewn than are being cleared. Each month, at least \n        1,200 persons, mostly innocent civilians, are killed or injured \n        by landmines. In some countries, more than one third of all \n        casualties of antipersonnel landmines are women and children.\n            (5) With hundreds of types of antipersonnel landmines being \n        produced in at least 50 countries, only international \n        cooperation on limits on the production, possession, transfer, \n        and use of antipersonnel landmines will stop the slaughter of \n        innocent lives.\n            (6) A United Nations conference to review the 1980 \n        Conventional Weapons Convention, including Protocol II to the \n        Convention (otherwise known as the Landmine Protocol), is \n        planned for 1995. Meetings of governmental experts to prepare \n        for the conference have begun. This is a critical time for \n        United States leadership to help solve the landmine crisis.\n\nSEC. 2. POLICY.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the President should--\n            (1) actively seek an international agreement prohibiting \n        the production, possession, transfer, and use of antipersonnel \n        landmines; and\n            (2) as interim measures to be pursued during the seeking of \n        such prohibitions, actively seek international agreements, \n        modifications of the 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention, or \n        other agreements or arrangements to limit further the \n        production, possession, transfer, and use of antipersonnel \n        landmines.\n\nSEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON THE PRODUCTION AND PROCUREMENT OF ANTIPERSONNEL \n              LANDMINES.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a \nmoratorium by the United States on the purchase and production of \nantipersonnel landmines would encourage other nations to adopt similar \nmeasures.\n    (b) Moratorium.--Effective 90 days after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, the United States Government shall not purchase or produce \nantipersonnel landmines.\n    (c) Period of Moratorium.--The prohibition set forth in subsection \n(b) shall continue until the end of the one-year period beginning on \nthe date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (d) Actions by Other Nations.--(1) The Congress urges the \nPresident, during the period referred to in subsection (c), to \nencourage each nation which is a major producer of antipersonnel \nlandmines to adopt a moratorium similar to the moratorium described in \nsubsection (b).\n    (2) If the President determines during the period referred to in \nsubsection (c) that nations that are major producers of antipersonnel \nlandmines have adopted moratoria similar to the moratorium described in \nsubsection (b), the President may extend the moratorium for such \nadditional time as the President considers appropriate.\n    (3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term ``major producers \nof antipersonnel landmines'' shall include the following:\n            (A) Belgium.\n            (B) Bulgaria.\n            (C) The Peoples Republic of China.\n            (D) Egypt.\n            (E) France.\n            (F) Germany.\n            (G) Hungary.\n            (H) Italy.\n            (I) Pakistan.\n            (J) Russia.\n            (K) South Africa.\n            (L) The United Kingdom.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF FUNDS FOR DEMINING ACTIVITIES.\n\n    Of the funds authorized by an Act authorizing appropriations for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, $10,000,000 are \nauthorized to support humanitarian activities relating to the clearing \nand disarming of landmines and the protection of civilians from \nlandmines (including activities relating to the furnishing of \neducation, training, technical assistance, demining equipment and \ntechnology and activities relating to research and development on \ndemining equipment and technology) and for contributions to United \nNations agencies and programs and to nongovernmental organizations to \nsupport such activities, and $10,000,000 are authorized for efforts to \nimprove landmine detection and neutralization.\n\nSEC. 5. ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF COSTS AND EFFECTS OF ANTIPERSONNEL \n              LANDMINES.\n\n    (a) Analysis.--(1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Agency for \nInternational Development and the Secretary of State shall jointly \nsubmit to Congress a joint report containing a quantitative and \nqualitative analysis of the social, economic, and environmental costs \nand effects of the use of antipersonnel landmines.\n    (2) The analysis shall cover not less than three countries (as \njointly determined by the Administrator and the Secretary) in which the \npresence of landmines presents significant social, economic, and \nenvironmental problems.\n    (3) In preparing the report, the Administrator and the Secretary \nshall rely on any appropriate governmental and nongovernmental \nmaterials and sources of information that are available to them.\n    (b) Assessment.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall submit to \nCongress a report setting forth the total number of members of the \nUnited States Armed Forces killed or wounded by antipersonnel landmines \nduring each of the following periods:\n            (A) World War II.\n            (B) The Korean conflict.\n            (C) The Vietnam era.\n            (D) The Persian Gulf War.\n    (2) The Secretary of Defense shall submit the report under this \nsubsection at the same time that the report required under subsection \n(a) is submitted.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``antipersonnel landmine'' means any of the \n        following:\n                    (A) Any munition placed under, on, or near the \n                ground or other surface area, delivered by artillery, \n                rocket, mortar, or similar means, or dropped from an \n                aircraft and which is designed, constructed, adapted, \n                or designed to be adapted to be detonated or exploded \n                by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person.\n                    (B) Any device or material which is designed, \n                constructed, adapted, or designed to be adapted to kill \n                or injure and which functions unexpectedly when a \n                person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless \n                object or performs an apparently safe act.\n            (2) The term ``1980 Conventional Weapons Convention'' means \n        the 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention on Production or \n        Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which \n        May Be Deemed To Be Excessively Injurious or To Have \n        Indiscriminate Effects, done at New York on April 10, 1981."
