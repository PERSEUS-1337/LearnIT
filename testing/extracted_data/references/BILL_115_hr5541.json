FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Allergies, when not properly diagnosed, cannot be \n        effectively treated.\n            (2) Allergies to food, inhaled particles, or other sources \n        can cause debilitating and, in some cases, fatal reactions.\n            (3) Allergies can substantially compound other illnesses, \n        including asthma, emphysema, and adult obstructive pulmonary \n        diseases, leading to social and economic costs for families and \n        our Nation's health care system.\n            (4) According to clinical guidelines from the National \n        Institutes of Health and recommendations from peer-reviewed \n        literature, in vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests \n        are considered equivalent as confirmatory tests in terms of \n        their sensitivity and accuracy.\n            (5) Despite these recommendations, some current Medicare \n        local coverage determinations and Medicaid coverage policies \n        deny equal access to in vitro specific IgE tests and \n        percutaneous tests.\n            (6) In vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests must \n        be equally accessible for clinicians and patients to improve \n        health outcomes, reduce system costs, and reduce current health \n        care disparities caused by the lack of equal coverage.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICAID COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SERVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1396 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in section 1902(a)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (82), by striking ``and'' at the \n                end;\n                    (B) in paragraph (83), by striking the period at \n                the end and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by inserting before the matter following \n                paragraph (83) the following new paragraph:\n            ``(84) provide, with respect to the provision of allergy \n        diagnostic testing services (as defined in section 1905(ee)) \n        under the State plan, for equality in the treatment of in vitro \n        specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests with respect to--\n                    ``(A) any medical necessity or other coverage \n                requirements established for such in vitro specific IgE \n                and percutaneous tests;\n                    ``(B) any frequency limits established for such \n                tests; and\n                    ``(C) any allergen unit limits established for such \n                tests.''; and\n            (2) in section 1905--\n                    (A) in subsection (r)--\n                            (i) by redesignating paragraph (5) as \n                        paragraph (6); and\n                            (ii) by inserting after paragraph (4) the \n                        following new paragraph:\n            ``(5) Allergy diagnostic testing services (as defined in \n        subsection (ee)).''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following new \n                subsection:\n    ``(ee) Allergy Diagnostic Testing Services Defined.--The term \n`allergy diagnostic testing services' means in vitro specific IgE tests \nand percutaneous tests that--\n            ``(1) have been cleared under section 501(k), classified \n        under section 513(f)(2), or approved under section 515 of the \n        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and\n            ``(2) are provided to individuals for the purpose of \n        evaluating immunologic response to certain antigens.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the amendments \n        made by this section shall apply with respect to items and \n        services provided on or after January 1, 2019.\n            (2) Exception for state legislation.--In the case of a \n        State plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) that the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services determines requires State legislation in order for the \n        respective plan to meet any requirement imposed by amendments \n        made by this section, the respective plan shall not be regarded \n        as failing to comply with the requirements of such title solely \n        on the basis of its failure to meet such an additional \n        requirement before the first day of the first calendar quarter \n        beginning after the close of the first regular session of the \n        State legislature that begins after the date of the enactment \n        of this Act.
