STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n    (a) Study.--\n            (1) In general.--The Federal banking agencies shall, \n        jointly, conduct a study of the impact of the Standardized \n        Approach NPR and the Advanced Approach NPR, respectively, on \n        the minimum regulatory capital requirements of insured \n        depository institutions and insured depository institution \n        holding companies. As part of this study, the Federal banking \n        agencies shall separately identify the various provisions of \n        the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \n        and of amendments made by that Act, that affect capital \n        quality, capital levels, asset quality, and the risk management \n        activities of insured depository institutions and insured \n        depository holding companies (hereinafter ``identified \n        provisions'') and take into consideration the impact of such \n        provisions. Without excluding any provisions the Federal \n        banking agencies identify as affecting capital quality, capital \n        levels, asset quality, and the risk management activities of \n        insured depository institutions and insured depository holding \n        companies, the identified provisions shall include the \n        following provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n        Consumer Protection Act, and the amendments made by such \n        provisions of such Act:\n                    (A) Section 115 (regarding enhanced supervision and \n                prudential standards).\n                    (B) Section 165 (regarding enhanced supervision and \n                prudential standards).\n                    (C) Section 166 (regarding early remediation \n                requirements).\n                    (D) Section 171 (regarding leverage and risk-based \n                capital requirements).\n                    (E) Section 619 (regarding prohibitions on \n                proprietary trading and certain relationships with \n                hedge funds and private equity funds).\n                    (F) Section 939 (regarding the removal of statutory \n                references to credit ratings).\n                    (G) Section 941 (regarding regulation of credit \n                risk retention and exemption of qualified residential \n                mortgages).\n                    (H) Section 1412 (regarding safe harbor and \n                rebuttable presumptions for qualified mortgages).\n            (2) Contents of study.--In conducting the study required in \n        paragraph (1), the Federal banking agencies shall determine and \n        make projections of the likely cumulative impact of the \n        Standardized Approach NPR, the Advanced Approach NPR, the Basel \n        III NPR, and the identified provisions on required regulatory \n        capital levels, capital quality, asset quality, and risk \n        management at covered financial institutions. Based on these \n        findings, the Federal banking agencies shall provide an \n        assessment regarding--\n                    (A) changes to required capital levels;\n                    (B) the aggregate increase or decrease of total \n                risk-weighted asset levels for the institutions to \n                which the Standardized Approach NPR or Advanced \n                Approach NPR would be applicable based on current \n                assets;\n                    (C) whether the NPRs and identified provisions will \n                cause capital levels at covered institutions to \n                fluctuate with more frequency or by greater amounts \n                than the current rules and indicate what, if any, \n                safety and soundness issues such fluctuations raise for \n                financial institutions or the financial system;\n                    (D) whether the NPRs and the identified provisions \n                will result in the discontinuation of the use of \n                certain risk management tools by covered financial \n                institutions and the impact on the safety and soundness \n                of financial institutions and the financial system;\n                    (E) the impact the NPRs and the identified \n                provisions will have on residential mortgage lending \n                and home equity lines of credit;\n                    (F) the likely cumulative impact of the NPRs and \n                the identified provisions will have on the availability \n                of credit, generally and in low- and moderate-income \n                areas;\n                    (G) the variance in required capital levels, \n                assets, and asset quality between institutions that \n                implement the advanced approaches or approaches to risk \n                weighting of assets and those that use the Standardized \n                Approach NPR or the Advanced Approach NPR and the \n                impact on competition between entities using different \n                approaches; and\n                    (H) historical probability of default and loss \n                given default of residential mortgage loans and the \n                proposed risk weightings in the Standardized Approach \n                NPR and the Advanced Approach NPR, and whether such \n                proposed risk weightings are appropriately and fairly \n                calibrated.\n            (3) Voluntary participation.--The Federal banking agencies \n        may seek input and participation from insured depository \n        institutions and insured depository institution holding \n        companies, however, participation in the study by insured \n        depository institutions and insured depository institution \n        holding companies shall be voluntary.\n    (b) Report.--\n            (1) In general.--The Federal banking agencies shall issue a \n        report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \n        of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the \n        House of Representatives on the results of the study required \n        by subsection (a).\n            (2) Contents.--The Federal banking agencies shall include \n        the methodologies and assumptions used in the study as well as \n        the required elements of the study listed in subsection (a) in \n        the report required in this subsection.\n\nSEC. 4. COMPETITIVE EQUALITY.\n\n    Section 908(a)(1) of the International Lending Supervision Act of \n1983 (12 U.S.C. 3907(a)(1)) is amended by inserting at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall, consistent with \nsafety and soundness, seek to ensure that any differences in rules \nimplementing the capital standards required under this section or other \nprovisions of Federal law for banking institutions, savings \nassociations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding \ncompanies do not give competitive advantages to any class or group of \nsuch institutions, associations, or companies unless required by other \nFederal law, and do not undermine any requirements for enhanced \nsupervision and prudential standards required by section 115 of the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. \n5325).''."
