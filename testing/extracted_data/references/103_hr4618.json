    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bovine Growth Hormone Milk Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Synthetic recombinant bovine growth hormone (in this \n        section referred to as ``synthetic BGH'') is a product of \n        genetic engineering and is the first food product of genetic \n        engineering to be in direct widespread use in the consumer \n        marketplace and to be ingested in significant amounts by \n        infants and children.\n            (2) Synthetic BGH injections in dairy cows result in a \n        residue of synthetic BGH in the milk produced by injected cows.\n            (3) Synthetic BGH injections of dairy cows result in \n        increased levels of bovine insulin-like growth factor in the \n        milk produced by injected cows. According to the American \n        Medical Association and others, further studies are required to \n        determine whether human ingestion of higher than normal levels \n        of bovine insulin-like growth factor is safe.\n            (4) Synthetic BGH injections result in a variety of health \n        problems in injected cows, including significant increases in \n        mastitis (an infection of the cow's udder that results in \n        visibly abnormal milk).\n            (5) The cow health problems resulting from synthetic BGH \n        injections will result in a significant increased use of \n        antibiotics in injected cows. Many of the antibiotics used to \n        treat mastitis in dairy cows are not detected in the usual milk \n        monitoring process. The Food and Drug Administration determined \n        that synthetic BGH poses a ``manageable risk'' to consumers \n        because of the increased risk of antibiotics entering the \n        consumer milk supply.\n            (6) Consumers are concerned about hormones and antibiotics \n        in their food and humane treatment of animals and have shown \n        overwhelming support for labeling of milk and milk products \n        produced with synthetic BGH.\n            (7) According to the Office of Management and Budget, \n        synthetic BGH use will result in an increase in Federal budget \n        costs of over $500,000,000 in the next 5 years and a decrease \n        in overall dairy farm income of $1.3 billion dollars in that \n        same period.\n            (8) As of June 1994, the European Community had a \n        moratorium on the commercial use of synthetic BGH and the \n        Canadian Parliament had recommended a similar moratorium. \n        Australia and New Zealand, where one quarter of the world's \n        milk is produced, refused to approve synthetic BGH.\n            (9) Consumers have a right to know if the milk they consume \n        has been produced with synthetic BGH.\n            (10) Both States and individual companies have begun to \n        take actions to label products produced with synthetic BGH.\n            (11) Confusion surrounding label claims and regulations \n        have resulted in lawsuits against States and companies who have \n        implemented label programs.\n            (12) There is a need for a common label to provide \n        consumers across the country with a simple and accessible means \n        of identifying milk produced with synthetic BGH.\n            (13) A synthetic BGH residue test is needed to validate \n        label claims in order to ensure consumers that the labels are \n        truthful and not misleading.\n            (14) A residue test is generally required when a drug is \n        found to leave a residue in a human food product.\n            (15) Scientific organizations, including the American \n        Medical Association and the Consumers Union, have stated that a \n        synthetic BGH residue test can be devised. Much of the \n        preliminary research for a test has already been completed. \n        Claims have been made that a test already has been successfully \n        developed in a lab.\n\n                           TITLE I--LABELING\n\nSEC. 101. LABELING.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall require the \nfollowing labeling of milk and milk products:\n            (1) If it is milk that--\n                    (A) is intended for human consumption; and\n                    (B)(i) is produced by cows that have been injected \n                with synthetic BGH; or\n                    (ii) has been commingled with milk produced by such \n                cows,\n        the labeling of the milk shall bear the following statement: \n        ``This milk was produced by cows injected with synthetic \n        BGH.''.\n            (2) If it is a milk product that is intended for human \n        consumption and is derived from milk described in paragraph \n        (1), the labeling of the milk product shall bear the following \n        statement: ``This milk product was derived from milk produced \n        by cows injected with synthetic BGH.''.\n\nSEC. 102. RECORDS.\n\n    (a) Records.--A person who sells synthetic BGH, purchases the \nhormone, distributes the hormone, or injects the hormone into a cow \nshall prepare and maintain records that comply with the regulations \nissued by the Secretary of Agriculture under subsection (b).\n    (b) Regulations regarding records.--\n            (1) Persons covered.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n        of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n        issue regulations that require--\n                    (A) persons who sell synthetic BGH;\n                    (B) persons who purchase synthetic BGH;\n                    (C) persons who distribute synthetic BGH; and\n                    (D) persons who inject synthetic BGH into cows,\n        to create and maintain records that contain the applicable \n        information specified in paragraph (2).\n            (2) Information.--Regulations issued under paragraph (1) \n        shall require records to contain a description of--\n                    (A) the quantity and source of the synthetic BGH \n                obtained (by manufacture, purchase, or any other \n                means);\n                    (B) the date on which the hormone was obtained; and\n                    (C) the identity of each person to whom the hormone \n                was sold or otherwise distributed, the cows into which \n                any portion of the hormone was injected, and each \n                person who has an operator or ownership interest in the \n                cows.\n    (c) Other Regulations.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall issue \nregulations that establish--\n            (1) requirements with respect to the sale, distribution, \n        and administration of synthetic BGH; and\n            (2) such other requirements with respect to the use of \n        synthetic BGH as the Secretary may determine to be necessary to \n        carry out the objectives of this Act.\n\nSEC. 103.
