FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) according to the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service, approximately 170,200,000 acres of wetlands existed in \n        Alaska in the 1780s and approximately 170,000,000 acres of \n        wetlands exist now, representing a loss rate of less than one-\n        tenth of 1 percent through human and natural processes;\n            (2) according to the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service more than 221 million acres of wetlands existed at the \n        time of Colonial America in the area that is now the contiguous \n        United States and 117 million of those acres, roughly 53 \n        percent, have been filled, drained, or otherwise removed from \n        wetland status;\n            (3) Alaska contains more wetlands than any other State, and \n        more wetlands than all other States combined;\n            (4) 88 percent of Alaska's wetlands are publicly owned, \n        whereas only 26 percent of the wetlands in the contiguous 48 \n        States are in public ownership;\n            (5) approximately 98 percent of all Alaskan communities, \n        including 200 of 209 remote villages in Alaska, are located in \n        or adjacent to wetlands;\n            (6) approximately 62 percent of all federally designated \n        wilderness lands, 70 percent of all Federal park lands, and 90 \n        percent of all Federal refuge lands are located in Alaska, thus \n        providing protection to approximately 60 million acres of \n        wetlands;\n            (7) more than 60 million acres of wetlands are conserved in \n        some form by land designations that restrict utilization or \n        degradation of wetlands;\n            (8) 104 million acres of land were granted to the State of \n        Alaska at statehood for purposes of economic development;\n            (9) approximately 43 million acres of land were granted to \n        Native Alaskans through regional and village corporations and \n        native allotments for their use and between 45 percent and 100 \n        percent of each Native corporations' land is categorized as \n        wetlands;\n            (10) development of basic community infrastructure in \n        Alaska, where approximately 75 percent of the non-mountainous \n        areas are wetlands, is often delayed and sometimes prevented by \n        the wetlands regulatory program for minimal identifiable \n        environmental benefit;\n            (11) the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act formerly regulated \n        disposition of dredge spoils in navigable waters, which did not \n        include wetlands, to keep navigable waters free of impairments;\n            (12) the 1972 Clean Water Act formed the basis for a broad \n        expansion of Federal jurisdiction over wetlands by modifying \n        the definition of ``navigable waters'' to include all ``waters \n        of the United States'';\n            (13) in 1975, a United States district court ordered the \n        Corps to publish revised regulations concerning the scope of \n        the section 404 program, regulations that expanded the scope of \n        the program to include the discharge of dredged and fill \n        material into wetlands;\n            (14) the wetlands regulatory program was expanded yet again \n        by regulatory action to include isolated wetlands, those that \n        are not adjacent to navigable waters, and such an expansion \n        formed the basis for burdensome intrusions on the property \nrights of Alaskans, Alaskan Native Corporations, the State of Alaska, \nand property owners in Alaska;\n            (15) expansion of the wetlands regulatory program in this \n        manner is beyond what the Congress intended when it passed the \n        Clean Water Act and the expansion has placed increasing and \n        unnecessary economic and administrative burdens on private \n        property owners, small businesses, city governments, State \n        governments, farmers, ranchers, and others for negligible \n        environmental benefit associated with wetland permits;\n            (16) for Alaska, a State with substantial conserved \n        wetlands and less than 1 percent private, non-corporate land \n        ownership, the burdens of the current wetlands regulatory \n        program unnecessarily inhibit reasonable community growth and \n        environmentally benign, sensitive resource development;\n            (17) Alaska villages, municipalities, boroughs, city \n        governments, and Native organizations are experiencing \n        increasing frustration with the constraints of the wetlands \n        regulatory program because it interferes with the location of \n        community centers, airports, sanitation systems, roads, \n        schools, industrial areas, and other critical community \n        infrastructure;\n            (18) policies that purport to achieve ``no net loss'' of \n        wetlands reflect a Federal response to the 53 percent loss of \n        the wetlands base in the south 48, a calculation that excludes \n        Alaska wetlands;\n            (19) total wetlands loss in Alaska is less than one-tenth \n        of 1 percent of the total wetlands acreage in Alaska;\n            (20) individual landowners in Alaska have experienced \n        devaluations of up to 97 percent of their property value due to \n        wetlands regulations and the tax base of many communities has \n        diminished by those regulations.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT.\n\n    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) is \namended--\n            (a) in section 101(a) (33 U.S.C. 1251(a)) by--\n                    (1) striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (6);\n                    (2) striking the period at the end of paragraph (7) \n                and inserting in lieu thereof ``; and''; and\n                    (3) adding the following new paragraphs:\n            ``(8) it is the national policy to--\n                    ``(A) achieve a balance between wetlands \n                conservation and adverse economic impacts on local, \n                regional, and private economic interests and\n                    ``(B) to eliminate the regulatory taking of private \n                property by the regulatory program authorized under \n                section 404;\n            ``(9) it is the national policy to encourage localized \n        wetlands planning, without mandating it and by providing funds \n        to encourage it, and such planning shall allow local political \n        subdivisions and local governments to apply differential \n        standards for the issuance of wetlands permits based on factors \n        that include the relative amount of conserved wetlands habitat \n        and the wetlands loss rate in the State in which such political \n        subdivision or local government is located; and\n            ``(10) it is the national policy that compensatory \n        mitigation on wetlands or potential wetlands located outside \n        the boundaries of a State shall not be required, requested, or \n        otherwise utilized to offset impacts to wetlands inside that \n        State.'';\n            (b) in section 404(b) (33 U.S.C. 1344(b)) by inserting \n        immediately after ``anchorage'' the following--\n            ``: Provided, however, That the guidelines adopted pursuant \n        to clause (1) for a State with substantial conserved wetlands \n        areas--\n            ``(A) shall not include requirements or standards for \n        mitigation to compensate for wetlands loss and adverse impacts \n        to wetlands;\n            ``(B) may include requirements or standards for \n        minimization of adverse impacts to wetlands; and\n            ``(C) may include standards or requirements for avoidance \n        of impacts only if the permit applicant is not required to \n        establish that upland alternative sites do not exist.'';\n            (c) in section 404(e) (33 U.S.C. 1344(e)) by inserting at \n        the end the following new paragraph--\n            ``(3) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs \n(1) and (2), at the request of a State with substantial conserved \nwetlands areas, the Secretary shall issue general permits for such \nStates and the requirements under which such general permits are issued \nshall contain a regulatory standard for discharge of dredged or fill \nmaterial into navigable waters in such State, including wetlands, that \nis no greater than the standard under subsection (b).'';\n            (d) in section 404(f)(1) (33 U.S.C. 1344(f)(1)) by--\n                    (1) striking the comma at the end of subparagraph \n                (F) and inserting in lieu thereof a semicolon; and\n                    (2) adding the following new subparagraphs--\n                    ``(G) associated with airport safety (ground and \n                air) in a State with substantial conserved wetlands \n                areas, and in any case associated with airport safety \n                (ground and air) when the Secretary of Transportation \n                determines that it is advisable for public safety \n                reasons and deems it necessary;\n                    ``(H) for construction and maintenance of log \n                transfer facilities associated with log transportation \n                activities;\n                    ``(I) for construction of tailings impoundments \n                utilized for treatment facilities (as determined by the \n                development document) for the mining subcategory for \n                which the tailings impoundment is constructed;\n                    ``(J) for construction of ice pads and ice roads \n                and for purposes of snow storage and removal,''; and\n            (e) by adding at the end of section 404 (33 U.S.C. 1344) \n        the following new subsections--\n    ``(s) Definitions.--For purposes of this section the term--\n            ``(1) `conserved wetlands' means wetlands that are located \n        in the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, \n        National Wilderness System, the Wild and Scenic River System, \n        and other similar Federal conservation systems, combined with \n        wetlands located in comparable types of conservation systems \n        established under State and local authority within State and \n        local land use systems.\n            ``(2) `economic base lands' means lands conveyed to, \n        selected by, or owned by Alaska Native entities pursuant to the \n        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, Public Law 92-203, as \n        amended, or the Alaska Native Allotment Act of 1906 (34 Stat. \n        197), and lands conveyed to, selected by, or owned by the State \n        of Alaska pursuant to the Alaska Statehood Act, Public Law 85-\n        508, as amended.\n            ``(3) `State with substantial conserved wetlands areas' \n        means any State which--\n                    ``(A) contains at least 15 areas of wetlands for \n                each acre of wetlands filled, drained, or otherwise \n                converted within such State (based upon wetlands loss \n                statistics reported in the 1990 United States Fish and \n                Wildlife Service Wetlands Trends report to Congress \n                entitled `Wetlands Losses in the United States 1780's \n                to 1980's');
