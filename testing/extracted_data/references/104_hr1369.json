FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Park Service administers Federal parks, \n        monuments, and reservations, to conserve the scenery, the \n        natural and historic objects, and wildlife therein, and \n        provides for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by \n        such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of \n        future generations.\n            (2) It is the function of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration to manage the safe and efficient use of the \n        navigable airspace of the United States, as provided for in the \n        Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. App. 1301 et seq.).\n            (3) The National Park Service lands in the State of Hawaii, \n        consisting of Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park, \n        Kalaupapa National Historical Park, Pu'u honua o Honaunau \n        National Historical Park, Pu'u Kohola Heiau National Historic \n        Site, Haleakala National Park, and Hawaii Volcanoes National \n        Park, are managed for the purposes of wilderness preservation, \n        protecting natural, cultural, historical, and wildlife \n        resources, and for promotion of the public enjoyment and use of \n        these resources.\n            (4) Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes National Parks are \n        designated by the United Nations as International Biosphere \n        Reserves because of their internationally significant scenery \n        and plant and animal communities, and furthermore that Hawaii \n        Volcanoes National Park is designated by the United Nations as \n        a World Heritage Site because of the significance of Mauna Loa \n        and Kilauea Volcanoes.\n            (5) In recognition of the values for which National Park \n        Service lands are managed, an above ground level (AGL) minimum \n        altitude of 1,500 feet shall be established for aircraft flying \n        in airspace over certain lands administered by the National \n        Park Service.\n            (6) The auditory and visual intrusion of aircraft flying at \n        low altitudes is the source of public complaint in certain \n        areas administered by the National Park Service.\n            (7) Aircraft flying at low altitudes may pose a potential \n        hazard to wildlife in certain areas administered by the \n        National Park Service.\n            (8) Aircraft flying at low altitudes over large \n        concentrations of migratory birds may pose a potential safety \n        hazard to pilots and passengers in certain areas administered \n        by the National Park Service.\n            (9) The Federal Aviation Administration and National Park \n        Service shall act in cooperation to reduce the incidence of \n        low-flying aircraft, including fixed-wing aircraft, \n        helicopters, ultralight vehicles, balloons, and gliders over \n        National Park Service administered land by complying with the \n        1,500 feet AGL minimum altitude requirement, and to avoid \n        flying over areas which the National Park Service designates as \n        noise-sensitive, and to respect standoff distances away from \n        areas which the National Park Service designates as primary \n        visitor use areas.\n\nSEC. 2.
