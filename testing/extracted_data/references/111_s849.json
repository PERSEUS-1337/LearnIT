    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) black carbon--\n                    (A) is a component of ambient particulate matter, \n                the mixture of which has been found to harm public \n                health by causing serious respiratory and \n                cardiovascular effects in developed and developing \n                countries;\n                    (B) plays a role in climate change by--\n                            (i) absorbing solar radiation; and\n                            (ii) reducing the reflectivity of snow and \n                        ice; and\n                    (C) is emitted from incomplete combustion of fossil \n                fuels, biomass, and biofuels;\n            (2) recent studies have shown that, in the United States, \n        old diesel engines are a major contributor of black carbon;\n            (3)(A) the United States has made great progress in \n        reducing black carbon emissions through regulations on new \n        vehicles and engines and a voluntary national diesel retrofit \n        program; but\n            (B) there remain in the United States more than 11,000,000 \n        diesel engines lacking the latest diesel emission control \n        technology; and\n            (4) the collection of information relating to, and research \n        regarding, black carbon would be useful to identify cost-\n        effective methods of reducing black carbon emissions in ways \n        and from sources that would have beneficial effects on the \n        public health and the climate.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Black carbon.--The term ``black carbon'' means any \n        light-absorbing graphitic (such as elemental) particle produced \n        by incomplete combustion.\n\nSEC. 3.
