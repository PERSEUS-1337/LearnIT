    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Immigration Law Enforcement Act of \n2006''.\n\nTITLE I--STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION IN THE ENFORCEMENT \n                         OF IMMIGRATION LAW ACT\n\nSEC. 101. FEDERAL AFFIRMATION OF ASSISTANCE IN IMMIGRATION LAW \n              ENFORCEMENT BY STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF \n              STATES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law and \nreaffirming the existing inherent authority of States, law enforcement \npersonnel of a State or a political subdivision of a State have the \ninherent authority of a sovereign entity to investigate, identify, \napprehend, arrest, detain, or transfer to Federal custody aliens in the \nUnited States (including the transportation of such aliens across State \nlines to detention centers), for the purposes of assisting in the \nenforcement of the immigration laws of the United States in the course \nof carrying out routine duties. This State authority has never been \ndisplaced or preempted by Congress.\n    (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed to \nrequire law enforcement personnel of a State or political subdivision \nof a State to--\n            (1) report the identity of a victim of, or a witness to, a \n        criminal offense to the Secretary of Homeland Security for \n        immigration enforcement purposes; or\n            (2) arrest such victim or witness for a violation of the \n        immigration laws of the United States.\n\n                TITLE II--ALIEN SMUGGLER PROSECUTION ACT\n\nSEC. 201. EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION OF ALIEN SMUGGLERS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Recent experience shows that alien smuggling is \n        flourishing, is increasingly violent, and is highly profitable.\n            (2) Alien smuggling operations also present terrorist and \n        criminal organizations with opportunities for smuggling their \n        members into the United States practically at will.\n            (3) Alien smuggling is a lucrative business. Each year, \n        criminal organizations that smuggle or traffic in persons are \n        estimated to generate $9,500,000,000 in revenue worldwide.\n            (4) Alien smuggling frequently involves dangerous and \n        inhumane conditions for smuggled aliens. Migrants are \n        frequently abused or exploited, both during their journey and \n        upon reaching the United States. Consequently, aliens smuggled \n        into the United States are at significant risk of physical \n        injury, abuse, and death.\n            (5) Notwithstanding that alien smuggling poses a risk to \n        the United States as a whole, uniform guidelines for the \n        prosecution of smuggling offenses are not employed by the \n        various United States attorneys. Understanding that border-area \n        United States attorneys face an overwhelming workload, a lack \n        of sufficient prosecutions by certain United States attorneys \n        has encouraged additional smuggling, and demoralized Border \n        Patrol officers charged with enforcing our anti-smuggling laws.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nAttorney General should adopt, not later than 3 months after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, uniform guidelines for the prosecution of \nsmuggling offenses to be followed by each United States attorney in the \nUnited States.\n    (c) Additional Personnel.--In each of the fiscal years 2008 through \n2013, the Attorney General shall, subject to the availability of \nappropriations, increase by not less than 20 the number of attorneys in \nthe offices of United States attorneys employed to prosecute cases \nunder section 274 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1324), as compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n            TITLE III--ENDING CATCH AND RELEASE ACT OF 2006\n\nSEC. 301. APPROPRIATE REMEDIES FOR IMMIGRATION LITIGATION.\n\n    (a) Requirements for an Order Granting Prospective Relief Against \nthe Government.--\n            (1) In general.--If a court determines that prospective \n        relief should be ordered against the Government in any civil \n        action pertaining to the administration or enforcement of the \n        immigration laws of the United States, the court shall--\n                    (A) limit the relief to the minimum necessary to \n                correct the violation of law;\n                    (B) adopt the least intrusive means to correct the \n                violation of law;\n                    (C) minimize, to the greatest extent practicable, \n                the adverse impact on national security, border \n                security, immigration administration and enforcement, \n                and public safety; and\n                    (D) provide for the expiration of the relief on a \n                specific date, which is not later than the earliest \n                date necessary for the Government to remedy the \n                violation.\n            (2) Written explanation.--The requirements described in \n        paragraph (1) shall be discussed and explained in writing in \n        the order granting prospective relief and must be sufficiently \n        detailed to allow review by another court.\n            (3) Expiration of preliminary injunctive relief.--\n        Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the \n        date that is 90 days after the date on which such relief is \n        entered, unless the court--\n                    (A) makes the findings required under paragraph (1) \n                for the entry of permanent prospective relief; and\n                    (B) makes the order final before expiration of such \n                90-day period.\n            (4) Requirements for order denying motion.--This subsection \n        shall apply to any order denying the Government's motion to \n        vacate, modify, dissolve or otherwise terminate an order \n        granting prospective relief in any civil action pertaining to \n        the administration or enforcement of the immigration laws of \n        the United States.\n    (b) Procedure for Motion Affecting Order Granting Prospective \nRelief Against the Government.--\n            (1) In general.--A court shall promptly rule on the \n        Government's motion to vacate, modify, dissolve or otherwise \n        terminate an order granting prospective relief in any civil \n        action pertaining to the administration or enforcement of the \n        immigration laws of the United States.\n            (2) Automatic stays.--\n                    (A) In general.--The Government's motion to vacate, \n                modify, dissolve, or otherwise terminate an order \n                granting prospective relief made in any civil action \n                pertaining to the administration or enforcement of the \n                immigration laws of the United States shall \n                automatically, and without further order of the court, \n                stay the order granting prospective relief on the date \n                that is 15 days after the date on which such motion is \n                filed unless the court previously has granted or denied \n                the Government's motion.\n                    (B) Duration of automatic stay.--An automatic stay \n                under subparagraph (A) shall continue until the court \n                enters an order granting or denying the Government's \n                motion.\n                    (C) Postponement.--The court, for good cause, may \n                postpone an automatic stay under subparagraph (A) for \n                not longer than 15 days.\n                    (D) Orders blocking automatic stays.--Any order \n                staying, suspending, delaying, or otherwise barring the \n                effective date of the automatic stay described in \n                subparagraph (A), other than an order to postpone the \n                effective date of the automatic stay for not longer \n                than 15 days under subparagraph (C), shall be--\n                            (i) treated as an order refusing to vacate, \n                        modify, dissolve or otherwise terminate an \n                        injunction;
