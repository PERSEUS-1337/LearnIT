    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Park Centennial Act of \n2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds:\n            (1) The National Park Service was established to conserve \n        the national parks, their scenery, natural and historic \n        objects, and wildlife for the enjoyment, in such manner and by \n        such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of \n        future generations.\n            (2) The central purpose of the establishment of our \n        national parks is being challenged by chronic funding \n        shortfalls, which have created annual shortfalls in operational \n        funding that exceed $600,000,000, and have amassed a \n        maintenance backlog estimated by the General Accounting Office \n        at between $4,080,000,000 and $6,800,000,000.\n            (3) Without providing the Park Service the resources \n        necessary to operate and maintain our national parks, future \n        generations will receive diminished visitor services, will \n        experience a continually weakening system that is less and less \n        able to fulfill its mission, and will inherit a national park \n        system than has been left to them in worse condition that it \n        was left to their ancestors.\n            (4) The annual appropriations process has proved incapable \n        of fully addressing the debilitating funding shortfalls of the \n        national parks, making it necessary to supplement what the \n        appropriations process is able to accomplish.\n            (5) It is necessary to ensure that fiscal resources devoted \n        to the national parks are spent wisely and effectively, making \n        strong congressional oversight over annual appropriations \n        extremely important.\n            (6) Congress can enhance the resources available for \n        national park operations and ensure adequate oversight over \n        Park Service spending by removing from the appropriations \n        process a series of funding responsibilities that are outside \n        the core operating budgets for the national parks.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to eliminate the annual \noperating deficit and the maintenance backlog in the national parks by \nthe centennial anniversary of the National Park System by enabling \nCongress to focus on overseeing and fully funding the core operations \nof the national parks in the annual appropriations process.\n\n                        TITLE I--CENTENNIAL FUND\n\nSEC. 101.
