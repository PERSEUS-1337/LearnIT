PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require all commercial \nair tour operators to hold a concessions permit with the Park Unit, and \nto provide Park Service authority to determine the appropriate level of \ncommercial scenic tour overflight activity.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The National Park Service administers Federal parks, \n        monuments, and reservations, to conserve the scenery; natural, \n        cultural and historic values; wilderness values, including \n        natural quiet; and wildlife resources while providing for the \n        enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will \n        leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. \n        In recognition of these values, many park units are recognized \n        as internationally significant International Biosphere Reserves \n        and World Heritage Sites.\n            (2) In order to manage National Park System units to \n        achieve the purposes for which they were established by \n        Congress, there is a need for National Park Service authority \n        to regulate commercial scenic overflight enterprises operating \n        over units of the National Park system.\n            (3) It is the function of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration to manage the safe and efficient use of the \n        navigable airspace of the United States, as provided for in the \n        Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. App. 1391, et seq.); \n        and to protect the environment from adverse impacts in accord \n        with sections 307(c) and 611 of the foregoing Act and section \n        4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. \n        1653(f)).\n            (4) The auditory and visual intrusion of aircraft flying at \n        low altitudes can be incompatible with the preservation and \n        management of natural or cultural resources, the natural quiet, \n        scenery, and/or the public's enjoyment of the resources on \n        lands managed by the public land management agencies, notably \n        such sensitive areas as parks, wildlife refuges, and wilderness \n        areas.\n            (5) It is the joint responsibility of these agencies to \n        resolve these incompatible situations or mitigate them to the \n        fullest extent possible in order to maintain these public lands \n        for the purposes for which they were established while \n        recognizing the public's and the Government's need to transit \n        navigable airspace.\n            (6) In recognition of the values for which National Park \n        Service lands are managed, the Federal Aviation Administration \n        and the National Park Service shall act cooperatively to reduce \n        the incidence of low-flying aircraft impacts from commercial \n        scenic tour overflights by helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, \n        blimps, and balloons over sensitive lands administered by the \n        National Park Service and to make these overflights compatible \n        with park preservation objectives.\n\nSEC. 3. COMMERCIAL AIR TOURS.\n\n    The Act of October 9, 1965 (16 U.S.C. 20-20g) commonly known as the \nNational Park Service Concessions Policy Act is amended by adding the \nfollowing new section at the end thereof:\n\n``SEC. 10.

Such permits may be issued subject to such \nconditions and restrictions as the Secretary deems necessary to protect \nthe resources of such unit and to protect and enhance visitor \nenjoyment.

The amendments shall--\n            ``(1) document the degree to which commercial scenic \n        overflights may affect the natural resources of the park unit \n        concerned;\n            ``(2) document the effects of such overflights on the park \n        visitor's experience; and\n            ``(3) propose measures necessary to protect park resources \n        and the visitor's experience from the adverse effects of \n        commercial scenic overflights.\nEach permit issued under subsection (a) for flights over any national \npark system unit after the effective date of general management plan \namendments adopted under this subsection shall be consistent with such \namendments.\n    ``(d) Penalty.--Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any \nrequirement of this section or of any rule or regulation promulgated by \nthe Secretary under this section shall be fined not more than $5,000 or \nimprisoned for not more than 5 years or both.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
