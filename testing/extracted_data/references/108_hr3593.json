FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In a recent report, a startling 85 percent of college \n        counseling centers revealed an increase in the number of \n        students they see with psychological problems. Furthermore, the \n        American College Health Association found that 61 percent of \n        college students reported feeling hopeless, 45 percent said \n        they felt so depressed they could barely function, and 9 \n        percent felt suicidal.\n            (2) There is clear evidence of an increased incidence of \n        depression among college students. According to a survey \n        described in the Chronicle of Higher Education (February 1, \n        2002), depression among freshmen has nearly doubled (from 8.2 \n        percent to 16.3 percent). Without treatment, researchers \n        recently noted that ``depressed adolescents are at risk for \n        school failure, social isolation, promiscuity, self medication \n        with drugs and alcohol, and suicide--now the third leading \n        cause of death among 10-24 year olds.''\n            (3) Researchers who conducted the study ``Changes in \n        Counseling Center Client Problems Across 13 Years'' (1989-2001) \n        at Kansas State University stated that ``students are \n        experiencing more stress, more anxiety, more depression than \n        they were a decade ago.'' (The Chronicle of Higher Education, \n        February 14, 2003).\n            (4) According to a 1999 UCLA study, more than 30 percent of \n        college freshmen reported feeling overwhelmed a great deal of \n        the time during the beginning of college and may benefit from \n        psychological services.\n            (5) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug \n        Abuse, the highest prevalence of both binge and heavy drinking \n        was found in young adults ages 18 to 25 (especially on college \n        campuses). In addition, the results of a Harvard School of \n        Public Health College Alcohol Study Survey printed in the \n        Journal of American Health show that 44.4 percent of college \n        students describe themselves as binge drinkers.\n            (6) The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \n        in 2002 reported that 1400 college students die each year from \n        alcohol-related injuries. In addition, it is stated that \n        college students who drink are more likely to assault, sexually \n        abuse, and vandalize others. Furthermore, it is reported that \n        25 percent of college students attribute academic problems to \n        excessive drinking.\n            (7) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug \n        Abuse, 20 percent of full-time undergraduate college students \n        use illicit drugs.\n            (8) The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also \n        reported that 18.4 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 are \n        dependent on or abusing illicit drugs or alcohol. In addition, \n        the study found that ``serious mental illness is highly \n        correlated with substance dependence or abuse. Among adults \n        with serious mental illness in 2001, 20.3 percent were \n        dependent on or abused alcohol or illicit drugs, while the rate \n        among adults without serious mental illness was only 6.3 \n        percent.''\n            (9) In 2001, there were 249,000 victims of rape in the \n        United States, according to statistics from the Rape, Abuse and \n        Incest National Network. 36 percent of victims of rape and \n        sexual assault are between the ages of 18 and 30.\n            (10) The National Victim's Center in 2001 reported that \n        13.3 percent of college women say they have been forced to have \n        sex in a dating situation.\n            (11) According to the National Eating Disorders \n        Association, 5-10 million women and 1 million men struggle with \n        eating disorders including anorexia, bulimia, binge eating \n        disorder, or borderline conditions after puberty.\n\nSEC. 3.
