FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It remains an urgent national priority to improve \n        economic growth and create new jobs.\n            (2) National security requires economic strength and global \n        engagement.\n            (3) Businesses today have a wide array of choices when \n        considering where to invest, expand, or establish new \n        operations.\n            (4) Administrations of both parties have consistently \n        reaffirmed the need to maintain an open investment climate as a \n        key to domestic economic prosperity and security.\n            (5) The United States has historically been the largest \n        worldwide recipient of global investment but has seen its share \n        of inbound global investment decline relative to its gross \n        domestic product in recent years.\n            (6) Governors and mayors throughout the United States face \n        increasing competition from other countries as they work to \n        recruit investment from global companies.\n            (7) Foreign direct investment can benefit the economy and \n        workforce of every State and Commonwealth in the United States.\n            (8) According to the latest Federal statistics, the United \n        States subsidiaries of companies headquartered abroad \n        contribute to the United States economy in a variety of \n        important ways, including by--\n                    (A) providing jobs for nearly 5,300,000 Americans \n                with average compensation that is approximately 33 \n                percent higher than the national private-sector \n                average, as these jobs are often in high-skilled, high-\n                paying industries;\n                    (B) strengthening the United States industrial base \n                and employing nearly 15 percent of the United States \n                manufacturing sector workforce;\n                    (C) establishing operations in the United States \n                from which to sell goods and services around the world, \n                thereby producing nearly 18 percent of United States \n                exports;\n                    (D) promoting innovation with more than \n                $41,000,000,000 in annual United States research and \n                development activities;\n                    (E) paying nearly 17 percent of United States \n                corporate income taxes; and\n                    (F) purchasing more than $1,800,000,000,000 in \n                domestic goods and services annually from local \n                suppliers and small businesses, amounting to 80 cents \n                for every dollar spent on input purchases.\n            (9) These companies account for 5.8 percent of United \n        States private sector Gross Domestic Product.\n            (10) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State \n        have declared increasing inbound global investment to be among \n        their top priorities.\n            (11) The President issued a statement in 2011 reaffirming \n        the longstanding open investment policy of the United States \n        and encouraged all countries to pursue such a policy.\n            (12) The President signed an Executive order in 2011 to \n        establish the SelectUSA initiative, aimed at promoting greater \n        levels of business investment in the United States.\n            (13) The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in \n        2011 recommended the establishment of a National Investment \n        Initiative to attract $1,000,000,000,000 in new business \n        investment from abroad.\n            (14) The United States and the European Union recently \n        unveiled a set of principles aimed at promoting a more open \n        climate for international investment and intended as a model \n        for countries around the world.\n            (15) Maintaining the United States commitment to open \n        investment policy encourages other countries to do the same and \n        enables the United States to open new markets abroad for United \n        States companies and their products.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the ability of the United States to attract inbound \n        investment, particularly net new investment, is directly linked \n        to the long-term economic prosperity, competitiveness, and \n        security of the United States;\n            (2) in order to remain the most attractive location for \n        global investment, Congress and Federal departments and \n        agencies should be mindful of the potential impact upon the \n        ability of the United States to attract foreign direct \n        investment when evaluating proposed legislation or regulatory \n        policy;\n            (3) it is a top national priority to enhance the \n        competitiveness, prosperity, and security of the United States \n        by--\n                    (A) removing unnecessary barriers to inward global \n                investment and the jobs that it creates throughout the \n                United States; and\n                    (B) promoting policies to ensure the United States \n                remains the premier destination for global companies to \n                invest, hire, innovate, and manufacture their products; \n                and\n            (4) while foreign direct investment can enhance our \n        economic strength, policies regarding foreign direct investment \n        should reflect national security interests.\n\nSEC. 4.
