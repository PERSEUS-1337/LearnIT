    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Neutral Government Act of \n2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE OFFSETS AND CREDITS.\n\n    (a) Federal Authorities.--Subject to the requirements of this Act, \neach executive agency (as defined in section 105 of title V of the \nUnited States Code) and each legislative branch office is authorized to \nuse appropriated funds to purchase either or both of the following in \nany open market transaction, that complies with all applicable \nprocurement rules and regulations and is approved in accordance with \nsubsection (c):\n            (1) Qualified tradeable greenhouse gas offsets.\n            (2) Qualified tradeable renewable energy credits.\n    (b) Qualification of Offsets and Credits.--A tradeable greenhouse \ngas offset or renewable energy credit shall be treated as qualified for \npurposes of this section if the Secretary of Energy certifies the \ngenerator of such offset or credit. Upon the application of any person \ngenerating or planning to generate any such offsets or credits, the \nSecretary shall certify the generator if the Secretary determines that \nthe generator meets, or will, upon implementation, meet, such \nrequirements as the Secretary deems necessary, under rules promulgated \nby the Secretary, to ensure that the offsets or credits generated will \nrepresent the reduction of greenhouse gases as specified or estimated \nin the offset (in the case of an offset) or in the generation of the \namount of renewable energy which the credit represents or is estimated \nto represent (in the case of a credit). A reduction in greenhouse gases \nthat the Secretary determines would have occurred in the absence of the \nopportunity to sell an offset for such reduction shall not be treated \nas a qualified offset for purposes of this Act.\n    (c) Approval of Open Market Transactions.--The Secretary of Energy \nshall promulgate rules, after notice and opportunity for comment, \nregarding the open market transactions (involving qualified tradeable \ngreenhouse gas offsets and qualified tradeable renewable energy \ncredits) that will be treated as approved for purposes of this Act. \nSuch rules shall accommodate forward purchasing and crediting of \noffsets and credits on an estimated basis from small scale offset and \nrenewable energy generators, and other open market transactions that \nare useful in enabling short-term purchases of greenhouse gas offsets \nand renewable energy credits to contribute meaningfully to the \nimplementation of small scale offset and renewable energy generators.\n    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Greenhouse gas offset.--The term ``greenhouse gas \n        offset'' means the reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases \n        that results from an action or actions undertaken for the \n        purpose, among others, of reducing greenhouse gas emissions \n        (including the generation of renewable energy), where: (A) such \n        action or actions would not have occurred in the absence of the \n        opportunity to sell an offset for the resulting reductions; (B) \n        the party claiming credit for the reductions has acquired the \n        exclusive legal rights to claim credit for the reductions; and \n        (C) such exclusive legal rights can be verified and approved by \n        the Secretary through an auditable contract path or other \n        system established by the Secretary.\n            (2) Greenhouse gas.--The term ``greenhouse gas'' includes \n        carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases.\n            (3) Renewable energy credit.--The term ``renewable energy \n        credit'' means all of the environmental attributes associated \n        with a single unit of energy generated by a renewable energy \n        source where: (A) those attributes are transferred or recorded \n        separately from that unit of energy; (B) the party claiming \n        ownership of the credit has acquired the exclusive legal \n        ownership of all, and not less than all, the environmental \n        attributes associated with that unit of energy; and (C) \n        exclusive legal ownership of the credit can be verified and \n        approved by the Secretary through an auditable contract path or \n        other system established by the Secretary.\n            (4) Renewable energy.--The term ``renewable energy'' means \n        electric energy generated from solar, wind, biomass, landfill \n        gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current, and thermal), \n        geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric \n        generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or \n        additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project.\n            (5) Tradeable.--The term ``tradeable'' when used in \n        connection with an offset or credit means that the offset or \n        credit is available for purchase and sale in an open and \n        transparent market.\n    (e) Effective Date.--The authority of section 1 shall take effect \nfor fiscal years after the enactment of this Act."
