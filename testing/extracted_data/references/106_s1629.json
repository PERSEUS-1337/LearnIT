FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n        (1) certain parcels of private land located in northeast Oregon \n    are intermingled with land owned by the United States and \n    administered--\n            (A) by the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Central \n        Oregon Resource Area in the Prineville Bureau of Land \n        Management District and the Baker Resource Area in the Vale \n        Bureau of Land Management District; and\n            (B) by the Secretary of Agriculture as part of the Malheur \n        National Forest, the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, and the \n        Umatilla National Forest;\n        (2) the surface estate of the private land described in \n    paragraph (1) is intermingled with parcels of land that are owned \n    by the United States or contain valuable fisheries and wildlife \n    habitat desired by the United States;\n        (3) the consolidation of land ownerships will facilitate sound \n    and efficient management for both public and private lands;\n        (4) the improvement of management efficiency through the land \n    tenure adjustment program of the Department of the Interior, which \n    disposes of small isolated tracts having low public resource values \n    within larger blocks of contiguous parcels of land, would serve \n    important public objectives, including--\n            (A) the enhancement of public access, aesthetics, and \n        recreation opportunities within or adjacent to designated wild \n        and scenic river corridors;\n            (B) the protection and enhancement of habitat for \n        threatened, endangered, and sensitive species within unified \n        landscapes under Federal management; and\n            (C) the consolidation of holdings of the Bureau of Land \n        Management and the Forest Service--\n                (i) to facilitate more efficient administration, \n            including a reduction in administrative costs to the United \n            States; and\n                (ii) to reduce right-of-way, special use, and other \n            permit processing and issuance for roads and other \n            facilities on Federal land;\n        (5) time is of the essence in completing a land exchange \n    because further delays may force the identified landowners to \n    construct roads in, log, develop, or sell the private land and \n    thereby diminish the public values for which the private land is to \n    be acquired; and\n        (6) it is in the public interest to complete the land exchanges \n    at the earliest practicable date so that the land acquired by the \n    United States can be preserved for--\n            (A) protection of threatened and endangered species \n        habitat; and\n            (B) permanent public use and enjoyment.\n\nSEC. 3.
