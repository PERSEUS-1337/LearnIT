FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Legitimate Internet sellers of prescription drugs can \n        offer substantial benefits to consumers. These potential \n        benefits include convenience, privacy, valuable information, \n        competitive prices, and personalized services.\n            (2) Unlawful Internet sellers of prescription drugs may \n        dispense inappropriate, contaminated, counterfeit, or subpotent \n        prescription drugs that could put at risk the health and safety \n        of consumers.\n            (3) Unlawful Internet sellers have exposed consumers to \n        significant health risks by knowingly filling invalid \n        prescriptions, such as prescriptions based solely on an online \n        questionnaire, or by dispensing prescription drugs without any \n        prescription.\n            (4) The ease with which web sites can be created and \n        removed and the lack of readily available information to \n        identify Internet sellers creates significant barriers to \n        effective law enforcement efforts against unlawful Internet \n        sellers.\n            (5) Consumers may have difficulty distinguishing legitimate \n        from unlawful Internet sellers, as well as foreign from \n        domestic Internet sellers, of prescription drugs.\n            (6) States need additional enforcement tools to take \n        effective action against unlawful domestic Internet sellers and \n        the Federal agencies need additional enforcement tools to take \n        effective action against unlawful foreign Internet sellers.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide Federal and \nState law enforcement with adequate tools to take effective action \nagainst interstate Internet sellers of prescription drugs who illegally \nsell such drugs to consumers in the United States and to protect such \nconsumers against potential harms that may result from purchasing such \ndrugs from such sellers.\n\nSEC. 3.
