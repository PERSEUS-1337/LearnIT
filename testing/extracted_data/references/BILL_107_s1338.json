FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The following events were key in the creation of the \n        Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument:\n                    (A) On June 25 and 26, 1876, a historic battle \n                between the United States Seventh Cavalry, led by \n                General George Armstrong Custer, and an opposing force \n                of Arapaho, Northern Cheyenne, and Lakota Indians, was \n                fought near the Little Bighorn River in southern \n                Montana.\n                    (B) On August 1, 1879, the battlefield was \n                officially recognized and designated as a national \n                cemetery under General Order No. 78, Headquarters of \n                the Army.\n                    (C) On December 7, 1886, Executive Order No. 337443 \n                established the boundary, approximately one mile \n                square, for the National Cemetery of Custer's \n                Battlefield Reservation.\n                    (D) On April 14, 1926, the Reno-Benteen Battlefield \n                was acquired by an Act of Congress (44 Stat. 168), and \n                the Army was ordered to take charge of the site.\n                    (E) On April 15, 1930, by an Act of Congress (46 \n                Stat. 168), all rights, titles and privileges of the \n                Crow tribe, from whose reservation the battlefield site \n                was carved, were granted to the United States.\n                    (F) On August 10, 1939, a public historical museum \n                was authorized (53 Stat. 1337).\n                    (G) On June 3, 1940, Executive Order No. 8428 \n                transferred management of the area to the National Park \n                Service, Department of the Interior.\n                    (H) On March 22, 1946, by an Act of Congress \n                (Public Law 79-332) the area was redesignated, Custer \n                Battlefield National Monument.\n                    (I) On January 3, 1991, by an Act of Congress \n                (Public Law 102-201), Custer Battlefield National \n                Monument was redesignated as Little Bighorn Battlefield \n                National Monument (referred to in this Act as the \n                ``Monument''), and an Indian memorial was authorized.\n            (2) The current total size of the Monument is 765.34 acres. \n        This includes the areas immediately surrounding the cemetery \n        and a separate area, the Reno-Benteen Battlefield, a few miles \n        from the cemetery. There are additional sites of historical \n        interest related to the 1876 battle that are not contained \n        within the boundaries of the Monument as it is presently \n        constituted.\n            (3) The United States has a tradition of preserving the \n        sites of historic battles, in the conviction that such ground \n        is hallowed by the sacrifices of those who gave their lives in \n        conflict, and in the hope that understanding the events of our \n        past, especially tragic events, helps us to understand the \n        people we have become. A necessary part of this preserving and \n        honoring is attempting, as much as is possible, to maintain the \n        appearance of the places where these struggles occurred as the \n        participants would have experienced them.\n            (4) The area surrounding the Monument has seen markedly \n        increased commercial development in recent years. Such \n        development not only threatens to intrude on the experience of \n        visitors to the Monument, but in many instances the development \n        has actually taken place directly on sites of historical \n        importance, irrevocably altering physical features of the \n        landscape that are crucial for understanding what took place at \n        the Battle of the Little Bighorn.\n            (5) It is in the interest of the United States to preserve \n        the integrity of the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, \n        an event of lasting significance for the United States and for \n        the sovereign Indian nations. In order to preserve this \n        historical treasure, it is imperative that additional lands \n        surrounding the Monument be set aside and given protected \n        status or be made part of the Monument itself.\n            (6) All areas of the Monument, as well as the other areas \n        of historical interest, are completely contained within the \n        external boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation.\n            (7) There is every indication that additional land and \n        facilities are available for inclusion in the Monument through \n        either voluntary conveyance or by gift or donation from private \n        individuals and entities.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to establish a cooperative and collaborative process \n        for expanding and enhancing the Monument;\n            (2) to ensure that the process established by this Act \n        reflects the social, historical and cultural concerns of the \n        Indian tribes participating in such processes in a manner \n        consistent with the long-standing Federal policy to encourage \n        tribal self-determination; and\n            (3) to ensure that the resources within the Monument are \n        protected and enhanced by--\n                    (A) providing for partnerships between the Crow \n                Tribe, the National Park Service, and the Native \n                American Tribes who participated in the Battle of \n                Little Bighorn; and\n                    (B) encouraging private individuals and entities to \n                donate land and facilities to the Monument.\n\nSEC. 3.
