FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Over 220,000 Americans die each year from cardiac \n        arrest. Every 2 minutes, an individual goes into cardiac arrest \n        in the United States.\n            (2) The chance of successfully returning to a normal heart \n        rhythm diminishes by 10 percent each minute following sudden \n        cardiac arrest.\n            (3) Eighty percent of cardiac arrests are caused by \n        ventricular fibrillation, for which defibrillation is the only \n        effective treatment.\n            (4) Sixty percent of all cardiac arrests occur outside the \n        hospital. The average national survival rate for out-of-\n        hospital cardiac arrest is only 5 percent.\n            (5) Communities that have established and implemented \n        public access defibrillation programs have achieved average \n        survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as high as 50 \n        percent.\n            (6) According to the American Heart Association, wide use \n        of defibrillators could save as many as 50,000 lives nationally \n        each year.\n            (7) Successful public access defibrillation programs ensure \n        that cardiac arrest victims have access to early 911 \n        notification, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early \n        defibrillation, and early advanced care.\n\nSEC. 3. PUBLIC ACCESS DEFIBRILLATION PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 \net seq.), as amended by Public Law 106-310, is amended by adding after \nsection 311 the following:\n\n``SEC. 312.
