    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe heading of Chapter 4.6 (commencing with Section 1070) of Part 3 of Division 2 of the Labor Code is amended to read:\nCHAPTER  4.6. Public Transit Service Contracts and Contracts for the Collection and Transportation of Solid Waste\nSEC. 2.\nSection 1070 of the Labor Code is amended to read:\n1070.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) That when public agencies with jurisdiction over public transit services or the collection and transportation of solid waste award contracts to operate bus and rail services, or to provide for the collection and transportation of solid waste to a new contractor, qualified employees of the prior contractor who are not reemployed by the successor contractor face significant economic dislocation as a result.\n(b) That those displaced employees rely unnecessarily upon the unemployment insurance system, public social services, and health programs, increasing costs to these vital government programs and placing a significant burden upon both the government and the taxpayers.\n(c) That it serves an important social purpose to establish incentives for contractors who bid on public transit service contracts or contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste to retain qualified employees of the prior contractor to perform the same or similar work.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 1071 of the Labor Code is amended to read:\n1071.\nThe following definitions apply to this chapter:\n(a) \u201cAwarding authority\u201d means any local government agency, including any city, county, special district, transit district, joint powers authority, or nonprofit corporation that awards or otherwise enters into contracts for public transit services or for the collection and transportation of solid waste performed within the State of California.\n(b) \u201cBidder\u201d means any person who submits a bid to an awarding authority for a public transit service contract, an exclusive contract for the collection and transportation of solid waste, or a subcontract.\n(c) \u201cContractor\u201d means any person who enters into a public transit service contract or an exclusive contract for the collection and transportation of solid waste with an awarding authority.\n(d) \u201cEmployee\u201d means any individual who works for a contractor or subcontractor under a contract. \u201cEmployee\u201d does not include an executive, administrative, or professional employee exempt from the payment of overtime compensation within the meaning of subdivision (a) of Section 515 or any person who is not an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined under Section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 152(3)).\n(e) \u201cPerson\u201d means any individual, proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, trust, association, or other entity that may employ individuals or enter into contracts.\n(f) \u201cPublic transit services\u201d means the provision of passenger transportation services to the general public, including paratransit service.\n(g) \u201cService contract\u201d means any contract the principal purpose of which is to provide public transit services or the exclusive right to provide collection and transportation of solid waste through the use of employees.\n(h) \u201cSolid waste\u201d has the same meaning as defined in Section 40191 of the Public Resources Code.\n(i) \u201cSubcontractor\u201d means any person who is not an employee who enters into a contract with a contractor to perform a portion of the contractor\u2019s express obligations under a service contract. \u201cSubcontractor\u201d does not include a contractor\u2019s vendors, suppliers, insurers, or other service providers.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 1072 of the Labor Code is amended to read:\n1072.\n(a) A bidder shall declare as part of the bid for a service contract whether or not the bidder will retain the employees of the prior contractor or subcontractor for a period of not less than 90 days, as provided in this chapter, if awarded the service contract.\n(b) An awarding authority letting a service contract out to bid shall give a 10 percent preference to any bidder who agrees to retain the employees of the prior contractor or subcontractor pursuant to subdivision (a).\n(c) (1) If the awarding authority announces that it intends to let a service contract out to bid, the existing service contractor, within a reasonable time, shall provide to the awarding authority the number of employees who are performing services under the service contract and the wage rates, benefits, and job classifications of those employees. In addition, the existing service contractor shall make this information available to any entity that the awarding authority has identified as a bona fide bidder. This information shall be made available to each bona fide bidder in writing at least 30 days before bids for the service contract are due, whether by inclusion of the information in the request for bids or otherwise. If the successor service contract is awarded to a new contractor, the existing contractor shall provide the names, addresses, dates of hire, wages, benefit levels, and job classifications of employees to the successor contractor. The duties imposed by this subdivision shall be contained in all service contracts.\n(2) A successor contractor or subcontractor who agrees to retain employees pursuant to subdivision (a) shall retain employees who have been employed by the prior contractor or subcontractors, except for reasonable and substantiated cause. That cause is limited to the particular employee\u2019s performance or conduct while working under the prior contract or the employee\u2019s failure of any controlled substances and alcohol test, physical examination, criminal background check required by law as a condition of employment, or other standard hiring qualification lawfully required by the successor contractor or subcontractor.\n(3) The successor contractor or subcontractor shall make a written offer of employment to each employee to be retained pursuant to subdivision (a). That offer shall state the time within which the employee must accept that offer, but in no case less than 10 days. Nothing in this section requires the successor contractor or subcontractor to pay the same wages or offer the same benefits provided by the prior contractor or subcontractor.\n(4) If, at any time, the successor contractor or subcontractor determines that fewer employees are required than were required under the prior contract or subcontract, the successor contractor or subcontractor shall retain qualified employees by seniority within the job classification. In determining those employees who are qualified, the successor contractor or subcontractor may require an employee to possess any license that is required by law to operate the equipment that the employee will operate as an employee of the successor contractor or subcontractor.\nSEC. 5.\nSection 1075 is added to the Labor Code, to read:\n1075.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following shall apply to service contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste:\n(a) A successor contractor or subcontractor shall be required to retain only employees of a contractor or subcontractor under a prior service contract whose employment would be terminated if the service contract were awarded to another contractor or subcontractor.\n(b) A successor contractor or subcontractor shall not be required to retain an employee of a contractor or subcontractor under a prior service contract under any of the following circumstances:\n(1) If the employee of the prior contractor or subcontractor does not meet any standard hiring qualification lawfully required by the successor contractor or subcontractor for the position.\n(2) If the successor contractor or subcontractor would be required to terminate or reassign an existing employee covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the successor contractor or subcontractor in order to hire the employee of the prior contractor or subcontractor.\n(3) If, and to the extent, the actual number of employees meeting the requirements of this chapter exceeds the number of those employees communicated to bona fide bidders in accordance with paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 1072.\n(c) An employee or his or her agent shall not bring an action against a successor contractor or subcontractor under subdivision (a) of Section 1073 without first giving the successor contractor or subcontractor written notice of the violation or breach and 30 days to cure the violation or breach.

It is not intended to determine whether or not a local agency should procure a service contract by inviting bids, extend an existing service contract, renegotiate its service contract with the prior contractor, or exercise any other right it possesses pursuant to Section 40059 of the Public Resources Code to determine aspects of solid waste handling that are of local concern.\n(e) This chapter does not modify, limit, or abrogate in any manner any franchise, contract, license, or permit granted or extended by a city, county, or other local government agency before January 1, 2017.\nSEC. 6.\nSection 1076 is added to the Labor Code, to read:\n1076.\nThe amendments and additions to this chapter made by the act adding this section shall not apply to contracts awarded before January 1, 2017, or to contracts for which the bid process has been completed before January 1, 2017.\nSEC. 7.\nIf the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code."
