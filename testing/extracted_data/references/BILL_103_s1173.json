SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Japan Trade Equalizing \nAct of 1993''.\n\n                   TITLE I--FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS\n\nSEC. 101. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND DISCLAIMERS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States trade deficit with Japan has \n        increased substantially over the past decade. In 1991, the \n        United States trade deficit with Japan was $43,400,000,000. The \n        trade deficit increased by 14 percent in 1 year, to over \n        $49,400,000,000 by the end of 1992.\n            (2) The traditional domestic motor vehicle and motor \n        vehicle parts sector directly employs more than 1 million \n        workers and indirectly employs several million more. The \n        workers are skilled, hard working, productive, capable, and \n        proud of their work. The workers and their employers have \n        achieved great improvements in quality, performance, fuel \n        economy, safety, and design of domestic motor vehicles.\n            (3) The domestic motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts \n        sector directly and indirectly accounts for about 12 percent of \n        our gross national product and generates more than \n        $200,000,000,000 a year in revenue.\n            (4) The domestic motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts \n        sector is a major consumer of steel, glass, textiles, rubber, \n        aluminum, machine tools, chemicals, electronics, and other \n        important products.\n            (5) Recognizing the competitive pressures facing the motor \n        vehicle industry, Japan has operated under a voluntary export \n        restraint arrangement since 1981 that has not been recognized \n        or enforced by the United States Government.\n            (6) Since 1986 the United States Government has engaged, \n        with little result, in a negotiating process with the \n        Government of Japan to obtain fair access to the markets of \n        that nation for United States producers of motor vehicle parts \n        and manufacturers of motor vehicles.\n            (7) Despite these negotiating efforts, in 1992 the United \n        States posted a $49,400,000,000 trade deficit with Japan of \n        which over $30,000,000,000 was accounted for by the automotive \n        sector deficit ($9,800,000,000 of which was attributable to \n        motor vehicle parts), and there is little evidence that the \n        Japanese Government is seriously trying to eliminate such \n        deficits which are detrimental to the United States economy and \n        jobs.\n            (8) In addition to transplant assembly facilities in the \n        United States that are owned or controlled by Japanese persons, \n        motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts are being imported from \n        Japan into the United States in such increased quantities and \n        under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, \n        serious injury to domestic manufacturers of like or directly \n        competitive products and to the domestic workers producing such \n        products.\n            (9) In the last 5 years, transplant assembly facilities in \n        the United States that are owned or controlled by persons from \n        Japan have not shifted significantly their procurement to \n        traditional United States producers of motor vehicle parts, as \n        illustrated by the fact that--\n                    (A) the United States automotive parts trade \n                deficit with Japan grew between 1985 and 1990 at an \n                annual average rate of 17 percent and totaled \n                $9,800,000,000 in 1992; and\n                    (B) only 12.5 percent of the customs value of \n                vehicles manufactured in such transplant facilities in \n                the United States is based on parts produced by \n                traditional United States motor vehicle parts \n                producers, while 35.1 percent of such value is based on \n                imports from Japan and 32.4 percent of such value is \n                based on purchases from Japanese-affiliated parts \n                producers located in the United States.\n            (10) The pattern of procurement described in paragraph (9) \n        has contributed significantly to the overall United States \n        merchandise trade deficit with Japan.\n            (11) The continuation of current procurement practices by \n        automobile companies owned or controlled by persons from Japan \n        and the increased production of vehicles by transplant \n        facilities in the United States is projected to result in a 110 \n        percent (or $21,990,000,000) increase in the United States \n        motor vehicle parts trade deficit by 1994.\n            (12) Aftermarket parts are likely to account for 50 percent \n        of the motor vehicle parts trade deficit with Japan by 1994 \n        because transplant facilities are not purchasing sufficient \n        quantities of original equipment from United States suppliers.\n            (13) Traditional United States motor vehicle parts \n        manufacturers are particularly underrepresented in the \n        production of motor vehicles produced by transplant facilities \n        in the United States in the following 3 major, high value-added \n        vehicle systems:\n                    (A) Engines.\n                    (B) Transmissions.\n                    (C) Body structures.\n            (14) In the 1991 National Trade Estimates Report, the \n        United States Trade Representative listed ``close and durable \n        relationships'' between Japanese motor vehicle makers and \n        suppliers as a barrier to United States motor vehicle parts \n        sales in Japan.\n            (15) The market share of Japanese motor vehicle \n        manufacturers in the European Community is currently 10 percent \n        while their market share in the United States is about 35 \n        percent.\n            (16) The European Community has negotiated an understanding \n        with the Government of Japan limiting the market share of motor \n        vehicles produced by Japanese motor vehicle manufacturing \n        companies both in Japan and in the European Community to less \n        than 16 percent until the year 2000.\n            (17) The home market for motor vehicles and motor vehicle \n        parts in Japan remains largely closed to all foreign \n        manufacturers whose combined market share equals no more than 3 \n        percent.\n            (18) Japan's nontariff market barriers include onerous \n        inspection and certification systems that discriminate against \n        foreign-made motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts, a tax \n        system that discriminates against foreign-made products, closed \n        distribution systems and dealer networks, and government-\n        tolerated ``Keiretsu'' relationships involving motor vehicle \n        and motor vehicle parts manufacturers and dealers. At the same \n        time, Japanese firms enjoy open markets in the United States \n        with no limitations or discrimination.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to decrease the \nmerchandise trade deficit of the United States with Japan by providing \nfor a staged merchandise trade deficit reduction over a 5-year period.\n    (c) Congressional Disclaimers.--It is the intent of Congress that \nthis Act shall not be deemed to modify or amend the terms or conditions \nof any international treaty, convention, or agreement that may be \napplicable to motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and to which the \nUnited States, on the date of the enactment of this Act, is a party, \nincluding, but not limited to, the terms or conditions of any such \ntreaty, convention, or agreement which provide for the resolution of \nconflicts between the parties thereto. Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued (1) to confer jurisdiction upon any court of the United \nStates to consider and resolve such conflicts, or (2) to alter or amend \nany law existing on the date of the enactment of this Act which may \nconfer such jurisdiction in such courts.\n\nSEC. 102.

STAGED TRADE DEFICIT REDUCTION.\n\n    (a) Trade Deficit Reduction Targets.--\n            (1) In general.--The trade deficit reduction target for \n        each of the calendar years listed below is an average monthly \n        merchandise trade deficit of the United States with Japan \n        during such year that does not exceed an amount that equals the \n        applicable percentage of the baseline deficit that appears \n        opposite such year:\n\nCalendar year                       Applicable percentage of baseline \n                                            deficit\n    1994..........................................           80 percent\n    1995..........................................           60 percent\n    1996..........................................           40 percent\n    1997..........................................           20 percent\n    1998..........................................            0 percent\n            (2) Special rule for 1998.--For calendar year 1998, the 0 \n        percent trade deficit reduction target shall be treated as \n        having been met if the merchandise trade deficit of the United \n        States with Japan during such year does not exceed--\n                    (A) an amount equal to 5 percent of the value of \n                the aggregate bilateral merchandise trade between the \n                United States and Japan during such year; or\n                    (B) $5,000,000,000.\n    (b) Computations.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than January 1 following each \n        calendar year listed in subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall \n        compute whether the trade deficit reduction target for such \n        year was met.\n            (2) Announcement of import restriction implementation \n        period.--If the Secretary finds under paragraph (1) that the \n        trade deficit reduction target specified under subsection (a) \n        for a calendar year was not met, the Secretary shall announce, \n        by publication in the Federal Register, that the import \n        restriction implementation period is in effect beginning on \n        January 1 of the year after the year to which the finding \n        applies.\n\nSEC. 202. COMPUTATION OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS IF TRADE DEFICIT REDUCTION \n              TARGET NOT MET.\n\n    (a) In General.--On January 1 of the first calendar year (and each \ncalendar year thereafter) for which an import restriction \nimplementation period is in effect, the Secretary shall compute and \npublish in the Federal Register the quantitative import restrictions \nfor such calendar year.\n    (b) Computation.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a), the term \n        ``quantitative import restrictions'' means the aggregate \n        quantity of Japanese motor vehicles and the aggregate quantity \n        of Japanese motor vehicle parts that may be entered into the \n        United States (in accordance with paragraph (2) or (3)) for a \n        calendar year described in subsection (a).\n            (2) First year restrictions.--The aggregate quantity of \n        Japanese motor vehicles and Japanese motor vehicle parts that \n        may be entered into the United States, during the first \n        calendar year for which an import restriction implementation \n        period is in effect, may not exceed the aggregate quantity of \n        such motor vehicles and the aggregate quantity of such motor \n        vehicle parts entered into the United States during 1993, \n        reduced by 20 percent.\n            (3) Subsequent years.--In the case of any calendar year for \n        which an import restriction period is in effect after the first \n        such calendar year, the aggregate quantity of Japanese motor \n        vehicles and Japanese motor vehicle parts that may be entered \n        into the United States shall not exceed the amount of such \n        motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts entered during the most \n        recent preceding calendar year for which an import restriction \n        implementation period was in effect, reduced by 20 percent.\n            (4) Administration.--In order to prevent import surging or \n        to otherwise ensure the efficient administration of this Act, \n        the Secretary may impose temporary quantitative import \n        restrictions on Japanese motor vehicles and Japanese motor \n        vehicle parts entered during the first 3 months of a calendar \n        year in an import restriction implementation period.\n\nSEC. 203. REPORTS.\n\n    Within 30 days after a computation is made under section 201 or 202 \nwith respect to a calendar year, the Secretary shall submit to the \nCongress a report setting forth the bases of the computation.\n\nSEC. 204. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ACHIEVEMENT OF MERCHANDISE TRADE \n              DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGETS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that representatives of the United \nStates and Japanese Governments should undertake continuing discussions \nregarding the means and measures, to be selected by the Japanese \nGovernment, to achieve the merchandise trade deficit reduction targets \nrequired under section 201(a). During the discussions, the Trade \nRepresentative should particularly address market access priorities for \nUnited States exports to Japan."
