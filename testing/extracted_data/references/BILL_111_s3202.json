FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The 7.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti on \n        January 12, 2010--\n                    (A) was Haiti's worst natural catastrophe in 200 \n                years;\n                    (B) caused the deaths of more than 200,000 people;\n                    (C) destroyed 105,000 homes, 50 hospitals and \n                health centers, and 1,300 school and university \n                buildings; and\n                    (D) significantly damaged the Presidential Palace, \n                the National Assembly building, and most of the other \n                government buildings in the capital city of Port-au-\n                Prince.\n            (2) Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest \n        country in the Western Hemisphere, with--\n                    (A) 80 percent of the population living below the \n                poverty line;\n                    (B) 54 percent of the population in abject poverty; \n                and\n                    (C) more than \\2/3\\ of the labor force believed to \n                lack formal employment.\n            (3) Although Haiti's per capita gross domestic product is \n        among the world's lowest, positive economic growth trends were \n        slowly emerging before the earthquake and Haiti was 1 of 2 \n        Caribbean countries expected to experience positive economic \n        growth in 2009.\n            (4) At a March 2010 meeting convened in Haiti by the Inter-\n        American Development Bank and the United Nations, which brought \n        together Haitian government and private sector leaders to \n        discuss the country's most critical needs, meeting participants \n        agreed that 2 critical catalysts for creating potentially \n        hundreds of thousands of jobs are--\n                    (A) modernizing Haitian policies and \n                infrastructure; and\n                    (B) improving the flow of foreign private \n                investment into Haiti.\n            (5) In section 201(b)(1) of the Support for East European \n        Democracy Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-279; 22 U.S.C. 5421), \n        Congress authorized USAID to provide a grant of $240,000,000 to \n        the Polish-American Enterprise Fund (referred to in this \n        section as the ``Polish Fund''), which was organized and \n        incorporated on April 27, 1990.\n            (6) The Polish Fund--\n                    (A) used the USAID grant to raise $2,300,000,000 in \n                private funds for investment in Poland; and\n                    (B) used the reflows from the USAID grant to \n                establish the Polish-American Freedom Foundation, whose \n                endowment exceeds $250,000,000.\n            (7) The success of the Polish Fund in attracting private \n        investment to Poland and in creating a legacy foundation from \n        its reflows represents a useful model for other Enterprise \n        Funds.\n            (8) Enterprise Funds have enjoyed success in poorer and \n        less developed countries, such as Albania, where the Albanian-\n        American Enterprise Fund played a pivotal role in helping to \n        develop the banking sector, privatizing and modernizing the \n        airport, and expanding access to international trade and \n        investment.\n            (9) Enterprise Funds in Albania, the Baltic States, \n        Hungary, Poland, Russia, and other countries have created and \n        supported programs that have contributed to the growth of an \n        entrepreneurial middle class.\n            (10) A professional and well-managed Haitian-American \n        Enterprise Fund, drawing upon the experience of members of the \n        Boards of Directors of prior Enterprise Funds, could achieve \n        similar success.\n            (11) The programs run by the Enterprise Funds in other \n        countries, which could also be run in Haiti, include \n        microloans, carefully designed and monitored mortgage programs, \n        and small business loans that would create the infrastructure \n        and investment climate needed to begin to build an \n        entrepreneurial middle class in Haiti.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote the Haitian private sector, including small \n        businesses, the agricultural sector, and joint ventures with \n        United States and Haitian participants; and\n            (2) to promote policies and practices conducive to the \n        private sector in Haiti through loans, grants, equity \n        investments, feasibility studies, technical assistance, \n        training, insurance, guarantees, and other measures.\n\nSEC. 4.
