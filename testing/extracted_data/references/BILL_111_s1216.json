FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced \n        by burning fuel. Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon \n        monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a serious \n        health condition that could result in death.\n            (2) Each year, carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of \n        fuel-burning appliances, such as furnaces, water heaters, \n        portable generators, and stoves, in residential homes and other \n        dwelling units kills at least 500 people and sends more than \n        20,000 people to hospital emergency rooms for treatment.\n            (3) Research shows that purchasing and installing carbon \n        monoxide alarms close to the sleeping areas in residential \n        homes and other dwelling units can help avoid fatalities.\n            (4) Congress should promote the purchase and installation \n        of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes and dwelling \n        units throughout the United States in order to promote the \n        health and public safety of all people of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
