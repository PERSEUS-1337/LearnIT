FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States has the objective of stabilizing \n        greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that \n        would prevent ``dangerous anthropogenic interference'' with the \n        climate system by becoming a party to the 1992 United Nations \n        Framework Convention on Climate Change, pledging to China to \n        reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 28 percent of their 2005 \n        levels by 2025, and regulating greenhouse gas emissions from \n        stationary sources, mobile sources, and electrical power \n        suppliers.\n            (2) To achieve this objective, the increase in global mean \n        surface temperature should not exceed 2\u000fC (3.6\u000fF) above \n        preindustrial temperature, much of which is already projected \n        to occur by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n            (3) The risks associated with a temperature increase above \n        2\u000fC (3.6\u000fF) are grave, including the disintegration of the \n        Greenland ice sheet, which, if it were to melt completely, \n        would raise global average sea level by approximately 23 feet, \n        devastating many of the world's coastal areas and population \n        centers.\n            (4) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects \n        that temperatures will rise between 1.8\u000fC to 4.0\u000fC (3.2\u000fF to \n        7.2\u000fF) by the end of the century, under a range of expected \n        emissions trends, but if there are common goals to limit \n        greenhouse gas emissions, the temperature increase can be \n        limited to 2\u000fC (3.6\u000fF) or less.\n            (5) Serious global warming impacts have already been \n        observed in the United States and worldwide, including--\n                    (A) increases in heat waves and other extreme \n                weather events;\n                    (B) rise in sea level, retreat of glaciers and \n                polar ice;\n                    (C) decline in mountain snowpack, increased drought \n                (including droughts in the West and South United \n                States) resulting in damage to our economy and \n                property;\n                    (D) extreme weather conditions resulting in \n                wildfires, stronger hurricanes and polar vortex \n                occurrences resulting in further damage to property and \n                our economy;\n                    (E) damage to our environment such as ocean \n                acidification, extensive coral bleaching, migrations, \n                and shifts in the yearly cycles of plants and animals; \n                and\n                    (F) effects on human population including \n                population displacement and adverse health effects such \n                as the spread of infectious diseases and climate-\n                related conditions such as asthma.\n            (6) Scientists project that under a midrange estimate of \n        global warming, by 2050, roughly 25 percent of animal and plant \n        species will be committed to extinction.\n            (7) Decisive action is needed to minimize the many dangers \n        posed by global warming.\n            (8) The timing of such action is critical, given that \n        greenhouse gases can persist in the atmosphere for more than a \n        century.\n            (9) The International Energy Agency has warned in its most \n        recent World Energy Outlook report that, unless there is a \n        serious commitment to investing in zero carbon renewable energy \n        resources, much of the amount of projected limits necessary to \n        avoid greenhouse-gas-emission-caused dangerous anthropogenic \n        interference with the climate system will be locked in and \n        exceeded.\n            (10) PricewaterhouseCoopers Low Carbon Economy Index Report \n        estimates that carbon-based fuel use needs to be reduced 6.5 \n        percent per year through the year 2100, nearly six times the \n        current rate, to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference \n        with the climate system.\n            (11) With only 5 percent of the world population, the \n        United States emits approximately 20 percent of the world's \n        total greenhouse gas emissions and must be a leader in \n        addressing global warming.\n            (12) The State of California, the 8th largest economy in \n        the world, has shown that renewable energy standards and \n        greenhouse gas emissions regulation can reduce greenhouse gas \n        emissions while fostering significant economic growth.\n            (13) Existing energy efficiency and clean, renewable energy \n        technologies can reduce global warming pollution, while saving \n        consumers money, reducing our dependence on oil, enhancing \n        national security, cleaning the air, and protecting pristine \n        places from drilling and mining.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nUnited States should participate in negotiations under the 1992 United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change and honor its \ncommitments therefrom with the objective of securing United States \nparticipation in agreements that--\n            (1) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n        are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n        principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n            (2) achieve reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions \n        at a pace and level sufficient to avoid dangerous interference \n        with the Earth's climate; and\n            (3) advance and protect the economic and national security \n        interests of the United States.\n\n                       TITLE I--RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nSEC. 101. NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARD.\n\n    Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (16 \nU.S.C. 824a-4 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 610. NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARD.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall promulgate regulations \nrequiring that--\n            ``(1) beginning in calendar year 2020, the percentage of \n        electric energy generated from renewable sources that is sold \n        at the retail level in the United States shall increase each \n        year;\n            ``(2) in calendar year 2030 and each subsequent calendar \n        year, such percentage shall be not less than 40 percent of the \n        total electric energy sold at the retail level in the United \n        States; and\n            ``(3) in calendar year 2050 and each subsequent calendar \n        year, such percentage shall not be less than 80 percent of the \n        total electric energy sold at the retail level in the United \n        States.\n    ``(b) Consultation.--The Secretary shall carry out this section in \nconsultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency.\n    ``(c) Subsequent Increases.--Upon petition or upon the Secretary's \nown initiative, the Secretary may increase the percentage required by \nsubsection (a)(2).\n    ``(d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to preempt or limit State actions to enhance renewable energy \ngeneration or energy efficiency.''.\n\n                      TITLE II--ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\nSEC. 201.
