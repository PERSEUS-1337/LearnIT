PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to require the General Services Administration to audit \n        the energy performance of buildings owned by the General \n        Services Administration and identify--\n                    (A) steps that can be taken to improve energy \n                efficiency and reduce costs; and\n                    (B) cost-savings that can be achieved by \n                implementing energy efficiency measures;\n            (2) to establish minimum efficiency standards for buildings \n        leased by the Federal government;\n            (3) to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution; and\n            (4) to require regular reporting to Congress and the public \n        on the energy use of Federal buildings and the cost-savings and \n        pollution reduction associated with efficiency measures.\n\nSEC. 3. ENERGY AUDITS OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, each energy manager (as defined in section 543(f)(1) of \nthe National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(1))) of \na building owned by the General Services Administration shall carry out \nan audit of that building that--\n            (1) identifies any modifications necessary to improve \n        energy efficiency that, within 10 years of implementation, will \n        result in energy cost savings equal to the total investment \n        made; and\n            (2) quantifies the estimated cost-savings associated with \n        any energy efficiency improvements identified by the energy \n        manager.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Administrator of General Services shall report to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of \nRepresentatives on--\n            (1) all efficiency improvements identified in the audits \n        carried out under subsection (a);\n            (2) the total estimated cost-savings associated with the \n        efficiency improvements described in paragraph (1); and\n            (3) the status of implementation of the efficiency \n        improvements described in paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 4.
