In developing the best practices, the Attorney General shall \ntake into account that sexual assault perpetrators are often habitual \noffenders, may commit many acts of sexual violence against both \nstrangers and victims known to them, and may commit other violent \ncrimes and crimes against property.\n    (b) Content.--The best practices developed under subsection (a) \nshall--\n            (1) establish the appropriate prioritization of testing of \n        samples of sexual assault evidence, including samples related \n        to--\n                    (A) cases in which a suspect has been identified \n                and cases in which a suspect has not been identified; \n                and\n                    (B) cases in which the assault was committed by a \n                stranger and cases in which the assault was committed \n                by someone known to the victim;\n            (2) describe the protocols for appropriately handling and \n        storing samples of sexual assault evidence;\n            (3) describe the evidentiary value of and make \n        recommendations pertaining to testing all samples of sexual \n        assault evidence, including samples related to--\n                    (A) cases in which a suspect has been identified \n                and cases in which a suspect has not been identified;\n                    (B) cases in which the assault was committed by a \n                stranger and cases in which the assault was committed \n                by someone known to the victim;\n                    (C) cases in which prosecution of a perpetrator is \n                barred by an applicable statute of limitations; and\n                    (D) cases in which forensic evidence has been \n                collected from a victim who, pursuant to section \n                2010(d)(1) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n                Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg-4(d)(1)), chooses \n                not to participate in the criminal justice system or \n                cooperate with law enforcement; and\n            (4) make recommendations with respect to notifying a victim \n        that the sample of sexual assault evidence of the victim has \n        been tested, including victims in cases--\n                    (A) that are actively being investigated (including \n                cases being actively investigated after a period of \n                dormancy); and\n                    (B) in which prosecution of a perpetrator is barred \n                by an applicable statute of limitations.\n    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that law \nenforcement agencies and other appropriate entities should use the best \npractices developed and disseminated under subsection (a) to develop, \nevaluate, and improve DNA evidence protocols.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n    Not later than 90 days after the end of each fiscal year for which \na grant is made for the purpose described in section 2(a)(6) of the DNA \nAnalysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, as added by section 2(1) of \nthis Act, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report that--\n            (1) lists the States and units of local government that \n        have been awarded such grants and the amount of the grant \n        received by each such State or unit of local government;\n            (2) states the number of extensions granted by the Attorney \n        General under section 2(n)(3) of such Act, as added by section \n        2(6) of this Act; and\n            (3) summarizes the processing status of the samples of \n        sexual assault evidence on which information has been entered \n        into the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry established \n        under section 3, including the number of samples that have not \n        been tested."
