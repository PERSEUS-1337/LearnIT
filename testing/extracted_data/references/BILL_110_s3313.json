FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Despite the fact that polygamy has been illegal in the \n        United States for over 100 years, the practice of polygamy \n        involving underage marriages is growing. Sizable polygamist \n        communities exist in Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, and are \n        expanding into other States.\n            (2) Polygamist communities are typically controlled by \n        organizations that engage in widespread and systematic \n        violations of State laws and the laws of the United States in \n        order to enrich their leaders and maintain control over their \n        members.\n            (3) The crimes perpetrated by these organizations include \n        child abuse, domestic violence, welfare fraud, tax evasion, \n        public corruption, witness tampering, and transporting victims \n        across State lines.\n            (4) Due to the systematic and sophisticated nature of these \n        crimes, State and local law enforcement agencies would benefit \n        from the assistance of the Federal Government as they \n        investigate and prosecute these organizations and their leaders \n        for violations of State law. In addition, violations of Federal \n        law associated with polygamy should be investigated and \n        prosecuted directly by Federal authorities.\n            (5) The work of State and Federal law enforcement agencies \n        to combat crimes by polygamist organizations would benefit from \n        enhanced collaboration and information-sharing among such \n        agencies.\n            (6) The establishment of a task force within the Department \n        of Justice to coordinate Federal efforts and collaborate with \n        State agencies would aid in the investigation and prosecution \n        of criminal activities of polygamist organizations in both \n        Federal and State courts.\n            (7) Polygamist organizations isolate, control, manipulate, \n        and threaten victims with retribution should they ever abandon \n        the organization. Individuals who choose to testify against \n        polygamist organizations in Federal or State court have unique \n        needs, including social services and witness protection \n        support, that warrant Federal assistance.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF A FEDERAL POLYGAMY TASK FORCE.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established within the Department of \nJustice a Federal Polygamy Task Force, which shall consist of the \nDeputy Attorney General, the United States attorneys from affected \nFederal judicial districts, representatives of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, \nand the Department of Health and Human Services, and any officer of the \nFederal Government whom the Deputy Attorney General considers necessary \nto strengthen Federal law enforcement activities and provide State and \nlocal law enforcement officials the assistance they need to address the \nillegal activity of one or more polygamist organizations.\n    (b) Purposes.--The Federal Polygamy Task Force established under \nsubsection (a) shall--\n            (1) formulate effective responses to the unique set of \n        crimes committed by polygamist organizations;\n            (2) establish partnerships with State and local law \n        enforcement agencies to share relevant information and \n        strengthen State and Federal efforts to combat crimes \n        perpetrated by polygamist organizations;\n            (3) assist States by providing strategies and support for \n        the protection of witnesses;\n            (4) track the criminal behavior of polygamist organizations \n        that cross State and international borders; and\n            (5) ensure that local officials charged with protecting the \n        public are not corrupted because of financial, family, or \n        membership ties to a polygamist organization.\n\nSEC. 4.
