FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) Under Federal law there is no consistent definition \n        of rural schools.\n            ``(2) Rural school districts do not benefit as much as the \n        school districts could from Federal education funding because \n        the unique needs of rural school districts do not necessarily \n        fit the categorical Federal formula programs.\n            ``(3) Rural schools often cannot compete for Federal \n        funding distributed by competitive grants because the schools \n        lack the personnel needed to prepare grant applications and the \n        resources to hire specialists in the writing of Federal grant \n        proposals.\n            ``(4) Small school districts with fewer than 600 students \n        often cannot use Federal grant funds distributed by formula \n        because the formula allocation does not provide enough revenue \n        to carry out the program the grant is intended to fund.\n\n``SEC. 10973.
