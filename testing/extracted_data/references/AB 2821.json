    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Homeless beneficiaries incur disproportionate Medi-Cal costs, particularly people experiencing chronic homelessness and people who cycle between homelessness, emergency departments, inpatient care, and nursing home stays. Supportive housing, which is affordable housing with intensive services, allows people experiencing significant barriers to housing stability to improve their health and decrease their Medicaid costs. National studies comparing formerly homeless Medicaid beneficiaries living in supportive housing with homeless beneficiaries receiving usual care demonstrate Medicaid cost savings of almost $9,000 per year after the costs of services.\n(b) In most communities in California, a lack of housing affordable to people experiencing homelessness is one of the greatest barriers to exiting homelessness. Housing resources would equip Whole Person Care counties choosing to target homeless people with the resources to achieve the goals of the Whole Person Care Waiver provisions, during the course of the pilot and after the pilot ends. \u201cWhole Person Care pilot\u201d has the meaning as described in the Medi-Cal 2020 Waiver Special Terms and Conditions (STCs), Sections 110-126, as approved by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on December 30, 2015, or in any sub means the Department of Housing and Community Development.\n(e) \u201cHomeless\u201d has the same meaning as in Section 578.3 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as that section read on January 1, 2017.\n(f) \u201cInterim housing\u201d means a safe place for a participant to live temporarily while the participant is waiting to move into a permanent apartment affordable to the participant with rental assistance, and where the participant is not required to pay more than 30 percent of his or her income toward the cost of the interim housing. \u201cInterim housing\u201d may include recuperative or respite care and shall not be funded for longer than a period of nine months.\n(g) \u201cLong-term rental assistance\u201d means a rental subsidy provided to a housing provider, including a landlord renting in the private market or a developer leasing affordable housing, to assist a tenant to pay the difference between 30 percent of the tenant\u2019s income and fair market rent or reasonable market rent as determined by HCD.\n(h) \u201cPermanent housing\u201d means a housing unit where the landlord does not limit length of stay in the housing unit, the landlord does not restrict the movements of the tenant, and the tenant has a lease and is subject to the rights and responsibilities of tenancy, pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 1940) of Title 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code.\n(i) \u201cProgram\u201d means the Housing for a Healthy California Program created by this part.\n(j) \u201cSupportive housing\u201d has the same meaning as in Section 50675.14.\n53591.\nHCD shall do all of the following:\n(a) On or before October 1, 2017, establish the Housing for a Healthy California Program.\n(b) On or before October 1, 2017, draft guidelines for stakeholder comment to fund competitive grants to pay for interim and long-term rental assistance under the program.

If appropriations are made available in future years, applicants shall compete for each round of five-year grants.\n(d) Midyear and annually, collect data from the program grantees.\n(e) No later than April 1, 2018, contract with an independent evaluator or work with an evaluator who is contracted with DHCS to analyze data collected pursuant to Section 53573 to determine changes in health care costs associated with services provided under the program. HCD shall provide, on a regular basis as needed, collected data to the evaluator.\n(f) (1) On or before October 1, 2019, for grants awarded in 2018, and in subsequent years thereafter in which the program is allocated additional funds, report data collected to the Assembly Committee on Budget, the Senate Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review, the Assembly and Senate committees on health, the Assembly Committee on Housing and Community Development, and the Senate Committee on Transportation and Housing.\n(2) A report to be submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\n(g) HCD is encouraged to consult with DHCS where appropriate to carry out the intent of this section.\n53592.\nAn applicant shall be eligible for a program grant if the applicant meets the requirements of this section.
