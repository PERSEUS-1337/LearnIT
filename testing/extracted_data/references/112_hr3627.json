FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to research funded by the Food Allergy \n        Initiative and conducted by Northwestern University and \n        Children's Memorial Hospital, nearly 6,000,000 children in the \n        United States have food allergies.\n            (2) Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, is a systemic \n        allergic reaction that can kill within minutes.\n            (3) More than 15 percent of school-aged children with food \n        allergies have had an allergic reaction in school.\n            (4) Teenagers and young adults with food allergies are at \n        the highest risk of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis.\n            (5) Individuals with food allergies who also have asthma \n        may be at increased risk for severe or fatal food allergy \n        reactions.\n            (6) Studies have shown that 25 percent of epinephrine \n        administrations in schools involve individuals with a \n        previously unknown allergy.\n            (7) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \n        Diseases (``NIAID'') has reported that delays in the \n        administration of epinephrine to patients in anaphylaxis can \n        result in rapid decline and death. NIAID recommends that \n        epinephrine be given promptly to treat anaphylaxis.\n            (8) Physicians can provide standing orders to furnish a \n        school with epinephrine for injection, and several States have \n        passed laws to authorize this practice.\n            (9) The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology \n        recommends that epinephrine injectors should be included in all \n        emergency medical treatment kits in schools.\n            (10) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that an \n        anaphylaxis kit should be kept with medications in each school \n        and made available to trained staff for administration in an \n        emergency.\n            (11) According to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, \n        there are no contraindications to the use of epinephrine for a \n        life-threatening reaction.\n\nSEC. 3. PREFERENCE FOR STATES REGARDING ADMINISTRATION OF EPINEPHRINE \n              BY SCHOOL PERSONNEL.\n\n    Section 399L of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280g(d)) \nis amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by redesignating the second \n        paragraph (2) and paragraph (3) as paragraphs (3) and (4), \n        respectively;
