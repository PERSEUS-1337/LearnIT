DESIGNATION OF PAKISTANI TALIBAN AS FOREIGN TERRORIST \n              ORGANIZATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Pakistani Taliban is a murderous organization that \n        has taken credit for terrorist acts committed on United States \n        soil. Since 2001, the Pakistani Taliban has committed \n        atrocities aimed at nongovernmental organization workers, \n        government officials, law enforcement officials, and other \n        innocent civilians.\n            (2) The Government of Pakistan implicated the Pakistani \n        Taliban network in the December 2007 assassination of Benazir \n        Bhutto, and, in January 2008, the Central Intelligence Agency \n        also confirmed its belief in the involvement of the Pakistani \n        Taliban in the assassination.\n            (3) In a video recorded in April 2010, a representative of \n        the Pakistani Taliban indicated that the organization would \n        make cities in the United States a ``main target''.\n            (4) The Pakistani Taliban has made efforts to combine \n        forces with al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, threatening to \n        extend their reach and murderous acts. Despite unified efforts \n        to degrade their capabilities, the Pakistani Taliban have \n        managed to expand their deadly influence through alliances with \n        a number of other militant groups, terrorist organizations, and \n        independent terrorist cells under their control.\n            (5) On May 4, 2010, Faisal Shahzad was charged in the \n        failed Times Square bombing on May 1, 2010, and was indicted on \n        10 terrorism and weapons charges including attempted use of a \n        weapon of mass destruction. According to the indictment, the \n        Pakistani Taliban provided Shahzad with training and money for \n        his planned attack.\n            (6) The Pakistani Taliban is eligible for designation as a \n        foreign terrorist organization pursuant to section 219(a) of \n        the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)) given \n        its engagement in terrorist activities and the threat it poses \n        to the national security of the United States.\n            (7) Designation of the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign \n        terrorist organization would have several consequences, which \n        would be in the national security interest of the United \n        States. The consequences are as follows:\n                    (A) It would be unlawful for a person in the United \n                States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n                States to knowingly provide material support or \n                resources to the Pakistani Taliban, including any \n                property, tangible or intangible, or service, including \n                currency or monetary instruments or financial \n                securities, financial services, lodging, training, \n                expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false \n                documentation or identification, communications \n                equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, \n                explosives, or personnel.\n                    (B) Representatives and members of the Pakistani \n                Taliban who are aliens would be inadmissible to and, in \n                certain circumstances, removable from the United \n                States.\n                    (C) Any United States financial institution that \n                becomes aware that it has possession of or control over \n                funds in which the Pakistani Taliban or its agent has \n                an interest would be required to retain possession of \n                or control over the funds and report the funds to the \n                Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of \n                the Treasury.\n            (8) Designation of the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign \n        terrorist organization would--\n                    (A) support efforts of the United States Government \n                to curb terrorism financing and encourage other nations \n                to do the same;\n                    (B) stigmatize and isolate the Pakistani Taliban \n                internationally;\n                    (C) deter donations or contributions to and \n                economic transactions with the Pakistani Taliban; and\n                    (D) heighten public awareness and knowledge of the \n                Pakistani Taliban.\n    (b) Designation.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n        designate the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign terrorist \n        organization under section 219(a) of the Immigration and \n        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)).\n            (2) Administrative record not required.--The requirements \n        of paragraph (3) of section 219(a) of the Immigration and \n        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)(3)) shall not apply to the \n        designation under this subsection."
