FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Although in past years the yellowfin tuna fishery of \n        the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean has resulted in excessive \n        incidental mortality to dolphins, efforts by tuna fishermen \n        operating under United States and international conservation \n        programs have reduced this incidental mortality to levels that \n        are approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate in \n        accordance with section 101(a)(2).\n            ``(2) Support of the International Dolphin Conservation \n        Program is necessary to assure that these low levels of dolphin \n        mortality are maintained and eventually eliminated, if \n        possible.\n            ``(3) United States tuna fishing vessels have led the world \n        in the development of fishing methods to reduce dolphin \n        mortalities in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and should be \n        allowed to fish in that region on an equal basis with foreign \n        fleets.\n    ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to--\n            ``(1) continue the progress made in reducing the incidental \n        mortality of dolphins in the yellowfin tuna fishery in the \n        eastern tropical Pacific Ocean;\n            ``(2) support the International Dolphin Conservation \n        Program; and\n            ``(3) authorize the participation of United States tuna \n        fishing vessels in the yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern \n        tropical Pacific Ocean in a manner consistent with the \n        International Dolphin Conservation Program and the requirements \n        of this Act.\n\n``SEC. 302. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY.\n\n    ``(a) Regulations.--The Secretary may issue regulations to govern \nthe incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial \npurse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific \nOcean. Any such regulations shall be consistent with the requirements \nof the International Dolphin Conservation Program and with the goal of \nreducing the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals \noccurring in the yellowfin tuna fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific \nOcean to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious \ninjury rate.\n    ``(b) Consultations.--In developing any regulation under this \nsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of State and \nthe United States Commissioners to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna \nCommission appointed under section 3 of the Tuna Conventions Act of \n1950 (16 U.S.C. 952).\n\n``SEC. 303.
