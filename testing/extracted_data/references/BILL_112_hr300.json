FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress find as follows:\n            (1) Eighty percent of parents believe schools are teaching \n        money management and budgeting, while over 70 percent of \n        teachers are not teaching financial literacy.\n            (2) Most adults feel that their financial literacy skills \n        are inadequate, yet they do not rely on anyone else to handle \n        their finances; they feel it is important to know more but have \n        received no financial education.\n            (3) It is necessary to respond immediately to the pressing \n        needs of individuals faced with the loss of their financial \n        stability, however increased attention must also be paid to \n        financial literacy education reform and long-term solutions to \n        prevent future personal financial disasters.\n            (4) There is an urgent need to respond to the economic \n        crisis with research-based financial literacy education \n        programs to reach individuals at all ages and socioeconomic \n        levels, particularly those facing unique and challenging \n        financial situations, such as high school graduates entering \n        the workforce, soon-to-be and recent college graduates, young \n        families, and the unique needs of military personnel and their \n        families.\n            (5) More than 70 percent of parents say they have spoken \n        with their teens about credit and using credit cards wisely, \n        while less than 44 percent of the teenaged children of those \n        respondents say their parents have talked to them about credit \n        cards.\n            (6) Seventy-six percent of parents surveyed said their high \n        school student does not have a budget.\n            (7) The average credit card debt among graduate students \n        who carry cards is $7,831 per student, an increase of 59 \n        percent over 1998's average debt of $4,925.\n            (8) Young adults between 20 and 24 represent the fastest \n        growing segment of bankruptcy filings; in fact, more people \n        filed for bankruptcy in 2004 than graduated from college.\n            (9) Credit card debt among young adults between the ages of \n        25 and 34 has increased 55 percent, while credit card debt \n        among the youngest adults, between 18 and 24, has skyrocketed \n        104 percent since 1982.\n            (10) In April of 2009, the Comptroller General testified to \n        the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the \n        Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, of the \n        Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the \n        Senate that ``In 2006, we reported that the [Financial Literacy \n        and Education] Commission's National Strategy for Financial \n        Literacy was a useful first step in focusing attention on \n        financial literacy but largely was descriptive rather than \n        strategic. . . . However, to date the Commission has not \n        incorporated the other elements we recommended. . . . For the \n        most part, these revisions have consisted of newly developed \n        `calls to action' and have not represented a fundamental shift \n        in approach that incorporates specific recommendations on \n        roles, funding, and activities.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
