  (B) An individual shall not be denied regular \n                compensation under the State law's provisions relating \n                to availability for work, active search for work, or \n

       whichever is greater.\n    (c) Nonreduction Rule.--Under the agreement, subsection (b)(2)(C) \nshall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon \na determination by the

regular compensation which \n        will be payable during the period of the agreement (determined \n        disregarding the modifications described in subsection (b)(2)) \n        will be less

\n(b)(1)(B)(i), an individual shall be considered to have exhausted such \nindividual's rights to regular compensation under a State law when--\n            (1) no payments of regular compensation can be made under \n        such law because such individual has received all regular \n        compensation available to such individual based on employment \n        or wages during such individual's base period, or\n            (2) such individual's rights to such compensation have been \n        terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with \n        respect to which such

carry \n        out this Act, and\n            (3) the maximum amount of temporary supplemental \n        unemployment compensation payable to any individual for whom a \n        temporary
