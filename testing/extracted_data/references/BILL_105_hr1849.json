SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Oklahoma City National Memorial Act \nof 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2 FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) few events in the past quarter-century have rocked \n        Americans' perception of themselves and their institutions, and \n        brought together the people of our Nation with greater \n        intensity than the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. \n        Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City;\n            (2) the resulting deaths of 168 people, some of whom were \n        children, immediately touched thousands of family members whose \n        lives will forever bear scars of having those precious to them \n        taken away so brutally;\n            (3) suffering with such families are countless survivors, \n        including children, who struggle not only with the suffering \n        around them, but their own physical and emotional injuries and \n        with shaping a life beyond April 19;\n            (4) such losses and struggles are personal and, since they \n        resulted from so public an attack, they are also shared with a \n        community, a nation, and the world; and,\n            (5) the story of the bombing does not stop with the attack \n        itself or with the many losses it caused. The responses of \n        Oklahoma's public servants and private citizens, and those from \n        throughout the nation, remain as a testament to the sense of \n        unity, compassion, even heroism, that characterized the rescue \n        and recovery following the bombing.\n            (6) During the days immediately following the Oklahoma City \n        bombing, Americans and people from around the world of all \n        races, political philosophies, religions and walks of life \n        responded with unprecedented solidarity and selflessness; and\n            (7) Given the national and international impact and \n        reaction, the federal character of the site of the bombing, and \n        the significant percentage of the victims and survivors who \n        were federal employees the Oklahoma City Memorial will be \n        established, designed, managed and maintained to educate \n        present and future generations, through a public/private \n        partnership, to work together efficiently and respectfully in \n        developing a National Memorial relating to all aspects of the \n        April 19, 1995, bombing in Oklahoma City.\n\nSEC. 3.
