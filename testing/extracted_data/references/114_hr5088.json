FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Recent studies by the Government Accountability Office \n        (GAO) examining self-referral practices in advanced diagnostic \n        imaging and anatomic pathology determined that financial \n        incentives were the most likely cause of increases in self-\n        referrals.\n            (2) For advanced diagnostic imaging, GAO stated that \n        ``providers who self-referred made 400,000 more referrals for \n        advanced imaging services than they would have if they were not \n        self-referring'', at a cost of ``more than $100 million'' in \n        2010.\n            (3) For anatomic pathology, GAO found that ``self-referring \n        providers likely referred over 918,000 more anatomic pathology \n        services'' than they would have if they were not self-\n        referring, costing Medicare approximately $69,000,000 more in \n        2010 than if self-referral was not permitted.\n            (4) For radiation oncology, GAO found that intensity \n        modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) utilization among self-\n        referring groups increased by 356 percent, with overall \n        increases in IMRT utilization rates and spending due entirely \n        to services performed by limited-specialty groups. The GAO \n        concluded that ``the higher use of IMRT by self-referring \n        providers results in higher costs for Medicare and \n        beneficiaries. To the extent that treatment decisions are \n        driven by providers' financial interest and not by patient \n        preference, these increased costs are difficult to justify''.\n            (5) For physical therapy, GAO found that ``in the year a \n        provider began to self-refer, physical therapy service \n        referrals increased at a higher rate relative to non-self-\n        referring providers of the same specialty''.\n            (6) Noting the rapid growth of services covered by the in-\n        office ancillary services (IOAS) exception and evidence that \n        these services are sometimes furnished inappropriately by \n        referring physicians, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n        (MedPAC) stated that physician self-referral of ancillary \n        services creates incentives to increase volume under Medicare's \n        current fee-for-service payment systems and the rapid volume \n        growth contributes to Medicare's rising financial burden on \n        taxpayers and beneficiaries.\n            (7) The President's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget includes the \n        change to remove the four services: advanced diagnostic \n        imaging, anatomic pathology, radiation oncology, and physical \n        therapy from the IOAS exception to the Stark Law and cited the \n        change as generating a savings score of $4,980,000,000 over 10 \n        years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's analysis \n        of the President's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget listed the change as \n        generating a savings of $3,300,000,000 over 10 years.\n            (8) According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n        Services, a key rationale for the IOAS exception was to permit \n        physicians to provide ancillary services in their offices to \n        better inform diagnosis and treatment decisions at the time of \n        the patient's initial office visit.\n            (9) It is necessary, therefore, to distinguish between \n        services and procedures that were intended to be covered by the \n        IOAS exception, such as routine clinical laboratory services or \n        simple x-rays that are provided during the patient's initial \n        office visit, and other health care services which were clearly \n        not envisioned to be covered by that exception because they \n        cannot be performed during the patient's initial office visit.\n            (10) According to a 2010 Health Affairs study, less than 10 \n        percent of CT, MRI, and Nuclear Medicine scans take place on \n        the same day as the initial patient office visit.\n            (11) According to a 2012 Health Affairs study, urologists' \n        self-referrals for anatomic pathology services of biopsy \n        specimens is linked to increased use and volume billed along \n        with a lower detection of prostate cancer.\n            (12) According to an October 2011 Laboratory Economics \n        report, there has been an increase in the number of anatomic \n        pathology specimen units billed to the Medicare part B program \n        from 2006 through 2010, specifically for CPT Code 88305, and \n        the rate of increase billed by physician offices for this \n        service is accelerating at a far greater pace than the rest of \n        the provider segments.\n            (13) According to a 2013 American Academy of Dermatology \n        Pathology Billing paper, arrangements involving the split of \n        the technical and professional components of anatomic pathology \n        services among different providers may endanger patient safety \n        and undermine quality of care.\n            (14) In November 2012, Bloomberg News released an \n        investigative report that scrutinized ordeals faced by \n        California prostate cancer patients treated by a urology clinic \n        that owns radiation therapy equipment. The report found that \n        physician self-referral resulted in a detrimental impact on \n        patient care and drove up health care costs in the Medicare \n        program. The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the \n        Baltimore Sun have also published investigations showing that \n        urology groups owning radiation therapy machines have \n        utilization rates that rise quickly and are well above national \n        norms for radiation therapy treatment of prostate cancer.\n            (15) According to a 2010 MedPAC report, only 3 percent of \n        outpatient physical therapy services were provided on the same \n        day as an office visit, only 9 percent within 7 days of an \n        office visit, and only 14 percent within 14 days of an office \n        visit. These services are not integral to the physician's \n        initial diagnosis and do not improve patient convenience \n        because patients must return for physical therapy treatments.\n            (16) Those services intended to be covered under the IOAS \n        exception are not affected by this legislation.\n            (17) The exception to the ownership or investment \n        prohibition for rural providers in the ``Stark'' rule is not \n        affected by this legislation.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) Maintain the in-office ancillary services exception and \n        preserve its original intent by removing certain complex \n        services from the exception--specifically, advanced imaging, \n        anatomic pathology, radiation therapy, and physical therapy.\n            (2) Protect patients from misaligned provider financial \n        incentives.\n            (3) Protect Medicare resources by saving billions of \n        dollars.\n            (4) Accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1), \n        (2), and (3) in a manner that does not alter the existing \n        exception to the ownership or investment prohibition for rural \n        providers.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n            (2) in paragraph (4), by inserting ``(or $150,000 if such \n        referrals are for specified non-ancillary services)'' after \n        ``$100,000''.\n    (c) Enhanced Screening of Claims.--Section 1877(g) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1395nn(g)) is further amended by adding at the \nend the following new paragraph:\n            ``(7) Compliance review for specified non-ancillary \n        services.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after \n                the date of the enactment of this paragraph, the \n                Secretary, in consultation with the Inspector General \n                of the Department of Health and Human Services, shall \n                review compliance with subsection (a)(1) with respect \n                to referrals for specified non-ancillary services in \n                accordance with procedures established by the \n                Secretary.\n                    ``(B) Factors in compliance review.--Such \n                procedures--\n                            ``(i) shall, for purposes of targeting \n                        types of entities that the Secretary determines \n                        represent a high risk of noncompliance with \n                        subsection (a)(1) with respect to such billing \n                        for such specified non-ancillary services, \n                        apply different levels of review based on such \n                        type;
