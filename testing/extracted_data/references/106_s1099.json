FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) United States goods and services compete in global \n        markets and it is necessary for trade agreements to promote \n        such competition.\n            (2) The current dispute resolution mechanism of the World \n        Trade Organization is designed to resolve disputes in a manner \n        that brings stability and predictability to world trade.\n            (3) When foreign countries refuse to comply with a panel or \n        Appellate Body report of the World Trade Organization and \n        violate any of the Uruguay Round Agreements, it has a \n        deleterious effect on the United States economy.\n            (4) A WTO member can retaliate against a country that \n        refuses to implement a panel or Appellate Body report by \n        imposing additional duties of up to 100 percent on goods \n        imported from the noncomplying country.\n            (5) In cases where additional duties are imposed on \n        imported goods, the duties should be used to provide relief to \n        the industry that is injured by the noncompliance.\n\nSEC. 3.
