FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In an October 2005 report to the Congress, the \n        Comptroller General reviewed the United States Government's \n        interagency efforts to coordinate the delivery of training and \n        technical assistance to countries vulnerable to terrorist \n        financing, and issues of accountability in the blocking of \n        terrorist assets held in the United States by the Secretary of \n        the Treasury.\n            (2) In April 2006, the Comptroller General of the United \n        States testified before the Congress on the findings of the \n        October 2005 report and, among other things, the Comptroller \n        General testified that ``Although the United States Government \n        provides a range of training and technical assistance to \n        countries it deems vulnerable to terrorist financing, it does \n        not have a strategic and integrated plan to coordinate the \n        delivery of this assistance.''.\n            (3) The Terrorist Financing Working Group, an interagency \n        entity established by the National Security Council and chaired \n        by the Secretary of State, coordinates the delivery of training \n        and technical assistance to nearly two dozen countries the \n        Working Group considers to be priority countries, as well as to \n        other countries the Working Group considers to be nonpriority \n        countries, that are vulnerable to terrorist financing.\n            (4) The Comptroller General testified that the Secretary of \n        State and the Secretary of the Treasury disagree about the \n        roles and procedures of each agency within the Terrorist \n        Financing Working Group for the delivery of counterterrorism \n        financing training and technical assistance, thereby causing \n        the overall effort to lack effective leadership.\n            (5) An example of how this disagreement has impacted the \n        delivery of training and technical assistance to countries \n        vulnerable to terrorist financing is as follows:\n                    (A) In May 2005, the Department of State denied a \n                Department of the Treasury employee official entry into \n                a priority country in response to a request from the \n                central bank of that country to set up a financial \n                intelligence unit.\n                    (B) The Secretary of State told the Comptroller \n                General that the Department wanted to conduct a \n                Terrorist Financing Working Group assessment before \n                allowing the Department of the Treasury to continue its \n                work.\n                    (C) According to the report of the Government \n                Accountability Office, the United States Ambassador to \n                the country requested a delay in the assessment and the \n                work of the Department of the Treasury was allowed to \n                proceed.\n                    (D) However, as a result of this disagreement, the \n                entry of the Department of the Treasury official into \n                the country and the work itself was delayed by several \n                months.\n            (6) The Comptroller General testified that the interagency \n        coordinating effort on terrorist financing training and \n        technical assistance lacked other key elements that are \n        critical to effective strategic planning, such as the strategic \n        alignment of resources with needs and risks, and a process to \n        measure results.\n            (7) The October 2005 report of the Comptroller General \n        found that the Attorney General, who provides technical \n        assistance in the drafting of anti-terrorist financing \n        legislation for priority countries, concluded that ``having \n        procedures and practices for Terrorist Financing Working Group \n        priority countries that differ from those for other vulnerable \n        countries creates problems''.\n            (8) The October 2005, report of the Comptroller General \n        cited several instances of interagency disagreements on whether \n        it is appropriate for contractors for the United States to \n        provide legislative drafting assistance for counterterrorism \n        financing legislation.\n            (9) In connection with this disagreement, the Secretary of \n        State and the Attorney General believe that legislative \n        drafting should be conducted by officials of the Department of \n        Justice, while the Secretary of the Treasury, in some \n        instances, advocated the use of contractors for nonpriority \n        countries.\n            (10) The Attorney General objected to the use of \n        contractors and indicated that previous contractor work on \n        legislative drafting did not meet international standards for \n        effective counterterrorism financing legislation, citing as an \n        example the work of a contractor to the Agency for \n        International Development who assisted in drafting legislation \n        which officials of the Department of Justice had to complete \n        because the draft included substantial deficiencies, in the \n        opinion of the Attorney General.\n            (11) In April 2006, officials representing the Secretary of \n        State and the Secretary of the Treasury testified before the \n        Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives \n        that they did not act on the Comptroller General's \n        recommendations to develop a strategic and integrated plan for \n        the delivery of counterterrorism financing training and \n        technical assistance and to enter into an interagency \n        Memorandum of Agreement that clarifies each agency's roles and \n        responsibilities.\n            (12) The officials testified that both the Secretary of \n        State and the Secretary of the Treasury believe that an \n        integrated strategic plan already exists and that ``There is no \n        desire among the Terrorist Financing Working Group agencies to \n        reinvent a process that has worked well for several years and \n        worked even better since the issuance of the General \n        Accountability Office report.''.\n            (13) The Comptroller General recommended in his \n        congressional testimony that Congress require ``the Secretary \n        of State and the Secretary of the Treasury to submit an annual \n        report to Congress showing the status of interagency efforts to \n        develop and implement an integrated strategic plan and \n        Memorandum of Agreement to ensure Terrorist Financing Working \n        Group's seamless functioning, particularly with respect to \n        Terrorist Financing Working Group roles and procedures''.\n\nSEC. 3.
