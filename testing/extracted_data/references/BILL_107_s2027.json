FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being \n        used by rebels, state actors, and terrorists to finance \n        military activities, overthrow legitimate governments, subvert \n        international efforts to promote peace and stability, and \n        commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians. During \n        the past decade, more than 6,500,000 people from Sierra Leone, \n        Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been \n        driven from their homes by wars waged in large part for control \n        of diamond mining areas. A million of these are refugees eking \n        out a miserable existence in neighboring countries, and tens of \n        thousands have fled to the United States. Approximately \n        3,700,000 people have died during these wars.\n            (2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to \n        nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart \n        not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights \n        violations.\n            (3) Human rights advocates, the diamond trade as \n        represented by the World Diamond Council, and the United States \n        Government recently began working to block the trade in \n        conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a \n        consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in \n        conflict diamonds.\n            (4) The United Nations Security Council has acted at \n        various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United \n        Nations to address threats to international peace and security \n        posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these actions, \n        it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons to certain \n        countries affected by such conflicts. It has further required \n        all states to prohibit the direct and indirect import of rough \n        diamonds from Angola and Sierra Leone unless the diamonds are \n        controlled under specified certificate of origin regimes and to \n        prohibit absolutely for a period of 12 months the direct and \n        indirect import of rough diamonds from Liberia.\n            (5) In response, the United States implemented sanctions \n        restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Angola and \n        Sierra Leone to those diamonds accompanied by specified \n        certificates of origin and fully prohibiting the importation of \n        rough diamonds from Liberia. In order to put an end to the \n        emergency situation in international relations, to maintain \n        international peace and security, and to protect its essential \n        security interests, and pursuant to its obligations under the \n        United Nations Charter, the United States is now taking further \n        action against trade in conflict diamonds.\n            (6) Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict \n        diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat of \n        a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of \n        countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and \n        penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they \n        employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other \n        countries are involved in working, through the ``Kimberley \n        Process'', toward devising a solution to this problem. As the \n        consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the \n        United States has an obligation to help sever the link between \n        diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an \n        effective solution.\n            (7) Articles XX and XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs \n        and Trade 1994 allow members of the World Trade Organization to \n        take measures to deal with situations such as that presented by \n        the current trade in conflict diamonds without violating their \n        World Trade Organization obligations.\n            (8) Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to \n        differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the \n        trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative \n        impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as \n        Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.\n            (9) Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the \n        regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the \n        trade in conflict diamonds.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Conflict diamonds.--The term ``conflict diamonds'' \n        means--\n                    (A) rough diamonds the importation of which is \n                prohibited by United Nations Security Council \n                Resolutions because that trade is fueling conflict;\n                    (B) in the case of rough diamonds not covered by \n                subparagraph (A), rough diamonds used by any armed \n                movement or an ally of an armed movement to finance or \n                sustain operations to carry out systematic human rights \n                abuses or attacks against unarmed civilians; or\n                    (C) diamonds that evidence shows fund the al-Qaeda \n                international terrorist network and related groups \n                designated under Executive Order No. 13224 of September \n                23, 2001 (66 Federal Register 49079).\n            (2) Diamonds.--The term ``diamonds'' means diamonds \n        classifiable under subheading 7102.31.00 or subheading \n        7102.39.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n        States.\n            (3) Polished diamonds.--The term ``polished diamonds'' \n        means diamonds classifiable under subheading 7102.39.00 of the \n        Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n            (4) Rough diamonds.--The term ``rough diamonds'' means \n        diamonds that are unworked, or simply sawn, cleaved, or bruted, \n        classifiable under subheading 7102.31.00 of the Harmonized \n        Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n            (5) United states.--The term ``United States'', when used \n        in the geographic sense, means the several States, the District \n        of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of \n        the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.

PROHIBITION OF POLISHED DIAMONDS AND JEWELRY.\n\n    The President shall prohibit specific entries into the customs \nterritory of the United States of polished diamonds and jewelry \ncontaining diamonds if the President has credible evidence that such \npolished diamonds and jewelry were produced with conflict diamonds.\n\nSEC. 6.

Such an international arrangement should create an effective \nglobal system of controls covering countries that export and import \nrough diamonds, should contain the elements described in section \n4(b)(3), and should address independent monitoring, the collection of \nreliable statistics on the diamond trade, and the need for a \ncoordinating body or secretariat to implement the arrangement.\n    (b) Additional Security Council Resolutions.--It is the sense of \nCongress that the President should take the necessary steps to seek \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolutions with respect to trade in \ndiamonds from additional countries identified under section 7(a)(5).\n    (c) Trade in Legitimate Diamonds.--It is the sense of Congress that \nthe provisions of this Act should not impede the trade in legitimate \ndiamonds with countries which are working constructively to eliminate \ntrade in conflict diamonds, including through the negotiation of an \neffective international arrangement to eliminate trade in conflict \ndiamonds.\n    (d) Implementation of Effective Measures.--It is the sense of \nCongress that companies involved in diamond extraction and trade should \nmake financial contributions to countries seeking to implement any \neffective measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds described in \nsection 4(b), if those countries would have financial difficulty \nimplementing those measures.\n\nSEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated to the President $5,000,000 \nfor each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to provide assistance to \ncountries seeking to implement any effective measures to stop trade in \nconflict diamonds described in section 4(b), if those countries would \nhave financial difficulty implementing those measures.\n\nSEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \nAct."
