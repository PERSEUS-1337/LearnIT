    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Gasoline Act of 1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) according to the National Air Quality and Emissions \n        Trends Report of the Environmental Protection Agency, dated \n        1996, motor vehicles account for a major portion of the \n        emissions that degrade the air quality of the United States: 49 \n        percent of nitrogen oxides emissions, 26 percent of emissions \n        of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than \n        or equal to 10 micrometers (PM-10), and 78 percent of carbon \n        monoxide emissions;\n            (2)(A) failure to control gasoline sulfur concentration \n        adversely affects catalytic converter function for all vehicles \n        in the national vehicle fleet; and\n            (B) research performed collaboratively by the auto and oil \n        industries demonstrates that when sulfur concentration in motor \n        vehicle gasoline is reduced from 450 parts per million \n        (referred to in this section as ``ppm'') to 50 ppm--\n                    (i) hydrocarbon emissions are reduced by 18 \n                percent;\n                    (ii) carbon monoxide emissions are reduced by 19 \n                percent; and\n                    (iii) nitrogen oxide emissions are reduced by 8 \n                percent;\n            (3)(A) recent studies conducted by the American Automobile \n        Manufacturers Association (AAMA), the Association of \n        International Automobile Manufacturers (AIMA), and the \n        Coordinating Research Council confirm that sulfur in vehicle \n        fuel impairs to an even greater degree the emission controls of \n        Low-Emission Vehicles (referred to in this section as ``LEVs'') \n        and Ultra-Low-Emission Vehicles (referred to in this section as \n        ``ULEVs'');\n            (B) because sulfur-induced impairment of advanced \n        technology emission control systems is not fully reversible \n        under normal in-use driving conditions, a nationwide, year-\n        round sulfur standard is necessary to prevent impairment of \n        vehicles' emission control systems as the vehicles travel \n        across State lines;\n            (C) industry research on LEVs and ULEVs demonstrates that \n        when gasoline sulfur concentration is lowered from 330 ppm to \n        40 ppm--\n                    (i) hydrocarbon emissions are reduced by 34 \n                percent;\n                    (ii) carbon monoxide emissions are reduced by 43 \n                percent; and\n                    (iii) nitrogen oxide emissions are reduced by 51 \n                percent;\n            (D) failure to control sulfur in gasoline will inhibit the \n        introduction of more fuel-efficient technologies, such as \n        direct injection engines and ``NO&lt;INF&gt;x&lt;/INF&gt; trap'' after-\n        treatment technology, which require fuel with a very low \n        concentration of sulfur;\n            (E) the technology for removing sulfur from fuel during the \n        refining process is readily available and currently in use; and\n            (F) the reduction of sulfur concentrations in fuel to the \n        level required by this Act is a cost-effective means of \n        improving air quality;\n            (4)(A) gasoline sulfur levels in the United States--\n                    (i) average between 300 and 350 ppm and range as \n                high as 1000 ppm; and\n                    (ii) are far higher than the levels allowed in many \n                other industrialized nations, and higher than the \n                levels allowed by some developing nations;\n            (B) the European Union recently approved a standard of 150 \n        ppm to take effect in 2000, to be phased down to 30 through 50 \n        ppm by 2005;\n            (C) Japan has a standard of 50 ppm; and\n            (D) gasoline and diesel fuel in Australia, New Zealand, \n        Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Finland have significantly \n        lower sulfur concentrations than comparable gasoline and diesel \n        fuel in the United States;\n            (5)(A) California is the only State that regulates sulfur \n        concentration in all gasoline sold; and\n            (B) in June 1996, California imposed a 2-part limitation on \n        sulfur concentration in gasoline: a 40 ppm per gallon maximum, \n        or a 30 ppm per gallon annual average with an 80 ppm per gallon \n        maximum;\n            (6)(A) a 1998 regulatory impact analysis by the California \n        Air Resources Board reports that air quality improved \n        significantly in the year following the introduction of low \n        sulfur gasoline; and\n            (B) the California Air Resources Board credits low sulfur \n        gasoline with reducing ozone levels by 10 percent on the South \n        Coast, 12 percent in Sacramento, and 2 percent in the Bay Area; \n        and\n            (7)(A) reducing sulfur concentration in gasoline to the \n        level required by this Act is a cost-effective pollution \n        prevention measure that will provide significant and immediate \n        benefits; and\n            (B) unlike vehicle hardware requirements that affect only \n        new model years, sulfur control produces the benefits of \n        reduced emissions of air pollutants across the vehicle fleet \n        immediately upon implementation.\n\nSEC. 3.
