FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On December 3, 2007, the National Intelligence \n        Estimate, representing the consensus view of 16 intelligence \n        agencies, concluded that Iran had once had a covert nuclear \n        weapons program.\n            (2) The National Intelligence Estimate also found that Iran \n        had halted its covert nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that \n        this program remains frozen.\n            (3) The NIE concluded that Iran's leadership was quite \n        sensitive to international views and wanted to avoid \n        international confrontation and made a ``cost-benefit'' \n        decision regarding whether or not to have such a program.\n            (4) Serious concerns still remain about the Government of \n        Iran's intentions and behavior with respect to the development \n        of nuclear weapons, especially regarding its fuel enrichment \n        program and the speed with which it might reconstitute its \n        suspended nuclear weapons program.\n            (5) Hostile official rhetoric exacerbates tensions and \n        reinforces misunderstandings and animus between the people of \n        the United States and Iran.\n            (6) The United States should enlist the support of all \n        interested parties to the region, including the IAEA, to \n        establish a program to ensure that Iran's nuclear weapons \n        program is terminated permanently, that its nuclear energy \n        program is brought fully under IAEA inspection and control, and \n        that all diplomatic tools are utilized to achieve these \n        objectives.\n            (7) A diplomatic solution that includes direct, \n        unconditional, bilateral, and comprehensive talks with the \n        Government of Iran is the only way to resolve long-standing \n        tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nSEC. 3.
