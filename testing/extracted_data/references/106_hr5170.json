FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to a 1999 Department of the Treasury study, \n        of the 51,400,000 joint returns filed in 1999, approximately--\n                    (A) 48 percent will incur a marriage tax penalty,\n                    (B) 41 percent will incur a marriage tax bonus, and\n                    (C) 11 percent will generally be unaffected.\n            (2) The average marriage tax penalty in 1999 will reach \n        $1,141 per couple, according to the Department of the Treasury \n        study.\n            (3) At least 66 provisions in the existing tax code treat \n        married couples differently from single filers, according to \n        the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n            (4) Married working women, on average, earn approximately \n        60 percent of their husband's salary, according to the Bureau \n        of the Census. The wage gap between women and men is 73 percent \n        for Caucasian women, 63 percent for African-American women, and \n        53 percent for Hispanic women, according to the National \n        Committee on Pay Equity.\n            (5) Approximately 40 percent of married mothers in the \n        United States stay at home to raise their young children full \n        time while almost no fathers do, according to the Bureau of the \n        Census.\n            (6) Although the United States tax code is neutral, it is \n        biased against secondary earners, who are overwhelmingly women.\n            (7) Because of the progressive marginal rates in the tax \n        code, one spouse earning $25,000 per year would be taxed \n        entirely at the 15 percent rate; but if the other spouse also \n        earns $25,000, a portion of the other spouse's income would be \n        taxed at the 28 percent rate.\n            (8) Regardless of marital status, once an individual's \n        reported income level reaches beyond the earned income tax \n        credit threshold, she or he automatically loses this benefit. \n        As a result, newly married couples struggling to escape poverty \n        suddenly lose this vital tax benefit simply because they are no \n        longer single.\n\nSEC. 3. MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF.\n\n    (a) Standard Deduction.--\n            (1) In general.--Paragraph (2) of section 63(c) of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to standard deduction) \n        is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``$5,000'' in subparagraph (A) and \n                inserting ``twice the dollar amount in effect under \n                subparagraph (C) for the taxable year'',\n                    (B) by adding ``or'' at the end of subparagraph \n                (B),\n                    (C) by striking ``in the case of'' and all that \n                follows in subparagraph (C) and inserting ``in any \n                other case.'', and\n                    (D) by striking subparagraph (D).\n            (2) Increase allowed as deduction in determining minimum \n        tax.--Subparagraph (E) of section 56(b)(1) of such Code is \n        amended by adding at the end the following new sentence: ``The \n        preceding sentence shall not apply to so much of the standard \n        deduction under subparagraph (A) of section 63(c)(2) as exceeds \n        the amount which would be such deduction but for the amendment \n        made by section 2(a)(1) of the Penalty Relief From Marriage Tax \n        Act of 2000.''\n            (3) Technical amendments.--\n                    (A) Subparagraph (B) of section 1(f)(6) of such \n                Code is amended by striking ``(other than with'' and \n                all that follows through ``shall be applied'' and \n                inserting ``(other than with respect to sections \n                63(c)(4) and 151(d)(4)(A)) shall be applied''.\n                    (B) Paragraph (4) of section 63(c) of such Code is \n                amended by adding at the end the following flush \n                sentence:\n        ``The preceding sentence shall not apply to the amount referred \n        to in paragraph (2)(A).''\n    (b) Earned Income Credit.--\n            (1) In general.--Subsection (a) of section 32 of such Code \n        (relating to credit for earned income) is amended by adding at \n        the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(3) Reduction of marriage penalty.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--In the case of a joint return, \n                the phaseout amount under this section shall be such \n                amount (determined without regard to this paragraph) \n                increased by $2,500 ($2,000 in the case of taxable \n                years beginning during 2001).\n                    ``(B) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any \n                taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2002, \n                the $2,500 amount contained in subparagraph (A) shall \n                be increased by an amount equal to the product of--\n                            ``(i) such dollar amount, and\n                            ``(ii) the cost-of-living adjustment \n                        determined under section 1(f)(3) for the \n                        calendar year in which the taxable year begins, \n                        determined by substituting `calendar year 2001' \n                        for `calendar year 1992' in subparagraph (B) \n                        thereof.\n                If any increase determined under the preceding sentence \n                is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be \n                rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50.''\n            (2) Repeal of reduction of refundable tax credits.--\n                    (A) Subsection (d) of section 24 of such Code is \n                amended by striking paragraph (2) and redesignating \n                paragraph (3) as paragraph (2).\n                    (B) Section 32 of such Code is amended by striking \n                subsection (h).\n    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000.\n\nSEC. 4.
