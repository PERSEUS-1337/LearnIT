FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Depository institutions and affiliates of depository \n        institutions currently may control and lease foreclosed \n        property for a limited period of time often subject to safety \n        and soundness considerations, under various Federal laws and \n        the law of some States.\n            (2) Authorizing such institutions, the GSEs, and affiliates \n        to enter into a long-term lease with the occupant of the \n        property or any other person would reduce the number of \n        residential properties entering into the housing inventory, \n        which in turn would help to stabilize home values and restore \n        confidence in the housing markets.\n            (3) Allowing depository institutions, the GSEs, and \n        affiliates of such institutions to lease foreclosed property \n        will allow the institution or affiliate to dispose of such \n        property into a presumably more stable market at the end of the \n        lease term which would reduce the loss the institution or \n        affiliate may otherwise be required to recognize upon \n        disposition of the property.\n            (4) Providing a means for foreclosed property to remain \n        occupied during the housing downturn will preserve the property \n        itself as well as the aesthetic and economic values of \n        neighboring homes and even whole neighborhoods.\n\nSEC. 3. BANK LEASING OF FORECLOSED PROPERTIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 18 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \n(12 U.S.C. 1828) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubsection:\n    ``(y) Leasing of Foreclosed Property.--\n            ``(1) Leasing authorized.--Notwithstanding any provision of \n        Federal or State law restricting the time during which a \n        depository institution, or any affiliate of a depository \n        institution, may hold or lease property, or any provision of \n        Federal or State law prohibiting a depository institution, or \n        any affiliate of a depository institution, from leasing \n        property and subject to this subsection and regulations \n        prescribed under this subsection, any depository institution, \n        and any affiliate of a depository institution, may lease to any \n        individual, including a lease with an option to purchase, for \n        not to exceed 5 years an interest in residential property \n        which--\n                    ``(A) was or is security for an extension of credit \n                by such depository institution or affiliate; and\n                    ``(B) came under the ownership or control of the \n                depository institution or affiliate through \n                foreclosure, or a deed in lieu of foreclosure, on the \n                extension of credit.\n            ``(2) Safety and soundness regulations.--The Federal \n        banking agencies shall jointly prescribe regulations which--\n                    ``(A) establish criteria and minimum requirements \n                for the leasing activity of any depository institution \n                or affiliate of a depository institution, including \n                minimum capital requirements, that the agency \n                determines to be appropriate for the preservation of \n                the safety and soundness of the institution or \n                affiliate;\n                    ``(B) establish requirements or exceptions that the \n                agency determines are appropriate under this subsection \n                for any such institution or affiliate for any other \n                purpose; and\n                    ``(C) provide for appropriate actions under section \n                38 with respect to any such lease if necessary to \n                protect the capital or safety and soundness of the \n                institution or affiliate or any other necessary \n                enforcement action.\n            ``(3) Length of lease.--If any provision of any Federal or \n        State law, including the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, \n        governing the permissible activities of depository institutions \n        or affiliates of depository institutions permits a depository \n        institution or any such affiliate to hold property as described \n        in paragraph (1) for a period longer than 5 years, any lease \n        under paragraph (1) may be extended to the extent permitted by \n        such provision of law.\n            ``(4) Sunset.--This section shall apply only with respect \n        to leases entered into during the 3-year period beginning on \n        the date of the enactment of the Neighborhood Preservation \n        Act.''.\n    (b) Intent of the Congress.--It is the intent of the Congress \nthat--\n            (1) no permanent change in policy on leasing foreclosed \n        property is being established with respect to depository \n        institutions and depository institution holding companies; and\n            (2) subsection (y) of section 18 of the Federal Deposit \n        Insurance Act should not apply to leases entered into after the \n        sunset date contained in such subsection.\n\nSEC. 4.
