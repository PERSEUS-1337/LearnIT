FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the use of controlled substances by emergency medical \n        services agencies to administer medical care and medicines to \n        individuals in the field is essential to save lives, manage \n        pain, and improve health outcomes;\n            (2) the unique nature of mobile emergency medical services \n        is unlike other healthcare services governed by the Controlled \n        Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) in that it requires the \n        provision of time-sensitive and mobile medical care to \n        individuals with critical injuries and illnesses in the field \n        and movement of such individuals to definitive care;\n            (3) there have been few investigations by the Drug \n        Enforcement Administration related to diversion in emergency \n        medical services;\n            (4) one recent survey of large emergency medical services \n        agencies in the United States showed less than 20 diversions or \n        investigations for nearly 70,000 doses of controlled substances \n        administered;\n            (5) regulatory oversight to prevent diversion is essential \n        in all health care settings, including emergency medical \n        services;\n            (6) such oversight shall be carefully tailored to recognize \n        unique care delivery models, including the provision of medical \n        care to individuals by emergency medical services practitioners \n        under the supervision of a physician medical director; and\n            (7) such oversight should further promote uniformity of \n        rules, application and enforcement to prevent diversion and \n        establish clear guidelines within emergency medical services \n        while also recognizing the variety of emergency medical \n        services agencies including governmental, nongovernmental, \n        private, and volunteer emergency medical services agencies.\n\nSEC. 3.
