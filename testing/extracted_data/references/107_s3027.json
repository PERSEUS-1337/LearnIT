    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Code Adam Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) ``Code Adam'' is a protocol used as a preventive tool \n        against child abductions and lost children in certain public \n        buildings and commercial establishments across the Nation.\n            (2) ``Code Adam'' was created and promoted by the Wal-Mart \n        retail stores, which developed this protocol as a child-safety \n        program to find a child who has been kidnapped or is merely \n        lost in a public place.\n            (3) This protocol was named in memory of 6-year-old Adam \n        Walsh, who was murdered after being kidnapped from a Florida \n        shopping mall in 1981, an event that brought the horror of \n        child abduction to national attention.\n            (4) ``Code Adam'' has proven extremely successful in \n        thwarting many attempted abductions through the issuance of a \n        ``Code Adam'' alert in commercial establishments, and it \n        continues to be implemented in stores across the country with \n        the help of the National Center for Missing and Exploited \n        Children.\n            (5) The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is the only \n        jurisdiction that has approved an Act to adopt the ``Code \n        Adam'' in government buildings.\n\nSEC. 3.
