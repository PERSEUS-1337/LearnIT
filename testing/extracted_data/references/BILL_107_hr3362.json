SIP REQUIREMENTS FOR AREAS UPWIND OF OZONE NONATTAINMENT AREAS.\n\n    (a) SIP Revisions for All Areas.--Section 110(a) of the Clean Air \nAct is amended by inserting the following new paragraph after paragraph \n(3):\n    ``(4) For each area (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as \nan `upwind area') in a State which, as determined by the State, causes \nor significantly contributes to a violation of the national ambient air \nquality standard for ozone in another area (hereinafter in this \nparagraph referred to as a `downwind area') in the State, the State \nshall submit, within 1 year of such determination, a revision of the \napplicable implementation plan that includes a requirement that \neither--\n            ``(A) the upwind area reduce emissions of ozone or its \n        precursors by an amount determined by the State to be necessary \n        to mitigate impacts commensurate with the level of contribution \n        caused by the upwind area to air pollution concentrations in \n        the downwind area; or\n            ``(B) the upwind area make payments to the State or to an \n        air quality district designated by the State to compensate the \n        downwind area in such amounts as such State finds necessary to \n        pay for the costs of emission reduction measures required to be \n        undertaken in the downwind area to fully mitigate the impacts \nof pollutants transported from the upwind area.''.\n    (b) Requirements for Moderate Ozone Nonattainment Areas.--Paragraph \n(4) of section 182(b) of the Clean Air Act is amended by adding the \nfollowing at the end thereof:\n            ``(B) For each moderate area which the State determines to \n        cause or significantly contribute to a violation of the \n        national ambient air quality standards for ozone in a downwind \n        area (as identified by the State under section 110(a)(4)), the \n        State shall submit, within 1 year after such determination, a \n        revision to the applicable implementation plan that includes \n        all provisions necessary to provide for an enhanced vehicle \n        inspection and maintenance program as described in paragraph \n        (3) of subsection (c) of this section and the regulations of \n        the Administrator adopted pursuant to such paragraph (3).''.\n\nSEC. 3. SIP REQUIREMENTS FOR STATES UPWIND OF OZONE NONATTAINMENT \n              AREAS.\n\n    (a) SIP Revisions for All Areas.--Section 126 of the Clean Air Act \nis amended by inserting the following new subsection after subsection \n(c):\n    ``(d) States Upwind of Ozone Nonattainment Areas.--For each State \n(hereinafter in this subsection referred to as an `upwind State') \nwhich, as determined by the Administrator, causes or significantly \ncontributes to a violation of the national ambient air quality standard \nfor ozone in an area in one or more other States (hereinafter in this \nparagraph referred to as a `downwind area'), the State shall submit, \nwithin 1 year of such determination, a revision of the applicable \nimplementation plan provisions adopted under section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii) \nthat contains either or both the following:\n            ``(1) Provisions under which the upwind State will require \n        reductions in emissions of ozone or its precursors by an amount \n        determined by the Administrator to be necessary to mitigate \n        impacts commensurate with the level of contribution caused by \n        sources in the upwind State to ozone concentrations in the \n        downwind area.\n            ``(2) Provisions under which the upwind State will make \n        payments to the State or States in which all or part of the \n        downwind area is located or to an air quality district \n        designated by the Administrator to compensate such State or \n        States in such amounts as the Administrator finds necessary to \n        pay for the costs of emission reduction measures required to be \n        undertaken in the downwind area to fully mitigate the impacts \nof pollutants transported from the upwind State.''.\n    (b) Requirements for Moderate Ozone Nonattainment Areas.--Paragraph \n(4) of section 182(b) of the Clean Air Act is amended by adding the \nfollowing at the end thereof:\n            ``(C) For each moderate area which the Administrator \n        determines to cause or significantly contribute to a violation \n        of the national ambient air quality standards for ozone in a \n        downwind area (as identified by the Administrator under section \n        126(d)), the State shall submit, within 1 year after such \n        determination, a revision to the applicable implementation plan \n        that includes all provisions necessary to provide for an \n        enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program as \n        described in paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of this section \n        and the regulations of the Administrator adopted pursuant to \n        such paragraph (3).''.\n\nSEC. 4.

Such \nmeasures shall include all existing control measures, as well as any \ncontrol measures not yet implemented that are necessary to fully \nmitigate the transport of ozone and its precursors to such downwind \nareas. There shall be no relaxation or rescission of any control \nmeasure or rule in the upwind area or unwind State as long as sources \nin such upwind area or State cause or contribute to a violation of the \nnational ambient air quality standard for ozone in any such downwind \narea.''."
