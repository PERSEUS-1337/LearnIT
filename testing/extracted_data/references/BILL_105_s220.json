FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The European Union's Third Country Meat Directive has \n        been used to decertify more than 400 United States facilities \n        exporting beef and pork products to the European Union even \n        though United States health inspection procedures are \n        equivalent to those provided for in the Third Country Meat \n        Directive.\n            (2) An effect of the decertifications is to prohibit the \n        importation of United States beef and pork products into the \n        European Union.\n            (3) As a result of the decertifications, the highly \n        competitive United States pork industry loses as much as \n        $60,000,000 each year from trade with European Union countries.\n            (4) In July 1987 and November 1990, at the request of \n        affected United States industries, the United States initiated \n        investigations under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into \n        the European Union's administration of the Third Country Meat \n        Directive and sought resolution of the meat and pork trade \n        problems through the dispute settlement process established \n        under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n            (5) The United States Trade Representative preliminarily \n        concluded on October 10, 1992, that the European Union's \n        administration of the Third Country Meat Directive created a \n        burden on and restricted United States commerce.\n            (6) Bilateral talks, initiated as a result of that finding, \n        resulted in an Exchange of Letters in which the United States \n        and the European Union concluded that the meat inspection \n        systems of the United States and the European Union provided \n        ``equivalent safeguards against public health risks'' and \n        agreed to take steps to resolve remaining differences regarding \n        meat inspection.\n            (7) Even though the United States terminated the section \n        301 investigation as a result of the Exchange of Letters, the \n        United States determined that the practices under investigation \n        would have been actionable if an acceptable agreement had not \n        been reached.\n            (8) United States meat and pork producers have displayed \n        consistent interest in exporting products to the European Union \n        and have undertaken substantial investment to take the steps \n        specified by the Exchange of Letters.\n            (9) The European Union has failed to acknowledge changes in \n        plant safety and inspection procedures undertaken in the United \n        States specifically at the European Union's request and has not \n        fulfilled its obligation to inspect and relist United States \n        producers who have taken the steps specified by the Exchange of \n        Letters.\n            (10) The actions of the European Union in conducting United \n        States plant inspections places the European Union in violation \n        of commitments made in the Exchange of Letters.\n            (11) The European Union, in addition to being a party to \n        the Exchange of Letters, is a signatory to GATT 1994 and to the \n        Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary \n        Measures, which requires that meat and pork inspection \n        procedures under Department of Agriculture regulations be \n        treated as equivalent to inspection procedures required by the \n        European Union under the Third Country Meat Directive if the \n        regulations achieve the European level of sanitary protection.\n            (12) Whenever a foreign country is not satisfactorily \n        implementing an international trade measure or agreement, the \n        United States Trade Representative is required under section \n        306(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2416(b)(1)) to \n        determine the actions to be taken under section 301(a) of such \n        Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
