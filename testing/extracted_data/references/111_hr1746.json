    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Predisaster Hazard Mitigation Act of \n2010''.\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The predisaster hazard mitigation program has been \n    successful and cost-effective. Funding from the predisaster hazard \n    mitigation program has successfully reduced loss of life, personal \n    injuries, damage to and destruction of property, and disruption of \n    communities from disasters.\n        (2) The predisaster hazard mitigation program has saved Federal \n    taxpayers from spending significant sums on disaster recovery and \n    relief that would have been otherwise incurred had communities not \n    successfully applied mitigation techniques.\n        (3) A 2007 Congressional Budget Office report found that the \n    predisaster hazard mitigation program reduced losses by roughly $3 \n    (measured in 2007 dollars) for each dollar invested in mitigation \n    efforts funded under the predisaster hazard mitigation program. \n    Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office found that projects \n    funded under the predisaster hazard mitigation program could lower \n    the need for post-disaster assistance from the Federal Government \n    so that the predisaster hazard mitigation investment by the Federal \n    Government would actually save taxpayer funds.\n        (4) A 2005 report by the Multihazard Mitigation Council showed \n    substantial benefits and cost savings from the hazard mitigation \n    programs of the Federal Emergency Management Agency generally. \n    Looking at a range of hazard mitigation programs of the Federal \n    Emergency Management Agency, the study found that, on average, $1 \n    invested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in hazard \n    mitigation provided the Nation with roughly $4 in benefits. \n    Moreover, the report projected that the mitigation grants awarded \n    between 1993 and 2003 would save more than 220 lives and prevent \n    nearly 4,700 injuries over approximately 50 years.\n        (5) Given the substantial savings generated from the \n    predisaster hazard mitigation program in the years following the \n    provision of assistance under the program, increasing funds \n    appropriated for the program would be a wise investment.\nSEC. 3. PREDISASTER HAZARD MITIGATION.\n    (a) Allocation of Funds.--Section 203(f) of the Robert T. Stafford \nDisaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5133(f)) is \namended to read as follows:\n    ``(f) Allocation of Funds.--\n        ``(1) In general.--The President shall award financial \n    assistance under this section on a competitive basis and in \n    accordance with the criteria in subsection (g).\n        ``(2) Minimum and maximum amounts.--In providing financial \n    assistance under this section, the President shall ensure that the \n    amount of financial assistance made available to a State (including \n    amounts made available to local governments of the State) for a \n    fiscal year--\n            ``(A) is not less than the lesser of--\n                ``(i) $575,000; or\n                ``(ii) the amount that is equal to 1 percent of the \n            total funds appropriated to carry out this section for the \n            fiscal year; and\n            ``(B) does not exceed the amount that is equal to 15 \n        percent of the total funds appropriated to carry out this \n        section for the fiscal year.''.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 203(m) of the Robert \nT.
