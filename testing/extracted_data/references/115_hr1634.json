FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to 2013 national health expenditure data, \n        United States health care spending increased 3.6 percent to \n        reach $2.9 trillion, or $9,255 per person, and accounted for \n        17.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n            (2) According to the Institute of Medicine, in 2012 \n        estimates of health care costs attributed over 75 percent of \n        national health expenditures to treatment for chronic diseases.\n            (3) A March 2003 report from the World Health Organization \n        concluded diet was a major cause of chronic diseases.\n            (4) Seven out of 10 deaths among people in the United \n        States each year are from chronic diseases such as \n        cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer.\n            (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, in 2013 heart disease was the leading cause of \n        death for American adults. Approximately 600,000 American \n        adults die each year from cardiovascular disease. Coronary \n        heart disease alone costs American taxpayers $108.9 billion \n        each year.\n            (6) Research has shown that following a healthful diet can \n        not only reduce symptoms related to cardiovascular disease but \n        can also actually reverse damage done to the arteries.\n            (7) According to the Journal of the American Medical \n        Association, two-thirds of adults in the United States are \n        currently overweight, and half of those overweight individuals \n        are obese. One in three children are overweight, and one-fifth \n        of children are obese. The United States spends about $147 to \n        $210 billion a year on obesity related diseases, including type \n        2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and arthritis.\n            (8) An estimated 29.1 million people in the United States \n        have diabetes. Another 86 million American adults have \n        prediabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        predicts that one in three children born in 2000 will develop \n        diabetes at some point in their lives. Total estimated costs of \n        diagnosed diabetes have increased 41 percent, to $245 billion \n        in 2012 from $174 billion in 2007.\n            (9) According to the American Cancer Society, there will be \n        an estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed and 589,430 \n        cancer deaths in the United States in 2015. That is equivalent \n        to about 1,620 deaths per day and accounts for nearly 1 of \n        every 4 deaths. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \n        (AHRQ) estimates that the direct medical costs for cancer in \n        the United States in 2011 were $88.7 billion.\n            (10) According to the Journal of the American College of \n        Nutrition, in 2008 physicians felt inadequately trained to \n        provide proper nutrition advice. Ninety-four percent felt \n        nutrition counseling should be included during primary care \n        visits, but only 14 percent felt adequately trained to provide \n        such counseling.\n            (11) A 1985 National Academy of Sciences report recommended \n        that all medical schools require at least 25 contact hours of \n        nutrition education. According to a 2009 national survey of \n        medical colleges published in Academic Medicine, only 38 \n        percent of medical schools met these minimum standards by \n        requiring 25 hours of nutrition education as part of their \n        general curricula in 2004. By 2010, that number had shrunk to \n        27 percent. In addition, 30 percent of United States medical \n        schools required a dedicated nutrition course in 2004. Most \n        recently, only 25 percent of such schools required such a \n        course in 2010.\n            (12) According to the Journal of Nutrition in Clinical \n        Practice in 2010, more than half of graduating medical students \n        felt their nutrition education was insufficient.\n            (13) Recognizing the importance of nutrition, Healthy \n        People 2020--the Federal Government's framework for a healthier \n        Nation--includes a goal (NWS-6) to increase the proportion of \n        physician office visits that include counseling or education \n        related to nutrition or weight. According to Healthy People \n        2020, only 13.8 percent of physician office visits included \n        counseling about nutrition or diet (2010 latest year \n        available).\n            (14) According to Mission: Readiness, one in four Americans \n        cannot serve in the military due to weight. For those serving, \n        the military discharged 4,300 active-duty personnel due to \n        weight problems in 2012.\n            (15) According to the Journal of American Health Promotion, \n        the military spends well over $1 billion a year to treat \n        weight-related health problems such as heart disease and \n        diabetes through its TRICARE health insurance for active duty \n        personnel, reservists, retirees and their families.\n            (16) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, American Indian or Alaska Native adults are 60 \n        percent more likely to be obese and over twice as likely as to \n        have diabetes compared to White adults.\n            (17) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, American Indian or Alaska Native adults have the \n        highest rate of diabetes among all minority groups at 15.9 \n        percent.\n\nSEC. 3.

If the agency, \nwith respect to such previous year, did not fully adopt and encourage \nsuch guidelines with respect to such professionals, the head of the \nagency shall include in the report for the year the percentage of such \nprofessionals employed by such agency to furnish primary care services \nwho completed continuing education courses relating to nutrition (as \ndescribed in subsection (c)).\n    (c) Continuing Education Relating to Nutrition.--For purposes of \nsubsections (a) and (b), continuing education courses relating to \nnutrition shall include at least content on the role of nutrition in \nthe prevention, management, and, as possible, reversal of obesity, \ncardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer.\n    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Continuing education.--The term ``continuing \n        education'' is defined as courses that meet requirements for \n        Continuing Medical Education (CME) or Continuing Education (CE) \n        by medical or nurse practitioner professional organizations or \n        certified accrediting bodies.\n            (2) Nurse practitioner.--The term ``nurse practitioner'' \n        has the meaning given such term in section 1861(aa)(5) of the \n        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(5)).\n            (3) Physician.--The term ``physician'' has the meaning \n        given such term in section 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(r)(1)).\n            (4) Primary care health professional.--The term ``primary \n        care health professional'' means a physician or nurse \n        practitioner who furnishes primary care services.\n            (5) Primary care services.--The term ``primary care \n        services'' has the meaning given such term in section \n        1842(i)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u(i)(4)), \n        but shall include such services furnished by a nurse \n        practitioner as would otherwise be included if furnished by a \n        physician."
