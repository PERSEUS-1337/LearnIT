FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The States should recognize that the terms ``acquired \n        immune deficiency syndrome'' and ``AIDS'' are obsolete. In the \n        case of individuals who are infected with the human \n        immunodeficiency virus (commonly known as HIV), the more \n        important medical fact for the individuals and for the \n        protection of the public health is the fact of infection, and \n        not just the later development of AIDS (the stage at which the \n        infection causes symptoms). The term ``HIV disease'', meaning \n        infection with HIV regardless of whether the infection has \n        progressed to AIDS, more correctly defines the medical \n        condition.\n            (2) The medical, public health, political, and community \n        leadership must focus on the full course of HIV disease rather \n        than concentrating on later stages of the disease. Continual \n        focus on AIDS rather than the entire spectrum of HIV disease \n        has left our Nation unable to deal adequately with the \n        epidemic. Federal and State data collection efforts should \n        focus on obtaining data as early as possible after infection \n        occurs, while continuing to collect data on the symptomatic \n        stage of the disease.\n            (3) Recent medical breakthroughs may enable doctors to \n        treat HIV disease as a chronic disease rather than as a \n        terminal disease. Early intervention in the progression of the \n        infection is imperative to prolonging and improving the lives \n        of individuals with the disease.\n            (4) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        recommended partner notification as a primary prevention \n        service. The health needs of the general public, and the care \n        and protection of those who do not have the disease, should be \n        balanced with the needs of individuals with the disease in a \n        manner that allows for the infected individuals to receive \n        optimal medical care and for public health services to protect \n        the uninfected.\n            (5) Individuals with HIV disease have an obligation to \n        protect others from being exposed to HIV by avoiding behaviors \n        that place others at risk of becoming infected. The States \n        should have in effect laws providing that intentionally \n        infecting others with HIV is a felony.\n\nSEC. 3.

For \n        purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of a State that \n        has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session is \n        deemed to be a separate regular session of the State \n        legislature.\n    (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) HIV.--The term ``HIV'' means the human immunodeficiency \n        virus.\n            (2) HIV disease.--The term ``HIV disease'' means infection \n        with HIV and includes any condition arising from such \n        infection.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services.\n    (e) Rule of Construction.--Part D of title XXVI of the Public \nHealth Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-71 et seq.) is amended by inserting \nafter section 2675 the following section:\n\n``SEC. 2675A.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INTENTIONAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the States should have in effect \nlaws providing that, in the case of an individual who knows that he or \nshe has HIV disease, it is a felony for the individual to infect \nanother with HIV if the individual engages in the behaviors involved \nwith the intent of so infecting the other individual.\n\nSEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that strict confidentiality should \nbe maintained in carrying out the provisions of section 3 of the this \nAct."
