PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to set a date certain for replacing the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 with a simple and fair alternative.\n\nSEC. 3. TERMINATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986.\n\n    (a) In General.--No tax shall be imposed by the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986--\n            (1) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2005; \n        and\n            (2) in the case of any tax not imposed on the basis of a \n        taxable year, on any taxable event or for any period after \n        December 31, 2005.\n    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to taxes imposed \nby--\n            (1) chapter 2 of such Code (relating to tax on self-\n        employment income);\n            (2) chapter 21 of such Code (relating to Federal Insurance \n        Contributions Act); and\n            (3) chapter 22 of such Code (relating to Railroad \n        Retirement Tax Act).\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TAX REFORM AND\n              SIMPLIFICATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex, \n        imposes significant burdens on individuals and businesses and \n        the economy, is extremely difficult for the Internal Revenue \n        Service to administer, and is in need of fundamental reform and \n        simplification.\n            (2) Many of the problems encountered by taxpayers in \n        dealing with the Internal Revenue Service could be eliminated \n        or alleviated by fundamental reform and simplification.\n            (3) The Federal Government's present fiscal outlook for \n        continuing and sustained budget surpluses provides a unique \n        opportunity for the Congress to consider measures for \n        fundamental reform and simplification of the tax laws.\n            (4) Recent efforts to simplify or reform the tax laws have \n        not been successful due in part to the difficulty of developing \n        broad-based, nonpartisan support for proposals to make such \n        changes.\n            (5) Many of the problems with the Internal Revenue Service \n        stem from the overly complex tax code the agency is asked to \n        administer.\n    (b) Establishment.--\n            (1) In general.--To carry out the purposes of this section, \n        there is established within the legislative branch a National \n        Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification (in this section \n        referred to as the ``Commission'').\n            (2) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of 15 \n        members, as follows:\n                    (A) Three members appointed by the President, two \n                from the executive branch of the Government and one \n                from private life.\n                    (B) Four members appointed by the majority leader \n                of the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and three \n                from private life.\n                    (C) Two members appointed by the minority leader of \n                the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from \n                private life.\n                    (D) Four members appointed by the Speaker of the \n                House of Representatives, one from Members of the House \n                and three from private life.\n                    (E) Two members appointed by the minority leader of \n                the House of Representatives, one from Members of the \n                House and one from private life.\n            (3) Chair.--The Commission shall elect a Chair (or two Co-\n        Chairs) from among its members.\n            (4) Meetings, quorums, vacancies.--After its initial \n        meeting, the Commission shall meet upon the call of the Chair \n(Co-Chairs, if elected) or a majority of its members. Nine members of \nthe Commission shall constitute a quorum.

Any meeting of the Commission \nor any subcommittee thereof may be held in executive session to the \nextent that the Chair (Co-Chairs, if elected) or a majority of the \nmembers of the Commission or subcommittee determine appropriate.\n            (5) Continuation of membership.--If--\n                    (A) any individual who appointed a member to the \n                Commission by virtue of holding a position described in \n                paragraph (2) ceases to hold such position before the \n                report of the Commission is submitted under subsection \n                (g); or\n                    (B) a member was appointed to the Commission as a \n                Member of Congress and the member ceases to be a Member \n                of Congress, or was appointed to the Commission because \n                the member was not an officer or employee of any \n                government and later becomes an officer or employee of \n                a government,\n        that member may continue as a member for not longer than the \n        30-day period beginning on the date that such individual ceases \n        to hold such position or such member ceases to be a Member of \n        Congress or becomes such an officer or employee, as the case \n        may be.\n            (6) Appointment;
