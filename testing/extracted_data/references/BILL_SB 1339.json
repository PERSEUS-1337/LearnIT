    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 10003 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:\n10003.\n(a) It shall be the responsibility of a recipient of aid pursuant to this division changing residence from one county to another to promptly notify either the county from which he or she moves or the county to which he or she moves of the change of residence. Recipients of CalWORKs, CalFresh, or Medi-Cal shall have the option to report a change of residence in person, in writing, telephonically, or, if the technology is available, electronically online and shall be advised of these options at the time of application and redetermination or recertification. Within seven business days of notice of a new residence, the notified county shall initiate an intercounty transfer for all benefits under this division that the recipient is receiving, and benefits shall be transferred no later than the first day of the next available benefit month following 30 days after a county was notified pursuant to this section.\n(b) To the greatest extent possible, the intercounty transfer process shall be simple and client friendly and minimize workload for county eligibility operations. The process shall ensure the applicant or recipient does not need to provide copies of documents that were previously provided to the prior county of residence, and there is no interruption in benefits.\n(c) Case file documents shall be electronically shared between the prior county of residence and the new county of residence, to the extent possible, as specified by the relevant state departments.\n(d) Notwithstanding Section 11052.5, the new county of residence shall not interview recipients moving to that county from another county to determine continued eligibility for CalFresh or CalWORKs until the next scheduled recertification pursuant to Section 18910.1 or redetermination pursuant to Section 11265. This section shall not preclude the new county of residence from interviewing CalWORKs recipients regarding welfare-to-work program participation, which is not a requirement for an intercounty transfer of CalWORKs eligibility.\n(e) For beneficiaries required to receive services through a Medi-Cal managed care health plan, the following shall apply:\n(1) If the beneficiary moves to another county and is still enrolled in a managed care health plan in the county from which he or she moved, the beneficiary shall have continued access to emergency services and any other coverage the managed care health plan authorizes out-of-network until the time that the intercounty transfer process pursuant to subdivision (a) is complete and the beneficiary is disenrolled from the managed care health plan.\n(2) If the beneficiary moves to another county and is still enrolled in a managed care health plan in the county from which he or she moved and needs nonemergent care that same month in the new county, the Medi-Cal Managed Care Ombudsman shall, upon request by the beneficiary or either county, disenroll the beneficiary as an expedited disenrollment from his or her managed care health plan. County-initiated disenrollment using an online form shall be processed no later than three business days after the request is made. Beneficiary-initiated disenrollment by telephone shall be effective no later than two business days after the request is made when the request is made before 5 p.m. Any beneficiary-initiated disenrollment request by phone made after 5 p.m. shall be processed the following business day and be effective no later than two business days after the request is processed.\n(3) A beneficiary who is disenrolled from the managed care health plan in the county from which he or she moved pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be entitled to the full scope of benefits for which he or she is entitled to in the new county through the fee-for-service delivery system until he or she is enrolled in a managed care health plan in the new county.\n(4) If the beneficiary moves to a county that provides Medi-Cal services through a county organized health system, the beneficiary shall be enrolled in that county organized health system plan on the first day of the following month once the new county of residence is reflected in the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System. If a beneficiary moves to a county without a county organized health system, the usual health plan choice process shall apply.\n(f) Failure to report a move to a different county within the state in itself shall not constitute a basis for an overpayment.\n(g) (1) Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services, without taking any further regulatory action, shall implement, interpret, or make specific this section by means of all-county letters, plan letters, plan or provider bulletins, or similar instructions until the time regulations are adopted. The State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services shall adopt regulations by July 1, 2021, in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.\n(2) Beginning June 1, 2017, and notwithstanding Section 10231.5 of the Government Code, the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services shall provide a status report on the adoption of the regulations to the Legislature on a semiannual basis, in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code, until regulations have been adopted.\n(h) This section shall be implemented only if, and to the extent, that federal financial participation is available and any necessary federal approvals have been obtained.\n(i) This section shall become operative on June 1, 2017.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 11052.6 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:\n11052.6.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the requirements of Section 11052.5 shall not apply to any caretaker relative when all of the following apply:\n(1) He or she is an approved relative pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 309 caring for a child who is a dependent child of the court, and is receiving benefits under the CalWORKs program on behalf of the child.\n(2) The caretaker relative is changing residence from one county to another county and is applying for benefits in the new county on behalf of one or more related children who are current recipients of benefits under the CalWORKS Program under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) of Part 3.\n(3) The caretaker relative is not an applicant for or a recipient of benefits under the CalWORKS Program.\n(b) If the caretaker relative subsequently applies for benefits under the CalWORKS Program, he or she shall be subject to the requirements of Section 11052.5 that are applicable to that program.\n(c) The county CalWORKs program shall verify that the individual applying for benefits meets the criteria set forth in this section.\n(d) This section shall become inoperative on June 1, 2017, and, as of January 1, 2018, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that becomes operative on or before January 1, 2018, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 11053 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:\n11053.\n(a) It shall be the responsibility of a recipient changing residence from one county to another within the state to promptly notify the county paying aid to the recipient of the move and to apply for a redetermination of eligibility within the new county of residence.

The county to which the recipient has moved will be responsible for determining the recipient\u2019s continued eligibility for payment of aid and, to the extent possible, as determined by the Director of Health Services, eligibility for the Medi-Cal program, as of the first day of the month following 30 days after the first county has notified the second county of the recipient\u2019s relocation. The first county shall provide the second county with copies of those documents, as specified by the department, necessary to establish current eligibility and grant amount.\n(b) This section shall become inoperative on June 1, 2017, and, as of January 1, 2018, is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that becomes operative on or before January 1, 2018, deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 11053.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:\n11053.2.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the department shall establish a process of intercounty transfer of eligibility for CalFresh benefits provided under Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 18900) of Part 6 when a recipient changes residence from one county to another within the state.

To the greatest extent possible, the process shall be simple, client friendly, ensure the client does not need to provide copies of documents that were previously provided to the prior county of residence, build on existing processes for the programs described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b), and minimize workload for county eligibility operations. The process developed pursuant to this subdivision shall be implemented no later than July 1, 2011.\n(d) Upon the implementation of the intercounty transfer procedures set forth in this section, it shall be the responsibility of a recipient changing residence from one county to another within the state to notify his or her prior county of residence of his or her move.
