PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide agricultural \nproducers in the United States, in cooperation with States and local \ngovernments, financially competitive options for maintaining prime, \nunique, and other strategic farmland in agricultural production.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Prime, unique, and other farmland that has strategic \n        importance because of its exceptional agricultural, economic, \n        or environmental contribution to society is being converted to \n        nonagricultural uses because agricultural producers and other \n        owners of such lands lack financially competitive options for \n        retaining it in agricultural production.\n            (2) States and local governments have been unable to \n        provide sufficient incentives to landowners to maintain prime, \n        unique, and other strategic farmland in agricultural \n        production.\n            (3) Federal assistance is needed to achieve the national \n        interest in protecting prime, unique, and other strategic \n        farmlands.\n\nSEC. 3.
