FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act makes \n        health care more expensive and less accessible, while also \n        driving up the Federal deficit and debt.\n            (2) This increase in cost is most noticeable in the health \n        insurance exchanges established under such Act, which would \n        increase the Federal deficit by $1.017 trillion over an eleven-\n        year timeframe, as stated in a July, 2012 Congressional Budget \n        Office report.\n            (3) The Federal mandate to establish health insurance \n        exchanges directly assaults the States' traditional authority \n        to regulate health insurance.\n            (4) Such Federal mandate imposes unknown insurance costs on \n        consumers and administrative costs on States.\n            (5) Such Federal mandate imposes a ``one-size-fits-all'' \n        approach that ignores State differences.\n            (6) Such Federal mandate undermines choice and competition \n        and guarantees further consolidation of the health insurance \n        markets.\n\nSEC. 3.
