FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the strategic interests of the United States would be \n        served by a reduction in the Nation's dependence upon imported \n        oil to produce transportation fuels and other products vital to \n        both the domestic economy and national security;\n            (2) this goal would be served by the development of a \n        viable, commercially competitive synthetic fuels industry \n        reliant upon domestic coals and other plentiful, nontraditional \n        carbonaceous feedstocks; and\n            (3) temporary financial incentives are required to foster \n        private investment in the technology, design, construction, and \n        operation of strategic facilities capable of producing \n        synthetic fuels on a commercial scale.\n\nSEC. 3.
