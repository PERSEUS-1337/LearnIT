FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) reductions of atmospheric sulfur dioxide and nitrogen \n        oxide from utility plants, in addition to the reductions \n        required under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), are \n        needed to reduce acid deposition and its serious adverse \n        effects on public health, natural resources, building \n        structures, sensitive ecosystems, and visibility;\n            (2) sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide contribute to the \n        development of fine particulates, suspected of causing human \n        mortality and morbidity to a significant extent;\n            (3) regional nitrogen oxide reductions of 75 percent in the \n        Eastern United States, in addition to the reductions required \n        under the Clean Air Act, may be necessary to protect sensitive \n        watersheds from the effects of nitrogen deposition;\n            (4) since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were \n        enacted, some acidic lakes in the Adirondacks in the State of \n        New York have started to slowly show chemical recovery from \n        acid rain, demonstrating that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide \n        regulations can be implemented in a cost-effective manner, but \n        the recovery is progressing at a slower rate than originally \n        intended;\n            (5) nitrogen oxide is highly mobile and can lead to ozone \n        formation hundreds of miles from the emitting source;\n            (6) on March 10, 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency \n        (EPA) issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to require \n        additional reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in \n        28 Eastern States and the District of Columbia;\n            (7) these reductions represent approximately a 70 percent \n        reduction in sulfur dioxide and a 60 percent reduction in \n        nitrogen oxide in the affected States;\n            (8) on July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals \n        for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated CAIR and on \n        December 23, 2008, the same court remanded the rule back to the \n        EPA without vacature;\n            (9) fossil fuel-fired electric generating units emit \n        approximately \\1/3\\ of the total mercury emissions in the \n        United States;\n            (10) mercury is considered a neurotoxin which can \n        bioaccumulate as it moves its way up the food chain and is \n        especially harmful to young children and developing fetuses;\n            (11) according to the EPA, there were 3,080 fish advisories \n        for mercury in 2006; there are over 90 fish advisories for \n        mercury in New York alone, with blanket warning for the \n        Adirondack and Catskill Mountains;\n            (12) on March 15, 2005, EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury \n        Rule (CAMR), which for the first time sought to regulate \n        mercury emissions from power plants, but used a less \n        restrictive cap-and-trade approach for this very harmful \n        substance and would take a full decade to implement;\n            (13) on February 8, 2008, the United States Court of \n        Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated CAMR; and\n            (14) on February 23, 2009, the Supreme Court denied a \n        request to reconsider the decision.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to recognize the current scientific understanding that \n        emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, and the acid \n        deposition resulting from emissions of sulfur dioxide and \n        nitrogen oxide, present a substantial human health and \n        environmental risk;\n            (2) to require reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen \n        oxide emissions;\n            (3) to support the efforts of existing acid rain and \n        mercury monitoring programs located throughout the country;\n            (4) to reduce utility emissions of nitrogen oxide by 75 \n        percent from 1997 levels;\n            (5) to reduce utility emissions of sulfur dioxide by 75 \n        percent after the implementation of phase II sulfur dioxide \n        requirements under section 405 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7651d); and\n            (6) to adopt a strict standard for mercury emissions by \n        power plants of 0.6 pounds per trillion Btu without allowing \n        for a cap-and-trade system.\n\nSEC. 3.
