    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer and Small Business Energy \nCommission Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there have been several sharp increases since 1990 in \n        the price of electricity, gasoline, home heating oil, natural \n        gas, and propane in the United States;\n            (2) recent examples of such increases include--\n                    (A) unusually high gasoline prices that are at \n                least partly attributable to global politics;\n                    (B) electricity price spikes during the California \n                energy crisis of 2001; and\n                    (C) the Midwest gasoline price spikes in spring \n                2001;\n            (3) shifts in energy regulation, including the allowance of \n        greater flexibility in competition and trading, have affected \n        price stability and consumers in ways that are not fully \n        understood;\n            (4) price spikes undermine the ability of low-income \n        families, the elderly, and small businesses (including farmers \n        and other agricultural producers) to afford essential energy \n        services and products;\n            (5) energy price spikes can exacerbate a weak economy by \n        creating uncertainties that discourage investment, growth, and \n        other activities that contribute to a strong economy;\n            (6) the Department of Energy has determined that the \n        economy would be likely to perform better with stable or \n        predictable energy prices;\n            (7) price spikes can be caused by many factors, including \n        insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery capacity \n        limits, insufficient infrastructure, over-regulation or under-\n        regulation, flawed deregulation, excessive consumption, over-\n        reliance on foreign supplies, insufficient research and \n        development of alternative energy sources, opportunistic \n        behavior by energy companies, and abuses of market power;\n            (8) consumers and small businesses have few options other \n        than to pay higher energy costs when prices spike, resulting in \n        reduced investment and slower economic growth and job creation;\n            (9) the effect of price spikes, and possible responses to \n        price spikes, on consumers and small businesses should be \n        examined; and\n            (10) studies have examined price spikes of specific energy \n        products in specific contexts or for specific reasons, but no \n        study has examined price spikes comprehensively with a focus on \n        the impacts on consumers and small businesses.\n\nSEC. 3.
