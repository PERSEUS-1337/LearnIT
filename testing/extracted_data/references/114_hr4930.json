Whenever the \n        United States intends to use such information against an \n        aggrieved person, it shall provide an in camera and ex parte \n        notice to the court concerning such use.\n            (7) Whenever the court of appeals receives a notice \n        pursuant to subsection (d)(6), the court shall review, in \n        camera and ex parte, the application, order, and any other \n        materials that may be submitted by the United States.\n            (8) If the court determines that the order was not lawfully \n        authorized, or the information was not obtained in conformity \n        with the order, it shall exclude such information from \n        consideration as part of the administrative record.\n            (9) Any classified information, sensitive security \n        information, law enforcement sensitive information, or \n        information that is otherwise privileged or subject to \n        statutory protections, that is part of the administrative \n        record, or cited by the court in any decision, shall be treated \n        by the court and the parties consistent with the provisions of \n        this subsection, and shall remain under seal and preserved in \n        the records of the court to be made available in the event of \n        further proceedings. In no event shall such information be \n        released as part of the public record.\n            (10) After the expiration of the time to seek further \n        review, or the conclusion of further proceedings, the court \n        shall return the administrative record, including any and all \n        copies, to the United States. All privileged information or \n        other information in the possession of petitioner's counsel \n        that was provided by the United States pursuant to a protective \n        order shall be returned to the United States, or the \n        petitioner's counsel shall certify its destruction, including \n        any and all copies.\n    (e) Scope of Review.--The court of appeals shall decide any \npetition for review filed under subsection (c) based solely on the \nadministrative record submitted by the United States, including any \ninformation which may have been filed with the court in camera and ex \nparte, and any information submitted by the petitioner during the \nadministrative redress process established by section 44903, 44909, or \n44926 of title 49, United States Code. The court shall uphold a final \ndecision issued pursuant to the administrative redress process by the \nTransportation Security Administration unless such decision was--\n            (1) arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n        otherwise not in accordance with law;\n            (2) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \n        immunity;\n            (3) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \n        limitation, or short of statutory right;\n            (4) lacking substantial support in the administrative \n        record taken as a whole, including in the classified \n        information submitted to the court; or\n            (5) not in accord with procedures required by law.\n    (f) Supreme Court Review.--A decision by the court of appeals under \nthis section may be reviewed by the Supreme Court under section 1254 of \ntitle 28, United States Code.\n    (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued as limiting, superseding, or preventing the invocation of, \nany privileges or defenses that are otherwise available at law or in \nequity to protect against the disclosure of information.\n\nSEC. 3.
