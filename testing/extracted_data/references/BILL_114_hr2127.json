FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (Public \n        Law 107-71) authorized the Transportation Security \n        Administration to ``establish requirements to implement trusted \n        passenger programs and use available technologies to expedite \n        the security screening of passengers who participate in such \n        programs, thereby allowing security screening personnel to \n        focus on those passengers who should be subject to more \n        extensive screening.''.\n            (2) In October 2011, the Transportation Security \n        Administration began piloting the PreCheck program in which a \n        limited number of passengers who were participants in the \n        frequent flyer programs of domestic air carriers were directed \n        to special screening lanes for expedited security screening.\n            (3) In December 2013, the Transportation Security \n        Administration opened the PreCheck program to eligible \n        passengers who submit biographic and biometric information for \n        a security risk assessment.\n            (4) Today, expedited security screening is provided to \n        passengers who, in general, are members of populations \n        identified by the Administrator of the Transportation Security \n        Administration as presenting a low risk to aviation security, \n        including members of populations known and vetted by the \n        Administrator or through another Department of Homeland \n        Security trusted traveler program, and to passengers who are \n        selected by expedited screening on a case-by-case basis through \n        the Transportation Security Administration's Managed Inclusion \n        process and other procedures.\n            (5) According to the Transportation Security \n        Administration, the Managed Inclusion process ``combines the \n        use of multiple layers of security to indirectly conduct a \n        real-time assessment of passengers'' through the use of \n        Passenger Screening Canine teams, Behavior Detection Officers, \n        Explosives Trace Detection (ETD) machines, and other \n        activities.\n            (6) In December 2014, the Comptroller General of the United \n        States concluded in a report entitled ``Rapid Growth in \n        Expedited Passenger Screening Highlights Need to Plan Effective \n        Security Assessments'' that ``it will be important for TSA to \n        evaluate the security effectiveness of the Managed Inclusion \n        process as a whole, to ensure that it is functioning as \n        intended and that passengers are being screened at a level \n        commensurate with their risk''.\n            (7) On March 16, 2015, the Inspector General of the \n        Department of Homeland Security released a report entitled \n        ``Allegation of Granting Expedited Screening through TSA \n        PreCheck Improperly'', in which the Inspector General \n        determined that the Transportation Security Administration \n        granted expedited security screening at a PreCheck security \n        lane to a passenger who had served time in prison for felonies \n        committed as a member of a domestic terrorist group and who was \n        not a participant in the PreCheck program.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION; PRECHECK OPERATIONS MAINTAINED; ALTERNATE METHODS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (d), not later \nthan 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \nAdministrator of the Transportation Security Administration shall \ndirect that access to expedited airport security screening at an \nairport security checkpoint be limited to only the following:\n            (1) A passenger who voluntarily submits biographic and \n        biometric information for a security risk assessment and whose \n        application for the PreCheck program has been approved, or a \n        passenger who is a participant in another trusted or registered \n        traveler program of the Department of Homeland Security.\n            (2) A passenger traveling pursuant to section 44903 of \n        title 49, United States Code (as established under the Risk-\n        Based Security for Members of the Armed Forces Act (Public Law \n        112-86)), section 44927 of such title (as established under the \n        Helping Heroes Fly Act (Public Law 113-27)), or section 44928 \n        of such title (as established under the Honor Flight Act \n        (Public Law 113-221)).\n            (3) A passenger who did not voluntarily submit biographic \n        and biometric information for a security risk assessment but is \n        a member of a population designated by the Administrator of the \n        Transportation Security Administration as known and low-risk \n        and who may be issued a unique, known traveler number by the \n        Administrator determining that such passenger is a member of a \n        category of travelers designated by the Administrator as known \n        and low-risk.\n    (b) PreCheck Operations Maintained.--In carrying out subsection \n(a), the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration \nshall ensure that expedited airport security screening remains \navailable to passengers at or above the level that exists on the day \nbefore the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Minors and Seniors.--The Administrator of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration may provide access to expedited airport \nsecurity screening at an airport security checkpoint to a passenger who \nis--\n            (1) 75 years old or older; or\n            (2) 12 years old or under and who is traveling with a \n        parent or guardian who is a participant in the PreCheck \n        program.\n    (d) Frequent Fliers.--If the Administrator of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration determines that such is appropriate, the date \nspecified in subsection (a) may be extended by up to 1 year to \nimplement such subsection with respect to the population of passengers \nwho did not voluntarily submit biographic and biometric information for \nsecurity risk assessments but who nevertheless receive expedited \nairport security screening because such passengers are designated as \nfrequent fliers by air carriers. If the Administrator uses the \nauthority provided by this subsection, the Administrator shall notify \nthe Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate of \nsuch phased-in implementation.\n    (e) Alternate Methods.--The Administrator of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration may provide access to expedited airport \nsecurity screening to additional passengers pursuant to an alternate \nmethod upon the submission to the Committee on Homeland Security of the \nHouse of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation of the Senate of an independent assessment of the \nsecurity effectiveness of such alternate method that is conducted by an \nindependent entity that determines that such alternate method is \ndesigned to--\n            (1) reliably and effectively identify passengers who likely \n        pose a low risk to the United States aviation system;\n            (2) mitigate the likelihood that a passenger who may pose a \n        security threat to the United States aviation system is \n        selected for expedited security screening; and\n            (3) address known and evolving security risks to the United \n        States aviation system.\n    (f) Information Sharing.--The Administrator of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration shall provide to the entity conducting the \nindependent assessment under subsection (c) effectiveness testing \nresults that are consistent with established evaluation design \npractices, as identified by the Comptroller General of the United \nStates.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORTING.\n\n    Not later than 3 months after the date of the enactment of this Act \nand annually thereafter, the Administrator of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration shall report to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation of the Senate on the percentage of all \npassengers who are provided expedited security screening, and of such \npassengers so provided, the percentage who are participants in the \nPreCheck program (who have voluntarily submitted biographic and \nbiometric information for security risk assessments), the percentage \nwho are participants in another trusted traveler program of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the percentage who are participants in \nthe PreCheck program due to the Administrator's issuance of known \ntraveler numbers, and for the remaining percentage of passengers \ngranted access to expedited security screening in PreCheck security \nlanes, information on the percentages attributable to each alternative \nmethod utilized by the Transportation Security Administration to direct \npassengers to expedited airport security screening at PreCheck security \nlanes.\n\nSEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    Nothing in this Act may be construed to--\n            (1) authorize or direct the Administrator of the \n        Transportation Administration to reduce or limit the \n        availability of expedited security screening at an airport; or\n            (2) limit the authority of the Administrator to use \n        technologies and systems, including passenger screening canines \n        and explosives trace detection, as a part of security screening \n        operations.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives July 27, 2015.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
