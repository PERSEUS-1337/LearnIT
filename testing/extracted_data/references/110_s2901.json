    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Encouraging Mortgage Modifications \nAct of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) mortgage modifications often afford the best \n        opportunity to avoid foreclosures and provide long term, \n        sustainable solutions for American homeowners;\n            (2) reaching mortgage modification agreements with \n        homeowners has been unacceptably slow and foreclosure rates \n        continue to rise, with the number of homeowners forced into \n        foreclosure double the number who receive modifications or \n        repayment plans;\n            (3) servicers have an obligation to protect the interests \n        of investors when determining whether to offer a modification \n        or repayment plan;\n            (4) the best course of action for the investor pool as a \n        whole may disadvantage the interests of individual classes of \n        investors;\n            (5) servicers have expressed concern that investor classes \n        that are disproportionately disadvantaged by a modification or \n        repayment plan may seek to hold the servicer liable;\n            (6) without liability protection, many servicers will not \n        be willing to take on the risk associated with approving a \n        mortgage modification or repayment plan, and instead, they will \n        eventually pursue foreclosure even though foreclosure costs can \n        equal 50 percent or more of mortgage value; and\n            (7) the net present value of a modified mortgage loan will \n        almost always exceed the amount recouped by allowing the home \n        to go into foreclosure.\n\nSEC. 3. LEGAL SAFE HARBOR FOR ENTERING INTO CERTAIN LOAN MODIFICATIONS \n              OR WORKOUT PLANS.\n\n    Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 \nU.S.C. 2605) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (i) and (j) as subsections \n        (j) and (k), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (h) the following:\n    ``(i) Duty of Servicers Regarding Certain Loan Modifications or \nWorkout Plans.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n        law, absent specific contractual provisions to the contrary, a \n        servicer of pooled qualified residential mortgages--\n                    ``(A) owes any duty to determine if the net present \n                value of the payments on the loan, as modified, is \n                likely to be greater than the anticipated net recovery \n                that would result from foreclosure to all investors and \n                parties having a direct or indirect interest in the \n                pooled loans or securitization vehicle, but not to any \n                individual party or group of parties; and\n                    ``(B) acts in the best interests of all such \n                investors and parties, if the servicer agrees to or \n                implements a qualified loan modification or workout \n                plan for a qualified residential mortgage, or if, and \n                only if, such efforts are unsuccessful or infeasible, \n                takes other reasonable loss mitigation actions, \n                including accepting partial payments or short sale of \n                the property;
