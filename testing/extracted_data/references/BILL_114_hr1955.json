FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) ineffective wastewater treatment is one of the most \n        common sources of water pollution;\n            (2) nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading, \n        continues to be one of the most significant water quality \n        issues facing the Great Lakes System;\n            (3) limiting phosphorus loads is key to controlling \n        excessive algal growth, and a coordinated Great Lakes System-\n        wide strategy to change how nutrients are discharged is urgent; \n        and\n            (4) nutrient removal technology is one of the most \n        reliable, cost effective, and direct methods for reducing the \n        flow of phosphorus and other harmful nutrients from point \n        sources in the Great Lakes System.\n\nSEC. 3.
