FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Type 2 Diabetes affects 17,000,000 Americans, with over \n        1,000,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Type 1 Diabetes \n        affects over 1,000,000 Americans, with over 13,000 new cases \n        diagnosed each year. Diabetes costs the nation an estimated \n        $138,000,000,000 per year.\n            (2) Diabetic retinopathy is the most common complication \n        resulting from diabetes, and causes degradation in visual \n        acuity and eventual blindness. Diabetic retinopathy is the \n        leading cause of blindness in people aged 20 to 74, and up to \n        24,000 diabetics become legally blind each year.\n            (3) During the first two decades of disease, nearly all \n        patients with Type 1 and over 60 percent of patients with Type \n        2 Diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy, and the risk of \n        diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes. \n        Onset of Type 2 diabetes is today occurring at younger ages, \n        which will increase the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in \n        the future.\n            (4) Clinical trials have demonstrated that early detection \n        and treatment of diabetic retinopathy can reduce vision loss by \n        90 percent, and remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy has \n        the potential to reach large numbers of diabetic patients who \n        live in rural, remote or underserved areas and who lack \n        geographical or financial access to regular, in-office eye \n        examinations by eye specialists.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE COVERAGE OF REMOTE ASSESSMENT OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY.\n\n    (a) Coverage.--Section 1861 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395x) is amended:\n            (1) in subsection (s)(2)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (Y), by striking ``and'' at the \n                end;\n                    (B) in subparagraph (Z), by adding ``and'' at the \n                end; and\n                    (C) by inserting after subparagraph (Z) the \n                following new subparagraph:\n            ``(AA) remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy (as \n        defined in subsection (bbb));''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n\n              ``Remote Assessment of Diabetic Retinopathy\n\n    ``(bbb) The term `remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' means \na diagnostic examination of the retina for the purpose of early \ndetection of diabetic retinopathy that--\n            ``(1) is provided not more frequently than on an annual \n        basis to an individual who has been diagnosed with diabetes;\n            ``(2) meets technical standards set forth by the Secretary \n        (which shall be determined in consultation with industry and \n        practitioner groups with expertise in ophthalmology, ophthalmic \n        imaging, telemedicine, or related fields);\n            ``(3) is furnished via a telecommunications system by a \n        physician (as defined in subsection (r)), a practitioner \n        (described in section 1842(b)(18)(C) of this title), or a non-\n        physician technician deemed to be qualified by the Secretary \n        under the regulations promulgated pursuant to this Act, to an \n        eligible patient enrolled under this part, notwithstanding that \n        the individual physician or practitioner providing the service \n        is not at the same location as the beneficiary;

and\n            (B) whether the study under paragraph (1) should be \n        repeated, and if so, how frequently.\n    (e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \napply to assessments performed on or after the date that is 30 days \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4 MEDICAID COVERAGE OF REMOTE ASSESSMENT OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--Section 1905(a)(13) of the Social Security Act \n(42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(13)) is amended by inserting ``remote assessment of \ndiabetic retinopathy (as defined in section 1861(bbb)),'' after \n``including''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply to assessments performed on or after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act.\n    (c) State Compliance.--In the case of a State plan for medical \nassistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act which the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services determines requires State \nlegislation (other than legislation authorizing or appropriating funds) \nin order for the plan to meet the additional requirement imposed by the \namendments made by subsection (a), the State plan shall not be regarded \nas failing to comply with the requirements of such title solely on the \nbasis of its failure to meet this additional requirement before the \nfirst day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of \nthe first regular session of the State legislature that begins after \nthe date of the enactment of this Act.
