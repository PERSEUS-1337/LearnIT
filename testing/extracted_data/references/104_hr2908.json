DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The terms ``salmonid'' means a specie in the family \n        salmonidae, including each specie of salmon and trout.\n            (2) The term ``domesticated'', with respect to salmonids, \n        means salmonids raised on a farm for profit and held throughout \n        their life-cycle in captivity.\n            (3) The term ``broodstock'' means domesticated salmonids \n        intended to be used for reproductive purposes.\n            (4) The term ``seedstock'' means gametes (egg and sperm) \n        and fertilized (eyed) eggs produced from domesticated salmonid \n        broodstock.\n            (5) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) United States breeders of domesticated salmonids raise \n        broodstock and produce seedstock which are essential to the \n        production of domesticated salmonids in the United States and \n        throughout the world;\n            (2) the production and dissemination in interstate commerce \n        of salmonid broodstock and seedstock provides employment and \n        income in economically depressed rural areas and contributes to \n        the expansion of United States exports;\n            (3) various foreign nations, including the members of the \n        European Union, have adopted requirements that salmonid \n        seedstock imported from the United States and other nations be \n        inspected and certified by a competent authority prior to \n        export;\n            (4) existing Federal and State programs for the inspection \n        and certification of the health status of salmonid broodstock \n        and seedstock are inadequate and inconsistent;\n            (5) the efficient and effective inspection and \n        certification of salmonid breeding facilities, broodstock, and \n        seedstock is essential to the economic well-being of the \n        domesticated salmonid broodstock and seedstock industry in the \n        United States; and\n            (6) the Secretary of Agriculture currently provides \n        inspection and certification services to the livestock and live \n        poultry industries and has the technical expertise and capacity \n        necessary to administer a program to provide similar services \n        to the United States domesticated salmonid broodstock and \n        seedstock industry.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to designate the Secretary of Agriculture as the single \n        competent authority for the health inspection and certification \n        of salmonid broodstock and seedstock used to produce \n        domesticated salmonids;\n            (2) to promote fair trade and interstate commerce in \n        salmonid broodstock and seedstock produced in the United \n        States, which is used to produce domesticated salmonids; and\n            (3) to reduce the risk of transmission in interstate \n        commerce of diseases, pathogens and pests in domesticated \n        salmonid broodstock and seedstock to the extent practicable.\n\nSEC. 4.
