    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 44272 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n44272.\n(a) The Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program is hereby created. The program shall be administered by the commission. The commission shall implement the program by regulation pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. The program shall provide, upon appropriation by the Legislature, competitive grants, revolving loans, loan guarantees, loans, or other appropriate funding measures, to public agencies, vehicle and technology entities, businesses and projects, public-private partnerships, workforce training partnerships and collaboratives, fleet owners, consumers, recreational boaters, and academic institutions to develop and deploy innovative technologies that transform California\u2019s fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state\u2019s climate change policies. The emphasis of this program shall be to develop and deploy technology and alternative and renewable fuels in the marketplace, without adopting any one preferred fuel or technology.\n(b) A project that receives more than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) in funds from the commission shall be approved at a noticed public meeting of the commission and shall be consistent with the priorities established by the investment plan adopted pursuant to Section 44272.5. Under this article, the commission may delegate to the commission\u2019s executive director, or his or her designee, the authority to approve either of the following:\n(1) A contract, grant, loan, or other agreement or award that receives seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) or less in funds from the commission.\n(2) Amendments to a contract, grant, loan, or other agreement or award as long as the amendments do not increase the amount of the award, change the scope of the project, or modify the purpose of the agreement.\n(c) The commission shall provide preferences to those projects that maximize the goals of the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program, based on the following criteria, as applicable:\n(1) The project\u2019s ability to provide a measurable transition from the nearly exclusive use of petroleum fuels to a diverse portfolio of viable alternative fuels that meet petroleum reduction and alternative fuel use goals.\n(2) The project\u2019s consistency with existing and future state climate change policy and low-carbon fuel standards.\n(3) The project\u2019s ability to reduce criteria air pollutants and air toxics and reduce or avoid multimedia environmental impacts.\n(4) The project\u2019s ability to decrease, on a life-cycle basis, the discharge of water pollutants or any other substances known to damage human health or the environment, in comparison to the production and use of California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline or diesel fuel produced and sold pursuant to California diesel fuel regulations set forth in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2280) of Chapter 5 of Division 3 of Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations.\n(5) The project does not adversely impact the sustainability of the state\u2019s natural resources, especially state and federal lands.\n(6) The project provides nonstate matching funds. Costs incurred from the date a proposed award is noticed may be counted as nonstate matching funds. The commission may adopt further requirements for the purposes of this paragraph.
