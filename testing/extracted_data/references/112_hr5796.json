FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1979, agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran stormed \n        the United States Embassy in Tehran, taking American military \n        and diplomatic personnel hostage.\n            (2) The Iranian Government then held United States Embassy \n        personnel as hostages for 444 days, subjecting them to profound \n        physical and mental abuse, and forcing the United States to \n        negotiate their release, under duress.\n            (3) In the resultant agreement (commonly known as the \n        Algiers Accords) the United States agreed, among other steps, \n        to bar and preclude the hostages from prosecuting any claim \n        against Iran in United States courts.\n            (4) The Algiers Accords were never submitted to Congress \n        for ratification and none of the hostages or their family \n        members was consulted by the United States Government or \n        consented to these provisions precluding prosecution of their \n        claims.\n            (5) Notwithstanding the applicability of legal principles \n        which allowed the United States to renounce this obligation to \n        bar and preclude the prosecution of claims in United States \n        courts because they were so clearly negotiated under duress, \n        the United States Government has repeatedly intervened in \n        United States courts to preclude the prosecution of any claim \n        by the hostages against Iran, arguing that, in its opinion, \n        compliance with this agreement served overriding national \n        security interests which justified the taking of the hostages' \n        right to pursue compensation from Iran in United States courts.\n            (6) The United States Government has failed to propose any \n        process by which the hostages and their family members could be \n        compensated for the injuries and damages suffered by them by \n        reason of the horrific and heinous treatment while in \n        captivity.\n            (7) Congress has determined that the provision of \n        compensation to the hostages and their families through, among \n        other sources, funds obtained by vesting and liquidating \n        property in which Iran and its surrogates claim an interest \n        (including any funds held by the United States, including in \n        trust) is fully consistent with the Algiers Accords.\n            (8) Congress has determined that, only upon the payment of \n        such compensation, should the agreement by the United States \n        Government to bar and preclude prosecution of such claims in \n        United States courts be confirmed and ratified by legislation, \n        notwithstanding the duress under which the United States \n        originally negotiated that agreement.\n\nSEC. 3.
