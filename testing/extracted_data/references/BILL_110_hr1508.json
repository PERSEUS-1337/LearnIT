INTERNAL CONTROL REPORTING AND EVALUATION.\n\n    Subsection (b) of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 \nU.S.C. 7262(b)) is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(b) Internal Control Reporting and Evaluation.--\n            ``(1) Auditor attestation and report.--With respect to the \n        internal control assessment required by subsection (a), each \n        registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues the \n        audit report for the issuer shall, at the interval determined \n        under paragraph (2), attest to, and report on, the assessment \n        made by the management of the issue. The attestation and report \n        on the management assessment shall focus on the process and \n        system management used to identify and manage risks, identify \n        and implement key controls, and come to a conclusion on the \n        effectiveness of the internal controls over financial \n        reporting. Such attestation and report shall not include a \n        separate opinion on the outcome of the assessment, that is, the \n        auditor shall not issue a separate (pass/fail) opinion on the \n        effectiveness of management's internal controls over financial \n        reporting. Any such attestation shall not be the subject of a \n        separate engagement.\n            ``(2) Intervals for attestation and report.--The \n        Commission's regulations under this section shall require that \n        the attestation and report required by paragraph (1) be \n        performed during an initial reporting period, and then at 3-\n        year intervals. Such regulations shall require a shorter \n        interval in the event of a major shift in the company's \n        structure or performance, such as a merger, a significant \n        financial restatement, evidence of fraud, or other such events \n        as determined by the Commission.\n            ``(3) Standards for attestation and report.--\n                    ``(A) Risk-based evaluation.--An attestation made \n                under this subsection shall be made in accordance with \n                standards for attestation engagements issued or adopted \n                by the Board. Such standards shall require that the \n                audit of the management assessment of the internal \n                control of the issuer shall be designed, on the basis \n                of the probability of risk and magnitude of potential \n                harm, to focus on those controls that are critical to \n                the accuracy of the financial statements of the issuer, \n                and be consistent with the materiality standards \n                prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (4). Such \n                standards shall require that the determination by the \n                auditor of the controls that create the greatest risk \n                to the company shall be done in consultation with \n                management of the issuer and shall identify those \n                greatest risks on bases of the characteristics of the \n                industry within which the issuer operates.\n                    ``(B) Reliance on the work of others.--The \n                standards issued or adopted by the Board for purposes \n                of implementing the requirements of this subsection \n                shall eliminate duplication of audits and examinations \n                by--\n                            ``(i) allowing registered public accounting \n                        firms performing attestations and reports under \n                        this subsection to rely on examinations and \n                        inspections conducted by the Federal and state \n                        regulatory agencies to the extent those \n                        examinations and inspections focus on the \n                        issuer's risk-based internal controls;\n                            ``(ii) where the issuer has engaged a \n                        third-party accountant to test and provide \n                        management's assessment of the internal control \n                        systems, permitting--\n                                    ``(I) the third-party accountant to \n                                work with registered public accounting \n                                firms performing attestations and \n                                reports under this subsection on \n                                determining the controls to be tested \n                                and the scope of work;\n                                    ``(II) the registered public \n                                accounting firms performing \n                                attestations and reports under this \n                                subsection to rely heavily on the work \n                                of the third-party accountant during \n                                the attestation engagement to avoid \n                                repetitive testing; and\n                                    ``(III) management of the issuer to \n                                communicate openly with the registered \n                                public accounting firms performing \n                                attestations and reports under this \n                                subsection on all aspects of its \n                                internal controls.\n                    ``(C) Definition.--For purposes of subparagraph \n                (B)(ii), the term `third-party accountant' means a \n                registered public accounting firm other than the \n                registered public accounting firm that is engaged to \n                perform the attestation and report under this \n                subsection.\n            ``(4) Materiality standard.--The Commission shall develop a \n        standard of materiality for the conduct of the assessment and \n        report on an internal control under this subsection that shall \n        be based on whether the internal control has a material affect \n        on the company's financial statements and is significant to the \n        issuer's overall financial status.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
