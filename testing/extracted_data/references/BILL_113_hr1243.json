FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the National Science Board's 2010 Science \n        and Engineering Indicators, only 5 percent of American college \n        graduates major in engineering. In Asia, about 20 percent of \n        all baccalaureate degrees are in engineering and in China about \n        33 percent of baccalaureate degrees are in engineering.\n            (2) Although 4th graders in the United States score well \n        against international competition, students in the United \n        States fall near the bottom or dead last by 12th grade in \n        mathematics and science, respectively.\n            (3) Admissions requirements for undergraduate engineering \n        schools include a solid background in mathematics (algebra, \n        geometry, trigonometry, and calculus) and science (biology, \n        chemistry, and physics), in addition to courses in English, \n        social studies, and humanities.\n            (4) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, overall \n        engineering employment is expected to grow by 11 percent from \n        2008 through 2018, and, as a group, engineers earn some of the \n        highest average starting salaries among individuals holding \n        baccalaureate degrees.\n            (5) According to the Department of Labor, engineers should \n        be creative, inquisitive, analytical, and detail-oriented. \n        Engineers should be able to work as part of a team and to \n        communicate well, both orally and in writing. Communication \n        abilities are becoming increasingly important as engineers \n        interact more frequently with specialists in a wide range of \n        fields outside engineering.\n            (6) Exposure to project- and problem-based learning, in a \n        competitive team environment, gives 9th through 12th graders \n        the skills that they need to be successful in engineering \n        programs of study and engineering careers.\n            (7) According to Brandeis University's Center for Youth and \n        Communities, participants in FIRST Robotics (a nonprofit \n        organization that inspires young people to be science and \n        technology leaders by engaging the young people in mentor-based \n        programs)--\n                    (A) are more likely than nonparticipants to attend \n                an institution of higher education on a full-time basis \n                (88 percent versus 53 percent);\n                    (B) are nearly 2 times as likely to major in a \n                science or engineering field; and\n                    (C) are more than 3 times as likely to have majored \n                specifically in engineering.\n\nSEC. 3.
