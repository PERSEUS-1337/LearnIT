    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Interstate Horseracing Improvement \nAct of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress enacted the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 \n        (15 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) to regulate interstate commerce with \n        respect to parimutuel wagering on horseracing in order to \n        protect and further the horseracing industry of the United \n        States.\n            (2) The horseracing industry represents approximately \n        $40,000,000,000 to the United States economy annually and \n        generates nearly 400,000 domestic jobs.\n            (3) The use of performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing \n        adversely affects interstate commerce, creates unfair \n        competition, deceives horse buyers and the wagering public, \n        weakens the breed of the American Thoroughbred, is detrimental \n        to international sales of the American Thoroughbred, and \n        threatens the safety and welfare of horses and jockeys.\n            (4) The use of performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing \n        is widespread in the United States, where no uniform \n        regulations exist with respect to the use of, and testing for, \n        performance-enhancing drugs in interstate horseracing.\n            (5) The use of performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing \n        is not permitted in most jurisdictions outside the United \n        States. In the internationally competitive sport of \n        horseracing, the United States stands alone in its permissive \n        use of performance-enhancing drugs.\n            (6) The use of performance-enhancing drugs is illegal in \n        the United States in every sport other than horseracing.\n            (7) To protect and further the horseracing industry of the \n        United States, it is necessary to prohibit the use of \n        performance-enhancing drugs in interstate horseracing.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS ON USE OF PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. \n3001 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating section 9 as section 11; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 8 the following:\n\n``SEC. 9.
