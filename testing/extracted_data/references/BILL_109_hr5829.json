FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) A fundamental principle of American democracy is that \n        individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and \n        fight for justice.\n            (2) The actions of those who participated in the Civil \n        Rights movement from the 1950's through the 1960's are a \n        shining example of this principle in action, demonstrated in \n        events as varied as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins, \n        the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the drive for \n        voting rights in Mississippi, and the March to Selma.\n            (3) While the Civil Rights movement had many visible \n        leaders, including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, \n        Jr., and Rosa Parks, there were many others whose impact and \n        experience were just as important to the cause but who are not \n        as well known.\n            (4) The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess \n        an invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the \n        movement, and the recording of the retelling of their stories \n        and memories will provide a rich, detailed history of our \n        Nation during an important and tumultuous period.\n            (5) It is in the Nation's interest to undertake a project \n        to collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil Rights \n        movement so future generations will be able to learn of their \n        struggle and sacrifice through primary-source, eyewitness \n        material. A coordinated Federal project would also focus \n        attention on the efforts undertaken by various public and \n        private entities to collect and interpret articles in all \n        formats relating to the Civil Rights movement, and serve as a \n        model for future projects undertaken in museums, libraries, and \n        universities throughout the Nation.\n            (6) The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution \n        are appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make \n        available to the public a collection of these oral histories. \n        The Library and Smithsonian have expertise in the management of \n        documentation projects, and experience in the development of \n        cultural and educational programs for the public.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new \nfederally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will \ncoordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio \nrecordings of personal histories and testimonials of individuals who \nparticipated in the American Civil Rights movement that will build upon \nand complement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, \nand to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of \nsuch individuals so that Americans of all current and future \ngenerations may hear from them directly and better appreciate the \nsacrifices they made.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT PROJECT AT LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND \n              NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE \n              TO COLLECT VIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDINGS OF HISTORIES OF \n              PARTICIPANTS IN AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Project.--\n            (1) In general.--Within the limits of available funds, the \n        Librarian of Congress (hereafter referred to as the \n        ``Librarian'') and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution \n        (hereafter referred to as the ``Secretary)'', acting jointly, \n        shall establish an oral history project--\n                    (A) to survey, during the initial phase of the \n                project, collections of audio and video recordings of \n                the reminiscences of participants in the Civil Rights \n                movement that are housed in archives, libraries, \n                museums, and other educational institutions, as well as \n                ongoing documentary work, in order to augment and \n                complement these endeavors and avoid duplication of \n                effort;\n                    (B) to solicit, reproduce, and collect--\n                            (i) video and audio recordings of personal \n                        histories and testimonials of individuals who \n                        participated in the Civil Rights movement, and\n                            (ii) visual and written materials (such as \n                        letters, diaries, photographs, and ephemera) \n                        relevant to the personal histories of \n                        individuals;\n                    (C) to create a collection of the recordings and \n                other materials obtained, and to catalog and index the \n                collection in a manner the Librarian and the Secretary \n                consider appropriate; and\n                    (D) to make the collection available for public use \n                through the Library of Congress and the National Museum \n                of African American History and Culture, as well as \n                through such other methods as the Librarian and the \n                Secretary consider appropriate.\n            (2) Role of director of museum.--The Secretary shall carry \n        out the Secretary's duties under this Act through the Director \n        of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n    (b) Use of and Consultation With Other Entities.--The Librarian and \nthe Secretary may carry out the activities described in subsection \n(a)(1) through agreements and partnerships entered into with other \ngovernment and private entities, and may otherwise consult with \ninterested persons (within the limits of available resources) and \ndevelop appropriate guidelines and arrangements for soliciting, \nacquiring, and making available recordings under the project under this \nAct.\n    (c) Services of Experts and Consultants; Acceptance of Volunteer \nServices; Advance Payments.--In carrying out activities described in \nsubsection (a)(1), the Librarian and the Secretary may--\n            (1) procure temporary and intermittent services under \n        section 3109 of title 5, United States Code;\n            (2) accept and utilize the services of volunteers and other \n        uncompensated personnel and reimburse them for travel expenses, \n        including per diem, as authorized under section 5703 of title \n        5, United States Code; and\n            (3) make advances of money and payments in advance in \n        accordance with section 3324 of title 31, United States Code.\n    (d) Timing.--As soon as practicable after the enactment of this \nAct, the Librarian and the Secretary shall begin collecting video and \naudio recordings and other materials under subsection (a)(1), and shall \nattempt to collect the first such recordings from the oldest \nindividuals involved.\n    (e) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``Civil Rights movement'' \nmeans the movement to secure racial equality in the United States for \nAfrican Americans that, focusing on the period 1954 through 1968, \nchallenged the practice of racial segregation in the Nation and \nachieved equal rights legislation for all American citizens.\n\nSEC. 4.
