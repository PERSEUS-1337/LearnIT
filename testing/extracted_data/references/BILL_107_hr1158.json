FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The security of the United States homeland from \n        nontraditional and emerging threats must be a primary national \n        security mission of the United States Government. Attacks \n        against United States citizens on United States soil, possibly \n        causing heavy casualties, are likely during the next quarter \n        century, as both the technical means for carrying out such \n        attacks, and the array of actors who might use such means, are \n        proliferating despite the best efforts of United States \n        diplomacy.\n            (2) Attacks on United States soil may involve weapons of \n        mass destruction and weapons of mass disruption. As porous as \n        United States physical borders are in an age of burgeoning \n        trade and travel, its cyber borders are even more vulnerable, \n        and the critical infrastructure upon which so much of the \n        United States economy depends can now be targeted by \n        governments as well as individuals. The preeminence of the \n        United States makes it more appealing as a target, while its \n        openness and freedoms make it more vulnerable.\n            (3) Despite the serious threat to homeland security, the \n        United States Government has not yet adopted homeland security \n        as a primary national security mission. Its structures and \n        strategies are fragmented and inadequate. The assets and \n        organizations that now exist for homeland security are \n        scattered across more than two dozen departments and agencies, \n        and all 50 States.\n            (4) Guaranteeing that homeland security is achieved within \n        a framework of law that protects the civil liberties and \n        privacy of United States citizens is essential. The United \n        States Government must improve national security without \n        compromising established constitutional principles.\n            (5) A comprehensive strategy and new organizational \n        structures to prevent and protect against attacks on the United \n        States homeland, and to respond to such attacks if prevention \n        and protection should fail, are urgently needed.\n            (6) Through the National Homeland Security Agency, the \n        United States Government will improve the planning and \n        coordination of Federal support to State and local agencies to \n        rationalize the allocation of resources, enhance readiness in \n        order to prevent attacks, and facilitate recovery if prevention \n        fails.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL HOMELAND SECURITY AGENCY.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established a National Homeland \nSecurity Agency (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n``Agency'').\n    (b) Director.--There shall be at the head of the Agency a Director, \nwho shall be appointed by the President by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate.
