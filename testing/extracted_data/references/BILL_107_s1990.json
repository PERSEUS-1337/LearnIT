FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, or one half of all \n        pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and half of \n        all of these unintended pregnancies end in abortion;\n            (2) the Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n        contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended \n        pregnancy, reducing the risk by as much as 89 percent;\n            (3) the most commonly used forms of emergency contraception \n        are regimens of ordinary birth control pills taken within 72 \n        hours of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure;\n            (4) emergency contraception, also known as post-coital \n        contraception, is a responsible means of preventing pregnancy \n        that works like other hormonal contraception to delay \n        ovulation, prevent fertilization or prevent implantation;\n            (5) emergency contraception does not cause abortion and \n        will not affect an established pregnancy;\n            (6) it is estimated that the use of emergency contraception \n        could cut the number of unintended pregnancies in half, thereby \n        reducing the need for abortion;\n            (7) emergency contraceptive use is the United States \n        remains low, and 9 in 10 women of reproductive age remain \n        unaware of the method;\n            (8) although the American College of Obstetricians and \n        Gynecologists recommends that doctors routinely offer women of \n        reproductive age a prescription for emergency contraceptive \n        pills during their annual visit, only 1 in 5 ob/gyns routinely \n        discuss emergency contraception with their patients, suggesting \n        the need for greater provider and patient education;\n            (9) in light of their safety and efficacy, both the \n        American Medical Association and the American College of \n        Obstetricians and Gynecologists have endorsed more widespread \n        availability of emergency contraceptive pills, and have \n        recommended that dedicated emergency contraceptive products be \n        available without a prescription;\n            (10) Healthy People 2010, published by the Office of the \n        Surgeon General, establishes a 10-year national public health \n        goal of increasing the proportion of health care providers who \n        provide emergency contraception to their patients; and\n            (11) public awareness campaigns targeting women and health \n        care providers will help remove many of the barriers to \n        emergency contraception and will help bring this important \n        means of pregnancy prevention to American women.\n\nSEC. 3.
