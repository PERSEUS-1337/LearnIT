FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Section 108 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n        U.S.C. 404a) requires that the President shall transmit to \n        Congress each year a comprehensive report on the national \n        security strategy of the United States at the same time that \n        the President submits the budget for the following fiscal year \n        under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code.\n            (2) The national security strategy report sets forth the \n        national security strategy of the United States and includes a \n        comprehensive description and discussion of the worldwide \n        interests, goals, and objectives of the United States that are \n        vital to the national security of the United States and also \n        the proposed short-term and long-term uses of the political, \n        economic, military, and other elements of the national power of \n        the United States to protect or promote United States national \n        security interests.\n            (3) The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n        (Public Law 103-62) requires United States Government \n        departments and agencies to set goals, measure performance, \n        report on their accomplishments, establish long-term strategic \n        goals as well as annual goals, define clear missions and \n        desired outcomes, measure performance as a means of gauging \n        progress, and utilize performance information as a basis for \n        decisionmaking.\n            (4) Under the administration of President George W. Bush \n        and in accordance with the Government Performance and Results \n        Act of 1993, all United States Government departments and \n        agencies were required to conduct performance-based budgeting \n        and planning as guided by the Office of Management and Budget's \n        Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), in order to ensure more \n        accurate assessment of program performance and to drive a \n        sustained focus on program results.\n            (5) In January 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \n        stated that the United States foreign assistance structure \n        risks incoherent policies, ineffective programs, and wasted \n        resources when spending is not strategically tied to \n        overarching United States goals.\n            (6) The Department of State and the United States Agency \n        for International Development (USAID) developed a Joint \n        Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2007-2012, which outlines \n        strategic goals shared by both agencies, and implemented a \n        joint Department of State-USAID foreign assistance budget \n        process starting with the fiscal year 2008 budget request.\n            (7) In 2008, the Department of State approved plans for new \n        Department of State-USAID Country Assistance Strategies that \n        would take a comprehensive approach by including the efforts of \n        all United States agencies providing foreign assistance in a \n        country and by including an overall strategic approach for such \n        foreign assistance.\n            (8) The Department of State and USAID have participated in \n        a pilot performance-reporting program launched by the Office of \n        Budget and Management aimed at streamlining Federal agency \n        reporting while retaining ongoing efforts to directly integrate \n        budget and performance planning and reporting.\n            (9) USAID seeks to apply ``performance management'' by \n        implementing a five-step strategic management process that \n        includes mission performance plans, the Department of State and \n        USAID Joint Strategic Plan, annual reports, a performance and \n        accountability report, agency policy frameworks, and bureau \n        strategic frameworks.\n            (10) In the report entitled ``Foreign Aid Reform: \n        Comprehensive Strategy, Interagency Coordination, and \n        Operational Improvements Would Bolster Current Efforts'', the \n        Government Accountability Office found that, until the \n        Department of State develops and implements a comprehensive, \n        integrated United States foreign assistance strategy, it will \n        lack assurance that programs are strategically tied to \n        overarching United States goals and that, by basing its annual \n        operational plans and Country Assistance Strategies on a \n        standardized program structure, the Department of State was, in \n        fact, attempting to tie its planning and budgeting to strategic \n        foreign policy objectives.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) under the direction of the President, the Secretary of \n        State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n        International Development (USAID) should, to the maximum extent \n        practicable, make funding decisions on the basis of a long-term \n        strategy that addresses national security, diplomatic, and \n        foreign assistance objectives and needs of the United States; \n        and\n            (2) while steps already taken towards performance \n        management and budgeting by the Department of State and USAID \n        are commendable, there remains a need for budget requests for \n        the Department of State, USAID, and other foreign affairs \n        agencies to be more effectively integrated with national \n        security objectives and program evaluation and management.\n\nSEC. 4.
