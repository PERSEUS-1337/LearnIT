FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The failure to reuse and recycle empty beverage \n        containers represents a significant and unnecessary waste of \n        important national energy and material resources.\n            (2) The littering of empty beverage containers constitutes \n        a public nuisance, safety hazard, and aesthetic blight and \n        imposes on public agencies, private businesses, farmers, and \n        landowners unnecessary costs for the collection and removal of \n        the containers.\n            (3) Solid waste resulting from the empty beverage \n        containers constitutes a significant proportion of municipal \n        solid waste and increases the cost and problems of effectively \n        managing the disposal of the waste.\n            (4) It is difficult for local communities to raise the \n        necessary capital to initiate comprehensive recycling programs.\n            (5) The reuse and recycling of empty beverage containers \n        would help eliminate unnecessary burdens on individuals, local \n        governments, and the environment.\n            (6) Several States have previously enacted and implemented \n        State laws designed to protect the environment, conserve energy \n        and material resources, and promote resource recovery of waste \n        by requiring a refund value on the sale of all beverage \n        containers.\n            (7) The laws referred to in paragraph (6) have proven \n        inexpensive for government to administer and effective at \n        reducing financial burdens on communities by internalizing the \n        cost of recycling and litter control to the producers and \n        consumers of beverages.\n            (8) A national system for requiring a refund value on the \n        sale of all beverage containers would act as a positive \n        incentive to individuals to clean up the environment and \n        would--\n                    (A) result in a high level of reuse and recycling \n                of the containers; and\n                    (B) help reduce the costs associated with solid \n                waste management.\n            (9) A national system for requiring a refund value on the \n        sale of all beverage containers would result in significant \n        energy conservation and resource recovery.\n            (10) The reuse and recycling of empty beverage containers \n        would eliminate unnecessary waste management burdens on the \n        Federal Government, State and local governments, and the \n        environment.\n            (11) The collection of unclaimed refunds from a national \n        system of beverage container recycling would provide the \n        resources necessary to assist comprehensive reuse and recycling \n        programs throughout the United States.\n            (12) A national system of beverage container recycling is \n        consistent with the intent of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).\n            (13) This Act is consistent with the goals established by \n        the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency during \n        June 1996 that include a national goal of 35 percent source \n        reduction and recycling by 2005, coupled with a reduction in \n        per capita waste generation.\n\nSEC. 3.
