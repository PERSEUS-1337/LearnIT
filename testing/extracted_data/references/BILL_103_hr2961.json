FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, located in \n        northeastern North Carolina, provides unique opportunities for \n        observing and interpreting the biological richness of the \n        region's estuaries and wetlands.\n            (2) Although there are 10 national wildlife refuges in \n        eastern North Carolina, not one has an educational or \n        interpretative center for visitors.\n            (3) The State of North Carolina, Tyrrell County, the town \n        of Columbia, the Conservation Fund, and private citizens have \n        proposed to enter into a partnership with the United States \n        Fish and Wildlife Service to establish an educational and \n        interpretative facility to be known as the Center for the \n        Sounds.\n            (4) Establishment of the Center for the Sounds would bestow \n        economic benefits upon Tyrrell County and the town of Columbia.\n            (5) The Federal Government has designated the Albemarle-\n        Pamlico estuary system of northeastern North Carolina as an \n        estuary of national concern.\n\nSEC. 2. FURTHER FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress further finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Throughout his congressional career, the Honorable \n        Walter B. Jones was a strong supporter of the National Wildlife \n        Refuge System.\n            (2) During his years of service in the House of \n        Representatives, Walter B. Jones supported the establishment \n        and expansion of National Wildlife Refuges in eastern North \n        Carolina; these include 6 new National Wildlife Refuges \n        established in his district, including the Alligator River \n        National Wildlife Refuge and the Pocosin Lakes National \n        Wildlife Refuge, which are respectively the third largest and \n        fifth largest National Wildlife Refuges east of the Mississippi \n        River.\n            (3) Walter B. Jones helped increase refuge acreage in his \n        district by over 303,000 acres, thus ensuring the protection of \n        these lands for wildlife habitat and public recreation.\n            (4) Walter B. Jones' support for reintroducing endangered \n        red wolves into the wild at Alligator River National Wildlife \n        Refuge was a major factor in securing public acceptance of, and \n        support for, this first successful effort to reintroduce \n        endangered predators into formerly occupied habitat.\n            (5) Walter B. Jones devoted much of his congressional \n        career, including his years as Chairman of the Merchant Marine \n        and Fisheries Committee, to the conservation of fish and \n        wildlife, for the benefit of the Nation and the people of North \n        Carolina.\n            (6) Walter B. Jones should most appropriately be recognized \n        for his work on behalf of fish and wildlife conservation by \n        having the Center for the Sounds at the Pocosin Lakes National \n        Wildlife Refuge System named in his honor.\n\nSEC. 3.
