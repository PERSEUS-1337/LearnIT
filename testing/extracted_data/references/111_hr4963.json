FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) 44 million Americans have low bone mass or \n        osteoporosis, causing $19 billion in hospital and nursing home \n        expenses annually.\n            (2) Adequate calcium intake and weight-bearing exercise can \n        help build bone mass and prevent debilitating fractures.\n            (3) 98 percent of maximum bone density is reached by age \n        20, making it especially important that children get enough \n        calcium.\n            (4) The United States Department of Agriculture finds that \n        32 percent of children ages 4 through 8 and 90 percent of girls \n        and 70 percent of boys ages 9 through 19 do not meet current \n        calcium recommendations.\n            (5) Per capita milk consumption in the United States has \n        been decreasing for 3 decades. Per capita milk consumption by \n        children fell quickly from 2005 to 2010, and this consumption \n        rate is declining even more rapidly as these children reach \n        their teenage years.\n            (6) Fewer than half of school-age children participate in \n        school meal programs.\n            (7) 87 percent of schools sell soft drinks, fruit drinks, \n        and sports drinks on campus through school meal programs, \n        vending machines, and other means.\n\nSEC. 3.
