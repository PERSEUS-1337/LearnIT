FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n        that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n            (2) The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to \n        punish crimes against the law of nations and therefore Congress \n        may by law impose penalties on those who provide material \n        support to foreign organizations engaged in terrorist activity, \n        and allow for victims of international terrorism to recover \n        damages from those who have harmed them.\n            (3) International terrorism affects the interstate and \n        foreign commerce of the United States by harming international \n        trade and market stability, and limiting international travel \n        by United States citizens as well as foreign visitors to the \n        United States.\n            (4) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n        affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds \n        outside of the United States for conduct directed and targeted \n        at the United States.\n            (5) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of \n        action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under \n        the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n            (6) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for \n        the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n        (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the \n        leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and \n        conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the \n        United States, provides the proper legal framework for how such \n        liability should function in the context of the Anti-Terrorism \n        Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n            (7) The United Nations Security Council declared in \n        Resolution 1373, adopted on September 28, 2001, that all \n        countries have an affirmative obligation to ``[r]efrain from \n        providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities \n        or persons involved in terrorist acts,'' and to ``[e]nsure that \n        any person who participates in the financing, planning, \n        preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting \n        terrorist acts is brought to justice''.\n            (8) Consistent with these declarations, no country has the \n        discretion to engage knowingly in the financing or sponsorship \n        of terrorism, whether directly or indirectly.\n            (9) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or \n        recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly \n        or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a \n        significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that threaten \n        the security of nationals of the United States or the national \n        security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, \n        necessarily direct their conduct at the United States, and \n        should reasonably anticipate being brought to court in the \n        United States to answer for such activities.\n            (10) The United States has a vital interest in providing \n        persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks \n        committed within the United States with full access to the \n        court system in order to pursue civil claims against persons, \n        entities, or countries that have knowingly or recklessly \n        provided material support or resources, directly or indirectly, \n        to the persons or organizations responsible for their injuries.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil litigants \nwith the broadest possible basis, consistent with the Constitution of \nthe United States, to seek relief against persons, entities, and \nforeign countries, wherever acting and wherever they may be found, that \nhave provided material support, directly or indirectly, to foreign \norganizations or persons that engage in terrorist activities against \nthe United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
