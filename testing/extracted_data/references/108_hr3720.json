FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Fifty-four percent of high school seniors in 2001 had \n        used an illicit drug in their lifetime.\n            (2) Forty-two percent of 12th graders, 37 percent of 10th \n        graders, and 20 percent of 8th graders in 2001 had used an \n        illicit drug in the past year.\n            (3) Eighty percent of 12th graders, 70 percent of 10th \n        graders, and 51 percent of 8th graders in 2001 had used alcohol \n        in their lifetime.\n            (4) Sixty-four percent of 12th graders, 48 percent of 10th \n        graders, and 23 percent of 8th graders in 2001 had been \n        intoxicated.\n            (5) Use of 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine (commonly \n        referred to as ``MDMA'' or ``ecstasy'') by 12th graders \n        increased from 6 percent in 1998 to 11.7 percent in 2001.\n            (6) Schoolchildren who use and abuse addictive illicit \n        drugs or alcohol increase the risk to the health and safety of \n        all students and impact the learning environment of the school \n        because--\n                    (A) use of illicit drugs or alcohol can lead to \n                serious health effects, the development of life-\n                threatening diseases, and even death;\n                    (B) use of illicit drugs like marijuana or ecstasy \n                kills brain cells in the learning centers of the brain, \n                directly impacting a student's ability to learn in \n                school;\n                    (C) chemicals left in the central nervous system \n                after using marijuana cause the brain to be irritated \n                and uncontrollable, resulting in disruptive behavior in \n                the classroom;\n                    (D) students who smoke cigarettes or use other \n                illicit drugs have been shown to have less desire to \n                learn, resulting in lower grade point averages when \n                compared to other students; and\n                    (E) students who use illicit drugs or alcohol have \n                a higher rate of breaking school rules.\n\nSEC. 3.
