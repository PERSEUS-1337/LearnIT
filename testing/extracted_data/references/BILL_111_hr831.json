    "content": "SECTION 1. ANTITRUST EXEMPTIONS.\n\n     (a) Study.--The Comptroller General shall conduct a study of the \nlegal requirements and policies followed by the Department in deciding \nwhether to approve international alliances under section 41309 of title \n49, United States Code, and grant exemptions from the antitrust laws \nunder section 41308 of such title in connection with such international \nalliances.\n    (b) Issues To Be Considered.--In conducting the study under \nsubsection (a), the Comptroller General, at a minimum, shall examine \nthe following:\n            (1) Whether granting exemptions from the antitrust laws in \n        connection with international alliances has resulted in public \n        benefits, including an analysis of whether such benefits could \n        have been achieved by international alliances not receiving \n        exemptions from the antitrust laws.\n            (2) Whether granting exemptions from the antitrust laws in \n        connection with international alliances has resulted in reduced \n        competition, increased prices in markets, or other adverse \n        effects.\n            (3) Whether international alliances that have been granted \n        exemptions from the antitrust laws have implemented pricing or \n        other practices with respect to the hub airports at which the \n        alliances operate that have resulted in increased costs for \n        consumers or foreclosed competition by rival (nonalliance) air \n        carriers at such airports.\n            (4) Whether increased network size resulting from \n        additional international alliance members will adversely affect \n        competition between international alliances.\n            (5) The areas in which immunized international alliances \n        compete and whether there is sufficient competition among \n        immunized international alliances to ensure that consumers will \n        receive benefits of at least the same magnitude as those that \n        consumers would receive if there were no immunized \n        international alliances.\n            (6) The minimum number of international alliances that is \n        necessary to ensure robust competition and benefits to \n        consumers on major international routes.\n            (7) Whether the different regulatory and antitrust \n        responsibilities of the Secretary and the Attorney General with \n        respect to international alliances have created any significant \n        conflicting agency recommendations, such as the conditions \n        imposed in granting exemptions from the antitrust laws.\n            (8) Whether, from an antitrust standpoint, requests for \n        exemptions from the antitrust laws in connection with \n        international alliances should be treated as mergers, and \n        therefore be exclusively subject to a traditional merger \n        analysis by the Attorney General and be subject to advance \n        notification requirements and a confidential review process \n        similar to those required under section 7A of the Clayton Act \n        (15 U.S.C. 18a).\n            (9) Whether the Secretary should amend, modify, or revoke \n        any exemption from the antitrust laws granted by the Secretary \n        in connection with an international alliance.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Secretary of \nTransportation, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of \nthe House of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation of the Senate a report on the results of the study \nunder subsection (a), including any recommendations of the Comptroller \nGeneral as to whether there should be changes in the authority of the \nSecretary under title 49, United States Code, or policy changes that \nthe Secretary can implement administratively, with respect to approving \ninternational alliances and granting exemptions from the antitrust laws \nin connection with such international alliances.\n    (d) Adoption of Recommended Policy Changes.--Not later than one \nyear after the date of receipt of the report under subsection (c), and \nafter providing notice and an opportunity for public comment, the \nSecretary shall issue a written determination as to whether the \nSecretary will adopt the policy changes, if any, recommended by the \nComptroller General in the report or make any other policy changes with \nrespect to approving international alliances and granting exemptions \nfrom the antitrust laws in connection with such international \nalliances.\n    (e) Sunset Provision.--\n            (1) In general.--An exemption from the antitrust laws \n        granted by the Secretary on or before the last day of the 3-\n        year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act in \n        connection with an international alliance, including an \n        exemption granted before the date of enactment of this Act, \n        shall cease to be effective after such last day unless the \n        exemption is renewed by the Secretary.\n            (2) Timing for renewals.--The Secretary may not renew an \n        exemption under paragraph (1) before the date on which the \n        Secretary issues a written determination under subsection (d).\n            (3) Standards for renewals.--The Secretary shall make a \n        decision on whether to renew an exemption under paragraph (1) \n        based on the policies of the Department in effect after the \n        Secretary issues a written determination under subsection (d).\n    (f) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Exemption from the antitrust laws.--The term \n        ``exemption from the antitrust laws'' means an exemption from \n        the antitrust laws granted by the
