SHORT TITLE; SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Missile \nProtection Act of 1997''.\n    (b) Authorizations of Supplemental Appropriations.--All amounts \nauthorized to be appropriated by this Act are authorizations of \nsupplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal \nyear 1998.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has vital interests in the Middle \n        East and Persian Gulf region.\n            (2) The United States maintains a force of approximately \n        25,000 military personnel in the Middle East and Persian Gulf \n        region.\n            (3) The United States has many allies and friends in the \n        Middle East and Persian Gulf region.\n            (4) The policies of the current regime in Iran, including \n        the export of terrorism and the pursuit of regional military \n        hegemony, are inimical to the interests of the United States \n        and its allies and friends.\n            (5) Iran has been aggressively pursuing ballistic missile \n        technology. According to a statement by the Vice President in \n        August 1997, ``It is obvious that there is a vigorous effort by \n        Iran to obtain the technologies that it needs to build a \n        ballistic missile and to build nuclear weapons.''\n            (6) The President, in Executive Order 12938, issued on \n        November 14, 1994 and reaffirmed in November 1995 and November \n        1996, declared a state of emergency, finding that ``the \n        proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and \n        of the means of delivering such weapons, constitutes an unusual \n        and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \n        policy, and economy of the United States . . .''\n            (7) Iran may achieve theater ballistic missile capabilities \n        capable of striking United States forces, allies, and friends \n        in the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions within one to two \n        years. Department of Defense officials report that Iran is \n        acquiring missile systems and technology from abroad and is \n        developing two ballistic missile systems. The Assistant \n        Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs recently testified \n        that Iran could complete development of its Shahab-3 missile in \n        12 to 18 months. This threat will grow over time as Iranian \n        missile production capability matures and missile ranges \n        increase.\n            (8) The United States intelligence community confirms that \n        Iran is achieving the capability described in paragraph (7) \n        with substantial assistance from other nations, including \n        Russia. The Director of Central Intelligence reported that \n        ``Russia supplied a variety of ballistic missile-related goods \n        to foreign countries [in late 1996] . . . especially Iran.''\n            (9) Currently deployed missile defenses have been designed \n        to meet shorter range, slower missile threats and are not \n        adequate to meet the threat posed by new Iranian ballistic \n        missiles under development. The United States and its allies \n        will be vulnerable to Iranian missiles after they become \n        operational and until improved United States and allied missile \n        defenses are deployed.\n            (10) Current theater missile defense plans of the \n        Department of Defense are inadequate to meet the state of \n        emergency declared by the President. The Patriot Advanced \n        Capability (PAC-3) and Navy Area Defense missile defense \n        systems have limited capability against longer-range ballistic \n        missiles. The more capable Theater High-Altitude Area Defense \n        (THAAD) system and Navy Theater-Wide system are not scheduled \n        to be deployed until well after the time by which it is \n        expected that the Iranian missile threat will have matured.\n            (11) It is a matter of the highest national interest to \n        minimize the vulnerability of United States forces, allies, and \n        friends to this threat.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE OF ACT.\n\n    In light of the findings in section 2, an immediate national \nresponse to the emerging Iranian missile threat, consistent with the \nPresidential declaration of national emergency, is required and is in \nthe highest national interest of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF EXTENT OF RUSSIAN COOPERATION WITH BALLISTIC \n              MISSILE ACTIVITIES OF IRAN.\n\n    (a) Discussion With Russia.--The Secretary of Defense shall enter \ninto discussions with the Government of Russia for the purpose of \nobtaining information on--\n            (1) the extent and technical specifics of cooperation and \n        assistance by Russia in the development by Iran of a ballistic \n        missile capability; and\n            (2) the technical nature of Iranian ballistic missile \n        capabilities.\n    (b) Limitation on Fiscal Year 1998 Cooperative Ballistic Missile \nDefense Projects.--(1) The amount described in paragraph (2) may not be \nobligated until the Secretary of Defense determines, and certifies to \nCongress, that the Russian government is providing full cooperation to \nthe United States and its allies in the obtaining of the information \ndescribed in subsection (a). Such a certification shall be submitted \nnot later than 30 days after the date of such a determination. The \nSecretary shall include with the certification a description of the \nbasis for the Secretary's determination.\n    (2) The amount referred to in paragraph (1) is $3,000,000 of the \nfunds appropriated for fiscal year 1998 for Russian cooperative \nballistic missile defense projects as part of the amount appropriated \nfor that fiscal year for missile defense programs of the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization.\n\nSEC. 5.
