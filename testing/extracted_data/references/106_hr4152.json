FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Organ procurement organizations play an important role \n        in the effort to increase organ donation in the United States.\n            (2) The current process for certification and \n        recertification of organ procurement organizations conducted by \n        the Department of Health and Human Services has created a level \n        of uncertainty that is interfering with organ procurement \n        organization effectiveness in raising the level of organ \n        donation.\n            (3) The General Accounting Office, the Institute of \n        Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health have \n        identified substantial limitations in the organ procurement \n        organization certification and recertification process and have \n        recommended changes in that process.\n            (4) The limitations in the recertification process \n        include--\n                    (A) an exclusive reliance on population-based \n                measures of performance that do not account for the \n                potential in the population for organ donation and do \n                not permit consideration of other outcome and process \n                standards that would more accurately reflect the \n                relative capability and performance of each organ \n                procurement organization;\n                    (B) an immediate decertification of organ \n                procurement organizations solely on the basis of the \n                performance measures, without an appropriate \n                opportunity to file and a grace period to pursue a \n                corrective action plan; and\n                    (C) a lack of due process to appeal to the \n                Secretary of Health and Human Services for \n                recertification on either substantive or procedural \n                grounds.\n            (5) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the \n        authority under section 1138(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Social \n        Security Act to extend the period for recertification of an \n        organ procurement organization from 2 to 4 years on the basis \n        of its past practices in order to avoid the inappropriate \n        disruption of the Nation's organ system.\n            (6) The Secretary of Health and Human Services can use the \n        extended period for recertification of all organ procurement \n        organizations to--\n                    (A) develop improved performance measures that \n                would reflect organ donor potential and interim \n                outcomes, and to test these measures to ensure that \n                they accurately measure performance differences among \n                the organ procurement organizations; and\n                    (B) improve the overall certification process by \n                incorporating process as well as outcome performance \n                measures, and developing equitable processes for \n                corrective action plans and appeals.\n\nSEC. 3. CERTIFICATION AND RECERTIFICATION OF ORGAN PROCUREMENT \n              ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1138(b) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1320b-8(b)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) by striking ``within the \n        previous 2 years (4 years if the Secretary determines \n        appropriate for an organization on the basis of its past \n        practices) as meeting the standards to be a qualified organ \n        procurement organization (as so described);'' and inserting \n        ``under paragraph (2) within the previous 4 years;'';\n            (2) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following new \n        paragraph:\n    ``(2) Not later than January 1, 2002, the Secretary shall set forth \nin regulations the process and performance standards by which an \norganization shall be certified or recertified as a qualified organ \nprocurement organization consistent with the following:\n            ``(A) Certification or recertification of such an \n        organization shall be made not more frequently than once every \n        4 years.\n            ``(B) Performance standards applicable for certification or \n        recertification of an organization shall use--\n                    ``(i) outcome and process performance measures that \n                are based on empirical evidence of organ donor \n                potential and other related factors in each service \n                area of qualified organ procurement organizations, and\n                    ``(ii) multiple outcome measures, which may or may \n                not be based on empirical evidence.\n            ``(C)(i) In the case of a certified qualified organ \n        procurement organization that the Secretary determines does not \n        meet the performance standards for recertification, the \n        organization may submit to the Secretary a corrective action \n        plan.\n            ``(ii) If the Secretary approves the corrective action plan \n        submitted under clause (i), the Secretary shall provide for an \n        additional 3-year period during which such organization shall \n        implement the corrective action plan. An organization \n        implementing a corrective action plan shall be treated as being \n        certified by the Secretary during such 3-year period.\nThe Secretary shall develop and implement appropriate procedures for an \norganization to appeal a decision of the Secretary to deny \ncertification or recertification of an organization under this \nparagraph.''.\n    (b) Transition Rule.--In the case of an organization that on \nJanuary 1, 2000, has in effect a certification or recertification by \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services as a qualified organ \nprocurement organization under section 1138(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-8(b)(1)(A)(ii)), such certification or \nrecertification shall remain in effect until the earlier of January 1, \n2002, or the date on which the Secretary publishes a final rule \nimplementing the provisions of 1138(b)(2), as added by subsection (a) \nof this Act."
