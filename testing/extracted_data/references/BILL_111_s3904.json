FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) a reliable source of groundwater is an essential \n        element of the economy of the communities on the High Plains;\n            (2) the High Plains Aquifer consists largely of the \n        Ogallala Aquifer with small components of other geologic units;\n            (3) the High Plains Aquifer experienced a dramatic decline \n        in water table levels in the latter half of the 20th century;\n            (4) the decline in water table levels is especially \n        pronounced in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, with areas in the \n        States of Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas experiencing \n        declines of over 100 feet from 1950 to 2007;\n            (5)(A) the saturated thickness of the High Plains Aquifer \n        has declined by over 50 percent in some areas; and\n            (B) the percentage of the High Plains Aquifer that has a \n        saturated thickness of 100 feet or more declined from 54 \n        percent to 51 percent in the period from 1980 to 2007;\n            (6) the decreased water levels in the High Plains Aquifer \n        coupled with higher pumping lift costs raise concerns about the \n        long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the High \n        Plains;\n            (7) hydrological modeling by the United States Geological \n        Survey indicates that in the context of sustained high \n        groundwater use in the surrounding region, reductions in \n        groundwater pumping at the single farm level or at a local \n        level of up to 100 square miles, have a very time-limited \n        impact on conserving the level of the local water table, thus \n        creating a disincentive for individual water users to invest in \n        water conservation measures;\n            (8) incentives must be created for conservation of \n        groundwater on a regional scale, in order to achieve an \n        agricultural economy on the High Plains that is sustainable; \n        and\n            (9) for water conservation incentives to function, Federal, \n        State, tribal, and local water policymakers, and individual \n        groundwater users must have access to reliable information \n        concerning aquifer recharge rates extraction rates, and water \n        table levels at the local and regional levels on an ongoing \n        basis.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote groundwater \nconservation on the High Plains in order to extend the useable life of \nthe High Plains Aquifer.\n\nSEC. 3.
