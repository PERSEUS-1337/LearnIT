FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Good vision is essential for proper physical \n        development and educational progress in growing children.\n            (2) Many serious ocular conditions are treatable if \n        identified in the preschool and early school-aged years.\n            (3) Early detection of ocular conditions provides the best \n        opportunity for effective, inexpensive treatment and can have \n        far-reaching implications for vision.\n            (4) Various identification methods, whether vision \n        screening or comprehensive eye exams required by State laws, \n        will identify children needing services. A child identified \n        through vision screening should receive a comprehensive eye \n        exam followed by subsequent treatment as needed. A child \n        identified through a comprehensive eye exam should receive \n        subsequent treatment as needed. All children identified as \n        needing services should have access to subsequent treatment as \n        needed.\n\nSEC. 3.
