DISPOSITION OF FUND.\n\n    (a) State Share.--(1) Six months after the end of fiscal year 2004, \nand annually thereafter, the Secretary shall pay from the Fund to each \ncoastal State one-half of such revenues paid into the Fund with respect \nto the fiscal year most recently completed, and any interest earned \nthereon, as may be attributable to that State.\n    (2) In order to determine to which State revenues are attributable \nfor purposes of this Act, the Secretary shall delimit the lateral \nboundaries between the coastal States to a point 200 geographic miles \nseaward of the coast line. Such boundaries shall be set according to \nthe following principles, listed in order of the priority of their \napplication:\n            (A) Any judicial decrees or interstate compacts delimiting \n        lateral offshore boundaries between coastal States.\n            (B) Principles of domestic and international law governing \n        the delimitation of lateral offshore boundaries.\n            (C) The desirability of following existing lease boundaries \n        and block lines on the Secretary's official protraction \n        diagrams.\n    (3) Each coastal State, before receiving funds under this \nsubsection, shall annually enact the necessary legislation to provide \nany State permits required for onshore facilities needed to support \noffshore oil or gas development or production in the area adjacent to \nthat coastal State. If a State fails to enact such legislation, the \nfunds attributable to that State shall not be disbursed, and the \nSecretary shall take into consideration that failure before offering \nany additional leases for sale in the offshore area adjacent to that \nState.\n    (b) Coastal County Share.--(1) At the same time that the Secretary \npays revenues to coastal States under subsection (a), the Secretary \nshall pay to coastal counties within that State the remaining one-half \nof the revenues, and any interest earned on those revenues, in the Fund \nfor that fiscal year attributable to that State.\n    (2) In order to determine to which coastal county revenues are \nattributable for purposes of this Act, the Secretary shall delimit the \nlateral boundaries between the coastal counties to a point 200 \ngeographic miles seaward of the coast line.

If a county fails to enact \nsuch legislation, the funds attributable to that county shall not be \ndisbursed, and the Secretary shall take into consideration that failure \nbefore offering any additional leases for sale in the offshore area \nadjacent to that county.\n    (c) Use of Funds by States.--Each coastal State shall use funds \nreceived pursuant to subsection (a)--\n            (1) to pay for the administrative costs the State incurs in \n        the leasing and permitting process as specified in the Outer \n        Continental Shelf Lands Act;\n            (2) for such environmental and natural resource projects as \n        the State determines; or\n            (3) for such educational projects as the State determines.\n    (d) County Distribution of Funds.--Each coastal county shall \ndevelop a formula to allocate at least two-thirds of the funds received \npursuant to subsection (b) to local communities within its jurisdiction \nbased on the proximity of these communities to the coast, except that \nfunds shall be withheld from communities that the Secretary determines \nhave failed to issue permits required for onshore facilities needed to \nsupport offshore oil or gas development or production in the area \nadjacent to that coastal county.\n\nSEC. 6. DESIGNATION OF COASTAL COUNTIES.\n\n     For the purposes of this Act, the Secretary, after consultation \nwith the Governor of each coastal State, shall determine which \ncounties, parishes, boroughs, tribal governments, or other units of \ngeneral government immediately below the level of State government \nshall be designated as coastal counties.\n\nSEC. 7. LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABILITY OF BOUNDARIES.\n\n     The boundaries and areas delimited under section 5 are solely for \nthe purposes of this Act."
