FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near \n        the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving an \n        estimated 220,000 people dead, including 103 United States \n        citizens, 101 United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent \n        of the nation's civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, \n        115,000 homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 people displaced.\n            (2) According to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment \n        conducted by the Government of Haiti, with technical assistance \n        from the United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter-American \n        Development Bank, the Economic Commission for Latin America and \n        the Caribbean, and the European Commission, an estimated 15 \n        percent of the population were directly affected by the \n        disaster and related damages and economic losses totaled \n        $7,804,000,000.\n            (3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti had some of the \n        lowest socioeconomic indicators and the second highest rate of \n        income disparity in the world, conditions that have further \n        complicated post-earthquake recovery efforts and, according to \n        the World Bank, have significantly reduced the prospects of \n        economic growth spurring broader poverty reduction.\n            (4) According to the World Food Program, more than \n        6,700,000 people in Haiti (out of a population of about \n        10,000,000) are considered food insecure nationally.\n            (5) In October 2010, an unprecedented outbreak of cholera \n        in Haiti resulted in over half a million reported cases and \n        over 8,000 deaths to date, further straining the capacity of \n        Haiti's public health sector and increasing the urgency of \n        resettlement and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) efforts.\n            (6) The international community, led by the United States \n        and the United Nations, mounted an unprecedented humanitarian \n        response in Haiti, with donors pledging approximately \n        $10,400,000,000 for humanitarian relief and recovery efforts, \n        including debt relief, supplemented by $3,100,000,000 in \n        private charitable contributions, of which approximately \n        $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed and an additional \n        $3,800,000,000 has been committed as of September 30, 2013.\n            (7) The emergency response of the men and women of the \n        United States Government, led by the United States Agency for \n        International Development (USAID) and the United States \n        Southern Command, as well as of cities, towns, individuals, \n        businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United \n        States, was particularly swift and resolute.\n            (8) Since 2010, a total of $1,300,000,000 in United States \n        assistance has been allocated for humanitarian relief and \n        $2,300,000,000 has been allocated for recovery, reconstruction, \n        and development assistance in Haiti, including $1,140,000,000 \n        in emergency appropriations and $95,000,000 that has been \n        obligated specifically to respond to the cholera epidemic.\n            (9) Of the $3,600,000,000 in United States assistance \n        allocated for Haiti, $651,000,000 was apportioned to the USAID \n        to support an ambitious recovery plan, including the \n        construction of a power plant to provide electricity for the \n        new Caracol Industrial Park (CIP) in northern Haiti, a new port \n        near the CIP, and permanent housing in new settlements in the \n        Port-au-Prince, St-Marc, and Cap-Haitien areas.\n            (10) On October 9, 2013, the Committee on Foreign Affairs \n        of the House of Representatives held an oversight hearing on \n        the status and effectiveness of post-earthquake United States \n        aid to Haiti, following a House of Representatives-mandated, \n        year-long Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that \n        was highly critical of some aspects of USAID's recovery effort.\n            (11) According to GAO, as of June 30, 2013, USAID had \n        disbursed just 31 percent of its reconstruction funds in Haiti, \n        the port project was 2 years behind schedule and over budget by \n        an estimated $189,000,000, the housing project has been reduced \n        by 80 percent, and the sustainability of the power plant, the \n        port, and the housing projects were all at risk.\n            (12) GAO further found that Congress has not been provided \n        with sufficient information to ensure that it is able to \n        conduct effective oversight at a time when most funding remains \n        to be disbursed, and specifically recommends that a periodic \n        reporting mechanism be instituted to fill this information gap.\n            (13) Donors have encountered significant challenges in \n        implementing recovery programs and nearly 4 years after the \n        earthquake an estimated 171,974 people remain displaced in \n        camps, unemployment remains high, corruption is rampant, land \n        rights remain elusive, allegations of wage violations are \n        widespread, the business climate is unfavorable, and government \n        capacity remains weak.\n            (14) For Haiti to achieve stability and long term economic \n        growth, donor assistance will have to be carefully coordinated \n        with a commitment by the Haitian Government to transparency, a \n        market economy, rule of law, and democracy.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to support the sustainable \nrebuilding and development of Haiti in a manner that--\n            (1) promotes efforts that are led by and support the \n        Haitian people and the Haitian Government at all levels so that \n        Haitians lead the course of reconstruction and development of \n        Haiti;\n            (2) builds the long term capacity of the Government of \n        Haiti and Haitian civil society;\n            (3) reflects the priorities and particular needs of both \n        women and men so they may participate equally and to their \n        maximum capacity;\n            (4) respects and helps restore Haiti's natural resources, \n        as well as builds community-level resilience to environmental \n        and weather-related impacts;\n            (5) provides timely and comprehensive reporting on goals \n        and progress, as well as transparent post program evaluations \n        and contracting data;\n            (6) prioritizes the local procurement of goods and services \n        in Haiti where appropriate; and\n            (7) promotes the holding of free, fair, and timely \n        elections in accordance with democratic principles and the \n        Haitian Constitution.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that transparency, accountability, \ndemocracy, and good governance are integral factors in any \ncongressional decision regarding United States assistance, including \nassistance to Haiti.\n\nSEC. 5.
