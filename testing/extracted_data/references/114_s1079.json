Budget neutrality.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n        death among men and women combined in the United States.\n            (2) In 2015, more than 130,000 Americans will be diagnosed \n        with colorectal cancer, and nearly 50,000 Americans are \n        expected to die from it.\n            (3) Approximately 60 percent of colorectal cancer cases and \n        70 percent of colorectal cancer deaths occur in those aged 65 \n        and older.\n            (4) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopies allow for the \n        detection and removal of polyps before they progress to \n        colorectal cancer, as well as early detection of colorectal \n        cancer when treatment can be most effective.\n            (5) According to a 2012 study published in the New England \n        Journal of Medicine, removing precancerous polyps through \n        colonoscopy could reduce the number of colorectal cancer deaths \n        by 53 percent.\n            (6) Although colorectal cancer is highly preventable with \n        appropriate screening, one in three adults between the ages of \n        50 and 75 years are not up to date with recommended colorectal \n        cancer screening.\n            (7) Over 200 organizations have committed to eliminating \n        colorectal cancer as a major health problem in the United \n        States and are working toward a shared goal of screening 80 \n        percent of eligible Americans by 2018.\n            (8) Hepatitis C is a liver disease that causes inflammation \n        of the liver and results from infection with the Hepatitis C \n        virus. Chronic Hepatitis C infection can lead to serious health \n        problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. \n        It is the leading cause of liver transplants in the United \n        States.\n            (9) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention (CDC), more than 75 percent of adults infected with \n        the Hepatitis C virus in the United States were born between \n        1945 and 1965.\n            (10) The CDC estimates that up to 75 percent of individuals \n        with Hepatitis C do not know that they are infected.\n            (11) The CDC and the United States Preventive Services Task \n        Force (USPSTF) recommend a one-time screening for Hepatitis C \n        for all individuals born between 1945 and 1965.\n            (12) A recent study suggests that offering Hepatitis C \n        screening to patients in connection with screening \n        colonoscopies may be an effective means of increasing Hepatitis \n        C screening rates among individuals born between 1945 and 1965.\n\nSEC. 3.
