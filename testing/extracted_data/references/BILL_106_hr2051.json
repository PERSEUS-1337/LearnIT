The Secretary may also take testimony from other \n        interested persons and shall consider all written petitions \n        received in response to each petition.\n            ``(5) Findings.--Not later than 60 days after the date on \n        which a public hearing is convened with respect to a petition \n        submitted under this subsection, the Secretary shall issue \n        written findings in response to the issues raised in the \n        petition, including, at a minimum, findings as to--\n                    ``(A) subject to paragraph (8), whether fares for \n                air transportation at the airport are substantially \n                higher than at comparable airports in the Nation;\n                    ``(B) whether air carrier costs to provide air \n                transportation at the airport appear substantially \n                higher than at comparable airports;\n                    ``(C) whether barriers to entry are discouraging or \n                preventing other air carriers from initiating \n                competitive air transportation at the airport;\n                    ``(D) whether marketing practices described in \n                subsection (c) or other air carrier practices are \n                contributing to such barriers to entry or are otherwise \n                resulting in higher air carrier costs or higher fares \n                for air transportation; and\n                    ``(E) as appropriate, whether any programs under \n                the Secretary's authority could be helpful to airports \n                in marketing their facilities to air carriers, reducing \n                fares for air transportation, or minimizing barriers to \n                entry by other air carriers seeking to provide air \n                transportation at the airport.\n            ``(6) Subsequent petitions.--If the Secretary receives a \n        petition under this section with respect to an airport for \n        which the Secretary has previously conducted an investigation \n        and public hearing under this subsection, the Secretary may \n        decide not to conduct a subsequent investigation and public \n        hearing in response to the new petition. In deciding whether to \n        conduct the investigation and public hearing, the Secretary \n        shall consider whether changed circumstances may have limited \n        the continuing validity of the Secretary's previous findings \n        with respect to the airport.\n            ``(7) Reports to congress.--Not later than 180 days after \n        the date of enactment of this subsection, and at the end of \n        each 180-day period thereafter, the Secretary shall transmit to \n        Congress a report on the results of the investigations, if any, \n        completed under this subsection during that period.\n            ``(8) Limitation on statutory construction.--Nothing in \n        this subsection may be construed to authorize the Secretary to \n        set or invalidate any fare for air transportation.\n    ``(c) Marketing Practices That Adversely Affect Air Carrier \nCompetition.--\n            ``(1) Review.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n        enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall review the \n        marketing practices of air carriers that may inhibit the \n        availability of quality, affordable air transportation services \n        to commercial service airports, including--\n                    ``(A) marketing arrangements between air carriers \n                and travel agents;\n                    ``(B) code-sharing partnerships;\n                    ``(C) frequent flyer incentive programs and \n                restrictions on purchases of frequent flyer mileage by \n                other air carriers;\n                    ``(D) computer reservation system displays;\n                    ``(E) gate arrangements at airports;\n                    ``(F) exclusive dealing arrangements; and\n                    ``(G) any other marketing practices that may have \n                similar impacts.\n            ``(2) Regulations.--If the Secretary finds, after \n        conducting the review required by paragraph (1), that 1 or more \n        marketing practices of air carriers inhibit the availability of \n        quality, affordable air transportation services at commercial \n        service airports, the Secretary, after providing notice and an \n        opportunity for public comment, shall issue regulations to \n        address the marketing practices.''."
