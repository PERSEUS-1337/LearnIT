    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Play in Sport Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the National Commission on Sports and Substance Abuse, \n        sponsored by the National Center on Addiction and Substance \n        Abuse at Columbia University, found that most parties involved \n        in Olympic sports agree that doping (the use of banned \n        performance-enhancing substances) is a serious problem for the \n        Olympics and must be eliminated to preserve the integrity of \n        the competition;\n            (2) the use of performance-enhancing substances in sports \n        threatens the health of our athletes, the integrity and meaning \n        of sport, and the health and ethical values of our children;\n            (3) there is currently no set of long-term comprehensive \n        studies on the effects of performance-enhancing substances;\n            (4) according to the Commission referred to in paragraph \n        (1), some problems which must be solved to enable a fair and \n        effective drug testing program include developing highly \n        accurate tests for performance-enhancing substances in the body \n        and establishing and accrediting testing laboratories around \n        the world;\n            (5) the United States Government has recognized the United \n        States Anti-Doping Agency as the official anti-doping agency \n        for Olympic, Pan American, and Paralympic sport in the United \n        States, and provides significant financial support to such \n        Agency; and\n            (6) the National Institute of Standards and Technology is \n        the Federal Government's premier laboratory for the development \n        of standards and testing methodology as well as for developing \n        rigorous testing laboratory accreditation procedures.\n\nSEC. 3. RESEARCH FOR TESTING OF PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING SUBSTANCES.\n\n    The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in consultation \nand cooperation with the United States Anti-Doping Agency, shall \nestablish a research program to develop and improve the reliability, \nvalidity, and cost-effectiveness of testing for performance-enhancing \nsubstances the use of which is prohibited in the Olympic Games. Such \nresearch program shall--\n            (1) pay particular attention to the development and \n        improvement of tests for the use of steroids, human growth \n        hormone, and insulin-like growth factor;\n            (2) establish methods of ensuring that the ability to test \n        for the use of newly banned performance-enhancing substances is \n        maintained; and\n            (3) develop standard reference materials to ensure the \n        accuracy of measurements.\nDevelopment of the agenda for the research program established under \nthis section should be on the basis of the best available technology, \nregardless of the type of sample specimen used. All research projects \nshould be evaluated on a peer-reviewed basis.\n\nSEC. 4. ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES FOR TESTING LABORATORIES.\n\n    The National Institute of Standards and Technology shall provide \nreview and assessment assistance to the United States Anti-Doping \nAgency with respect to the laboratory accreditation process and testing \nprocedures delineated in the International Olympic Committee's Olympic \nMovement Anti-Doping Code. Such assistance shall include--\n            (1) procedures for accreditation of laboratories;\n            (2) sampling procedures in doping controls; and\n            (3) laboratory analysis procedures.\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology shall limit its \nassistance under this section to areas where it has demonstrated \ntechnical competence.\n\nSEC. 5. RESEARCH ON LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF USE OF PERFORMANCE-\n              ENHANCING SUBSTANCES.\n\n    The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in consultation \nand cooperation with the United States Anti-Doping Agency, shall \nestablish a research program to determine the long-term consequences of \nuse of performance-enhancing substances. Development of the research \nagenda should place the highest priority on the most potentially \nharmful and the most widely used performance-enhancing substances. \nPriorities for research shall include--\n            (1) the health effects of consumption of performance-\n        enhancing substances; and\n            (2) the efficacy and long-term effects of the use of \n        steroids, including precursor substances.\nPopulation studies under this section should not be limited to elite \nathletes but should include adolescent athletes as well.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology--\n            (1) for carrying out sections 3 and 4, $5,000,000 for each \n        of the fiscal years 2003 through 2007; and\n            (2) for carrying out section 5, $2,000,000 for each of the \n        fiscal years 2003 through 2007."
