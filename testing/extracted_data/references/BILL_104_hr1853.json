FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tobacco use remains the largest preventable cause of \n        illness and premature death in the United States, responsible \n        for the unnecessary deaths of more than 419,000 Americans each \n        year.\n            (2) Tobacco is a uniquely harmful product in that it kills \n        if used as intended.\n            (3) The United States health care system expenditures due \n        directly to smoking totals $50 billion a year. The United \n        States economy loses $47 billion a year in productivity due to \n        smoking.\n            (4) The 1988 report of the United States Surgeon General \n        concluded that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are \n        addicting, that nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes \n        addiction, and that the pharmacologic and behavioral processes \n        that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that \n        determine addiction to heroin and cocaine.\n            (5) The 1994 report by the United States Surgeon General \n        concluded that the nicotine in tobacco products is responsible \n        for the rapid addiction of up to half of all children who \n        experiment with tobacco.\n            (6) Among adults in the United States who have ever smoked \n        daily, 91 percent tried their first cigarette and 77 percent \n        became daily smokers before they were 20 years old.\n            (7) Nicotine addicts over 3,000 children each day into an \n        activity which eventually will kill approximately \\1/2\\ of \n        them.\n            (8) The current Commissioner of Food and Drugs has labeled \n        tobacco a pediatric disease.\n            (9) A senior research scientist for one of the largest \n        cigarette manufacturers in the United States has observed: \n        ``The primary incentive to cigarette smoking is the immediate \n        salutary effect of inhaled smoke upon body function . . . The \n        physiological effect serves as the primary incentive; all other \n        incentives are secondary . . . Think of the cigarette pack as a \n        storage container for a day's supply of nicotine . . . Think of \n        the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine . . . \n        Think of a puff of smoke as the vehicle of nicotine.''.\n            (10) The use of tobacco products continues to be \n        widespread, in spite of increased awareness of their lethal \n        nature, because nicotine which is the single, removable \n        substance in tobacco that causes addiction in children and \n        reinforces that addiction in adults.\n            (11) Tobacco manufacturers have the capability to remove \n        all or virtually all of the nicotine from their tobacco \n        products using technology already in existence.\n            (12) Nicotine destroys the freedom of millions of children \n        and adults in the United States to choose whether or not to \n        continue using tobacco products.\n\nSEC. 3. REGULATION.\n\n    (a) Definition.--Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(gg) The term `tobacco product' means any cigarette, cigar, \nlittle cigar, pipe tobacco, fine cut tobacco, or any smokeless tobacco \nproduct.\n    ``(hh) The term `nicotine' includes any substance that has \npharmacologic activity similar to nicotine.''.\n    (b) Reduction in Nicotine.--Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act is amended--\n            (1) in the title by adding at the end ``AND TOBACCO \n        PRODUCTS'', and\n            (2) by adding after subchapter C the following:\n\n                    ``Subchapter D--Tobacco Products\n\n                    ``regulation of tobacco products\n\n    ``Sec. 545.
