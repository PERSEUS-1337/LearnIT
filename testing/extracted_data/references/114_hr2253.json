FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Medicaid plays a key role in providing coverage for \n        millions of working families.\n            (2) Medicaid enrollees include families, pregnant women, \n        children, individuals with disabilities, and other low-income \n        individuals. Without Medicaid coverage, many enrollees would be \n        uninsured or lack coverage for services they need.\n            (3) In 2014, the Medicaid program covered 69,000,000 \n        individuals, or 1 in every 5 Americans. This number will \n        continue to grow, particularly since the Affordable Care Act \n        significantly expanded eligibility to millions of uninsured \n        adults.\n            (4) If all States expand their Medicaid programs, an \n        estimated 7,000,000 women ages 18 to 64 would gain coverage \n        under Medicaid.\n            (5) In 47 States and in the District of Columbia, Medicaid \n        pays up to 67 percent less than Medicare for the same primary \n        care services.\n            (6) Congress has recognized that low provider participation \n        in Medicaid decreases access to health care. To address this \n        problem, Congress acted to increase Medicaid payments for \n        certain primary care services to be not less than the Medicare \n        payment rates for 2013 and 2014.\n            (7) As more Americans become insured and empowered \n        participants in their own health care, demand for primary care \n        services is expected to increase over the next few years.\n            (8) According to a study published earlier this year in the \n        New England Journal of Medicine, higher Medicaid payment rates \n        have significantly increased appointment availability for \n        Medicaid enrollees.\n            (9) Six in 10 women ages 18 to 44 (58 percent) report they \n        see an obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physician on a \n        regular basis. They are more likely to see their OB/GYN \n        physician on a regular basis than any other type of provider. \n        Given that women comprise the majority of Medicaid enrollees, \n        it is critical that primary care providers, including OB/GYN \n        physicians, receive sufficient reimbursement to participate in \n        Medicaid.\n            (10) Nurse practitioners and other health professionals \n        deliver many primary care services. Applying Medicare's rates \n        for nurse practitioners and other health professionals \n        encourages greater participation in Medicaid, thereby \n        increasing access to primary care, particularly in underserved \n        areas.\n            (11) The enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rate ensures \n        providers have the financial capability to serve their \n        patients' primary care needs. Furthermore, adding nurse \n        practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, \n        and OB/GYN physicians serving in primary care settings \n        increases access to critical health care services for women and \n        children nationwide.\n\nSEC. 3. RENEWAL OF APPLICATION OF MEDICARE PAYMENT RATE FLOOR TO \n              PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FURNISHED UNDER MEDICAID AND \n              INCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS.\n\n    (a) Renewal of Payment Floor;
