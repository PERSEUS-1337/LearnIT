FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS ON POLICIES THAT DISADVANTAGE \n              THE HIRING OF UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND LAWFULLY PRESENT \n              ALIENS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n        (Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 119), many individuals and \n        businesses are required to purchase health insurance coverage \n        for themselves and their employees;\n            (2) individuals who were unlawfully present in the United \n        States who have been granted deferred action under the Deferred \n        Action for Childhood Arrivals Program undertaken by the \n        Executive Branch and who then receive work authorization are \n        exempt from these requirements;\n            (3) many United States employers hiring United States \n        citizens or individuals legally present in the United States \n        are required to either offer those persons affordable health \n        insurance or pay a penalty of approximately $3,000 per employee \n        per year; and\n            (4) an employer does not have to provide insurance, or in \n        many instances pay a penalty, if they hire individuals who were \n        not lawfully present but who have been granted deferred action \n        under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program and \n        work authorization.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) this disparate treatment has the unacceptable effect of \n        discouraging the hiring of United States citizens and those in \n        a lawful immigration status in the United States; and\n            (2) the Executive Branch should refrain from pursuing \n        policies, such as granting deferred action under the Deferred \n        Action for Childhood Arrivals Program and work authorization to \n        unlawfully present individuals, that disadvantage the hiring of \n        United States citizens and those in a lawful immigration status \n        in the United States.\n\nSEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON POLICIES THAT DISADVANTAGE LAWFULLY \n              PRESENT ALIENS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the Director of United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services should--\n            (1) stop putting the interests of aliens who are unlawfully \n        present in the United States ahead of the interests of aliens \n        who are following proper immigration laws and procedures by \n        adjudicating petitions and applications for immigration \n        benefits submitted by aliens unlawfully present in the United \n        States because when adjudicators and resources of U.S. \n        Citizenship and Immigration Services are used to adjudicate \n        petitions and applications for aliens who are unlawfully \n        present, the time it takes to process petitions and \n        applications submitted by other aliens is significantly \n        increased and a backlog is created and it is unfair to use the \n        fees paid by other aliens to cover the costs of adjudicating \n        petitions and applications for aliens unlawfully present in the \n        United States; and\n            (2) use the funds available under existing law to improve \n        services and increase the efficiency of the immigration \n        benefits application process for aliens abroad or who are \n        lawfully present in the United States.\n                                                        "
