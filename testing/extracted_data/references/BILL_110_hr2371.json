FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n        that tooth decay in baby teeth has increased 15 percent among \n        United States toddlers and preschoolers 2 to 5 years old, \n        between 1988 to 1994 and 1994 to 2004.\n            (2) During the period of 1999 to 2004, 28 percent of young \n        children had experienced cavities.\n            (3) Tooth decay is the single most common childhood chronic \n        disease, and it disproportionately affects poor and minority \n        children.\n            (4) Eighty percent of dental decay occurs in just 25 \n        percent of children.\n            (5) Parents are 3 times more likely to report that their \n        children's dental needs are unmet, when compared with general \n        medical care needs.\n            (6) While 9,000,000 of the children in this Nation do not \n        have medical insurance, more than twice that number--\n        20,000,000--do not have dental insurance.\n            (7) The Department of Health and Human Services estimates \n        that more than 31,000,000 people live in dental health provider \n        shortage areas, and 4,650 additional dentists would be needed \n        to meet the need that exists in those areas.\n            (8) Health centers serve as the health care home for \n        16,000,000 individuals, including 5,200,000 children, aged 18 \n        and under.\n            (9) A significant number of health centers provide dental \n        services, but in many instances those services are inadequate \n        to meet the needs of low-income children in the communities \n        they serve.\n\nSEC. 3.
