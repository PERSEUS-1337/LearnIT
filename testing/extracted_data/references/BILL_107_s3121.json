FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) It is feasible for terrorists to obtain and to \n        disseminate radioactive material using a radiological \n        dispersion device (RDD), or by emplacing discrete radioactive \n        sources in major public places.\n            (2) It is not difficult for terrorists to improvise a \n        nuclear explosive device of significant yield once they have \n        acquired the fissile material, highly enriched uranium, or \n        plutonium, to fuel the weapon.\n            (3) An attack by terrorists using a radiological dispersion \n        device, lumped radioactive sources, an improvised nuclear \n        device (IND), or a stolen nuclear weapon is a plausible event.\n            (4) Such an attack could cause catastrophic economic and \n        social damage and could kill large numbers of Americans.\n            (5) The first line of defense against both nuclear and \n        radiological terrorism is preventing the acquisition of \n        radioactive sources, special nuclear material, or nuclear \n        weapons by terrorists.\n\nSEC. 3.
