FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Chapter 2205 of title 36, United States Code (commonly \n        referred to as the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act), \n        requires the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to obtain \n        for the United States ``the most competent representation \n        possible in each event of the Olympic Games''.\n            (2) A traditional route in the United States to \n        participation in the Olympic Games has been participation in \n        athletics at United States four-year colleges and universities.\n            (3) United States four-year colleges and universities are \n        producing a much smaller number of participants in certain \n        sports of the Olympic Games than they have in the past. A 2001 \n        report of the General Accounting Office entitled \n        ``Intercollegiate Athletics: Four-Year Colleges' Experiences \n        Adding and Discontinuing Teams'' reveals that, between 1981 and \n        1999, in five Olympic women's sports--gymnastics, fencing, \n        field hockey, archery, and badminton--and eleven Olympic men's \n        sports--wrestling, tennis, gymnastics, rifle/shooting, fencing, \n        outdoor track, swimming, skiing, ice hockey, water polo, and \n        archery--discontinuations of teams by such colleges and \n        universities have resulted in a net loss in the number of such \n        teams nationwide. The largest percentage loss in such teams \n        occurred in women's gymnastics (a 53 percent loss) and in men's \n        wrestling (a 40 percent loss). The report also indicates that \n        while the number of women participating in college athletics \n        increased between 1981 and 1999, the number of men \n        participating in college athletics in 1999 still significantly \n        exceeded the number of women participating in college athletics \n        in that year.\n            (4) According to the report, such discontinuations stem \n        from declining student interest in the Olympic sports referred \n        to in paragraph (3) and from administrative decisions of \n        colleges and universities regarding the allocation of \n        resources.\n            (5) While there has been a loss of teams at colleges and \n        universities in the Olympic sports referred to in paragraph \n        (3), three other Olympic sports, called ``Emerging Sports for \n        Women'' by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, have \n        yet to be fully established. These sports are team handball, \n        synchronized swimming, and equestrian. These sports merit \n        additional support if the USOC is to meet the basic requirement \n        referred to in paragraph (1).\n            (6) Because the Olympic sports referred to in paragraphs \n        (3) and (5) tend not to generate revenue for colleges and \n        universities, such sports have little leverage in decisions of \n        colleges and universities about the allocation of their \n        resources for sports programs.\n            (7) The discontinuation by colleges and universities of \n        teams in the Olympic sports referred to in paragraphs (3) \n        disrupts the amateur careers of athletes participating in such \n        sports and makes it more difficult for the USOC to fulfill one \n        of its primary missions.\n            (8) In addition to the basic requirement referred to in \n        paragraph (1), the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act \n        also identifies other objectives of the USOC, including--\n                    (A) that it ``assist organizations and persons \n                concerned with sports in the development of amateur \n                athletic programs for amateur athletes'';\n                    (B) that it ``encourage and provide assistance to \n                amateur athletic activities for women''; and\n                    (C) that it ``encourage and provide assistance to \n                amateur athletes of racial and ethnic minorities for \n                the purpose of eliciting the participation of such \n                minorities in amateur athletic activities in which they \n                are underrepresented''.\n            (9) Due to a lack of public dissemination of data collected \n        by the Department of Education under the Equity in Athletics \n        Disclosure Act, prospective student-athletes often lack \n        information to determine what athletic opportunities colleges \n        and universities provide their students.\n            (10) According the report referred to in paragraph (3), \n        colleges and universities often discontinue sports teams in a \n        manner that gives student-athletes no advance notice of \n        consideration of such discontinuations and no opportunity for \n        appeal of the decision--thereby disrupting the amateur careers \n        affected by such discontinuations.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage United States \nrepresentation in the events of the Olympic Games by--\n            (1) promoting the revitalization of amateur athletics; and\n            (2) encouraging amateur careers in athletics.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS FOR SUPPORT OF CERTAIN AMATEUR ATHLETICS.\n\n    (a) Authority.--Chapter 2205 of title 36, United States Code \n(commonly referred to as the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports \nAct), is amended by adding at the end the following new subchapter:\n\n                    ``SUBCHAPTER III--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n``Sec. 220541.
