DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Qualified desalination facility.--The term ``qualified \n        desalination facility'' means a facility that--\n                    (A) produces for sale to domestic customers \n                desalinated seawater, brackish groundwater, or surface \n                water whose source water is greater than 1000 \n                milligrams per liter total dissolved solids;\n                    (B) is owned or operated by--\n                            (i) a State or any political subdivision, \n                        agency, authority, or instrumentality of a \n                        State;\n                            (ii) an Indian tribe; or\n                            (iii) a corporation responsible for \n                        providing municipal water service pursuant to \n                        State or tribal law;\n                    (C) is first used to produce commercial desalinated \n                water for sale during the 10-year period beginning on \n                October 1 of the first fiscal year occurring after the \n                date of enactment of this Act; and\n                    (D) uses the best available technology as \n                determined by the Secretary.\n            (2) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n        meaning given that term in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-\n        Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)).\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n            (4) State.--The term ``State'' means the several States, \n        the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the \n        Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nSEC. 3.
