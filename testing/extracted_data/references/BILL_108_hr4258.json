FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The possibility exists today that terrorists or others \n        who intend harm to United States forces deployed abroad or to \n        the homeland will use techniques in biotechnology to enhance \n        the transmissibility, stability, virulence, or host range of a \n        biological agent, or to render existing diagnostic, \n        therapeutic, and vaccine strategies or innate immune responses \n        against a biological agent less effective.\n            (2) This possibility will likely grow over time as such \n        techniques develop, improve, and spread as an inevitable result \n        of biotechnology innovation.\n            (3) Natural processes can also lead to the emergence of \n        previously unknown and harmful pathogens or render known \n        pathogens resistant to existing diagnostic, therapeutic, or \n        adaptive immune approaches.\n            (4) Long delays in developing new and effective responses \n        to pathogens are typical. The discovery, development, and \n        approval process for new drugs and vaccines typically requires \n        10 to 20 years and costs an average of $800 million. These \n        constraints reflect the long, costly research and development \n        process, including the failure of most drug or vaccine \n        candidates to demonstrate favorable characteristics in pre-\n        clinical testing, as well as the expensive, time-consuming \n        clinical trials required to prove the safety and effectiveness \n        of new treatments.\n            (5) Congress has already authorized the abridgement of the \n        long testing and approval process required to ensure safety and \n        efficacy under the emergency conditions of a severe outbreak of \n        a harmful pathogen. However, it will likely still take years \n        for even an experimental treatment or vaccine to become \n        available.\n            (6) There is no coordinated, focused research and \n        development program or overall national strategy to achieve \n        significant and dramatic reductions in the timeframe from the \n        identification of a pathogen to the development and emergency \n        approval for human use of reasonably safe and effective new \n        biodefense medical countermeasures against a previously unknown \n        or engineered pathogen or toxin.\n            (7) Even utilizing existing technologies, there is no \n        organized capability in the public or private sector to rapidly \n        screen drug candidates for potential therapeutic activity \n        against pathogens, develop and manufacture drug, biological, or \n        medical device products, or test already approved treatments \n        for efficacy against a previously unknown or engineered \n        biological threat that puts our deployed armed forces or the \n        homeland at risk.\n            (8) In the area of infectious disease in particular, \n        private sector firms are abandoning all types of innovation and \n        research and development in favor of investments in more \n        profitable medical markets.\n            (9) Tremendous potential exists for benefits to health by \n        concerted, targeted public-private investment to dramatically \n        reduce the timeframe for the development of new \n        countermeasures. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology \n        industries are fundamentally innovative and are quick to \n        integrate new technologies. Useful and important discoveries \n        and technological advances will be rapidly absorbed by the \n        private sector, leading to faster delivery of new medicines and \n        reductions in the costs of drug development.\n    (b) Policy.--The Congress hereby declares it to be the national \npolicy of the United States to promote technological advancements that \nwill dramatically reduce the timeframe for the development of new \nmedical countermeasures to treat or prevent disease caused by \ninfectious disease agents or toxins that, through natural processes or \nintentional introduction, may pose a significant risk to public health \nnow or in the future.\n\nSEC. 3.
