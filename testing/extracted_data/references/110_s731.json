    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Carbon Dioxide Storage \nCapacity Assessment Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Assessment.--The term ``assessment'' means the national \n        assessment of geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide \n        completed under this Act.\n            (2) Capacity; geological storage capacity.--The terms \n        ``capacity'' and ``geological storage capacity'' mean the \n        portion of a storage formation that can retain carbon dioxide \n        under the parameters (including physical, geological, and \n        economic parameters) established under the methodology \n        developed under this Act.\n            (3) Engineered hazards.--The term ``engineered hazards'' \n        includes the location and completion history of any well that \n        could affect potential storage.\n            (4) Risk.--The term ``risk'' includes risks posed by \n        geomechanical, geochemical, hydrogeological, structural, and \n        engineered hazards.\n            (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United \n        States Geological Survey.\n            (6) Storage formation.--The term ``storage formation'' \n        means a saline formation, unmineable coal seam, or oil or gas \n        reservoir capable of accommodating a volume of industrial \n        carbon dioxide.\n\nSEC. 3. METHODOLOGY FOR NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF GEOLOGICAL STORAGE \n              CAPACITY FOR CARBON DIOXIDE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 270 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall develop a methodology for \nconducting a national assessment of the geological storage capacity for \ncarbon dioxide.\n    (b) Potential Storage Formations.--In developing the methodology \nunder this section, the Secretary shall consider--\n            (1) the geographic extent of all potential storage \n        formations in all 50 States;\n            (2) the capacity of the potential storage formations;\n            (3) the injectivity of the potential storage formations;\n            (4) an estimate of potential volumes of oil and gas \n        recoverable by injection and storage of industrial carbon \n        dioxide in potential storage formations; and\n            (5) the risk associated with the potential storage \n        formations.\n    (c) Coordination.--\n            (1) Federal coordination.--\n                    (A) Consultation.--The Secretary shall consult with \n                the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the \n                Environmental Protection Agency on issues of data \n                sharing, format, development of the methodology, and \n                content of the assessment required under this Act to \n                ensure the maximum usefulness and success of the \n                assessment.\n                    (B) Cooperation.--The Secretary of Energy and the \n                Administrator shall cooperate with the Secretary to \n                ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, the \n                usefulness and success of the assessment.\n            (2) State coordination.--The Secretary shall consult with \n        State geological surveys and other relevant entities to ensure, \n        to the maximum extent practicable, the usefulness and success \n        of the assessment.\n    (d) Opportunity for Review and Comment.--During the period \nbeginning on the date that is 270 days after the date of enactment of \nthis Act and ending not less than 45 days, and not more than 90 days, \nafter the commencement of the assessment, the Secretary shall provide \nthe heads of stakeholder Federal agencies, the heads of State land \nmanagement agencies, industry stakeholders, and the public with an \nopportunity to review and comment on the proposed methodology developed \nunder subsection (a).\n    (e) Independent Verification.--During the period described in \nsubsection (d), the Secretary shall convene a committee of subject \nmatter experts composed of representatives of Federal agencies, \ninstitutions of higher education, nongovernmental organizations, State \norganizations, industry, and international geoscience organizations to \nconduct a review of the methodology for capacity and risk estimation \nrequired to carry out this section.\n    (f) Final Publication.--Not later than 90 days after the period \ndescribed in subsection (d), the Secretary shall--\n            (1) publish in the Federal Register a description of the \n        final methodology to be used for conducting the national \n        assessment of the geological storage capacity for carbon \n        dioxide required under subsection (a), taking into account any \n        comments received under subsection (d) and the methodology \n        review conducted under subsection (e); and\n            (2) issue a public report that responds to the comments \n        received under subsection (d) and the methodology review under \n        subsection (e).\n\nSEC. 4. COMPLETION OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF GEOLOGICAL STORAGE \n              CAPACITY FOR CARBON DIOXIDE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of final \npublication of the methodology, the Secretary shall complete a national \nassessment of geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide using the \nmethodology developed under section 3.\n    (b) Database.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a database \n        on the Internet accessible to the public that provides the \n        results of the assessment required under this section, \n        including a detailed description of the data collected under \n        the assessment.\n            (2) Data.--The database shall include the data necessary to \n        rank potential storage sites for capacity and risk, across the \n        United States, within each State, by formation, and within each \n        basin.\n    (c) Report.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date on \n        which the assessment required under this section is completed, \n        the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of \n        Congress and the President a report that describes the findings \n        of the assessment.\n            (2) Public availability.--The Secretary shall make the \n        report required under this subsection available on the \n        Internet.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act \n$20,000,000 for the period beginning on October 1 of the first full \nfiscal year after the date of enactment of this Act and ending 4 years \nthereafter."
