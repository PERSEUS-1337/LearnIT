    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``American Indian \nEqual Justice Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) a universal principle of simple justice and accountable \n        government requires that all persons be afforded legal remedies \n        for violations of their legal rights;\n            (2) the fifth amendment of the Constitution builds upon \n        that principle by guaranteeing that ``. . . no person shall be \n        deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of \n        law'';\n            (3) sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine that has its \n        origins in feudal England when it was policy that the ``King \n        could do no wrong'', affronts that principle and is \n        incompatible with the rule of law in democratic society;\n            (4) for more than a century, the Government of the United \n        States and the States have dramatically scaled back the \n        doctrine of sovereign immunity without impairing their dignity, \n        sovereignty, or ability to conduct valid government policies;\n            (5) the only remaining governments in the United States \n        that maintain and assert the full scope of immunity from \n        lawsuits are Indian tribal governments;\n            (6) according to the 1990 decennial census conducted by the \n        Bureau of the Census, nearly half of the individuals residing \n        on Indian reservations are non-Indian;\n            (7) for the non-Indian individuals referred to in paragraph \n        (6) and the thousands of people of the United States, Indian \n        and non-Indian, who interact with tribal governments everyday, \n        the rights to due process and legal remedy are constantly at \n        risk because of tribal immunity;\n            (8) by providing a complete shield from legal claims, the \n        doctrine of sovereign immunity frustrates justice and provokes \n        social tensions and turmoil inimical to social peace;\n            (9) the Supreme Court has affirmed that Congress has clear \n        and undoubted constitutional authority to define, limit, or \n        waive the immunity of Indian tribes; and\n            (10) it is necessary to address the issue referred to in \n        paragraph (9) in order to--\n                    (A) secure the rights provided under the \n                Constitution for all persons; and\n                    (B) uphold the principle that no government should \n                be above the law.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist in ensuring due \nprocess and legal rights throughout the United States and to strengthen \nthe rule of law by making Indian tribal governments subject to judicial \nreview with respect to certain civil matters.\n\nSEC. 2.
