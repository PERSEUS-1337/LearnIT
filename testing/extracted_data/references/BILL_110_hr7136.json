FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n        citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates offenders \n        into free society, helping to enhance public safety.\n            (2) Article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the United \n        States grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over Federal \n        elections, an authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the \n        Supreme Court.\n            (3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal \n        protection require an equal opportunity for Americans to vote \n        in Federal elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or \n        denied by the United States or by any State on account of race, \n        color, gender or previous condition of servitude. The 14th and \n        15th Amendments to the Constitution empower Congress to enact \n        measures to protect the right to vote in Federal elections.\n            (4) There are three areas where discrepancies in State laws \n        regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in Federal \n        elections: (A) there is no uniform standard for voting in \n        Federal elections which leads to an unfair disparity and \n        unequal participation in Federal elections based solely on \n        where a person lives; (B) laws governing the restoration of \n        voting rights after a felony conviction are unequal throughout \n        the country and persons in some States can easily regain their \n        voting rights while in other States persons effectively lose \n        their right to vote permanently; and (C) State \n        disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact racial ethnic \n        minorities.\n            (5) Disenfranchisement results from varying State laws that \n        restrict voting while under some form of criminal justice \n        supervision or after the completion of a felony sentence in \n        some States. Two States do not disenfranchise felons at all \n        (Maine and Vermont). Forty-eight States and the District of \n        Columbia have disenfranchisement laws that deprive convicted \n        offenders of the right to vote while they are in prison. In \n        thirty-five States, convicted offenders may not vote while they \n        are on parole and thirty of these States disenfranchise felony \n        probationers as well. In ten States, a conviction can result in \n        lifetime disenfranchisement.\n            (6) An estimated 5,300,000 Americans, or about one in \n        forty-one adults, currently cannot vote as a result of a felony \n        conviction. Nearly 4,000,000 (74 percent) of the 5,300,000 \n        disqualified voters are not in prison, but are on probation or \n        parole, or are ex-offenders. Approximately 2,000,000 of those \n        individuals are individuals who have completed their entire \n        sentence, including probation and parole, yet remain \n        disenfranchised.\n            (7) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders, the \n        right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this \n        possibility is often illusory. Offenders must either obtain a \n        pardon or order from the Governor or action by the parole or \n        pardon board, depending on the offense and State. Offenders \n        convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers \n        to regaining voting rights.\n            (8) In at least 16 States, Federal offenders cannot use the \n        State procedure for restoring their civil rights. The only \n        method provided by Federal law for restoring voting rights to \n        ex-offenders is a Presidential pardon. Few persons who seek to \n        have their right to vote restored have the financial and \n        political resources needed to succeed.\n            (9) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n        ethnic minorities. Thirteen percent of the African American \n        adult male population, or 1,400,000 African American men, are \n        disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, three in \n        ten of the next generation of black men will be disenfranchised \n        at some point during their lifetime. Hispanic citizens are also \n        disproportionately disenfranchised since they are \n        disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system.\n            (10) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a \n        felony offense and who are living and working in the community \n        serves no compelling State interest and hinders their \n        rehabilitation and reintegration into society.\n            (11) State disenfranchisement laws suppress electoral \n        participation among eligible voters and damage the integrity of \n        the electoral process. State disenfranchisement laws \n        significantly impact the rate of electoral participation among \n        the children of disenfranchised parents.\n            (12) The United States in the only Western democracy that \n        permits the permanent denial of voting rights to individuals \n        with felony convictions.\n\nSEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n    The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United States to \nvote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged \nbecause that individual has been convicted of a criminal offense unless \nsuch individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional \ninstitution or facility at the time of the election.\n\nSEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Attorney General.--The Attorney General may, in a civil action, \nobtain such declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to remedy \na violation of this Act.\n    (b) Private Right of Action.--\n            (1) A person who is aggrieved by a violation of this Act \n        may provide written notice of the violation to the chief \n        election official of the State involved.\n            (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the violation \n        is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice under \n        paragraph (1), or within 20 days after receipt of the notice if \n        the violation occurred within 120 days before the date of an \n        election for Federal office, the aggrieved person may, in a \n        civil action obtain declaratory or injunctive relief with \n        respect to the violation.\n            (3) If the violation occurred within 30 days before the \n        date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person \n        need not provide notice to the chief election official of the \n        State under paragraph (1) before bringing a civil action to \n        obtain declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the \n        violation.\n\nSEC. 5.
