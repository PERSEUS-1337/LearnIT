FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Nation's beaches are a valuable public resource \n        used for recreation by millions of people annually;\n            (2) the beaches of coastal States are hosts to many out-of-\n        State and international visitors;\n            (3) tourism in the coastal zone generates billions of \n        dollars annually;\n            (4) increased population has contributed to the decline in \n        the environmental quality of coastal waters;\n            (5) pollution in coastal waters is not restricted by State \n        and other political boundaries;\n            (6) coastal States have different methods of testing the \n        quality of coastal recreation waters, providing varying degrees \n        of protection to the public;\n            (7) the adoption of consistent criteria by coastal States \n        for monitoring the quality of coastal recreation waters, and \n        the posting of signs at beaches notifying the public during \n        periods when the standards are exceeded, would enhance public \n        health and safety; and\n            (8) while the adoption of such criteria will enhance public \n        health and safety, exceedances of such criteria should be \n        addressed, where feasible, as part of a watershed approach to \n        effectively identify and eliminate sources of pollution.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require uniform \ncriteria and procedures for testing, monitoring, and posting of coastal \nrecreation waters at beaches open for use by the public to protect \npublic safety and improve environmental quality.\n\nSEC. 3. ADOPTION OF COASTAL RECREATIONAL WATER QUALITY CRITERIA BY \n              STATES.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--A State shall adopt water quality criteria for \ncoastal recreation waters which, at a minimum, are consistent with the \ncriteria published by the Administrator under section 304(a)(1) of the \nFederal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)) not later \nthan 3\\1/2\\ years following the date of the enactment of this Act. Such \nwater quality criteria shall be developed and promulgated in accordance \nwith the requirements of section 303(c) of the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (33 U.S.C. 1313(c)). A State shall incorporate such \ncriteria into all appropriate programs into which such State would \nincorporate other water quality criteria adopted under such section \n303(c) and revise such criteria not later than 3 years following the \ndate of publication of revisions by the Administrator under section \n4(b) of this Act.\n    (b) Failure of States To Adopt.--If a State has not complied with \nsubsection (a) by the last day of the 3\\1/2\\-year period beginning on \nthe date of the enactment of this Act, the water quality criteria \nissued by the Administrator under section 304(a)(1) of the Federal \nWater Pollution Control Act shall become applicable as the water \nquality criteria for coastal recreational waters for the State, and \nshall be deemed to have been promulgated by the Administrator pursuant \nto section 303(c)(4).\n\nSEC. 4. REVISIONS TO WATER QUALITY CRITERIA.\n\n    (a) Studies.--After consultation with appropriate Federal, State, \nand local officials, including local health officials, and other \ninterested persons, but not later than the last day of the 3-year \nperiod beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the \nAdministrator shall conduct, in cooperation with the Under Secretary of \nCommerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, studies to provide additional \ninformation to the current base of knowledge for use in developing--\n            (1) a more complete list of potential health risks, \n        including effects to the upper respiratory system;\n            (2) better indicators for directly detecting or predicting \n        in coastal recreational waters the presence of pathogens which \n        are harmful to human health; and\n            (3) more expeditious methods (including predictive models) \n        for detecting in coastal recreation waters the presence of \n        pathogens which are harmful to human health.\n    (b) Revised Criteria.--Based on the results of the studies \nconducted under subsection (a), the Administrator, after consultation \nwith appropriate Federal, State, and local officials, including local \nhealth officials, shall issue, within 5 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act (and review and revise from time to time \nthereafter, but in no event less than once every 5 years) revised water \nquality criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters that are \nharmful to human health, including a revised list of indicators and \ntesting methods.\n\nSEC. 5. COASTAL BEACH WATER QUALITY MONITORING.\n\n    Title IV of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n1341-1345) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 406.
