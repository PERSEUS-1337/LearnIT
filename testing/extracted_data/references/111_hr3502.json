FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mitochondrial disease results when there is a defect \n        that reduces the ability of the mitochondria in a cell to \n        produce energy. As the mitochondria fail to produce enough \n        energy, the cell will cease to function properly and will \n        eventually die. Organ systems will begin to fail, and the life \n        of the individual is compromised or ended.\n            (2) There are more than 40 specifically identified \n        mitochondrial diseases, but the vast majority have not yet been \n        identified.\n            (3) Mitochondrial diseases are a relatively newly diagnosed \n        group of diseases, first recognized in the late 1960s. \n        Diagnosis is extremely difficult for a number of reasons.\n            (4) Mitochondrial diseases can present themselves at any \n        age, with associated mortality rates that vary depending upon \n        the particular disease. The most severe diseases result in \n        progressive loss of neurological and liver function, and death \n        within several years.\n            (5) According to the National Institute of Environmental \n        Health Sciences, half of those affected by mitochondrial \n        disease are children, who show symptoms before age five and \n        approximately 80 percent of whom will not survive beyond the \n        age of 20.\n            (6) Mitochondrial dysfunction is also associated with \n        numerous other related disorders, including many common \n        neurological diseases (such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, \n        and autism), and other diseases associated with aging, \n        diabetes, cancer, and obesity.\n            (7) Mitochondrial disease is most commonly the result of \n        genetic mutation, either in the nuclear DNA or in the \n        mitochondrial DNA. Some mitochondrial diseases also are \n        attributable to environmental factors, including prescription \n        medications, that interfere with mitochondrial function.\n            (8) Researchers estimate that one in 4,000 children will \n        develop a mitochondrial disease related to an inherited \n        mutation by the age of 10 years, and that 1,000-2,000 children \n        are born each year in the United States who will develop \n        mitochondrial disease in their lifetimes. However, studies of \n        umbilical cord blood samples show that one in 200 children are \n        born with both normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA, and the \n        number of children with these mutations who actually develop a \n        disease is unknown.\n            (9) There are no cures for any of the specifically \n        identified mitochondrial diseases, nor is there a specific \n        treatment for any of these diseases.\n            (10) Improving our basic understanding of mitochondrial \n        function and dysfunction has potential application to numerous \n        areas of biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health \n        has taken an increased interest in mitochondrial disease and \n        dysfunction and has sponsored a number of activities in recent \n        years aimed at advancing mitochondrial medicine, including \n        incorporating research into functional variation in \n        mitochondria in the Transformative Research Grants Initiative.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote an enhanced \nresearch effort aimed at improved understanding of mitochondrial \ndisease and dysfunction and the development of treatments for \nmitochondrial disease.\n\nSEC. 3.
