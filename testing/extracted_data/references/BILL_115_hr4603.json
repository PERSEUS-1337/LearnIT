FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On April 2015, the United Nations Security Council \n        adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216 by 14 \n        affirmative votes to none against, with one abstention (by the \n        Russian Federation), imposing sanctions on individuals \n        undermining the stability of Yemen, and demanded that the \n        Houthis withdraw from all areas seized during the latest \n        conflict, relinquish arms seized from military and security \n        institutions, cease all actions falling exclusively within the \n        authority of the legitimate Government of Yemen, and fully \n        implement previous Security Council resolutions.\n            (2) On May 16, 2012, the Obama administration issued \n        Executive Order 13611 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to \n        Blocking Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, \n        or Stability of Yemen), imposing sanctions on persons that \n        ``have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the \n        peace, security, or stability of Yemen, such as acts that \n        obstruct the implementation of the agreement of November 23, \n        2011, between the Government of Yemen and those in opposition \n        to it, which provides for a peaceful transition of power in \n        Yemen, or that obstruct the political process in Yemen''.\n            (3) On November 10, 2014, the Obama administration \n        designated the leadership of the Iranian-supported Houthi \n        insurgent group, and their ally former Yemeni President Ali \n        Abdullah Saleh, for imposition of sanctions under Executive \n        Order 13611.\n            (4) Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has transferred \n        increasingly sophisticated weapons systems to the Houthis, who \n        have in turn shot missiles into Saudi Arabia from positions in \n        northern Yemen, including a missile in November 2017 that \n        targeted Riyadh International Airport. In response, Ambassador \n        Nikki Haley called on ``the United Nations and international \n        partners to take necessary action to hold the Iranian regime \n        accountable for these violations''.\n            (5) In addition to weapons, Iran is reportedly providing \n        Afghan and Shi'ite Arab specialists, including Hizballah, to \n        train Houthi units and act as logistical advisers.\n            (6) The Iranian-supported Houthis have attacked coalition \n        or coalition-affiliated maritime targets multiple times, a \n        United States Navy ship twice, and other shipping, forcing the \n        United States to respond with a combination of diplomacy and \n        calibrated military strikes against three radar facilities in \n        Houthi-controlled territory.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States to condemn Iranian \nactivities in Yemen in violation of United Nations Security Council \nResolution 2216 (2015), and call on all responsible countries to take \nappropriate and necessary measures against the Government of Iran, \nincluding the interdiction of Iranian weapons to the Houthis, and the \nbilateral and multilateral application of sanctions against Iran for \nits violations of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216.\n\nSEC. 4.
