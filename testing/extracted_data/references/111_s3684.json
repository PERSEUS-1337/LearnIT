    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of \n2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Cavernous angioma, also termed ``cerebral cavernous \n        malformations'' or ``CCM'', affects an estimated 1,500,000 \n        people in the United States.\n            (2) Cavernous angioma is a devastating blood vessel disease \n        that is characterized by the presence of vascular lesions that \n        develop and grow within the brain and spinal cord.\n            (3) Detection of cavernous angioma lesions is achieved \n        though costly and specialized medical imaging techniques.\n            (4) Cavernous angioma is a common type of vascular anomaly, \n        but individuals may not be aware that they have the disease \n        until the onset of serious clinical symptoms.\n            (5) Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may \n        experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden \n        death.\n            (6) Due to limited research with respect to cavernous \n        angioma, there is no treatment regimen for the disease other \n        than brain and spinal surgery.\n            (7) Some individuals with cavernous angioma are not \n        candidates for brain surgery, and no treatment option is \n        available for such individuals.\n            (8) There is a shortage of physicians who are familiar with \n        cavernous angioma and affected individuals may find it \n        difficult to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate care.\n            (9) Due to the presence of a specific disease-causing \n        mutation, termed the ``common Hispanic mutation'' that has \n        passed through as many as 17 generations of Americans descended \n        from the original Spanish settlers of the Southwest in the \n        1590s, New Mexico has the highest population density of \n        cavernous angioma in the world. Cavernous angioma affects tens \n        of thousands of individuals in New Mexico.\n            (10) Other States with high rates of cavernous angioma \n        include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado.\n            (11) Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, agreed to May \n        13, 2009, which was adopted unanimously, expresses the sense of \n        the Senate that there is a critical need to increase research, \n        awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous \n        malformations.\n            (12) The National Institutes of Health promotes advances in \n        biomedical research by supporting extramural research at \n        institutes of higher education, in part through extramural \n        centers of excellence. These centers promote research through a \n        multidisciplinary, team-based approach in order to better \n        understand complex biomedical systems and translate basic \n        scientific discoveries into useful clinical applications.\n            (13) To address the public health threat posed by cavernous \n        angioma in New Mexico and throughout the United States, there \n        is a need for a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, \n        Research, and Education Center in order to provide a model \n        medical system for other such centers, to facilitate medical \n        research to develop a cure for cavernous angioma, and to \n        enhance the medical care of individuals with cavernous angioma \n        nationwide.\n            (14) Given the existing programs and expertise at the \n        University of New Mexico, the first coordinated, centralized \n        Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and \n        Education Center should be established at the University of New \n        Mexico.\n\nSEC. 3. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER.\n\n    Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 409K.
