FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) drought, population increases, and environmental needs \n        are exacerbating water supply issues across the western United \n        States, including on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation in \n        southwestern Colorado;\n            (2)(A) a report of the Government Accountability Office \n        dated 2006 identified significant issues with the Pine River \n        Indian Irrigation Project, including the issue that, at the \n        time of the study, the Bureau of Indian Affairs estimated that \n        total deferred maintenance costs for the Project exceeded \n        $20,000,000; and\n            (B) other estimates have placed those costs at more than \n        $60,000,000;\n            (3) the report of the Government Accountability Office \n        demonstrates that key facilities of the Project are severely \n        deteriorated;\n            (4) operations and maintenance fees are not sufficient to \n        address the condition of the Project, even though the Bureau of \n        Indian Affairs has sought to double those fees, from $8.50 to \n        $17, in recent years;\n            (5) the report of the Government Accountability Office also \n        notes that a prior study done by the Bureau of Reclamation \n        determined that water users could not afford to pay operations \n        and maintenance fees of $8.50 and operate a profitable farming \n        operation;\n            (6) the benefits of rehabilitating and repairing the \n        irrigation infrastructure of the Project include--\n                    (A) water conservation;\n                    (B) extending available water supply;\n                    (C) increased agricultural production;\n                    (D) economic benefits;\n                    (E) safer facilities; and\n                    (F) the preservation of the culture of the Southern \n                Ute Indian Tribe;\n            (7) while, as of the date of enactment of this Act, the \n        Project is managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the \n        Southern Ute Indian Tribe also receives water from facilities \n        owned or operated by the Bureau of Reclamation; and\n            (8) rehabilitation and repair of the infrastructure of the \n        Project by the Bureau of Reclamation would improve--\n                    (A) overall water management; and\n                    (B) the ability of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe \n                and the Bureau of Reclamation to address potential \n                water conflicts.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require the Secretary \nof the Interior--\n            (1) to assess the condition of infrastructure of the Pine \n        River Indian Irrigation Project;\n            (2) to establish priorities for the rehabilitation of \n        irrigation infrastructure within the Project according to \n        specified criteria; and\n            (3) to implement rehabilitation activities for the \n        irrigation infrastructure of the Project.\n\nSEC. 3.
