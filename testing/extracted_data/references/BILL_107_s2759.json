FINDINGS\n\n    (a) Chloramphenicol, a potent antibiotic, can cause severe toxic \neffects in humans, including hypo-aplastic anemia, which is usually \nirreversible and fatal. The drug is administered to humans only in \nlife-threatening situations when less toxic drugs are not effective.\n    (b) Because of these human health impacts, chloramphenicol and \nsimilar drugs are not approved for use in food-producing animals in the \nUnited States. However, other countries have been found to use these \ndrugs in the aquaculture of shrimp and other seafood, including \nThailand, Vietnam, and China.\n    (c) The majority of shrimp consumed by the United States is \nimported. The nation imports 400,000 metric tons of shrimp annually, \nand the percentage of shrimp imports rises each year. Thailand and \nVietnam are the top two exporters of shrimp to the United States, and \nChina is the fifth largest exporter of shrimp to the United States.\n    (d) Upon detection of chloramphenicol in certain shipments of \nseafood from China and other nations, in 2002 the European Union and \nCanada severely restricted imports of shrimp and other food from these \nnations.\n    (e) The United States Food and Drug Administration inspects only 2 \npercent of all seafood imports into the United States and utilizes a \ntesting procedure that cannot detect the presence of chloramphenicol \nbelow 1 part per billion. The European Union and Canada use testing \nprotocols that can detect such substances to 0.3 parts per billion.\n    (f) While Food and Drug Administration import testing did not \ndetect chloramphenicol in shrimp imported from these nations in 2002, \nindependent testing performed by the state of Louisiana detected \nchloramphenicol at a level of over 2 parts per billion in crawfish \nimported from China.\n    (g) Imports of seafood from nations that utilize substances banned \nin the United States pose potential threats to United States consumers. \nDenial of entry to contaminated shrimp and other products to the \nEuropean Union and Canada will likely redirect imports to the United \nStates of contaminated products turned away from these countries.\n    (h) Immediate and focused actions must be taken by the Federal \ngovernment to improve enforcement of food import restrictions of \nseafood imports in order to protect United States consumers and ensure \nsafety of the food supply.\n\nSEC. 3. CONTAMINATED SEAFOOD.\n\n    Section 801 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n381) is amended by--\n            (1) striking all of the text in the third sentence of \n        subsection (a) after ``section 505,'' and inserting ``or (4) \n        such article is seafood that appears to bear or contain one or \n        more substances listed in section 530.41(a) of title 21, Code \n        of Federal Regulations, or (5) such article is seafood \n        originating from an exporter or country that the Secretary has \n        identified in guidance as a likely source of articles subject \n        to refusal of admission under clause (4) of this sentence, then \n        such article shall be refused admission, except as provided in \n        subsection (c) of this section and, with respect to articles \n        subject to clause (5) of this sentence, except as provided in \n        subsection (b) of this section.'';\n            (2) redesignating subsections (b) through (n) as \n        subsections (c) through (o), respectively; and\n            (3) inserting after subsection (a) the following:\n    ``(b)(1) Notwithstanding clause (5) of the third sentence in \nsubsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may permit individual \nshipments of seafood originating in a country or from an exporter \nlisted in guidance to be admitted into the United States if evidence \nacceptable to the Secretary is presented that the seafood in that \nshipment does not bear or contain a substance listed in section \n530.41(a) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations.\n    ``(2) The Secretary may remove a country or exporter listed in \nguidance under clause (5) of the third sentence of subsection (a) of \nthis section only if the country or exporter has shown to the \nsatisfaction of the Secretary that each substance at issue is no longer \nsold for use in, being used in, or being used in a manner that could \ncontaminate food-producing animals in the country at issue.''.\n\nSEC. 4. GUIDANCE FOR REFUSING ENTRY OF SEAFOOD FROM A COUNTRY OR \n              EXPORTER.\n\n    (a) Issuance of Guidance.--Upon a determination by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services that, based on information acceptable to the \nSecretary, an exporter or country appears to be a source of articles \nsubject to refusal under section 801(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(4)), the Secretary shall issue \nguidance described in section 801(a)(5) of that Act.\n    (b) Determination Criteria.--In making the determination described \nin subsection (a), or any determination under section 801(a) of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)), the Secretary \nmay consider--\n            (1) the detection of substances described in section \n        801(a)(4) of that Act by the Secretary;\n            (2) the detection of such substances by a person \n        commissioned to carry out examinations and investigations under \n        section 702(a) of that Act;\n            (3) findings from an inspection under section 704 of that \n        Act;\n            (4) the detection by other importing countries of such \n        substances in shipments of seafood that originate from such \n        country or exporter; and\n            (5) other evidence or information as determined by the \n        Secretary.\n    (c) Annual Report.--The Secretary shall provide a report within 30 \ndays after the end of each fiscal year to the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the House of Representatives \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce setting forth the names of all \ncountries and exporters for which the guidance described in subsection \n(a) was issued during that fiscal year.\n    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act, and no amendment \nmade by this Act, shall be construed to limit the existing authority of \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of the \nTreasury to consider any information or to refuse admission of any \narticle under section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (21 U.S.C. 381(a)).\n\nSEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF TOLERANCES.\n\n    If, after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services intends to issue a tolerance under section \n512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(b)) \nfor any of the substances listed in section 530.41(a) of title 21, Code \nof Federal Regulations, then the Secretary shall notify the Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Energy and Commerce before issuing that \ntolerance.
