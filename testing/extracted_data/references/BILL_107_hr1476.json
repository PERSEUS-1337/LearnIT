FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Kindergarten teachers estimate that 1 in 3 children \n        enters the classroom unprepared to meet the challenges of \n        school.\n            (2) A 1998 report regarding the prevention of reading \n        difficulties in young children found that--\n                    (A) preschool children need high quality language \n                and literacy environments in and out of their homes; \n                and\n                    (B) children need to arrive in the first grade with \n                strong language and cognitive skills and the motivation \n                to learn to read in order to benefit from classroom \n                instruction.\n            (3) The first 5 years is a very critical time in a child's \n        development, and a child's brain development is far more \n        susceptible to adverse influences than had been previously \n        realized.\n            (4) High quality prekindergarten programs can affect a \n        child's long-term success in areas such as school achievement, \n        higher earnings as adults, and decreased involvement with the \n        criminal justice system.\n            (5) Studies of several State prekindergarten initiatives \n        offer convincing evidence of the benefits of early education \n        for children at risk of school failure. These benefits include \n        higher mathematics and reading achievement, stronger learning \n        skills, increased creativity, better school attendance, \n        improved health, and greater involvement by parents in their \n        children's education.\n            (6) Only 1 State, Georgia, currently has a prekindergarten \n        initiative that is universally available to all children in the \n        State.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve school \nreadiness for young children by providing grants to States to assist in \nthe creation or expansion of early childhood education programs for \nchildren ages 5 and under.\n\nSEC. 2.
