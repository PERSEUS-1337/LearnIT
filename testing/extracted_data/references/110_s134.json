FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Public Law 87-590 (76 Stat. 389) authorized the \n        Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, including construction of the \n        Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline extending from Pueblo \n        Reservoir, Pueblo, Colorado to Lamar, Colorado;\n            (2) the Arkansas Valley Conduit was never built, partly \n        because of the inability of local communities to pay 100 \n        percent of the costs of construction of the Arkansas Valley \n        Conduit;\n            (3) in furtherance of the goals and authorization of the \n        Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, it is necessary to provide separate \n        authorization for the construction of the Arkansas Valley \n        Conduit;\n            (4) the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit is \n        necessary for the continued viability of southeast Colorado; \n        and\n            (5) the Arkansas Valley Conduit would provide the \n        communities of southeast Colorado with safe, clean, and \n        affordable water.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure a safe and adequate water supply for the \n        beneficiaries identified in Public Law 87-590 (76 Stat. 389) \n        and related authorizing documents and subsequent studies; and\n            (2) to establish a cost-sharing requirement for the \n        construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit.\n\nSEC. 3.
