FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) As there are over 45,000,000 individuals lacking health \n        insurance or who have inadequate health care coverage in the \n        United States, health centers under section 330 of the Public \n        Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b), including community health \n        centers, are increasingly called upon to provide care to the \n        uninsured and underinsured.\n            (2) These health centers are being challenged by increasing \n        financial pressures that jeopardize their ability to provide \n        access to health services for a number of large medically \n        underserved populations, including the elderly, the uninsured, \n        and lower-income individuals.\n            (3) Granting volunteer physician liability coverage through \n        the program under section 224(g) of the Public Health Service \n        Act (relating to the provisions of title 28, United States \n        Code, that are commonly referred to as the Federal Tort Claims \n        Act) (42 U.S.C. 233(g)) would significantly increase the number \n        of physicians available onsite at such health centers. Federal \n        studies have concluded that by offering liability coverage, \n        such centers are able to redirect funds to recruit full-time \n        physicians and provide needed health care services to their \n        communities.\n            (4) In addition, an increase in volunteer physicians at the \n        health centers will result in a direct improvement in the \n        ability of the centers to offer quality health care services \n        where the services are needed most.\n\nSEC. 3. HEALTH CENTERS UNDER PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT; LIABILITY \n              PROTECTIONS FOR VOLUNTEER PRACTITIONERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 224 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \nU.S.C. 233) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (g)(1)(A)--\n                    (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``or \n                employee'' and inserting ``employee, or (subject to \n                subsection (k)(4)) volunteer practitioner''; and\n                    (B) in the second sentence, by inserting ``and \n                subsection (k)(4)'' after ``subject to paragraph (5)''; \n                and\n            (2) in each of subsections (g), (i), (j), (k), (l), and \n        (m), by striking ``employee, or contractor'' each place such \n        term appears and inserting ``employee, volunteer practitioner, \n        or contractor''.\n    (b) Applicability; Definition.--Section 224(k) of the Public Health \nService Act (42 U.S.C. 233(k)) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing paragraph:\n    ``(4)(A) Subsections (g) through (m) apply with respect to \nvolunteer practitioners beginning with the first fiscal year for which \nan appropriations Act provides that amounts in the fund under paragraph \n(2) are available with respect to such practitioners.\n    ``(B) For purposes of subsections (g) through (m), the term \n`volunteer practitioner' means a practitioner who, with respect to an \nentity described in subsection (g)(4), meets the following conditions:\n            ``(i) The practitioner is a licensed physician or a \n        licensed clinical psychologist.\n            ``(ii) At the request of such entity, the practitioner \n        provides services to patients of the entity, at a site at which \n        the entity operates or at a site designated by the entity. The \n        weekly number of hours of services provided to the patients by \n        the practitioner is not a factor with respect to meeting \n        conditions under this subparagraph.\n            ``(iii) The practitioner does not for the provision of such \n        services receive any compensation from such patients, from the \n        entity, or from third-party payors (including reimbursement \n        under any insurance policy or health plan, or under any Federal \n        or State health benefits program).''.\n\nSEC. 4. STUDY ON ADEQUACY OF FUNDING FOR COVERAGE.\n\n    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall \nconduct a study concerning the adequacy of funding for liability \ncoverage through the program under section 224(g) of the Public Health \nService Act (relating to the provisions of title 28, United States \nCode, that are commonly referred to as the Federal Tort Claims Act) (42 \nU.S.C. 233(g)) for--\n            (1) public or nonprofit private entities receiving Federal \n        funds for health centers under section 330 of such Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 254b); and\n            (2) volunteer practitioners serving such health centers.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall prepare \nand submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report \ncontaining findings and recommendations from the study conducted under \nsubsection (a), including recommendations concerning the adequacy of \nthe funding described in subsection (a)."
