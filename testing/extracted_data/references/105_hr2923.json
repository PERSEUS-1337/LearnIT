    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Early Hearing Loss Detection, \nDiagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to authorize statewide early \ndetection, diagnosis, referral, and intervention networks, technical \nassistance, a national applied research program, and interagency and \nprivate sector collaboration for policy development, in order to assist \nthe States in making progress toward the following goals:\n            (1) All babies born in hospitals in the United States and \n        its territories should be screened for hearing loss before \n        leaving the hospital (unless the parents of the children object \n        to the screening).\n            (2) Babies who are not born in hospitals should be screened \n        within the first 3 months of life.\n            (3) Diagnostic audiologic testing, if indicated, should be \n        performed in a timely manner to allow appropriate referral for \n        treatment/intervention before the age of 6 months.\n            (4) All universal newborn hearing screening programs should \n        include a component which ensures linkage to diagnosis and the \n        community system of early intervention services.\n            (5) Public policy in early hearing detection, diagnosis, \n        and intervention should be based on applied research and the \n        recognition that infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf \n        or hard-of-hearing have unique language, learning, and \n        communication needs, and should be the result of consultation \n        with pertinent public and private sectors.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION \n              NETWORKS.\n\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this Act referred to \nas the ``Secretary''), acting through the Administrator of the Health \nResources and Services Administration, shall make awards of grants or \ncooperative agreements to develop statewide early detection, diagnosis, \nand intervention networks for the following purposes:\n            (1) To develop State capacity to support newborn hearing \n        loss detection, diagnosis, and intervention.\n            (2) To monitor the extent to which hearing detection is \n        conducted in birthing hospitals throughout the State, and \n        assist in the development of universal newborn hearing \n        detection programs in birthing hospitals and nonhospital \n        birthing sites.\n            (3) To develop statewide models which ensure effective \n        screening, referral, and linkage with appropriate diagnostic, \n        medical, and qualified early intervention services, providers, \n        and programs within the community.\n            (4) To collect data on statewide early detection, \n        diagnosis, and intervention that can be used for applied \n        research and policy development.\n\nSEC. 4. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND APPLIED RESEARCH.\n\n    (a) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.--The Secretary, \nacting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, shall make awards of grants or cooperative agreements to \nprovide technical assistance to State agencies to complement an \nintramural program and to conduct applied research related to infant \nhearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment/intervention. The program \nshall carry out the following:\n            (1) Provide technical assistance on data collection and \n        management.\n            (2) Develop standardized procedures for data management to \n        ensure quality monitoring of infant hearing loss detection, \n        diagnosis, and intervention programs.\n            (3) Study the costs and effectiveness of hearing detection \n        conducted by State-based programs in order to answer issues of \n        importance to national and State policymakers.\n            (4) Identify the causes and risk factors for congenital \n        hearing loss that might lead to the development of preventive \n        interventions.\n            (5) Study the effectiveness of early hearing detection, \n        diagnosis, and treatment/intervention programs by assessing the \n        health, developmental, cognitive, and language status of these \n        children at school age.\n            (6) Promote the sharing of data regarding early hearing \n        loss with State-based birth defects and developmental \n        disabilities monitoring programs for the purpose of identifying \n        previously unknown causes of hearing loss.\n    (b) National Institutes of Health.--The Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health, acting through the Director of the National \nInstitute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, shall for \npurposes of this Act carry out a program of research on the efficacy of \nnew screening techniques and technology, including clinical trials of \nscreening methods, studies on efficacy of intervention, and related \nbasic and applied research.\n\nSEC. 5.
