    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Prevent Iran from Acquiring Nuclear \nWeapons and Stop War Through Diplomacy Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech on December \n        10, 2009, President Obama said, ``I know that engagement with \n        repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation. \n        But I also know that sanctions without outreach--and \n        condemnation without discussion--can carry forward a crippling \n        status quo. No repressive regime can move down a new path \n        unless it has the choice of an open door.''\n            (2) In his address to the American Israel Public Affairs \n        Committee on March 4, 2012, President Obama said, ``I have said \n        that when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear \n        weapon, I will take no options off the table, and I mean what I \n        say. That includes all elements of American power. A political \n        effort aimed at isolating Iran; a diplomatic effort to sustain \n        our coalition and ensure that the Iranian program is monitored; \n        an economic effort to impose crippling sanctions; and, yes, a \n        military effort to be prepared for any contingency.''\n            (3) While the Obama Administration has rejected failed \n        policies of the past by engaging in negotiations with Iran \n        without preconditions, only four of such meetings have \n        occurred.\n            (4) Official representatives of the United States and \n        official representatives of Iran have held only two direct, \n        bilateral meetings in over 30 years, both of which occurred in \n        October 2009, one on the sidelines of the United Nations \n        Security Council negotiations in Geneva, and one on the \n        sidelines of negotiations brokered by the United Nations \n        International Atomic Energy Agency (referred to in this Act as \n        the ``IAEA'') in Vienna.\n            (5) All of the outstanding issues between the United States \n        and Iran cannot be resolved instantaneously. Resolving such \n        issues will require a robust, sustained effort.\n            (6) Under the Department of State's current ``no contact'' \n        policy, officers and employees of the Department of State are \n        not permitted to make any direct contact with official \n        representatives of the Government of Iran without express prior \n        authorization from the Secretary of State.\n            (7) On September 20, 2011, then-Chairman of the Joint \n        Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, called for establishing \n        direct communications with Iran, stating, ``I'm talking about \n        any channel that's open. We've not had a direct link of \n        communication with Iran since 1979. And I think that has \n        planted many seeds for miscalculation. When you miscalculate, \n        you can escalate and misunderstand.''\n            (8) On November 8, 2011, the IAEA issued a report about \n        Iran's nuclear program and expressed concerns about Iran's past \n        and ongoing nuclear activities.\n            (9) On December 2, 2011, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta \n        warned that an attack on Iran would result in ``an escalation \n        that would take place that would not only involve many lives, \n        but I think it could consume the Middle East in a confrontation \n        and a conflict that we would regret.''\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It should be the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to prevent Iran from pursuing or acquiring a nuclear \n        weapon and to resolve the concerns of the United States and of \n        the international community about Iran's nuclear program and \n        Iran's human rights obligations under international and Iranian \n        law;\n            (2) to ensure inspection of cargo to or from Iran, as well \n        as the seizure and disposal of prohibited items, as authorized \n        by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 (June 9, \n        2010);\n            (3) to pursue sustained, direct, bilateral negotiations \n        with the Government of Iran without preconditions in order to \n        reduce tensions, prevent war, prevent nuclear proliferation, \n        support human rights, and seek resolutions to issues that \n        concern the United States and the international community;\n            (4) to utilize all diplomatic tools, including direct \n        talks, targeted sanctions, Track II diplomacy, creating a \n        special envoy described in section 4, and enlisting the support \n        of all interested parties, for the purpose of establishing an \n        agreement with Iran to put in place a program that includes \n        international safeguards, guarantees, and robust transparency \n        measures that provide for full IAEA oversight of Iran's nuclear \n        program, including rigorous, ongoing inspections, in order to \n        verify that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful \n        purposes and that Iran is not engaged in nuclear weapons work;\n            (5) to pursue opportunities to build mutual trust and to \n        foster sustained negotiations in good faith with Iran, \n        including pursuing a fuel swap deal to remove quantities of low \n        enriched uranium from Iran and to refuel the Tehran Research \n        Reactor, similar to the structure of the deal that the IAEA, \n        the United States, China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, \n        and Germany first proposed in October 2009;\n            (6) to explore areas of mutual benefit to both Iran and the \n        United States, such as regional security, the long-term \n        stabilization of Iraq and Afghanistan, the establishment of a \n        framework for peaceful nuclear energy production, other \n        peaceful energy modernization programs, and counter-narcotics \n        efforts; and\n            (7) that no funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n        to any executive agency of the Government of the United States \n        may be used to carry out any military operation or activity \n        against Iran unless the President determines that a military \n        operation or activity is warranted and seeks express prior \n        authorization by Congress, as required under article I, section \n        8, clause 2 of the United States Constitution, which grants \n        Congress the sole authority to declare war, except that this \n        requirement shall not apply to a military operation or \n        activity--\n                    (A) to directly repel an offensive military action \n                launched from within the territory of Iran against the \n                United States or any ally with whom the United States \n                has a mutual defense assistance agreement;\n                    (B) in hot pursuit of forces that engage in an \n                offensive military action outside the territory of Iran \n                against United States forces or an ally with whom the \n                United States has a mutual defense assistance agreement \n                and then enter into the territory of Iran; or\n                    (C) to directly thwart an imminent offensive \n                military action to be launched from within the \n                territory of Iran against United States forces or an \n                ally with whom the United States has a mutual defense \n                assistance agreement.\n\nSEC. 4.
