FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that the conveyance of the Properties described in \nsection 4(b) to the Lessees of those Properties for fair market value \nwould have the beneficial results of--\n            (1) reducing Pick-Sloan project debt for the Canyon Ferry \n        Unit;\n            (2) providing a permanent source of funding for projects \n        that develop and maintain public recreation, and that conserve \n        and enhance fish and wildlife opportunities in the State of \n        Montana;\n            (3) reducing Federal payments in lieu of taxes and \n        associated management expenditures in connection with the \n        Government's ownership of the Properties while increasing local \n        tax revenues from the new owners; and\n            (4) eliminating expensive and contentious disputes between \n        the Secretary and leaseholders while ensuring that the Federal \n        Government receives full and fair value for the acquisition of \n        the Properties.\n\nSEC. 2.
