FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a prolonged and severe downturn in the market for \n        commercial space launches has resulted in--\n                    (A) a significant reduction in the United States \n                global market share in orbital space launches;\n                    (B) a severe decrease in the number of Government-\n                licensed orbital launches; and\n                    (C) a commercial space transportation industry \n                dependent upon Government business opportunities;\n            (2) the continuous reduction of cost and improvement in \n        safety and reliability of commercial space transportation \n        capabilities is a necessary ingredient to achieving most United \n        States space goals;\n            (3) the opening of outer space to the American people and \n        their economic, scientific, and cultural enterprises is a \n        priority goal which should guide Federal space investments, \n        policy development, and regulatory action;\n            (4) despite a weak United States launch industry, recent \n        industrial and technical developments indicate that commercial \n        suborbital human spaceflight vehicles are under active \n        development in both the United States and other nations, and \n        greater private investment in these development efforts will \n        promote greater innovation and competitiveness for the United \n        States commercial space transportation industry as a whole;\n            (5) space transportation is not without risks;\n            (6) a critical area of responsibility for the Office of the \n        Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation is \n        to ensure that the Federal regulation of this new commercial \n        suborbital human spaceflight industry should focus on \n        protecting the safety of the general, uninvolved public, while \n        allowing involved persons to assume risks which are inherent to \n        human spaceflight activities;\n            (7) enactment of a 3-year extension of the excess third \n        party claims payment provision of chapter 701 of title 49, \n        United States Code (Commercial Space Launch Activities) is \n        necessary to provide an appropriate period to evaluate \n        recommended changes to the Government's commercial space launch \n        indemnification regime;\n            (8) the Secretary of Transportation should establish \n        regulatory guidelines that foster an efficient and cost-\n        effective process for ensuring safe commercial space launch \n        operations at the Nation's launch ranges and bases; and\n            (9) the public interest is served by creating a clear legal \n        and regulatory regime for commercial space transportation, \n        including an unambiguous delineation of regulatory roles and \n        responsibilities.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) Authorization of Appropriations for Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation.--Section 70119 of title 49, United States Code, is \namended by striking paragraphs (1) and (2) and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) $11,523,000 for fiscal year 2004; and\n            ``(2) $11,000,000 for fiscal year 2005.''.\n    (b) Findings.--Section 70101(a) of title 49, United States Code, is \namended--\n            (1) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``human spaceflight,'' \n        after ``research,''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (4), by striking ``satellite'' and \n        inserting ``space'', and by striking ``services now available \n        from'' and inserting ``capabilities of''.\n    (c) Definitions.--Section 70102 of title 49, United States Code, is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (16) as \n        paragraphs (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), \n        (13), (14), (16), (19), and (20), respectively;\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(2) `crew' means an individual or individuals carried \n        within a launch or reentry vehicle who performs a function \n        necessary for the protection of public safety.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.\n\n    The Secretary of Transportation shall take appropriate efforts, \nincluding realignment of personnel and resources, to create a \nstreamlined, cost-effective, and enabling regulatory framework for the \nUnited States commercial human spaceflight industry. The Secretary of \nTransportation shall clearly distinguish the Department's regulation of \nair commerce from its regulation of commercial human spaceflight, and \nfocus the Department's regulation of commercial human spaceflight \nactivities on protecting the safety of the general public, while \nallowing spaceflight participants who have been trained and meet \nlicense-specific standards to assume an informed level of risk. Not \nlater than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary of Transportation shall transmit to the Congress a report on \nthe progress made in implementing this section.\n\nSEC. 5.

The study \nshall recommend modifications to the liability regime and \ncharacterization of actions required to implement those modifications. \nThe study shall analyze the adequacy, propriety, and effectiveness of, \nand the need for, the current liability risk-sharing regime. The study \nshall specifically consider--\n            (1) other countries' regimes;\n            (2) the use of the designation of ``ultra hazardous'' for \n        space transportation activities;\n            (3) relevant international treaties;\n            (4) impacts of reusable launch vehicles and spaceports; and\n            (5) the feasibility of airline-like liability regimes.\nThe study shall use a clearly described, analytical methodology to \nspecify the factors used in evaluating the current regime and \nalternative approaches to the current regime. Estimates of impacts \nshall be quantified where possible.\n    (b) Completion Date.--The results of the study described in \nsubsection (a) shall be transmitted to the Congress not later than 18 \nmonths after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 7. OFFICE OF SPACE COMMERCE.\n\n    (a) Redesignation.--The Office of Space Commercialization \nestablished under section 8 of the Technology Administration Act of \n1998 (15 U.S.C. 1511e) is redesignated as the Office of Space Commerce.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary of Commerce for the Office of Space \nCommerce--\n            (1) $1,800,000 for fiscal year 2004; and\n            (2) $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2005.\n\nSEC. 8.
