    "content": "The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied. It encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops (such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton) and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy, and eggs), as well as fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables. In addition, U.S. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products, forest products, custom work, machine hire, and other farm-related activities. The intensity and economic importance of each of these activities, as well as their underlying market structure and production processes, vary regionally based on the agro-climatic setting, market conditions, and other factors. As a result, farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the United States.  Annual U.S. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well-being, as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes, input expenses, and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period. When national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt-to-asset ratio, the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well-being of the national farm economy. In the second of three official U.S. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2019 (see shaded box below), ERS projects that U.S. net farm income will rise 4.8% in 2019 to $88.0 billion, up $4.0 billion from last year. Net cash income (calculated on a cash-flow basis) is also projected higher in 2019 (+7.2%) to $112.6 billion. The August 2019 net farm income forecast represents an increase from USDA's preliminary February 2019 forecast of $69.4 billion.  An increase in government support in 2019, projected at $19.5 billion and up 42.5% from 2018, is the principal driver behind the rise in net farm income. Support from traditional farm programs is expected to be bolstered by large direct government payments in response to trade retaliation under the escalating trade war with China. At a projected $19.5 billion in calendar 2019, direct government payments would represent 22.2% of net farm income\u00e2\u0080\u0094the largest share since 2006 when federal subsidies represented a 27.6% share.  The August forecast of $88 billion is just above (+0.9%) the 10-year average of $87.3 billion and represents continued agriculture-sector economic weakness since 2013's record high of $123.7 billion.  Both net cash income and net farm income achieved record highs in 2013 but fell to recent lows in 2016 ( Figure 1 ) before trending higher in each of the last three years 2017, 2018, and 2019. Commodity prices ( Figure A-1 to Figure A-4 ) have echoed the same pattern as farm income over the 2013-2019 period. When adjusted for inflation and represented in 2018 dollars ( Figure 2 ), the net farm income for 2019 is projected to be on par with the average of $86.8 billion for net farm income since 1940. After declining for four consecutive years, total production expenses for 2019 ( Figure 16 ), at $346.1 billion, are projected up slightly from 2018 (+0.4%), driven largely by higher costs for feed, labor, and property taxes. Global demand for U.S. agricultural exports ( Figure 20 ) is projected at $134.5 billion in 2019, down from 2018 (-6.2%), due largely to a decline in sales to China. Farm asset values and debt levels are projected to reach record levels in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094asset values at $3.1 trillion (+2.0%) and farm debt at $415.7 billion (+3.4%)\u00e2\u0080\u0094pushing the projected debt-to-asset ratio up to 13.5%, the highest level since 2003 ( Figure 26 ). Abundant domestic and international supplies of grains and oilseeds suggest a fifth straight year of relatively weak commodity prices in 2019 ( Figure A-1 through Figure A-4 , and Table A-4 ). However, considerable uncertainty remains concerning the eventual outcome of the 2019 growing season and the prospects for improved market conditions heading into 2020. As of early September, three major factors loom over U.S. agricultural markets and contribute to current uncertainty over both supply and demand prospects, as well as market prices: 1. First, wet spring conditions led to unusual plantings delays for the corn and soybean crops. This means that crop development is behind normal across much of the major growing regions and that eventual yields will depend on beneficial fall weather to achieve full crop maturity. Also, the late crop development renders crop growth vulnerable to an early freeze in the fall. 2. Second, large domestic supplies of corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton were carried over into 2019 ( Figure 6 ). Large corn and soybean stocks have kept pressure on commodity prices throughout the grain and feed complex in 2019. 3. Third, international trade disputes have led to declines in U.S. exports to China\u00e2\u0080\u0094a major market for U.S. agricultural products\u00e2\u0080\u0094and added to market uncertainty. In particular, the United States lost its preeminent market for soybeans\u00e2\u0080\u0094China. It is unclear how soon, if at all, the United States will achieve a resolution to its trade dispute with China or how international demand will evolve heading into 2020. U.S. agricultural production activity got off to a very late start in 2019 due to prolonged cool, wet conditions throughout the major growing regions, particularly in states across the eastern Corn Belt. This resulted in record large prevented planting acres ( Figure 3 ) and delays in the planting of the corn and soybean crops ( Table 1 ), especially in Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and North and South Dakota.  As of August 22, 2019, U.S. farmers have reported to USDA that, of the cropland that they intended to plant this past spring, they were unable to plant 19.8 million acres due primarily to prolonged wet conditions that prevented field work. Such acres are referred to as \"prevent plant (PPL)\" acres. The previous record for total PPL acres was set in 2011 at 10.2 million acres. The 19.8 million PPL acres includes 11.4 million acres of corn and 4.5 million acres of soybeans\u00e2\u0080\u0094both establish new records by substantial margins. The previous record PPL for corn was 2.8 million acres in 2013, and for soybeans it was 2.1 million acres in 2015. In addition, a sizeable portion of the U.S. corn and soybean crops were planted later than usual. Traditionally, 96% of the U.S. corn crop is planted by June 2, but in 2019 by that date only 67% of the crop had been planted ( Table 1 ). Similarly, the U.S. soybean crop was planted with substantial delays. By June 16, only 67% of the U.S. soybean crop was planted, whereas an average of 93% of the crop has been planted by that date during the past five years.  These planting delays have important implications for crop development as they push both crops' growing cycle into hotter, drier periods of the summer than usual and increase the risk of plant growth being shut off by an early freeze. But planting delays also increase the complexity of producer decisionmaking by pushing the planting date into the crop insurance \"late planting period,\" when insurance coverage starts to decline with each successive day of delay ( Figure 4 ).  When the planting occurs after the crop insurance policy's \"final planting date,\" the \"late planting period\" comes into play. Producers must then decide whether to opt for \"prevented planting\" indemnity payments (valued at 35% of their crop insurance guarantee) or try to plant the crop under reduced insurance coverage with a heightened risk of reduced yields. Producer's choices were further complicated in 2019 by the Secretary of Agriculture's announcement on May 23 that only producers with planted acres would be eligible for \"trade damage\" assistance payments in 2019 under the Market Facilitation Program (MFP). Corn and soybeans are the two largest U.S. commercial crops in terms of both value and acreage. For the past several years, U.S. corn and soybean crops have experienced strong growth in both productivity and output, thus helping to build stockpiles at the end of the marketing year. This has been particularly true for soybean production, which has seen rapid growth in yield, acres planted, and stocks. U.S. soybean production has been expanding rapidly since 1990, largely at the expense of the wheat sector which has been steadily losing acreage over the past several decades ( Figure 5 ). This pattern reached a historic point in 2018 when, for the first time in history, U.S. soybean plantings (at 89.196 million acres) exceeded corn plantings (89.129 million acres). The strong soybean plantings in 2018, coupled with the second-highest yields on record (51.6 bushels/acres), produced a record U.S. soybean harvest of 4.5 billion bushels and record ending stocks (1 billion bushels or a 27.2% stocks-to-use ratio) that year. However, the record soybean harvest in 2018, combined with the sudden loss of the Chinese soybean market (as discussed in the \" Agricultural Trade Outlook \" section of this report) discouraged many producers from planting soybeans in 2019. This contributed to a drop off (-14%) in soybean planted acres. Most market watchers had expected to see a strong switch from soybean to corn acres in 2019 as a result of the record soybean stocks and weak prices related to the U.S.-China trade dispute. However, the wet spring made large corn plantings unlikely as corn yields tend to experience rapid deterioration when planted in June or later. Despite these indications, USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) released the results of its June acreage survey for corn planted acres at 91.7 million acres\u00e2\u0080\u0094well above market expectations. However, because the wet spring had caused widespread delayed planting, USDA announced that it would re-survey the 14 major corn-producing states. The updated survey results were released on August 12 and, at 90.0 million acres, confirmed higher-than-expected corn plantings. As a result, the outlook for the U.S. corn crop has been pressured by the large planted acreage estimate but filled with uncertainty over the eventual success of the crop considering that it is being grown under unusually delayed conditions. Corn ending stocks are projected to surpass 2 billion bushels for the fourth consecutive year. Strong domestic demand from the livestock sector coupled with a robust export outlook are expected to support the season average farm price for corn at $3.60/bushel in the 2019/20 marketing year, unchanged from the previous year. The outlook for the U.S. soybean crop is more certain: USDA projects a 19% drop in U.S. soybean production to 3.68 billion bushels. Despite the outlook for lower production in 2019, the record carry-over stocks from 2018, and the sudden loss of China as the principal buyer of U.S. soybeans in 2018, USDA projects lower soybean farm prices (-8%) at $8.40/bushel for the 2019/20 marketing year\u00e2\u0080\u0094the lowest farm price since 2006 ( Figure 6 ). Both wheat and upland cotton farm prices for 2019 are projected down slightly from 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0094primarily due to the outlook for continued abundant stocks as indicated by the stocks-to-use ratios. The United States is traditionally one of the world's leading exporters of corn, soybeans, and soybean products\u00e2\u0080\u0094vegetable oil and meal. During the recent five-year period from 2013/2014 to 2017/2018, the United States exported 49% of its soybean production and 15% of its corn crop. As a result, the export outlook for these two crops is critical to both farm sector profitability and regional economic activity across large swaths of the United States as well as in international markets. However, the tariff-related trade dispute between the United States and China (as well as several major trading partners) has resulted in lower purchases of U.S. agricultural products by China in 2018 and 2019 and has cast uncertainty over the outlook for the U.S. agricultural sector, including the corn and soybean markets. Because the livestock sectors (particularly dairy and cattle, but hogs and poultry to a lesser degree) have longer biological lags and often require large capital investments up front, they are slower to adjust to changing market conditions than is the crop sector. As a result, USDA projects livestock and dairy production and prices an extra year into the future (compared with the crop sector) through 2020, and market participants consider this expanded outlook when deciding their market interactions\u00e2\u0080\u0094buy, sell, invest, etc.  During the 2007-2014 period, high feed and forage prices plus widespread drought in the Southern Plains\u00e2\u0080\u0094the largest U.S. cattle production region\u00e2\u0080\u0094had resulted in an 8% contraction of the U.S. cattle inventory. Reduced beef supplies led to higher producer and consumer prices and record profitability among cow-calf producers in 2014. This was coupled with then-improved forage conditions, all of which helped to trigger the slow rebuilding phase in the cattle cycle that started in 2014 ( Figure 7 ).  The expansion continued through 2018, despite weakening profitability, primarily due to the lag in the biological response to the strong market price signals of late 2014. The cattle expansion appears to have levelled off in 2019 with the estimated cattle and calf population unchanged from a year earlier at 103 million. Another factor working against continued expansion in cattle numbers is that producers are now producing more beef with fewer cattle. Similar to the cattle sector, U.S. hog and poultry flocks have been growing in recent years and are expected to continue to expand in 2019. For 2019, USDA projects production of beef (+0.6%), pork (+5.0%), broilers (+1.7%), and eggs (+2.3%) to expand modestly heading into 2020. This growth in protein production is expected to be followed by continued positive growth rates in 2020: beef (+1.9%), pork (+2.8%), broilers (+1.1%), and eggs (+0.9%).  A key uncertainty for the meat-producing sector is whether demand will expand rapidly enough to absorb the continued growth in output or whether surplus production will begin to pressure prices lower. USDA projects that combined domestic and export demand for 2019 will continue to grow for red meat (+1.7%) and poultry (+1.5%) but at slightly slower rates than projected meat production, thus contributing to 2019's outlook for lower prices and profit margins for livestock. The changing conditions for the U.S. livestock sector may be tracked by the evolution of the ratios of livestock output prices to feed costs ( Figure 8 ). A higher ratio suggests greater profitability for producers. The cattle-, hog-, and broiler-to-feed margins have all exhibited significant volatility during the 2017-2019 period. The hog, milk, and cattle feed ratios have trended downward during 2018 and 2019, suggesting eroding profitability. The broiler-to-feed price ratio has shown more volatility compared with the other livestock sectors but has trended upward from mid-2018 into 2019.  While this result varies widely across the United States, many small or marginally profitable cattle, hog, and milk producers face continued financial difficulties. Continued production growth of between 1% and 4% for red meat and poultry suggests that prices are vulnerable to weakness in demand. In addition, both U.S. and global milk production are projected to continue growing in 2019. As a result, milk prices could come under further pressure in 2019, although USDA is currently projecting milk prices up slightly in 2019. The lower price outlook for cattle, hogs, and poultry is expected to persist through 2019 before turning upward in 2020 ( Table A-4 ).  Projected farm-sector revenue sources in 2019 include crop revenues (46% of sector revenues), livestock receipts (42%), government payments (5%), and other farm-related income (8%), including crop insurance indemnities, machine hire, and custom work. Total farm sector gross cash income for 2019 is projected to be up (+2.2%) to $425.3 billion, driven by increases in both direct government payments (+42.5%) and other farm-related income (+19.3). Cash receipts from crop receipts (-1.7%) and livestock product (+0.5%) are down (-0.6%) in the aggregate ( Figure 9 ).  Total crop sales peaked in 2012 at $231.6 billion when a nationwide drought pushed commodity prices to record or near-record levels. In 2019, crop sales are projected at $193.7 billion, down 1.7% from 2018 ( Figure 10 ). Projections for 2019 and percentage changes from 2018 include  Feed crops\u00e2\u0080\u0094corn, barley, oats, sorghum, and hay: $56.3 billion (+0.4%); Oil crops\u00e2\u0080\u0094soybeans, peanuts, and other oilseeds: $36.3 billion (-14.0%); Fruits and nuts: $29.5 billion (+1.7%); Vegetables and melons: $19.6 billion (+6.0%); Food grains\u00e2\u0080\u0094wheat and rice: $12.3 billion (+6.5%); Cotton: $7.5 billion (-7.4%); and Other crops including tobacco, sugar, greenhouse, and nursery: $31.2 billion (+2.8%). The livestock sector includes cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry and eggs, dairy, and other minor activities. Cash receipts for the livestock sector grew steadily from 2009 to 2014, when it peaked at a record $212.3 billion. However, the sector turned downward in 2015 (-10.7%) and again in 2016 (-14.1%), driven largely by projected year-over-year price declines across major livestock categories ( Table A-4 and Figure 12 ).  In 2017, livestock sector cash receipts recovered with year-to-year growth of 8.1% to $175.6 billion. In 2018, cash receipts increased slightly (+0.6%). In 2019, cash receipts are projected up 0.5% for the sector at $177.4 billion as cattle, hog, and dairy sales offset declines in poultry. Projections for 2019 (and percentage changes from 2018) include Cattle and calf sales: $67.3 billion (+0.3%); Poultry and egg sales: $38.9 billion (-15.8%); Dairy sales: valued at $39.7 billion (+12.7%); Hog sales: $24.5 billion (+16.2%); and Miscellaneous livestock: valued at $7.0 billion (+2.1%). Historically, government payments have included  Direct payments (decoupled payments based on historical planted acres), Price-contingent payments (program outlays linked to market conditions), Conservation payments (including the Conservation Reserve Program and other environmental-based outlays), Ad hoc and emergency disaster assistance payments (including emergency supplemental crop and livestock disaster payments and market loss assistance payments for relief of low commodity prices), and Other miscellaneous outlays (including market facilitation payments, cotton ginning cost-share, biomass crop assistance program, peanut quota buyout, milk income loss, tobacco transition, and other miscellaneous payments). Projected government payments of $19.5 billion in 2019 would be up 42.5% from 2018 and would be the largest taxpayer transfer to the agriculture sector (in absolute dollars) since 2005 ( Figure 14 and Table A-4 ). The surge in federal subsidies is driven by large \"trade-damage\" payments made under the MFP initiated by USDA in response to the U.S.-China trade dispute. MFP payments (reported to be $10.7 billion) in 2019 include outlays from the 2018 MFP program that were not received by producers until 2019, as well as expected payments under the first and second tranches of the 2019 MFP program.  USDA ad hoc disaster assistance is projected higher year-over-year at $1.7 billion (+87.1%). Payments under the Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs are projected lower (-12.4%) in 2019 at a combined $2.8 billion compared with an estimated $3.2 billion in 2018 (see \"Price Contingent\" in Figure 14 ).  Conservation programs include all conservation programs operated by USDA's Farm Service Agency and the Natural Resources Conservation Service that provide direct payments to producers. Estimated conservation payments of $3.7 billion are forecast for 2019, down slightly (-8.4%) from $4.0 billion in 2018. Total government payments of $19.5 billion represents a 5% share of projected gross cash income of $425.3 billion in 2019. In contrast, government payments are expected to represent 22% of the projected net farm income of $88.0 billion. The importance of government payments as a percentage of net farm income varies nationally by crop and livestock sector and by region. The 2018 farm bill ( P.L. 115-334 ) made several changes to the previous Margin Protection Program (MPP), including a new name\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program\u00e2\u0080\u0094and expanded margin coverage choices from the original range of $4.00-$8.00 per hundredweight (cwt.). Under the 2018 farm bill, milk producers have the option of covering the milk-to-feed margin at a $9.50/cwt. threshold on the first 5 million pounds of milk coverage under the program.  The DMC margin differs from the USDA-reported milk-to-feed ratio shown in Figure 8 but reflects the same market forces. As of August 2019, the formula-based milk-to-feed margin used to determine government payments was at $9.45/cwt., just below the newly instituted $9.50/cwt. payment threshold ( Figure 15 ), thus increasing the likelihood that DMC payments may be less available in the second half of 2019. In total, the DMC program is expected to make $600 million in payments in 2019, up from $250 million under the previous milk MPP in 2018. Total production expenses for 2019 for the U.S. agricultural sector are projected to be up slightly (+0.4%) from 2018 in nominal dollars at $346.1 billion ( Figure 16 ). Production expenses peaked in both nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars in 2014, then declined for five consecutive years in inflation-adjusted dollars. However, in nominal dollars production expenses are projected to turn upward in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first upward turn since 2014.  Production expenses affect crop and livestock farms differently. The principal expenses for livestock farms are feed costs, purchases of feeder animals and poultry, and hired labor. Feed costs, labor expenses, and property taxes are all projected up in 2019 ( Figure 17 ). In contrast, fuel, land rent, interest costs, and fertilizer costs\u00e2\u0080\u0094all major crop production expenses\u00e2\u0080\u0094are projected lower.  But how have production expenses moved relative to revenues? A comparison of the indexes of prices paid (an indicator of expenses) versus prices received (an indicator of revenues) reveals that the prices received index generally declined from 2014 through 2016, rebounded in 2017, then declined again in 2018 ( Figure 18 ). Farm input prices (as reflected by the prices paid index) showed a similar pattern but with a smaller decline from their 2014 peak and have climbed steadily since mid-2016, suggesting that farm sector profit margins have been squeezed since 2016. Renting or leasing land is a way for young or beginning farmers to enter agriculture without incurring debt associated with land purchases. It is also a means for existing farm operations to adjust production more quickly in response to changing market and production conditions while avoiding risks associated with land ownership. The share of rented farmland varies widely by region and production activity. However, for some farms it constitutes an important component of farm operating expenses. Since 2002, about 39% of agricultural land used in U.S. farming operations has been rented.  The majority of rented land in farms is rented from non-operating landlords. Nationally in 2017, 29% of all land in farms was rented from someone other than a farm operator. Some farmland is rented from other farm operations\u00e2\u0080\u0094nationally about 8% of all land in farms in 2017 (the most recent year for which data are available)\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thus constitutes a source of income for some operator landlords. Total net rent to non-operator landlords is projected to be down (-2.1%) to $12.5 billion in 2019. Average cash rental rates for 2019 were up (+1.4%) year-over-year ($140 per acre versus $138 in 2018). National average rental rates\u00e2\u0080\u0094which for 2019 were set the preceding fall of 2018 or in early spring of 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094dipped in 2016 but still reflect the high crop prices and large net returns of the preceding several years, especially the 2011-2014 period ( Figure 19 ). The national rental rate for cropland peaked at $144 per acre in 2015.  U.S. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income, especially since 2005. As a result, the financial success of the U.S. agricultural sector is strongly linked to international demand for U.S. products. Because of this strong linkage, the downturn in U.S. agricultural exports that started in 2015 ( Figure 20 ) deepened the downturn in farm income that ran from 2013 through 2016 ( Figure 1 ). Since 2018, the U.S. agricultural sector's trade outlook has been vulnerable to several international trade disputes, particularly the ongoing dispute between the United States and China. A return to market-based farm income growth for the U.S. agricultural sector will likely necessitate improved international trade prospects. USDA projects U.S. agricultural exports at $134.5 billion in FY2019, down (-6.2%) from $143.4 billion in FY2018. Export data include processed and unprocessed agricultural products. This downturn masks larger country-level changes that have occurred as a result of ongoing trade disputes (as discussed below). In FY2019, U.S. agricultural imports are projected up at $129.3 billion (1.4%), and the resultant agricultural trade surplus of $5.2 billion would be the lowest since 2006. A substantial portion of the surge in U.S. agricultural exports that occurred between 2010 and 2014 was due to higher-priced grain and feed shipments, including record oilseed exports to China and growing animal product exports to East Asia. As commodity prices have leveled off, so too have export values (see the commodity price indexes in Figure A-1 and Figure A-2 ). In FY2017, the top three markets for U.S. agricultural exports were China, Canada, and Mexico, in that order. Together, these three countries accounted for 46% of total U.S. agricultural exports during the five-year period FY2014-FY2018 ( Figure 21 ). However, in FY2019 the combined share of U.S. exports taken by China, Canada, and Mexico is projected down to 38% largely due to lower exports to China. The ordering of the top markets in 2019 is projected to be Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), Japan, and China, as China is projected to decline as a destination for U.S. agricultural exports. From FY2014 through FY2017, China imported an average of $26.2 billion of U.S. agricultural products. However, USDA forecasts China's imports of U.S. agricultural products to decline to $20.5 billion in FY2018 and to $10.9 billion in FY2019 as a result of the U.S.-China trade dispute. The fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. export markets have traditionally been the EU and Japan, which accounted for a combined 17% of U.S. agricultural exports during the FY2014-FY2018 period. These two markets have shown limited growth in recent years when compared with the rest of the world. However, their combined share is projected to grow to 19% in FY2019 ( Figure 21 ).  The \"Rest of World\" (ROW) component of U.S. agricultural trade\u00e2\u0080\u0094South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia\u00e2\u0080\u0094has shown strong import growth in recent years. ROW is expected to account for 43% of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019. ROW import growth is being driven in part by both population and GDP growth but also from shifting trade patterns as some U.S. products previously targeting China have been diverted to new markets. Over the past four decades, U.S. agricultural exports have experienced fairly steady growth in shipments of high-value products\u00e2\u0080\u0094including horticultural products, livestock, poultry, and dairy. High-valued exports are forecast at $94.0 billion for a 69.9% share of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019 ( Figure 22 ). In contrast, bulk commodity shipments (primarily wheat, rice, feed grains, soybeans, cotton, and unmanufactured tobacco) are forecast at a record low 30.1% share of total U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019 at $40.5 billion. This compares with an average share of over 60% during the 1970s and into the 1980s. As grain and oilseed prices decline, so will the bulk value share of U.S. exports. The share of agricultural production (based on value) sold outside the country indicates the level of U.S. agriculture's dependence on foreign markets, as well as the overall market for U.S. agricultural products.  As a share of total farm and manufactured agricultural production, U.S. exports were estimated to account for 19.8% of the overall market for agricultural products from 2008 through 2016\u00e2\u0080\u0094the most recent data year for this calculation ( Figure 23 ). The export share of agricultural production varies by product category: At the upper end of the range for export shares, the bulk food grain export share has varied between 50% and 80% since 2008, while the oilseed export share has ranged between 47% and 58%. The mid-spectrum range of export shares includes the export share for fruit and tree nuts, which has ranged from 37% to 45%, while meat products have ranged from 27% to 41%. At the low end of the spectrum, the export share of vegetable and melon sales has ranged from 15% to 18%, the dairy products export share from 9% to 24%, and the agricultural-based beverage export share between 7% and 13%. The U.S. farm income and asset-value situation and outlook suggest a relatively stable financial position heading into 2019 for the agriculture sector as a whole\u00e2\u0080\u0094but with considerable uncertainty regarding the downward outlook for prices and market conditions for the sector and an increasing dependency on international markets to absorb domestic surpluses and on federal support to offset lost trade opportunities due to ongoing trade disputes. Farm asset values\u00e2\u0080\u0094which reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long-term profitability of farm sector investments\u00e2\u0080\u0094are projected to be up 2.0% in 2019 to a nominal $3.1 trillion ( Table A-3 ). In inflation-adjusted terms (using 2018 dollars), farm asset values peaked in 2014 ( Figure 24 ). Nominally higher farm asset values are expected in 2019 due to increases in both real estate values (+2.0%) and nonreal-estate values (+2.1%). Real estate is projected to account for 83% of total farm sector asset value. Crop land values are closely linked to commodity prices. The leveling off of crop land values since 2015 reflects stagnant commodity prices ( Figure 25 ). For 2019, USDA forecasts that prices for most major commodities will decline from 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0094wheat, barley, soybeans, cotton, choice steers, broilers, and eggs lower; sorghum, oats, rice, and pork products higher ( Table A-4 ). However, these projections are subject to substantial uncertainty associated with international commodity markets. Total farm debt is forecast to rise to a record $415.7 billion in 2019 (+3.4%) ( Table A-3 ). Farm equity\u00e2\u0080\u0094or net worth, defined as asset value minus debt\u00e2\u0080\u0094is projected to be up slightly (+1.8%) at $2.7 trillion in 2019 ( Table A-3 ). The farm debt-to-asset ratio is forecast up in 2019 at 13.5%, the highest level since 2003 but still relatively low by historical standards ( Figure 26 ). A farm can have both an on-farm and an off-farm component to its income statement and balance sheet of assets and debt. Thus, the well-being of farm operator households is not equivalent to the financial performance of the farm sector or of farm businesses because of the inclusion of nonfarm investments, jobs, and other links to the nonfarm economy.  Average farm household income (sum of on- and off-farm income) is projected at $116,060 in 2019 ( Table A-2 ), up 4.7% from 2018 but 13.5% below the record of $134,165 in 2014. About 17% ($20,075) of total farm household income is from farm production activities, and the remaining 83% ($95,985) is earned off the farm (including financial investments). The share of farm income derived from off-farm sources had increased steadily for decades but peaked at about 95% in 2000 ( Figure 27 ). Since 2014, over half of U.S. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations.  Since the late 1990s, farm household incomes have surged ahead of average U.S. household incomes ( Figure 28 ). In 2017 (the last year for which comparable data were available), the average farm household income of $111,744 was about 30% higher than the average U.S. household income of $86,220 ( Table A-2 ).  Figure A-1 to Figure A-4 present USDA data on monthly farm prices received for several major farm commodities\u00e2\u0080\u0094corn, soybeans, wheat, upland cotton, rice, milk, cattle, hogs, and chickens. The data are presented in an indexed format where monthly price data for year 2010 = 100 to facilitate comparisons. USDA Farm Income Data Tables  Table A-1 to Table A-3 present aggregate farm income variables that summarize the financial situation of U.S. agriculture. In addition, Table A-4 presents the annual average farm price received for several major commodities, including the USDA forecast for the 2018-2019 marketing year."
