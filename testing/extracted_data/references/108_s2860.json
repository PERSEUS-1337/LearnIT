    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act of \n2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) since the publication of the original study and \n        comprehensive list of recommendations in America Burning, \n        written in 1974, requested advances in fire prevention through \n        the installation of automatic sprinkler systems in existing \n        buildings have yet to be fully implemented;\n            (2) fire departments responded to approximately 1,700,000 \n        fires in 2001;\n            (3) there were 3,745 non-terrorist related deaths in the \n        United States and almost 21,000 civilian injuries resulting \n        from fire in 2001;\n            (4) 99 firefighters were killed in 2001, excluding the \n        terrorist acts on September 11th;\n            (5) fire caused $8,900,000,000 in direct property damage in \n        2001, and sprinklers are responsible for a 43 to 70 percent \n        reduction in property damage from fires in public assembly, \n        educational, residential, commercial, industrial and \n        manufacturing buildings;\n            (6) fire departments respond to a fire every 18 seconds, a \n        fire breaks out in a structure every 60 seconds and in a \n        residential structure every 80 seconds in the United States;\n            (7) the Station Nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island, \n        did not contain an automated sprinkler system and burned down, \n        killing 99 people on February 20, 2003;\n            (8) due to an automated sprinkler system, not a single \n        person was injured from a fire beginning in the Fine Line Music \n        Cafe in Minneapolis after the use of pyrotechnics on February \n        17, 2003;\n            (9) the National Fire Protection Association has no record \n        of a fire killing more than 2 people in a completely \n        sprinklered public assembly, educational, institutional or \n        residential building where the system was properly installed \n        and fully operational;\n            (10) sprinkler systems dramatically improve the chances of \n        survival of those who cannot save themselves, specifically \n        older adults, young children and people with disabilities;\n            (11) the financial cost of upgrading fire counter measures \n        in buildings built prior to fire safety codes is prohibitive \n        for most property owners;\n            (12) many State and local governments lack any requirements \n        for new structures to contain automatic sprinkler systems;\n            (13) under the present straight-line method of \n        depreciation, there is a disincentive for building safety \n        improvements due to an extremely low rate of return on \n        investment; and\n            (14) the Nation is in need of incentives for the voluntary \n        installation and retrofitting of buildings with automated \n        sprinkler systems to save the lives of countless individuals \n        and responding firefighters as well as drastically reduce the \n        costs from property damage.\n\nSEC. 3.
