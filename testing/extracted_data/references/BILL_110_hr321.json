FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The benefit of trade concessions can be adversely \n        affected by misalignments in currency.\n            (2) Misalignments in currency caused by government policies \n        intended to maintain an unfair trade advantage nullify and \n        impair trade concessions.\n            (3) Article XV of the GATT 1994 prohibits WTO members from, \n        by exchange rate action, frustrating the intent of the \n        provisions of that Agreement, or, by trade action, the intent \n        of the provisions of the Articles of Agreement of the \n        International Monetary Fund.\n            (4) The International Monetary Fund prohibits the use of \n        currency manipulation as a method of gaining unfair trade \n        advantage. The International Monetary Fund defines such \n        manipulation as large-scale and protracted intervention in one \n        direction to gain an unfair trade advantage.\n            (5) Sections 301 through 309 of the Trade Act of 1974 \n        contain the authority under United States law to take \n        retaliatory action, including import restrictions, to enforce \n        the rights of the United States against any unjustifiable, \n        unreasonable, or discriminatory practice or policy of a country \n        that burdens or restricts United States commerce.\n            (6) Economists have estimated that the RMB (the currency of \n        the People's Republic of China) is undervalued against the \n        United States dollar by as much as 40 percent.\n            (7) Import tariffs of the People's Republic of China \n        currently average about 15 percent. Assuming the recent \n        estimates of Chinese RMB undervaluation against the dollar are \n        correct, the effect of a free and open currency market would be \n        more than twice as large as the effect of eliminating every \n        tariff that the People's Republic of China imposes on United \n        States goods.\n            (8) The President should formally initiate action against \n        the People's Republic of China, on account of the manipulation \n        of its currency, pursuant to article XV of the GATT 1994, the \n        rules of the International Monetary Fund, sections 122 and 301 \n        through 309 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2132 and 2411 \n        through 2419), and section 3004 of the Omnibus Trade and \n        Competitiveness Act of 1988 (22 U.S.C. 5304).\n            (9) The President should, without weakening or impairing \n        existing trade remedies, clarify and improve World Trade \n        Organization rules with regard to currency manipulation for \n        trade advantage to reflect modern day monetary policy not \n        envisioned at the time current rules were adopted in 1947, and \n        report to Congress on ways to increase oversight and input \n        opportunities for Congress in the interaction of the United \n        States in the World Trade Organization.\n\nSEC. 3. ANALYSIS OF AND REPORT ON EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES OF CHINA.\n\n    (a) Analysis.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon the \nenactment of this Act and annually thereafter, analyze the exchange \nrate policies of the People's Republic of China in order to determine \nwhether that country manipulates the rate of exchange between the \ncurrency of that country and the United States dollar, within the \nmeaning of article XV of the GATT 1994.\n    (b) Computation of Rate of Manipulation.--If the Secretary of the \nTreasury makes an affirmative determination under subsection (a), the \nSecretary shall compute the rate of manipulation against the dollar in \nthe form of a percentage.\n    (c) Reports to Congress.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \nsubmit to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \nRepresentatives and to the Committee on Finance of the Senate a report \non the Secretary's analysis and findings under subsection (a), and any \nrate computed under subsection (b). The report shall be submitted--\n            (1) with respect to the analysis conducted upon the \n        enactment of this Act, not later than 60 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act; and\n            (2) with respect to each subsequent analysis, at the end of \n        each 1-year period thereafter.\n\nSEC. 4. ADDITIONAL TARIFFS.\n\n    (a) Additional Tariff.--In any case in which a report of the \nSecretary of the Treasury submitted under section 3(c) includes a rate \nof manipulation under section 3(b), the Secretary shall, not later than \n30 days after the report is submitted, impose on all products of China \nthat enter the customs territory of the United States, in addition to \nany duty that otherwise applies, a tariff equal to the applicable \npercentage of the appraised value of the product at the time of entry. \nFor purposes of this subsection, the ``applicable percentage'' is the \npercentage equal to the rate of manipulation.\n    (b) Annual Modification.--Any tariff imposed under subsection (a) \nshall be modified annually to the extent necessary to comply with the \nmost recent report of the Secretary of the Treasury under section 3(c).\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the terms ``GATT 1994'' and ``WTO member'' have the \nmeanings given those terms in section 2 of the Uruguay Round Agreements \nAct (19 U.S.C. 3501)."
