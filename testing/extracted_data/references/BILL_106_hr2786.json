FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Transmission networks are the backbone of competitive \n        power markets and increased interstate commerce in electricity.\n            (2) To support competitive power markets and to bring the \n        benefits of less regulation of such markets to transmission \n        customers, consumers, businesses, and the public, both today \n        and in the future, transmission networks must be expanded, \n        enhanced, and improved.\n            (3) The expansion, enhancement, and improvement of \n        transmission facilities also are necessary to maintain and \n        improve reliability of electric service.\n            (4) The regulation of transmission service must be \n        reformed.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF JURISDICTION.\n\n    (a) Declaration of Policy.--Section 201(a) of the Federal Power Act \n(16 U.S.C. 824(a)) is amended by inserting after ``transmission of \nelectric energy in interstate commerce'' the following: ``, including \nthe unbundled transmission of electric energy sold at retail,''.\n    (b) Application of Part.--Section 201(b)(1) of the Federal Power \nAct (16 U.S.C. 824(b)(1)) is amended by--\n            (1) inserting after ``the transmission of electric energy \n        in interstate commerce'' the following: ``, including the \n        unbundled transmission of electric energy sold at retail,''; \n        and\n            (2) adding at the end of subsection (b) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(3) After consulting with the appropriate State \n        regulatory authorities, the Commission shall determine by rule \n        or order which facilities used for the transmission and \n        delivery of electric energy are used for transmission in \n        interstate commerce subject to the jurisdiction of the \n        Commission under this part, and which are used for local \n        distribution subject to State jurisdiction.''.\n    (c) Definition of Interstate Commerce.--Section 201(c) of the \nFederal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824(c)) is amended after ``outside \nthereof' by inserting ``(including consumption in a foreign country)''.\n    (d) Definitions of Types of Sales.--Section 201(d) of the Federal \nPower Act (16 U.S.C. 824(d)) is amended by--\n            (1) inserting ``(1)'' after the subsection designation; and\n            (2) adding at the end the following:\n    ``(2) The term `bundled retail sale of electric energy' means the \nsale of electric energy to an ultimate consumer in which the generation \nand transmission service are not sold separately.\n    ``(3) The term `unbundled local distribution service' means the \ndelivery of electric energy to an ultimate consumer if--\n            ``(A) the electric energy and the service of delivering it \n        are sold separately; and\n            ``(B) the delivery uses facilities for local distribution \n        as determined by the Commission under subsection (b)(3).\n    ``(4) The term `unbundled transmission of electric energy sold at \nretail' means the transmission of electric energy to an ultimate \nconsumer if--\n            ``(A) the electric energy and the service of transmitting \n        it are sold separately, and\n            ``(B) the transmission uses facilities for transmission in \n        interstate commerce as determined by the Commission under \n        subsection (b)(3).''.\n    (e) Definition of Public Utility.--Section 201(e) of the Federal \nPower Act (16 U.S.C. 824(e)) is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(e) The term `public utility', when used in this part or in the \npart next following means--\n            ``(1) any person who owns or operates facilities subject to \n        the jurisdiction of the Commission under this part (other than \n        facilities subject to such jurisdiction solely by reason of \n        section 210, 211, or 212); and\n            ``(2) any transmitting utility that is not a public utility \n        under paragraph (1), but only with respect to determining, \n        fixing, and otherwise regulating the rates, terms, and \n        conditions for the transmission of electric energy under this \n        part.''.\n    (f) Application of Part to Government Utilities.--Section 201(f) of \nthe Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824(f)) is amended by striking ``No \nprovision'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``Except as provided in \nsubsection (e)(2) and section 3(23), no provision''.\n\nSEC. 4.

If the Commission \nshall find, after an evidentiary hearing on the record, that the denial \nof services complained of was unjust, unreasonable, unduly \ndiscriminatory or preferential, or contrary to the public interest, the \nCommission may order the provision of such services at rates and on \nterms and conditions that shall be in accordance with section 215 of \nthis Act.''."
