FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As our Nation's communications networks continue to \n        grow and become ever more sophisticated, more individuals and \n        industries will be using such networks to conduct commercial \n        transactions.\n            (2) It is important to establish personal privacy rights \n        and industry obligations now so that consumers have confidence \n        that their personal privacy is fully protected in our Nation's \n        telecommunications networks.\n            (3) The information superhighway must be safe and secure \n        for all its travellers so that economic growth is not \n        threatened due to consumer concern over the electronic ethics \n        of certain cyberspace marketers.\n            (4) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104) \n        contains expanded privacy protections for consumers by \n        requiring that telecommunications carriers under the \n        jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission obtain \n        consumer approval prior to reusing or selling certain personal \n        information.\n            (5) It is becoming increasingly apparent that the existing \n        privacy protections accorded consumers with respect to \n        information gathered by telecommunications carriers are not \n        alone sufficient to protect consumer privacy rights and that \n        further protections are needed to ensure that such rights are \n        retained and respected on the information superhighway by other \n        entities doing business in cyberspace.\n            (6) In addition to the growing number of businesses and \n        adults getting online, some 2,000,000 kids currently use the \n        Internet and this number is expected to grow to more than \n        15,000,000 by the year 2000.\n            (7) Recent media reports indicate that online marketers are \n        gathering personal information from children, in some cases in \n        a deceptive manner.\n            (8) In addition to the work performed by the Federal \n        Communications Commission in regulating our Nation's \n        telecommunications networks, the Federal Trade Commission \n        continues to have the task of ensuring that online marketers \n        and businesses at the ends of the line do not engage in \n        deceptive or fraudulent practices.\n            (9) The ease of gathering and compiling personal \n        information, both overtly and surreptitiously, in cyberspace is \n        becoming increasingly efficient and almost effortless due to \n        advances in digital telecommunications technology. As a result, \n        digital technology allows information gatherers to compile \n        highly detailed personal histories of both children and adults \n        who are network users.\n            (10) Regardless of the technology that consumers use, their \n        privacy rights and expectations remain a constant. Consumers \n        must have knowledge that personal information is being \n        collected about them; consumers must be given conspicuous \n        notice if the recipient of that information intends to reuse it \n        for other purposes, or disclose, or sell it; and finally, \n        consumers must have the right to prohibit or curtail any reuse \n        or sale of their personal information.\n            (11) Our Nation's communications networks, including the \n        Internet, have developed extremely rapidly over the last 2 \n        years, and changes in standards, protocols, and digital \n        technologies have enabled consumers to make decisions about \n        access to information and services, such as the types of \n        content on the Internet.\n            (12) New innovative technology may empower consumers and \n        parents to better control dissemination of personal information \n        by restoring decisionmaking power to the consumer or parent.\n            (13) Industry efforts, with Government encouragement and \n        oversight, to assist consumers through the development of \nstandards, protocols, and practices for the collection and \ndissemination of personal information is critical to help parents and \nconsumers better control dissemination of their personal information.\n            (14) Adoption of strong, fair information policies, \n        standards, and practices, along with the widespread \n        implementation and utilization of consumer empowerment tools, \n        may limit the need for Government regulation of personal \n        information collection and dissemination practices on the \n        Internet.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION EXAMINATION.\n\n    (a) Proceeding Required.--Within 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall commence a \nproceeding--\n            (1) to determine whether consumers are able, and, if not, \n        the methods by which consumers may be enabled--\n                    (A) to have knowledge that consumer information is \n                being collected about them through their utilization of \n                various telecommunications services and systems;\n                    (B) to have conspicuous notice that such \n                information could be used, or is intended to be used, \n                by the entity collecting the data for reasons unrelated \n                to the original communications, or that such \n                information could be sold (or is intended to be sold) \n                to other companies or entities; and\n                    (C) to stop the reuse, disclosure, or sale of that \n                information;\n            (2) to determine whether, in the case of consumers who are \n        children, the abilities described in subparagraphs (A), (B), \n        and (C) of paragraph (1) are or can be exercised by their \n        parents;\n            (3) to propose changes in the Commission's regulations as \n        necessary to correct any defects identified pursuant to this \n        section in the privacy rights and remedies of parents and \n        consumers generally;\n            (4) to review responses and suggestions from affected \n        commercial and nonprofit entities, as well as from the National \n        Telecommunication and Information Administration, to the \n        proposed changes made pursuant to paragraph (3); and\n            (5) to prepare recommendations to the Congress for any \n        legislative changes required to correct such defects.\n    (b) Schedule for Federal Trade Commission Responses.--The Federal \nTrade Commission shall, within 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act--\n            (1) complete any rulemaking required to revise Commission \n        regulations to correct any defects in such regulations \n        identified pursuant to subsection (a); and\n            (2) submit to Congress a report containing the \n        recommendations required by subsection (a)(5).\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION EXAMINATION.\n\n    (a) Proceeding Required.--Within 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission shall \ncommence a proceeding--\n            (1) to examine the impact of interconnected communications \n        networks of telephone, cable, satellite, wireless devices, and \n        other technologies on the privacy rights and remedies of the \n        consumers of those technologies, as described in paragraphs (1) \n        and (2) of section 3(a);\n            (2) to determine whether consumers are able, and, if not, \n        the methods by which consumers may be enabled to exercise such \n        rights and remedies;\n            (3) to propose changes in the Commission's regulations to \n        ensure that the effect on consumer privacy rights is considered \n        in the introduction of new telecommunications services and that \n        the protection of such privacy rights is incorporated as \n        necessary in the design of such services or the rules \n        regulating such services;\n            (4) to propose changes in the Commission's regulations as \n        necessary to correct any defects identified pursuant to this \n        section in such rights and remedies;\n            (5) to review responses and suggestions from affected \n        commercial and nonprofit entities, as well as from the National \n        Telecommunications and Information Administration, to the \n        proposed changes made pursuant to paragraph (4); and\n            (6) to prepare recommendations to the Congress for any \n        legislative changes required to correct such defects.\n    (b) Schedule for Federal Communications Commission Responses.--The \nFederal Communications Commission shall, within 1 year after the date \nof enactment of this Act--\n            (1) complete any rulemaking required to revise Commission \n        regulations to correct defects in such regulations identified \n        pursuant to subsection (a); and\n            (2) submit to the Congress a report containing the \n        recommendations required by subsection (a)(6)."
