FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) parents who do not find a child custody ruling to their \n        liking in one State will often start a custody proceeding in \n        another State in the hope of obtaining a more favorable ruling;\n            (2) although Federal and State child custody jurisdictional \n        laws were established to prevent this situation, gaps still \n        exist that allow for confusion and differing interpretations by \n        various State courts, and which lead to separate and \n        inconsistent custody rulings between States;\n            (3) in the event that a different ruling is handed down in \n        the second State's court, the problem then arises of which \n        court has jurisdiction, and which ruling should be granted full \n        faith and credit under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act \n        of 1980;\n            (4) changes in the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of \n        1980 must be made that will provide a remedy for cases where \n        conflicting State rulings exist--\n                    (A) to prevent different rulings from occurring in \n                the first instance by clarifying provisions with regard \n                to continuing State jurisdiction to modify a child \n                custody order; and\n                    (B) to assist the courts in this task by \n                establishing a centralized, nationwide child custody \n                database; and\n            (5) in the absence of such changes, parents will continue \n        to engage in the destructive practice of moving children across \n        State borders to escape a previous custody ruling or \n        arrangement, and will continue to use their helpless children \n        as pawns in their efforts at personal retribution.\n\nSEC. 3. MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS FOR COURT JURISDICTION.\n\n    Section 1738A of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:\n    ``(d)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the jurisdiction of a court of a \nState that has made a child custody determination in accordance with \nthis section continues as long as such State remains the residence of \nthe child or of any contestant.\n    ``(2) Continuing jurisdiction under paragraph (1) shall be subject \nto any applicable provision of law of the State that issued the initial \ncustody determination in accordance with this section, when such State \nlaw establishes limitations on continuing jurisdiction when a child is \nabsent from such State.'';\n            (2) in subsection (f)--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n                paragraphs (2) and (1), respectively; and\n                    (B) in paragraph (1), as so redesignated, by \n                inserting ``pursuant to subsection (d),'' after ``the \n                court of the other State no longer has jurisdiction,''; \n                and\n            (3) in subsection (g), by inserting ``or continuing \n        jurisdiction'' after ``exercising jurisdiction''.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CHILD CUSTODY REGISTRY.\n\n    Section 453 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 653) is amended \nby adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(g)(1) Subject to the availability of appropriations, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, in cooperation with the \nAttorney General, shall expand the Federal Parent Locator Service \nestablished under this section, to establish a national network to \nallow State courts to identify every proceeding relating to child \ncustody jurisdiction filed before any court of the United States or of \nany State. Information identifying custody determinations from other \ncountries will also be accepted for filing in the registry.\n    ``(2) As used in this subsection--\n                    ``(A) the term `information' includes--\n                            ``(i) the court or jurisdiction where a \n                        custody determination is filed;\n                            ``(ii) the name of the presiding officer of \n                        the issuing court;\n                            ``(iii) the names and social security \n                        numbers of the parties;\n                            ``(iv) the name, date of birth, and social \n                        security numbers of each child; and\n                            ``(v) the status of the case;\n                    ``(B) the term `custody determination' has the same \n                meaning given such term in section 1738A of title 28, \n                United States Code;\n                    ``(C) the term `custody proceeding'--\n                            ``(i) means a proceeding in which a custody \n                        determination is one of several issues, such as \n                        a proceeding for divorce or separation, as well \n                        as neglect, abuse, dependency, wardship, \n                        guardianship, termination of parental rights, \n                        adoption, protection from domestic violence, \n                        and Hague Child Abduction Convention \n                        proceedings; and\n                            ``(ii) does not include a judgment, decree, \n                        or other order of a court regarding paternity \n                        or relating to child support or any other \n                        monetary obligation of any person, or a \n                        decision made in a juvenile delinquency, status \n                        offender, or emancipation proceeding.\n    ``(3) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in cooperation \nwith Attorney General, shall promulgate regulations to implement this \nsection.\n    ``(4) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \nnecessary to carry out this subsection.''.\n\nSEC. 5. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING SUPERVISED VISITATION CENTERS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Senate that local governments should take \nfull advantage of the Local Crime Prevention Block Grant Program \nestablished under subtitle B of title III of the Violent Crime Control \nand Law Enforcement Act of 1994, to establish supervised visitation \ncenters for children who have been removed from their parents and \nplaced outside the home as a result of abuse or neglect or other risk \nof harm to them, and for children whose parents are separated or \ndivorced and the children are at risk because of physical or mental \nabuse or domestic violence."
