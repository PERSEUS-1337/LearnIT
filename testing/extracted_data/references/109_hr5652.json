    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``African Development Foundation Act \nof 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The African Development Foundation is uniquely \n        promoting sustainable community-based solutions to economic and \n        social development and is effectively supporting the \n        development of African-owned small enterprises as engines of \n        growth and sources of income and employment for the poor.\n            (2) The African Development Foundation's programs advance \n        United States interests in Africa and are in high demand across \n        the continent, as evidenced by $20 million in host country \n        contributions.\n            (3) The Office of Management and Budget has determined the \n        African Development Foundation to be a fully effective agency \n        after assessing its program performance.\n            (4) The African Development Foundation is the only United \n        States Government agency working directly at the grassroots \n        level, supporting African-designed and African-driven solutions \n        to economic and social problems. The African Development \n        Foundation enables individuals and groups to get out of poverty \n        by putting their own ideas to work, instead of someone else's.\n            (5) In 2005, African Development Foundation investments \n        across Africa created more than 110,000 jobs for poor Africans \n        and generated $70 million in gross revenues for enterprises. \n        Almost 65 percent of micro and small entrepreneurs assisted by \n        the African Development Foundation were women.\n            (6) African Development Foundation-assisted groups had $35 \n        million in export sales in 2005. For example, in Tanzania, the \n        African Development Foundation is helping several thousand \n        small sugar cane producers improve their income. Mtibwa Sugar \n        has increased its gross export revenues by 423 percent over the \n        past three years, from US$1.188 million during fiscal year 2002 \n        to US$5.034 million in fiscal year 2005. In the Ruembe \n        Outgrowers Association, sugar cane yields per hectare are up 30 \n        percent and cumulative export sales stand at US$4.7 million. \n        The number of participating cane farmers has increased by 50 \n        percent since project inception and the income of the 1440 \n        growers has almost doubled as a consequence of investment by \n        the African Development Foundation.\n            (7) The African Development Foundation is supporting \n        African solutions to prevent HIV/AIDS and to reduce its impact \n        on families and communities. For example, in Swaziland, where \n        almost 40 percent of adults are infected with the AIDS virus, \n        the African Development Foundation is improving nutrition and \n        providing income-generating opportunities for widows and \n        orphans by helping them produce and market vegetables, in \n        Ghana, the African Development Foundation funded the training \n        of almost 1500 youth who conducted peer counseling on HIV/AIDS \n        to more than 200,000 young people, in Plateau State, Nigeria, \n        the African Development Foundation funded a pilot program to \n        adapt and extend a faith-based life skills training program in \n        the public secondary schools in which approximately 500 \n        teachers were trained in the new curriculum and more than \n        25,000 students received year-long training, and in Tanzania, \n        the African Development Foundation has experimented with \n        supporting schemes that extend micro-credit to people living \n        with HIV/AIDS, enabling them to start informal businesses and \n        undertake income-generating activities.\n            (8) The work of the African Development Foundation is a \n        powerful example of the goodwill of the American people, and it \n        is one of the most effective foreign assistance programs of the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
