FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the interest of the United States to maintain \n        healthy livestock herds;\n            (2) managing the risks of foot and mouth disease, bovine \n        spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United \n        States may require billions of dollars for remedial activities \n        by consumers, producers, and distributors of meat and blood \n        products;\n            (3) the potential introduction of those diseases into the \n        United States would cause devastating financial losses to--\n                    (A) the agriculture industry and other economic \n                sectors; and\n                    (B) United States trade in the affected animals and \n                animal products;\n            (4) foot and mouth disease is a severe and highly \n        contagious viral infection affecting cattle, deer, goats, \n        sheep, swine, and other animals;\n            (5) the most effective means of eradicating foot and mouth \n        disease is by the slaughter of affected animals;\n            (6) while foot and mouth disease was eradicated in the \n        United States in 1929, the virus could be reintroduced by--\n                    (A) a single infected animal, an animal product, or \n                a person carrying the virus;\n                    (B) an act of terrorism; or\n                    (C) other means;\n            (7) once introduced, foot and mouth disease can spread \n        quickly through--\n                    (A) exposure to aerosols from infected animals;\n                    (B) direct contact with infected animals; and\n                    (C) contact with contaminated feed, equipment, or \n                humans harboring the virus or carrying the virus on \n                their clothing;\n            (8) foot and mouth disease is endemic to more than \\2/3\\ of \n        the world and is considered to be widespread in parts of \n        Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America;\n            (9) foot and mouth disease occurs in over 7 different \n        serotypes and 60 subtypes;\n            (10) as foot and mouth disease outbreaks have occurred, the \n        United States has banned the importation of live ruminants and \n        swine and many animal products from countries affected by foot \n        and mouth disease;\n            (11) recently, the United States has implemented bans in \n        response to outbreaks in Argentina, the European Union, and \n        Taiwan;\n            (12) although United States exclusion programs have been \n        successful at keeping foot and mouth disease out of the United \n        States since 1929, recent outbreaks in Argentina, the European \n        Union, and Taiwan are placing an unprecedented strain on our \n        animal health system;\n            (13) bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a transmissible, \n        neuro-degenerative disease found in cattle;\n            (14) in cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the \n        active agent is found primarily in the brain and spinal cord \n        and has not been found in commonly consumed beef products;\n            (15) bovine spongiform encephalopathy is thought to have an \n        incubation period of several years but is ultimately fatal to \n        cattle within weeks of onset of the active disease;\n            (16) bovine spongiform encephalopathy was first widely \n        found in 1986 in cattle in the United Kingdom;\n            (17) bovine spongiform encephalopathy-carrying cattle have \n        been found in cattle in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, \n        Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, \n        Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland;\n            (18) cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy \n        originating from the United Kingdom have been found and \n        intercepted in Canada;\n            (19) since 1989, the Secretary of Agriculture has \n        prohibited the importation of live grazing animals from \n        countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been found \n        in cattle;\n            (20) other products derived from grazing animals, such as \n        blood meal, bonemeal, fat, fetal bovine serum, glands, meat-\n        and-bone meal, and offal, are prohibited from entry, except \n        under special conditions or under permits issued by the \n        Secretary of Agriculture for scientific or research purposes;\n            (21) on December 12, 1997, the Secretary of Agriculture \n        extended those restrictions to include all countries in Europe \n        because of concerns about widespread risk factors and \n        inadequate surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy;\n            (22) on December 7, 2000, the Secretary of Agriculture \n        prohibited all imports of rendered animal protein products from \n        Europe;\n            (23) Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease is a human spongiform \n        encephalopathy;\n            (24) on March 20, 1996, the Spongiform Encephalopathy \n        Advisory Committee of the United Kingdom announced the \n        identification of 10 cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-\n        Jacob disease;\n            (25) all 10 patients developed onsets of the disease in \n        1994 or 1995;\n            (26) scientific experts (including scientists at the \n        Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, and the World Health Organization) are studying the \n        possible link (including potential routes of transmission) \n        between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant \n        Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease;\n            (27) from October 1996 to December 2000, 87 cases of \n        variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease have been reported in the \n        United Kingdom, 3 cases in France, and 1 case in Ireland; and\n            (28) to reduce the risk of human spongiform \n        encephalopathies in the United States, the Commissioner of Food \n        and Drugs has--\n                    (A) banned individuals who lived in Great Britain \n                for at least 180 days since 1980 from donating blood in \n                the United States; and\n                    (B) established regulations that prohibit the \n                feeding of most animal-derived proteins to grazing \n                animals.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide the people of \nthe United States and Congress with information concerning--\n            (1) actions by Federal agencies to prevent foot and mouth \n        disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related \n        diseases;\n            (2) the sufficiency of legislative authority to prevent or \n        control foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform \n        encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United States;\n            (3) the economic impacts associated with the potential \n        introduction of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform \n        encephalopathy, and related diseases into the United States; \n        and\n            (4) the risks to public health from possible links between \n        bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other spongiform \n        encephalopathies to human illnesses.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n                    (C) any immediate needs for additional legislative \n                authority, appropriations, or product bans to prevent \n                the introduction of foot and mouth disease or bovine \n                spongiform encephalopathy into the United States.\n            (2) Submission of report to congress.--The Secretary shall \n        submit the preliminary report to--\n                    (A) the Committee on Agriculture of the House of \n                Representatives;\n                    (B) the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n                Forestry of the Senate;\n                    (C) the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \n                Development, and Related Agencies of the Committee on \n                Appropriations of the Senate;
