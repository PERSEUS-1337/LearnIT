FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Health Resources and Services Administration \n        estimates there is currently a shortage of more than 200,000 \n        registered nurses nationwide and projects the shortage will \n        grow to over 1 million nurses by 2020, 36 percent less than \n        needed to meet demand for nursing care.\n            (2) The shortage of qualified nursing faculty is the \n        primary factor driving the inability of nursing schools to \n        graduate more registered nurses to meet the nation's growing \n        workforce demand.\n            (3) There continues to be strong interest on the part of \n        young Americans to enter the nursing field. The National League \n        for Nursing estimates that 88,000 qualified applications, or \n        one out of every three submitted to basic registered nurse \n        programs in 2006, were rejected due to lack of capacity.\n            (4) The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (in \n        this Act referred to as the ``AACN'') estimates that 40,285 \n        applicants were turned away specifically from baccalaureate and \n        graduate schools of nursing in 2007 and over 70 percent of the \n        schools responding to the AACN survey reported a lack of nurse \n        faculty as the number one reason for turning away qualified \n        applicants. Likewise, nearly 70 percent of the associate's \n        degree registered nurse programs responding to the most recent \n        American Association of Community Colleges Nursing Survey \n        reported a lack of faculty to teach as the number one reason \n        for turning away qualified applicants.\n            (5) Large numbers of faculty members at schools of nursing \n        in the United States are nearing retirement. According to the \n        AACN, the average age of a nurse faculty member is 55 years old \n        and the average age at retirement is 62.\n            (6) The current nationwide nurse faculty vacancy rate is \n        estimated to be as high as 8.8 percent, including 767 vacant \n        positions at schools of nursing offering baccalaureate and \n        advanced degrees and, in 2006, as many as 880 in associate's \n        degree programs.\n            (7) Market forces have created disincentives for \n        individuals qualified to become nurse educators from pursing \n        this career. The average annual salary for an associate \n        professor of nursing with a master's degree is nearly 20 \n        percent less that the average salary for a nurse practitioner \n        with a master's degree, according to the 2007 salary survey by \n        the journal ADVANCE for Nurse Practitioners.\n            (8) The most recent Health Resources and Services \n        Administration survey data indicates that from a total of more \n        than 2 million registered nurses, only 143,113 registered \n        nurses with a bachelor's degree and only 51,318 registered \n        nurses with an associate's degree have continued their \n        education to earn a master's degree in the science of nursing, \n        the minimum credential necessary to teach in all types of \n        registered nurse programs. The majority of these graduates do \n        not become nurse educators.\n            (9) Current Federal incentive programs to encourage nurses \n        to become educators are inadequate and inaccessible for many \n        interested nurses.\n            (10) A broad incentive program must be available to willing \n        and qualified nurses that will provide financial support and \n        encourage them to pursue and maintain a career in nursing \n        education.\n\nSEC. 3. NURSE FACULTY LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.\n\n    Part E of title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n297a et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 846A the following \nnew section:\n\n``SEC. 846B.
