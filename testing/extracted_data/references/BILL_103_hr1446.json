PRINCIPAL NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    In addition to the overall and principal trade negotiating \nobjectives of the United States set forth in section 1101 of the \nOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the purposes, policies, \nand objectives of title I of such Act of 1988 that are applicable with \nrespect to any free-trade area trade agreement negotiated under the \nauthority of such title I in furtherance of the Enterprise for the \nAmericas Initiative with any country in the Western Hemisphere outside \nNorth America (hereinafter referred to as the ``EAFTA'') include the \nachievement of the following principal negotiating objectives:\n            (1) Worker rights and standards and protection.--With a \n        view to establishing open, expanding mutually-beneficial trade \n        among the countries of the Western Hemisphere, to spreading the \n        benefits of such trade as widely as possible, to protecting \n        citizens interests, and to enhancing respect for human rights \n        throughout the Western Hemisphere, the principal negotiating \n        objectives of the United States with respect to worker rights \n        and standards, and the protection thereof, in the conduct of \n        international trade, commerce, and finance are--\n                    (A) to ensure freedom of association and to affirm \n                the vital role that free and independent unions play in \n                democratic governance;\n                    (B) to ensure the rights of working people to \n                organize, to bargain collectively, and to strike, and \n                to ensure the right of workers' representatives to \n                legal protection in the free exercise of their duties \n                and fundamental human rights;\n                    (C) to establish a minimum age for the employment \n                of children--\n                            (i) at 14 years if the employment will not \n                        result in the neglect of their education and \n                        will not harm their health and well-being, and\n                            (ii) at 18 years if the employment involves \n                        the use of, or exposure to, hazardous equipment \n                        or toxic chemical substances, but only if the \n                        use or exposure will not pose long-term risks \n                        to their health and safety;\n                    (D) to ensure the right to health at the workplace \n                and to a healthy working environment, including freedom \n                from exposure to toxic substances;\n                    (E) to guarantee the right of all workers to equal \n                protection, including freedom from discrimination in \n                wages or working conditions, regardless of their \n                nationality, race, religion, age, or sex; and\n                    (F) to guarantee humane standards of wages and \n                hours of work that take into account different levels \n                of national economic development, but provide for \n                improvement concurrently with gains in productivity.\n            (2) Environmental quality and protection.--In recognition \n        of the shared responsibility of the countries of the Western \n        Hemisphere as stewards responsible for, and our common interest \n        in, preserving and sustaining the Western Hemisphere's natural \n        habitat and resources over time, the principal negotiating \n        objectives of the United States with respect to environmental \n        quality and protection are--\n                    (A) the protection of environmental quality and of \n                the integrity of ecosystems, as well as the maintenance \n                of scarce biological and physical resources, in the \n                conduct of international trade, commerce, and finance;\n                    (B) the establishment of a process for the full and \n                public disclosure of the kinds, quantities, and risks \n                associated with toxic chemical and hazardous substance \n                discharges into the air, water, and land;\n                    (C) the prevention of the export of toxic and \n                hazardous substances and products, such as carcinogens \n                and unsafe drugs, that are banned in the country of \n                origin;\n                    (D) the prevention of the export of products \n                (unless remediation or repatriation contracts already \n                exist) manufactured, extracted, harvested, or grown \n                under environmental conditions or workplace safety and \n                health conditions that undermine counterpart standards, \n                particularly those applicable to the counterpart \n                industry in the importing country or the counterpart \n                standards, in general, in the importing country; and\n                    (E) to require that industries within their \n                national borders reduce the amount and toxicity of \n                hazardous substances that they use, minimize the amount \n                and toxicity of wastes they generate, and demonstrate \n                publicly their use of best available technology for \n                pollution abatement in their production processes.\n            (3) Unfair trade practices.--In acknowledging different, \n        evolving comparative advantages among trading nations, but with \n        a view to distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable \n        means of competition among trading nations, the principal \n        negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to \n        unfair trade practices shall include the adoption, as a \n        principle, that the systematic denial or practical negation of \n        the protections accorded worker rights and standards and \n        environmental quality (within the context of paragraphs (1) and \n        (2)) as a means for any country or its industries to gain \n        competitive advantage in international trade, commerce, and \n        finance is an actionable unfair trade practice.\n            (4) Comprehensive dispute resolution.--The principal \n        negotiating objectives of the United States are to achieve a \n        process for the settlement of disputes that arise between or \n        among the signatories with respect to unfair trade practices, \n        including not only those involving commonly identified unfair \n        trade barriers, but unfair practices, within the context of the \n        negotiating objectives listed in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) \n        involving the systematic denial or practical negation of worker \n        rights and standards and failure to apply or enforce standards \n        relating to environmental quality or protection, resulting in \n        distortions to international trade, commerce, and finance. Such \n        a process shall include--\n                    (A) notification by each signatory nation to the \n                other signatories regarding changes in law or practice \n                that will materially affect the agreement;\n                    (B) provision, on a sequential basis and subject to \n                reasonable time limits, for consultation between or \n

authority to investigate, adjudicate, and issue \n                binding judgments in a timely manner regarding the \n                issues in dispute pursuant to subparagraph (B)--\n                            (i) that consists of equal numbers of \n                        experts from the signatory nations (with United \n                        States experts being subject to the advice and \n                        consent of the United States Senate), and\n                            (ii) the chairmanship of which will be \n                        filled by individuals who--\n                                    (I) are citizens of the respective \n                                signatories,\n                                    (II) serve on a rotational basis \n

                             chairperson appointed from the United \n                                States is subject to the advice and \n                                consent of the United

aggrieved signatory nation to--\n                            (i) suspend, withdraw, or prevent the \n                        application of, the benefits of trade agreement \n
