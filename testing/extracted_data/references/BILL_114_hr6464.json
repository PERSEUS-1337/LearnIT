FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Teachers, because of their position in the classroom, \n        often see important opportunities to improve student learning \n        most directly and thus have a unique perspective from which to \n        create practical solutions to help students succeed.\n            (2) According to a Scholastic and Bill & Melinda Gates \n        Foundation poll, 69 percent of teachers feel that their voices \n        are heard in their school, but only one-third feel heard in \n        their district, five percent in their State, and two percent at \n        the national level.\n            (3) The failure to leverage teachers' expertise has a \n        negative impact on teacher engagement in education reforms and \n        misses a critical opportunity for administrators and \n        policymakers to draw on knowledge and expertise from the \n        classroom that can help address critical education needs and \n        challenges.\n            (4) Empowering teachers to lead beyond the classroom, \n        without necessarily leaving the classroom, will demonstrate the \n        trust and respect for teachers, as professionals, that they \n        deserve and will help improve teaching and student outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to empower teachers to develop and \nimplement projects with the potential to have a wider impact on \ndeveloping the knowledge, pedagogical skills, and conditions needed to \nimprove teaching and student outcomes, particularly academic growth, by \nbringing their classroom knowledge and expertise directly to bear on \nthe many challenges confronting our education system.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Program authorized.--From the funds made available \n        under section 7, the Secretary of Education may make grants, on \n        a competitive basis, to one or more nonprofit organizations to \n        award subgrants to eligible entities to develop and implement \n        teacher-led projects to improve teaching and student outcomes \n        in elementary school and secondary school, particularly \n        academic growth.\n            (2) Grant period.--A grant made to a nonprofit organization \n        under paragraph (1) shall be for a period of not more than five \n        years.\n            (3) Use of grant funds.--A nonprofit organization that \n        receives a grant under paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) shall reserve not less than 90 percent of the \n                grant to award subgrants, on a competitive basis, to \n                eligible entities under subsection (c); and\n                    (B) may use not more than 10 percent of the grant \n                for administrative purposes.\n    (b) Applications.--A nonprofit organization that desires a grant \nunder this section shall submit an application to the Secretary at such \ntime and in such manner, and containing such information as the \nSecretary may require.
