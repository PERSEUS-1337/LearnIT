FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among \n        people over 65.\n            (2) By 2030, the population of individuals who are 65 years \n        of age or older will double. By 2050, the population of \n        individuals who are 85 years of age or older will quadruple.\n            (3) In 2000, falls among elderly individuals accounted for \n        10,200 deaths and 1,600,000 emergency department visits.\n            (4) Sixty percent of fall-related deaths occur among \n        persons 75 and older.\n            (5) Twenty-five percent of elderly persons who sustain a \n        hip fracture die within 1 year.\n            (6) Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly \n        have increased from 231,000 admissions in 1988 to 332,000 in \n        1999. The number of hip fractures is expected to exceed 500,000 \n        by 2040.\n            (7) Annually, more than 64,000 individuals who are over 65 \n        years of age sustain a traumatic brain injury as a result of a \n        fall.\n            (8) Annually, 40,000 individuals who are over 65 years of \n        age visit emergency departments with traumatic brain injuries \n        suffered as a result of a fall, of which 16,000 of these \n        individuals are hospitalized and 4,000 of these individuals \n        die.\n            (9) The rate of fall-induced traumatic brain injuries for \n        individuals who are 80 years of age or older increased by 60 \n        percent from 1989 to 1998.\n            (10) The estimated total cost for non-fatal traumatic brain \n        injury-related hospitalizations for falls in individuals who \n        are 65 years of age or older is more than $3,250,000,000. Two-\n        thirds of these costs occurred among individual who were 75 \n        years of age or older.\n            (11) The costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and \n        society as a whole from falls by elderly persons continue to \n        climb much faster than inflation and population growth. Direct \n        costs alone will exceed $32,000,000,000 in 2020.\n            (12) The Federal Government should devote additional \n        resources to research regarding the prevention and treatment of \n        falls in residential as well as institutional settings.\n            (13) A national approach to reducing elder falls, which \n        focuses on the daily life of senior citizens in residential, \n        institutional, and community settings is needed. The approach \n        should include a wide range of organizations and individuals \n        including family members, health care providers, social \n        workers, architects, employers and others.\n            (14) Reducing preventable adverse events, such as elder \n        falls, is an important aspect to the agenda to improve patient \n        safety.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n     The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to develop effective public education strategies in a \n        national initiative to reduce elder falls in order to educate \n        the elders themselves, family members, employers, caregivers, \n        and others who touch the lives of senior citizens;\n            (2) to expand needed services and gain information about \n        the most effective approaches to preventing and treating elder \n        falls; and\n            (3) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        to evaluate the effect of elder falls on the costs of the \n        Medicare and Medicaid programs and the potential for reducing \n        costs by expanding education, prevention, and elderly \n        intervention services covered or sponsored by these two \n        programs.\n\nSEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following part:\n\n                  ``PART R--PREVENTION OF ELDER FALLS\n\n``SEC. 399AA.
