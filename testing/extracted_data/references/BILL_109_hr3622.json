FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Federal authorities do not have sufficient manpower or \n        resources to patrol and defend the international borders of the \n        United States to prevent individuals from entering the United \n        States illegally.\n            (2) An ever-increasing number of heavily armed and \n        dangerous criminals, violent gang members, and drug smugglers \n        are entering the United States illegally over our international \n        borders.\n            (3) Federal and State law enforcement authorities have \n        identified an alarming increase in the number of foreign \n        nationals from countries with known connections to terrorist \n        organizations who are hiding among this crowd of dangerous \n        illegal immigrants, and camouflaging themselves among an \n        immense and rapidly growing number of foreign nationals who are \n        entering the United States illegally in search of work.\n            (4) The United States is at war with terrorist criminal \n        organizations and individuals from foreign nations who are \n        fanatically committed to the destruction of the United States, \n        who have repeatedly demonstrated their ability and willingness \n        to hide their true identities and their evil purposes, and who \n        will enter and move about the United States illegally and use \n        sneak attacks and any criminal means or method available to \n        them to cause the mass destruction of human life in the United \n        States.\n            (5) The history of the United States from the first days of \n        the American Revolution is filled with innumerable examples of \n        honorable and invaluable service by citizen volunteers, \n        organized into well-regulated local militias, who have ably \n        defended the frontiers and borders of the United States \n        whenever and wherever Federal military or law enforcement \n        authorities were unable or unwilling to do so.\n            (6) The uniquely devious, criminal, cowardly, and \n        fanatically determined nature of the terrorist criminal \n        organizations and individuals that have declared war on the \n        people of the United States compel the Congress to invoke its \n        constitutional authority to authorize all able-bodied and \n        eligible United States citizens to serve in a militia in \n        defense of our international borders under the direct command \n        and control of the Governors of the border States.\n            (7) Therefore, in light of these facts, in response to the \n        continuing threat of these terrorist criminal organizations to \n        carry out future attacks on the people of the United States \n        similar to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and in \n        order to quickly supplement the inadequate manpower and \n        resources now deployed by the Federal Government in defense of \n        our international borders, it is necessary to invoke \n        congressional authority under article 1, section 8, of the \n        Constitution, to call forth ``the Militia to execute the Laws \n        of the Union'', to provide authorization and funding for \n        ``organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia'', and to \n        assist the States with statutory guidance and funding to \n        provide for the common defense of the lives, liberty, and \n        domestic tranquility of the people of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
