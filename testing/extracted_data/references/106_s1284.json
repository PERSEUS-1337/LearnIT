FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the opportunity for all consumers to purchase electric \n        energy in interstate commerce from the supplier of choice is \n        essential to a dynamic, fully integrated and competitive \n        national market for electric energy;\n            (2) the establishment, maintenance or enforcement of \n        exclusive rights to sell electric energy and other State action \n        which unduly discriminates against any consumer who seeks to \n        purchase electric energy in interstate commerce from the \n        supplier of its choice constitutes an unwarranted and \n        unacceptable discrimination against and burden on interstate \n        commerce;\n            (3) in today's technologically driven marketplace there is \n        no justification for the discrimination against and burden \n        imposed on interstate commerce by exclusive rights to sell \n        electric energy or other State action which unduly \n        discriminates against any consumer who seeks to purchase \n        electric energy in interstate commerce from the supplier of its \n        choice; and\n            (4) the electric energy transmission and local distribution \n        facilities of all of the Nation's utilities are essential \n        facilities for the conduct of a competitive interstate retail \n        market in electric energy in which all consumers have the \n        opportunity to purchase electric energy in interstate commerce \n        from the supplier of their choice.\n\nSEC. 3.

ACCESS TO TRANSMISSION AND LOCAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.\n\n    No supplier of electric energy, who would otherwise have a right of \naccess to a transmission or local distribution facility because such \nfacility is an essential facility for the conduct of interstate \ncommerce in electric energy, shall be denied access to such facility or \nprecluded from engaging in the retail sale of electric energy on the \ngrounds that such denial or preclusion is authorized or required by \nState action establishing, maintaining, or enforcing an exclusive right \nto sell, transmit, or locally distribute electric energy.\n\nSEC. 6.
