    "content": "Historic preservation is the practice of protecting and preserving sites, structures, objects, landscapes, and other cultural resources of historical significance. Various federal, state, and local government programs, as well as privately funded activities, support historic preservation in the United States. This report provides an overview of the federal role in historic preservation, including background and funding information for some of the major preservation programs authorized by Congress. In addition to establishing national policies governing historic preservation, Congress considers the federal government's role in financing many of these programs through the annual appropriations process. Some programs also periodically come before Congress for reauthorization. As a result, issues related to historic preservation are of perennial interest to Congress. Some Members of Congress support proposals to eliminate the federal role in historic preservation, leaving such programs to be sustained by other levels of government or by private support. Other Members feel federal support for historic preservation should be maintained or increased. The heavy toll of recent natural disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on historic resources has contributed to increased support for incorporating preservation needs in federal disaster relief planning and aid.  This report includes a summary of the federal government's role in historic preservation activities, from its early efforts in the late 1890s to today. The report contains a list of many of the federal grant programs funded through the annual appropriations process (see Appendix ). It also includes overviews of historic preservation grants for tribal historic preservation, African American civil rights, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Japanese American confinement sites (JACS), Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) programs, the Save America's Treasures grant program, and the American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP). The appendix includes eligibility requirements, matching fund guidelines, and statutory authorization for each program. It also includes an overview of federal funding for historic preservation activities from FY2016 to FY2020, along with requested totals for FY2021. Finally, the report outlines some potential issues facing the 116 th Congress in determining whether and how to address historic preservation needs at the federal level. The federal role in historic preservation was limited for much of the country's early history, with no formal federal policy in place. The two most significant early efforts at federal historic preservation came in the 1890s. First, Congress passed laws intended to protect ancient Puebloan sites in the American Southwest. Soon thereafter, Congress acquired thousands of acres of private land to establish five Civil War national battlefield parks to be administered by the Department of War. These two distinct federal efforts\u00e2\u0080\u0094commemorating very different moments in American history\u00e2\u0080\u0094are often marked as the genesis of the United States' federal preservation program. In the 20 th century, a legislative campaign for a comprehensive historic preservation policy bolstered these efforts. The Antiquities Act of 1906 provided the executive branch with authority to identify and protect cultural resources on federal lands in an expeditious manner. Prior to its passage, federal law provided no means to preserve national cultural and historic resources that had not received specific legislative authorization from Congress. The Antiquities Act authorized the President to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain \"historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest.\" The law also established guidelines around the future excavation of objects of antiquity found on land owned or controlled by the federal government. Since its passage in 1906, the Antiquities Act has been used to create more than 150 national monuments.  With the passage of the Historic Sites Act of 1935, Congress established a national policy on historic preservation. The act outlined a policy to \"preserve for public use historic sites, buildings, and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States\" while also providing the Secretary of the Interior the authority to develop a program aimed at identifying and evaluating cultural resources. It placed the primary responsibility for administering federal historic preservation activities with the National Park Service (NPS). Efforts to survey and evaluate cultural resources of national historical significance eventually led to the designation of national historic landmarks (NHLs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094a federal recognition for historic properties that exists today. (See \" National Historic Landmarks Program \" section for more information on NHL designation.)  In the aftermath of World War II, the United States saw an unprecedented transformation of the natural and built environment, thanks in part to a rapid growth in federal infrastructure projects. The construction of interstate highways, urban renewal projects, and large-scale development led to the destruction of numerous historic buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural resources not previously protected under the Historic Sites Act of 1935. In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson convened a special committee on historic preservation in 1965. The following year, the committee released its report, With Heritage So Rich , which called for a comprehensive national historic preservation program. The same year, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), which incorporated nearly every major recommendation included in the report. Broader than its two predecessors, NHPA is the most comprehensive piece of legislation addressing federal historic preservation. Among its many provisions, the law established the National Register of Historic Places and the procedures by which historic properties are placed on the register, funded the National Trust for Historic Preservation, created a grant program for state and tribal historic preservation, required federal agencies to manage and preserve their historic properties, and created a process for federal agencies to follow when their projects may affect a historic property. Congress has amended and expanded NHPA multiple times since its passage, most recently in 2016. Various federal programs and federally established entities support historic preservation across the United States. Many of these programs and entities were established in NHPA and its subsequent amendments; however, Congress has authorized through separate legislation several other programs that also support activities related to historic preservation. Although it is beyond the scope of this report to discuss all federal programs and entities that support historic preservation, selected major programs and entities are highlighted. Created by NHPA, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) is an independent agency consisting of federal, state, and tribal government members, as well as experts in historic preservation and members of the public. ACHP oversees the Section 106 review process, a process federal agencies must follow when their projects may affect a historic property. Federal agencies are required to review the potential impacts of their actions on historic sites, a process that is to be concluded before federal funding is provided or a federal license is issued. Section 106 applies only to federal or \"federally assisted\" undertakings, such as those receiving federal funding or a federal permit. As an independent agency, ACHP receives funding as part of the \"Related Agencies\" portion of the annual Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) is the primary source of funding for federal preservation awards to states, tribes, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. Although federal funding for historic preservation was available under the 1966 NHPA and subsequent amendments in 1970 and 1973, Congress did not officially establish the HPF to carry out the activities specified in NHPA until 1976. The HPF is funded through revenue generated by outer continental shelf mineral receipts, and it has been periodically reauthorized by Congress. Most recently, in 2016, Congress authorized the HPF to receive deposits of $150 million annually through FY2023. The funding is available only to the extent appropriated by Congress in discretionary appropriations laws. Since the HPF's establishment, Congress has never appropriated the full $150 million for the fund in a single fiscal year.  The HPF funds historic preservation activities in two ways: (1) formula-based apportionment grants and (2) competitive grant programs. Most HPF appropriated funds are used to provide formula-based matching grants-in-aid to state historic preservation offices (SHPOs) and tribal historic preservation offices (THPOs) and sub-grants to certified local governments (CLGs). Congress also has provided appropriations for additional competitive grant programs that fund specific historic preservation activities. The Appendix to this report provides an overview of the various grant programs that have been funded through the HPF, eligibility requirements, and program goals.  HPF grants are awarded annually to SHPOs of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia and the territories. SHPOs are appointed officials responsible for administering and managing federal funds to conduct historic preservation activities. These activities may include surveys and inventories, nominations to the National Register of Historic Places, preservation education, architectural planning, historic structure reports, community preservation planning, and physical preservation of historic buildings, among others. States conducting these activities are statutorily required to provide a 40% match to the funds provided by the HPF. Guidelines allow each state the flexibility to design and shape its historic preservation program as long as the program meets the overall responsibilities outlined by NHPA. Typically, SHPOs do not use these funds to issue sub-grants to other entities for individual historic preservation projects; rather, SHPOs generally use these funds for their own operational and administrative costs, as well as programmatic activities (listed above) carried out directly by the SHPO. Under federal regulations, at least 10% of the allocations to SHPOs are sub-granted to assist CLGs with local preservation needs (see \" Certified Local Government Program \" below). Congress appropriated $49.7 million in FY2019 and $52.7 million in FY2020 for SHPO grants-in-aid. Since 1996, NPS has awarded annual formula-based grants to Tribal Historic Preservation Offices (THPOs). Eligibility for grants under the THPO grant program is limited to federally recognized tribes that have signed agreements with NPS designating them as having an approved THPO. To become an approved THPO, a tribe submits a request to assume responsibilities from the SHPO and provides a program plan demonstrating how SHPO duties will be conducted. Once a program plan is completed and approved, an agreement between the tribe and the Secretary of the Interior is executed and the THPO becomes eligible for HPF grant support. Similar to SHPO grants, the THPO grant program requires at least a 40% nonfederal match. Activities funded through the program include staff salaries, archeological and architectural surveys, review and compliance activities, comprehensive preservation studies, National Register nominations, educational programs, and other preservation-related activities. Grants are not awarded competitively but instead are determined according to a formula in consultation with tribes. Congress appropriated $11.7 million in FY2019 and $13.7 million in FY2020 for THPO grants-in-aid. NHPA requires that at least 10% of the annual HPF funding provided to each SHPO be sub-granted to local government entities known as certified local governments (CLGs). A CLG is a unit of local (town, city, or county) government that has undergone a certification process administered by NPS and the respective state SHPO, involving demonstration of a commitment to historic preservation. Under this certification process, local governments must meet NPS guidelines that include the establishment of a \"qualified\" historic preservation commission, inventory maintenance and surveys of local historic resources, and enforcement of state or local historic preservation laws, as well as additional requirements that may be established at the state level. Although CLGs receive at least 10% of the total annual apportionment from their respective SHPOs, states may provide more than the required minimum 10% pass-through should they choose to do so. States typically award grants to individual CLGs through a competitive application process established by the SHPO. The National Register of Historic Places (or National Register) stands as the United States' \"official list\" of properties significant in \"American history, architecture, archeology, engineering and culture.\" The National Register is maintained by the Department of the Interior (DOI) and in particular by NPS under the authority of NHPA, as amended. NHPA requires the Secretary of the Interior to maintain the register, develop guidelines and regulations for nominations, consider appeals, make determinations of eligibility of properties, and make the National Register accessible to the public. NPS has developed standards and guidelines to help federal, state, and local governments prepare nominations for the register. SHPOs, THPOs, or federal historic preservation offices typically coordinate nominations for the National Register. Property owners, historical societies, preservation organizations, government agencies, and other interested parties work through these offices to determine whether a given property meets the requisite criteria for listing, at which point a completed nomination and recommendation are submitted to NPS for review. NPS is to decide whether a property should be listed within 45 days after receiving a completed nomination. Benefits of listing on the National Register include honorary designation, access to federal preservation grant funds for planning and rehabilitation activities, possible tax benefits, and required application of Section 106 review should a federal or federally assisted action affect the property. Listing of a property places no restrictions on what nonfederal owners may do with their property, up to and including destruction of the property. Under federal regulations, should a property no longer meet the criteria for listing, the property shall be removed from the National Register. Currently, more than 94,000 properties are listed on the National Register. The National Historic Landmarks (NHL) program\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the National Register\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a federal recognition program administered by NPS. The agency is responsible for overseeing the nomination process for new NHLs and providing technical assistance to existing landmarks. NHLs are places of national significance to the history of the United States (as opposed to National Register properties, which, according to NPS, \"are primarily of state and local significance\"). The Historic Sites Act of 1935 created the NHL program, and the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 clarified the role of NPS as the entity responsible for overseeing the designation of NHLs. All NHLs are also listed in the National Register. Funding for the NHL program falls under the National Register program, and NHLs are eligible for federal investment tax credits, technical assistance, and consideration in federal undertakings, similar to other properties on the National Register. With regard to federal undertakings, however, NHLs have a higher standard for protection than properties listed on the National Register. Whereas Section 106 of NHPA, applicable to properties on the National Register, requires only that agencies \"take into account\" the effects of an undertaking on historic properties, Section 110(f) of the law, applicable to NHLs, requires that agencies \"to the maximum extent possible undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to the landmark.\" Congress chartered the National Trust for Historic Preservation (or National Trust) in 1949. It is a private nonprofit corporation, responsible for encouraging the protection and preservation of historic American sites, buildings, and objects that are significant to the cultural heritage of the United States. The trust provides technical and educational services, promotes historic preservation activities, and administers several historic preservation grant programs. Congress authorized federal funding for the National Trust in the NHPA of 1966. Federal funding for the trust largely continued until FY1996, at which point the Interior Appropriations bill conference report stated that the managers agreed \"to a 3-year period of transition for the National Trust for Historic Preservation to replace federal funds with private funding.\" From FY1998 through FY2001, there was no federal funding for the National Trust. In FY2002, Congress appropriated from the HPF $2.5 million to use as an endowment to maintain and preserve National Trust historic properties. In FY2003, Congress appropriated an additional $2.0 million from the HPF for the endowment, and added $0.5 million more in FY2004. In FY2005, Congress stopped funding the National Trust, and currently the organization's funding comes largely from private donations. In 1976, Congress passed the Tax Reform Act, which provided tax incentives for owners of historic structures to consider rehabilitation and preservation over demolition. Some argued that the law prior to 1976 encouraged the demolition and redevelopment of historic properties over their preservation.  Since then, tax law has continued to evolve into what is now the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which includes historic tax credits (HTCs) administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and NPS in partnership with SHPOs. The HTC program encourages private investment in historic preservation and rehabilitation initiatives by providing a 20% federal tax credit to property owners who undertake substantial rehabilitation of a certified historic structure, while maintaining its historic character. Eligible buildings include those listed on the National Register of Historic Places, or architecturally contributing to a National Register district, that are rehabilitated for income-producing purposes. The program previously included a separate 10% rehabilitation credit for the rehabilitation of nonhistoric, nonresidential buildings built before 1936; however, the 2017 tax revision repealed this credit. Since 1976, over 44,000 projects have been completed under the program, with more than $96 billion leveraged in private investment for the rehabilitation of historic properties. Since 1984, Congress has designated 55 national heritage areas (NHAs) to recognize and assist efforts to protect, commemorate, and promote natural, cultural, historic, and recreational resources that form distinctive landscapes. NHAs are partnerships among NPS, states, and local communities, in which NPS supports state and local conservation through federal recognition, seed money, and technical assistance. Congress has established heritage areas for lands that are regarded as distinctive because of their resources, their built environment, and the culture and history associated with the land and its residents. In a majority of cases, NHAs have had a fundamental economic activity as their foundation, such as agriculture, water transportation, or industrial development. No comprehensive statute establishes criteria for designating NHAs or provides standards for their funding and management. Rather, particulars for each area are provided in the area's enabling legislation. Congress designates a management entity, usually nonfederal, to coordinate the work of the partners.\u00c2\u00a0NHAs are not part of the National Park System, in which lands are primarily federally owned and managed. Real property disposal is the process by which federal agencies identify and then transfer, donate, or sell real property they no longer need. The federal government has several programs that enable state, county, and local governments, as well as nonprofit organizations, to acquire at no cost properties deemed excess to the needs of a federal agency. Two programs in particular address the disposal of historic properties under federal ownership: the Historic Surplus Property Program and the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act Program. The NPS Historic Surplus Property Program is administered in partnership with the General Services Administration (GSA) and was authorized under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended. When federally owned historic buildings are no longer needed by their respective agencies, the GSA declares the buildings to be surplus. Applicants interested in obtaining these properties\u00e2\u0080\u0094which must be listed, or eligible for listing, in the National Register\u00e2\u0080\u0094submit an application to the GSA. Eligible applicants include state and public agencies, tribal entities, and nonprofit organizations. NPS then makes a formal recommendation to the GSA (or the Department of Defense, in the case of military properties) to effect the transfer of property. Once conveyed, a property must be managed and maintained in accordance with the terms of the transfer and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The NPS also administers a program to oversee the transfer of surplus historic lighthouses under federal ownership. Federal lighthouses and light stations were previously transferred to eligible entities through the Historic Surplus Property Program. In 2000, however, Congress passed the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act (NHLPA), an amendment to NHPA. The NHLPA provides a mechanism for the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to dispose of historic lighthouses that are listed, or determined eligible for listing, in the National Register. Similarly to other historic federal properties deemed to be excess, the NHLPA directs the USCG to issue a R eport of E xcess for historic light stations to the GSA, which then releases a notice of availability. At this point, interested parties looking to acquire the light station in question\u00e2\u0080\u0094at no cost\u00e2\u0080\u0094work with NPS to submit a formal application, which is then reviewed by an internal NPS review committee that makes a recommendation to the Secretary of the Interior and the GSA Administrator. If there are no interested parties\u00e2\u0080\u0094or if no applicant meets the requirements set forth by the review committee\u00e2\u0080\u0094the property is offered for sale by competitive bid or auction. Congress occasionally has passed legislation authorizing NPS to establish national networks aimed at coordinating the preservation and education efforts of various places, museums, and interpretive programs associated with specific historical moments or movements in U.S. history. To date, Congress has authorized the establishment of three such networks: the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom ( P.L. 105-203 ), the African American Civil Rights Network ( P.L. 115-104 ), and the Reconstruction Era National Historic Network ( P.L. 116-9 ). Legislation in the 116 th Congress ( H.R. 1179 and S. 2827 ) would establish a fourth network, the African-American Burial Grounds Network. These laws have provided that network sites can include federal, state, local, and privately owned properties, although inclusion in the network requires consent from property owners. Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Interior to produce and disseminate educational materials and provide technical assistance to network sites, and to develop an official symbol or logo for use across the network.  The federal government currently supports historic preservation through a variety of grant programs. The largest source of funding for federal historic preservation programs is the HPF, which currently funds state, tribal, and local historic preservation, African American civil rights grant programs, grants to underrepresented communities, tribal heritage grants, the Save America's Treasures program, disaster recovery grants, historic revitalization grants, and grants to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).  Several other historic preservation grant programs are funded through annual appropriations under other NPS and non-NPS accounts rather than through the HPF. These programs include grants for Japanese American confinement sites, Native American grave protection and repatriation, and preservation and acquisition grants for American battlefields. For a complete list of these programs and their guidelines, refer to the Appendix .  Table 1 , below, compares selected designations used by Congress and the executive branch for historic properties and sites. The table provides information on the entity that confers each designation (e.g., Congress, the President, the Interior or Agriculture Secretary); statutory authorities for the designation; the agency or agencies that administer each type of area (also noting designations for which the area typically is under nonfederal management); selected characteristics of the areas; and examples of each type of area. Designations for nonfederally owned and managed sites are listed according to the agency with administrative responsibility for the designation (e.g., responsibility for evaluating site qualifications and providing technical and/or financial assistance to designated sites). The federal government supports historic preservation through direct appropriations for federally protected sites and grants to nonfederal entities. Grant funding is typically provided to NPS-administered accounts within the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. These accounts provide technical and financial assistance to state, local, and tribal governments, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations with the goal of protecting cultural resources and promoting historic preservation activities across the United States. The majority of the funding is split between two NPS accounts: the HPF account, the primary source of funding for federal historic preservation programs, and the National Recreation and Preservation (NR&P) account, which provides funding for a variety of other congressionally authorized grant programs. Funding for historic preservation programs is not limited to these two accounts, however, nor does Congress exclusively fund grant programs as part of the Interior appropriations bill. Table 2 and Table 3 provide FY2016-FY2020 appropriations figures and the FY2021 budget request for programs funded as part of the HPF and NR&P accounts. In 2016, Congress reauthorized deposits of $150 million annually into the HPF for FY2017 through FY2023. Congress has never appropriated the full $150 million for the HPF since its establishment; however, regular appropriations to NPS's HPF account increased each year from FY2016 to FY2020. The FY2021 budget justification for NPS requests $40.7 million for HPF\u00e2\u0080\u0094a roughly 66% reduction in funding from FY2020 enacted amounts. This request would provide funding only for the core grant-in-aid programs to SHPOs ($26.9 million) and THPOs ($5.7 million), as well as $8 million for grants to HBCUs. It would not provide funding for additional competitive or non-formula-based grant programs. In addition to grant funds through the HPF account, Congress provides funding to other NPS-administered historic preservation grant programs under the National Recreation and Preservation (NR&P) account. This account provides for a broad range of activities related to historic and cultural preservation, as well as programs for recreational activities, natural resource conservation, environmental compliance, operations of the Office of International Affairs, and national heritage areas. Administration of grants funded through the NR&P account and HPF grant administration are included within the NR&P account under the \"Cultural Programs\" line item and the sub-activity \"Grants Administration.\" Congress appropriates direct funding for NPS-administered grant programs under the Cultural Programs line item. The Administration requested $33.9 million for NR&P in FY2021\u00e2\u0080\u0094a roughly 52% reduction from FY2020 enacted amounts.  Historic preservation programs are of perennial interest to Congress and have been the subject of congressional oversight and legislation in the 116 th Congress. Some Members of Congress support proposals to eliminate a federal government role in both administering and financing historic preservation programs, leaving such programs to be sustained by other levels of government or by private support. Others feel that a federal role in supporting historic preservation should be maintained or expanded. Similarly, some advocates believe there may be an inherent or increased tension between preservationist goals and federally controlled or licensed infrastructure projects.  The majority of federal grant programs for historic preservation receive funding through the annual appropriations process. Members of Congress as well as both current and past Administrations have expressed various opinions as to how federal funding for these programs should be allocated and at what levels. Both the FY2020 and the FY2021 budget requests from NPS would have significantly reduced funding for the HPF and would provide no funding for African American civil rights grant programs, grants to underrepresented communities, the Save America's Treasures program, or historic revitalization grants.  In response to the FY2020 budget proposal, the House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands of the Committee on Natural Resources held oversight hearings in April 2019 on the spending priorities and mission of NPS. During these hearings, some Members expressed concern that the proposed reduction in grant funding would impact the ability of communities to protect and maintain culturally and historically important resources. Others\u00e2\u0080\u0094including witnesses from NPS\u00e2\u0080\u0094expressed the position that \"core\" NPS priorities such as infrastructure and the NPS maintenance backlog should take priority over historic preservation when considering the appropriation of federal funds. Other issues Congress may consider are specific to NHPA and current historic preservation laws and regulations. For instance, some have argued that the \"stop, look, and listen\" approach under Section 106 of NHPA does not provide adequate protection for historic resources, since the law only establishes a procedural requirement for federal agencies. According to a study commissioned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2010, NPS reported to Congress that only 2% of all SHPO reviews for Section 106 compliance included findings of adverse effects to historic properties. For those undertakings that are deemed to have an adverse effect on a given historic property, the agency in question is only required to consider these effects\u00e2\u0080\u0094with no explicit legal mandate requiring them to address these potential impacts. In other words, although agencies are compelled to consult with the SHPO/THPO to develop solutions to mitigate effects, agency officials are not required to pursue the solutions, regardless of any adverse effects. As a result, some preservation advocates have charged that NHPA fails in its purported mission to protect cultural and historic sites. Others suggest that Section 106 compliance results in unnecessary and costly delays and have suggested that in some cases, opponents of specific federal projects may invoke Section 106 procedural steps in the hopes of delaying approval for a project\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes to the point of impacting a project's feasibility. Although federal regulations provide certain ways for agencies to tailor the Section 106 process to their needs, some stakeholders have asserted that these options are time-consuming to implement and not flexible enough for undertakings that involve new or emerging technologies. Multiple bills have been introduced to exempt or limit NHPA reviews for certain projects, such as rail and transit infrastructure projects and Federal Communications Commission construction projects for communications facilities following a major disaster. Many of the programs that directly or indirectly support historic preservation also have received attention in recent years. For example, in 2013, the Federal Railroad Administration published a study that concluded \"there is no consistent approach on how to address the National Register eligibility of railroad corridors.\" Although federal regulations outline the criteria for inclusion of a property on the National Register, the report states that inconsistent standards still abound, due to the multitude of entities conducting National Register evaluations. Another program of congressional interest has been the National Heritage Areas program. Legislation has been introduced in recent Congresses to establish a National Heritage Areas System governing the designation, management, and funding of NHAs, to replace the stand-alone approach currently in place. Additionally, some Members\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as past and current Administrations\u00e2\u0080\u0094have expressed interest in ensuring that NHAs eventually become financially self-sufficient and in limiting the federal funding for long-standing areas. In addition, Congress often considers bills to designate specific properties or areas as historically important, under various designations. For example, in the 116 th Congress, P.L. 116-9 included provisions that designated three new historical sites as units of the National Park System and six new national heritage areas, as well as stand-alone provisions that recognized the historical importance of sites across the United States. Although many of the programs described in this report provide for properties to receive historical designation administratively, Congress has at times conferred individual designations in law. Certain programs or designations require congressional action to establish new areas or to designate properties as historically significant.  Table A-1 is an overview of selected federal historic preservation grant programs. This overview focuses on programs with the primary mission of historic preservation and is not a complete representation of all federal grant programs that support historic preservation activities. Most of the programs listed here are subject to annual appropriations and therefore may not be currently funded, despite some programs having congressional authorization to administer grants. Programs authorized or funded in FY2020 for the first time may not be listed below. For example, as part of the FY2020 funding bill ( P.L. 116-94 ), Congress provided funding for a new civil rights grant program that would preserve and highlight the sites and stories associated with women, American Latino, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and LGBTQ Americans. NPS has not yet published eligibility requirements or program guidelines. P.L. 116-94 also authorized two new grant programs as part of the American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP): a battlefield interpretation modernization grant program and a battlefield restoration grant program. As these new programs have yet to receive appropriations from Congress, they are not listed below."
