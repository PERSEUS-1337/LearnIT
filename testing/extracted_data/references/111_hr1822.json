FINDINGS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Sex discrimination findings.--\n                    (A) Women are a vital part of American society and \n                culture and possess the same fundamental human rights \n                and civil rights as men.\n                    (B) United States law prohibits the dissimilar \n                treatment for males and females who are similarly \n                situated and prohibits sex discrimination in various \n                contexts, including the provision of employment, \n                education, housing, health insurance coverage, and \n                athletics.\n                    (C) Sex is an immutable characteristic, and is \n                ascertainable at the earliest stages of human \n                development through existing medical technology and \n                procedures commonly in use, including maternal-fetal \n                bloodstream DNA sampling, amniocentesis, chorionic \n                villus sampling or ``CVS'', and medical sonography. In \n                addition to medically assisted sex-determination \n                carried out by medical professionals, a growing sex-\n                determination niche industry has developed and is \n                marketing low-cost commercial products, widely \n                advertised and available, that aid in the sex \n                determination of an unborn child without the aid of \n                medical professionals. Experts have demonstrated that \n                the sex-selection industry is on the rise and predict \n                that it will continue to be a growing trend in the \n                United States. Sex determination is always a necessary \n                step to the procurement of a sex-selection abortion.\n                    (D) A ``sex-selection abortion'' is an abortion \n                undertaken for purposes of eliminating an unborn child \n                of an undesired sex. Sex-selection abortion is \n                barbaric, and described by scholars and civil rights \n                advocates as an act of sex-based or gender-based \n                violence, predicated on sex discrimination. By \n                definition, sex-selection abortions do not implicate \n                the health of the mother of the unborn, but instead are \n                elective procedures motivated by sex or gender bias.\n                    (E) The targeted victims of sex-selection abortions \n                performed in the United States and worldwide are \n                overwhelmingly female. The selective abortion of \n                females is female infanticide, the intentional killing \n                of unborn females, due to the preference for male \n                offspring or ``son preference''. Son preference is \n                reinforced by the low value associated, by some \n                segments of the world community, with female offspring. \n                Those segments tend to regard female offspring as \n                financial burdens to a family over their lifetime due \n                to their perceived inability to earn or provide \n                financially for the family unit as can a male. In \n                addition, due to social and legal convention, female \n                offspring are less likely to carry on the family name. \n                ``Son preference'' is one of the most evident \n                manifestations of sex or gender discrimination in any \n                society, undermining female equality, and fueling the \n                elimination of females' right to exist in instances of \n                sex-selection abortion.\n                    (F) Sex-selection abortions are not expressly \n                prohibited by United States law and the laws of 48 \n                States. Sex-selection abortions are performed in the \n                United States. In a March 2008 report published in the \n                Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \n                Columbia University economists Douglas Almond and Lena \n                Edlund examined the sex ratio of United States-born \n                children and found ``evidence of sex selection, most \n                likely at the prenatal stage''. The data revealed \n                obvious ``son preference'' in the form of unnatural \n                sex-ratio imbalances within certain segments of the \n                United States population, primarily those segments \n                tracing their ethnic or cultural origins to countries \n                where sex-selection abortion is prevalent. The evidence \n                strongly suggests that some Americans are exercising \n                sex-selection abortion practices within the United \n                States consistent with discriminatory practices common \n                to their country of origin, or the country to which \n                they trace their ancestry. While sex-selection \n                abortions are more common outside the United States, \n                the evidence reveals that female feticide is also \n                occurring in the United States.\n                    (G) The American public supports a prohibition of \n                sex-selection abortion. In a March 2006 Zogby \n                International poll, 86 percent of Americans agreed that \n                sex-selection abortion should be illegal, yet only two \n                States have proscribed sex-selection abortion.\n                    (H) Despite the failure of the United States to \n                proscribe sex-selection abortion, the United States \n                Congress has expressed repeatedly, through \n                Congressional resolution, strong condemnation of \n                policies promoting sex-selection abortion in the \n                ``Communist Government of China''. Likewise, at the \n                2007 United Nation's Annual Meeting of the Commission \n                on the Status of Women, 51st Session, the United \n                States' delegation spearheaded a resolution calling on \n                countries to eliminate sex-selective abortion, a policy \n                directly contradictory to the permissiveness of current \n                United States' law, which places no restriction on the \n                practice of sex-selection abortion. The United Nations \n                Commission on the Status of Women has urged governments \n                of all nations ``to take necessary measures to prevent \n                . . . prenatal sex selection''.\n                    (I) A 1990 report by Harvard University economist \n                Amartya Sen, estimated that more than 100 million women \n                were ``demographically missing'' from the world as \n                early as 1990 due to sexist practices, including sex-\n                selection abortion. Many experts believe sex-selection \n                abortion is the primary cause. As of 2008, estimates of \n                women missing from the world range in the hundreds of \n                millions.\n                    (J) Countries with longstanding experience with \n                sex-selection abortion--such as the Republic of India, \n                the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of \n                China--have enacted complete bans on sex-selection \n                abortion, and have steadily continued to strengthen \n                prohibitions and penalties. The United States, by \n                contrast, has no law in place to restrict sex-selection \n                abortion, establishing the United States as affording \n                less protection from sex-based feticide than the \n                Republic of India or the People's Republic of China, \n                whose recent practices of sex-selection abortion were \n                vehemently and repeatedly condemned by United States \n                congressional resolutions and by the United States' \n                Ambassador to the Commission on the Status of Women. \n                Public statements from within the medical community \n                reveal that citizens of other countries come to the \n                United States for sex-selection procedures that would \n                be criminal in their country of origin. Because the \n                United States permits abortion on the basis of sex, the \n                United States may effectively function as a ``safe \n                haven'' for those who seek to have American physicians \n                do what would otherwise be criminal in their home \n                countries--a sex-selection abortion, most likely late-\n                term.\n                    (K) The American medical community opposes sex-\n                selection abortion. The American College of \n                Obstetricians and Gynecologists, commonly known as \n                ``ACOG'', stated in its February 2007 Ethics Committee \n                Opinion, Number 360, that sex-selection is \n                inappropriate for family planning purposes because sex-\n                selection ``ultimately supports sexist practices''. \n                Likewise, the American Society for Reproductive \n                Medicine has opined that sex-selection for family \n                planning purposes is ethically problematic, \n                inappropriate, and should be discouraged.\n                    (L) Sex-selection abortion results in an unnatural \n                sex-ratio imbalance. An unnatural sex-ratio imbalance \n                is undesirable, due to the inability of the numerically \n                predominant sex to find mates. Experts worldwide \n                document that a significant sex-ratio imbalance in \n                which males numerically predominate can be a cause of \n                increased violence and militancy within a society. \n                Likewise, an unnatural sex-ratio imbalance gives rise \n                to the commoditization of humans in the form of human \n                trafficking, and a consequent increase in kidnapping \n                and other violent crime.\n                    (M) Sex-selection abortions have the effect of \n                diminishing the representation of women in the American \n                population, and therefore, the American electorate.\n                    (N) Sex-selection abortion reinforces sex \n                discrimination and has no place in a civilized society.\n            (2) Racial discrimination findings.--\n                    (A) Minorities are a vital part of American society \n                and culture and possess the same fundamental human \n                rights and civil rights as the majority.\n                    (B) United Sates law prohibits the dissimilar \n                treatment of persons of different races who are \n                similarly situated. United States law prohibits \n                discrimination on the basis of race in various \n                contexts, including the provision of employment, \n                education, housing, health insurance coverage, and \n                athletics.\n                    (C) A ``race-selection abortion'' is an abortion \n                performed for purposes of eliminating an unborn child \n                because the child or a parent of the child is of an \n                undesired race. Race-selection abortion is barbaric, \n                and described by civil rights advocates as an act of \n                race-based violence, predicated on race discrimination. \n                By definition, race-selection abortions do not \n                implicate the health of mother of the unborn, but \n                instead are elective procedures motivated by race bias.\n                    (D) No State has enacted law to proscribe the \n                performance of race-selection abortions.\n                    (E) Race-selection abortions have the effect of \n                diminishing the number of minorities in the American \n                population and therefore, the American electorate.\n                    (F) Race-selection abortion reinforces racial \n                discrimination and has no place in a civilized society.\n            (3) General findings.--\n                    (A) The history of the United States includes \n                examples of both sex discrimination and race \n                discrimination. The people of the United States \n                ultimately responded in the strongest possible legal \n                terms by enacting constitutional amendments correcting \n                elements of such discrimination. Women, once subjected \n                to sex discrimination that denied them the right to \n                vote, now have suffrage guaranteed by the 19th \n                amendment. African-Americans, once subjected to race \n                discrimination through slavery that denied them equal \n                protection of the laws, now have that right guaranteed \n                by the 14th amendment. The elimination of \n                discriminatory practices has been and is among the \n                highest priorities and greatest achievements of \n                American history.\n                    (B) Implicitly approving the discriminatory \n                practices of sex-selection abortion and race-selection \n                abortion by choosing not to prohibit them will \n                reinforce these inherently discriminatory practices, \n                and evidence a failure to protect a segment of certain \n                unborn Americans because those unborn are of a sex or \n                racial makeup that is disfavored. Sex-selection and \n                race-selection abortions trivialize the value of the \n                unborn on the basis of sex or race, reinforcing sex and \n                race discrimination, and coarsening society to the \n                humanity of all vulnerable and innocent human life, \n                making it increasingly difficult to protect such life. \n                Thus, Congress has a compelling interest in acting--\n                indeed it must act--to prohibit sex-selection abortion \n                and race-selection abortion.\n    (b) Constitutional Authority.--In accordance with the above \nfindings, Congress enacts the following pursuant to Congress' power \nunder section 2 of the 13th amendment and section 5 of the 14th \namendment to enforce those amendments, including the prohibition on \ngovernment action denying equal protection of the laws, and the power \nto pass all legislation necessary and proper for the carrying into \nexecution of these powers.\n\nSEC. 3.
