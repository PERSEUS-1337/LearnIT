FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States must have adequate infrastructure and \n        policies in place under the Department of Homeland Security to \n        protect against potential terrorists attempting to enter the \n        United States along the Southwest Border.\n            (2) According to top government officials, several Al Qaeda \n        leaders believe operatives can pay their way into the country \n        through Mexico and also believe illegal entry is more \n        advantageous than legal entry for operational security reasons.\n            (3) Official border patrol records reveal a disturbing \n        trend on the southern border indicating a growth in other than \n        Mexicans (OTMs), many from countries of interest, crossing into \n        the United States--between 2003 and 2004 the increase was at \n        least 35 percent.\n            (4) Because of budget constraints, the U.S. Immigration and \n        Customs Enforcement Office of Detention and Removal does not \n        have sufficient bed space to detain all illegal immigrants from \n        special interest countries therefore releasing them on personal \n        recognizance.\n            (5) The Department of Homeland Security estimates that up \n        to 90 percent of these immigrants do not appear for their \n        immigration hearings.\n            (6) The Department of Homeland Security needs more \n        personnel at the borders with the necessary security clearances \n        and equipment to adequately screen and detain immigrants coming \n        to the United States.\n            (7) The Secretary of Homeland Security should provide \n        appropriate training for inspectors, and associated support \n        staff, on an ongoing basis to utilize new technologies and to \n        ensure that the proficiency levels of such personnel are \n        acceptable to protect the borders of the United States.\n\nSEC. 2. IMPROVEMENT IN SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS ALONG THE UNITED \n              STATES-MEXICO BORDER AND INCREASE IN DETENTION BEDS.\n\n    (a) Improvement in Security Clearance Process.--The Secretary of \nHomeland Security shall--\n            (1) expeditiously implement policies ensuring that \n        personnel of the Department of Homeland Security along the \n        United States-Mexico border have the security clearances \n        required to access information necessary to adequately screen \n        immigrants entering the United States at such border, including \n        IDENT and IAFIS databases and databases used by the \n        Department's inspectors in secondary inspections;\n            (2) develop the interagency agreements and information \n        technology infrastructure necessary for border agents to \n        adequately screen immigrants entering the United States at such \n        border; and\n            (3) explore information sharing programs with countries of \n        interest to adequately screen immigrants entering our borders.\n    (b) Increase in Detention Beds.--Subject to the availability of \nappropriations, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall increase by \nthe amount necessary the number of detention beds needed to detain all \nimmigrants apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nOffice of Detention and Removal Operation should be placed under the \noperational control of the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, since the largest client of such office is the Border \nPatrol.\n\nSEC. 3.
