FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1)(A) Many information technology computer systems, \n        software programs, and similar facilities are essential to the \n        functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, utilities, \n        government, and safety and defense systems, in the United \n        States and throughout the world.\n            (B) Protecting systems and products against domestic and \n        international attacks or misuse through the Internet, public, \n        or private telecommunications systems, or similar means is a \n        matter of national and global interest.\n            (C) Such protection is best accomplished through private \n        sector solutions that are market driven and industry led \n        because the private sector owns, operates, and has developed \n        many of the networks, products, and services that constitute \n        the information infrastructure.\n            (D) Government should work cooperatively with industry on a \n        voluntary basis to achieve such protection and should not \n        mandate the private sector use particular technologies, dictate \n        standards, or impose undue costs.\n            (2) The prompt, voluntary, candid, and thorough, but secure \n        and protected, disclosure and exchange of information related \n        to the cyber security of entities, systems, and \n        infrastructure--\n                    (A) would greatly enhance the ability of private \n                and public entities to improve their cyber security;\n                    (B) would measurably contribute to avoidance of \n                financial risk and loss resulting from disruption or \n                harm to critical institutional elements of the United \n                States economy, including but not limited to securities \n                exchanges, banking and other financial services \n                institutions, communications networks, transportation \n                systems, manufacturing, information technology, health \n                care, government services, and electric utilities and \n                energy providers, or from serious damage to public \n                confidence in such critical institutional elements; and\n                    (C) is therefore a vital factor in minimizing any \n                potential cyber security-related disruption to the \n                Nation's critical infrastructure and the consequences \n                for its economic well-being and national security.\n            (3) Concern about the potential for legal liability \n        associated with the disclosure and exchange of cyber security \n        information has impeded and continues to impede the secure \n        disclosure and protected exchange of such information.\n            (4) The capability to securely disclose and engage in the \n        protected exchange of information relating to cyber security, \n        solutions, test practices, test results, and risk assessments \n        and audits, without undue concern about inappropriate \n        disclosure of that information, is critical to the ability of \n        private and public entities to address cyber security needs in \n        a timely manner.\n            (5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal \n        standards in connection with the secure disclosure and \n        protected exchange of cyber security information that will \n        promote appropriate disclosures and exchanges of such \n        information in a timely fashion.\n            (6) The ``National Plan for Information Systems Protection, \n        Version 1.0, An Invitation to a Dialogue'', released by the \n        President on January 7, 2000, calls for the Government to \n        assist in seeking changes to applicable laws on ``Freedom of \n        Information, liability, and antitrust where appropriate'' in \n        order to foster industry-wide centers for information sharing \n        and analysis.\n    (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in article 1, \nsection 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, the \npurposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote the secure disclosure and protected exchange \n        of cyber security information;\n            (2) to assist private industry and government in responding \n        effectively and rapidly to cyber security problems;\n            (3) to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by \n        establishing certain legal principles in connection with the \n        secure disclosure and protected exchange of cyber security \n        information; and\n            (4) to protect the legitimate users of cyber networks and \n        systems, and to protect the privacy and confidentiality of \n        shared information.\n\nSEC. 3.
