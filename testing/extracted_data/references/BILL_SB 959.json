    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares the following:\n(a) It is a matter of statewide concern that responsible competitive bidding at the University of California become more transparent than it is at present, in order that illegal and abusive employment practices by contractors can be prevented and, if not prevented, then brought to light and eliminated, with all victims of wage theft made whole for their employers\u2019 violations.\n(b) It is a matter of statewide concern that responsible competitive bidding at the University of California not undercut the wages and benefits provided by the University of California for comparable work, given that a significant percentage of University of California employees already are eligible for public benefits and any material decrease in the compensation of employees performing such work would result in materially increased General Fund costs for the provision of benefits.\n(c) It is a matter of statewide concern that the University of California not repeat past instances in which public resources have been squandered via contracting out to for-profit private contractors that charge significant administrative overhead.\n(d) In amending the Public Contract Code to promote responsible contracting at the University of California, it is important to delay the amendments\u2019 effective date until January 1, 2018, in order to afford adequate preparatory time to the university and to contractors intending to bid on university contracts, as well as to lessen the cost of the amendments\u2019 requirements by delaying their effect until after the university\u2019s $15 per hour minimum wage for contracted employees is fully in effect.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 10507.6 is added to the Public Contract Code, to read:\n10507.6.\n(a) For the purposes of this article, to qualify as a lowest responsible bidder or best value awardee on any contract for building maintenance, cleaning or custodial services, call center services, dining and food services, gardening, grounds keeping and plant nursery services, laborer services, mail room services, parking, shuttle bus, or transportation services, security services, storekeeper services, truck driving services, patient care technical employee services, patient billing services, medical transcribing services, patient escort services, or nursing assistant services a bidder shall satisfy the requirements set forth in this section.\n(b) (1) A bidder shall certify in writing to the University of California that the bid includes a total employee compensation package, including fringe benefits, that is valued on a per-employee basis at a level sufficient that it does not undercut by more than 5 percent the average per-employee value of total compensation, including fringe benefits, for employees of the University of California who perform comparable work at the relevant campus, medical center, or laboratory at which the bidder proposes to perform the work.\n(2) The University of California shall implement this section by including in its request for proposals a calculation of the average per-employee value of total compensation, including fringe benefits, for employees of the University of California who perform comparable work at the relevant campus, medical center, or laboratory, and that calculation shall use all known cost escalators to project the future rate of growth of average per-employee total compensation costs.\n(c) A bidder shall certify in writing to the University of California that, within the prior five years, the bidder has not been found liable for any violation of Section 484 of the Penal Code, Sections 200 through 558, inclusive, 1197.5, or 2810.5 of the Labor Code, or any wage order issued by the Industrial Welfare Commission, in any amount totaling more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) or 0.3 percent of the bidder\u2019s most recent annual gross revenue, whichever is less.\n(d) All records provided by a bidder or contractor to the university pursuant to this section shall be disclosed to any member of the public making a request to the university under Section 6253 of the Government Code, provided that (1) the university shall redact those portions of such records containing confidential information within the meaning of subdivision (c) of Section 6254 of the Government Code, and (2) the university, in responding to any request made during the course of a bid process that is not yet complete, shall delay until after the bid process is complete before disclosing any records containing materials submitted by a bidder.\n(e) The requirements of this section shall not apply to employees covered by Section 1191.5 of the Labor Code or subdivision (c) of Section 214 of Title 29 of the United States Code.
