FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is estimated that--\n                    (A) approximately 2 percent of adults and about 5 \n                percent of infants and young children in the United \n                States suffer from food allergies; and\n                    (B) each year, roughly 30,000 individuals require \n                emergency room treatment and 150 individuals die \n                because of allergic reactions to food;\n            (2)(A) eight major foods or food groups--milk, eggs, fish, \n        Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans--\n        account for 90 percent of food allergies;\n            (B) at present, there is no cure for food allergies; and\n            (C) a food allergic consumer must avoid the food to which \n        the consumer is allergic;\n            (3)(A) in a review of the foods of randomly selected \n        manufacturers of baked goods, ice cream, and candy in Minnesota \n        and Wisconsin in 1999, the Food and Drug Administration found \n        that 25 percent of sampled foods failed to list peanuts or eggs \n        as ingredients on the food labels; and\n            (B) nationally, the number of recalls because of unlabeled \n        allergens rose to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier;\n            (4) a recent study shows that many parents of children with \n        a food allergy were unable to correctly identify in each of \n        several food labels the ingredients derived from major food \n        allergens;\n            (5)(A) ingredients in foods must be listed by their \n        ``common or usual name'';\n            (B) in some cases, the common or usual name of an \n        ingredient may be unfamiliar to consumers, and many consumers \n        may not realize the ingredient is derived from, or contains, a \n        major food allergen; and\n            (C) in other cases, the ingredients may be declared as a \n        class, including spices, flavorings, and certain colorings, or \n        are exempt from the ingredient labeling requirements, such as \n        incidental additives; and\n            (6)(A) celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease that \n        causes damage to the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous \n        system, and other organs;\n            (B) the current recommended treatment is avoidance of \n        glutens in foods that are associated with celiac disease; and\n            (C) a multicenter, multiyear study estimated that the \n        prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is 0.5 to 1 \n        percent of the general population.\n\nSEC. 3.

A \nfinding by the Secretary under this paragraph (including any change in \nan earlier finding under this paragraph) is effective upon publication \nin the Federal Register as a notice.\n    ``(4) Notwithstanding subsection (g), (i), or (k), or any other \nlaw, a flavoring, coloring, or incidental additive that is, or that \nbears or contains, a major food allergen shall be subject to the \nlabeling requirements of this subsection.\n    ``(5) The Secretary may by regulation modify the requirements of \nsubparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1), or eliminate either the \nrequirement of subparagraph (A) or the requirements of subparagraph (B) \nof paragraph (1), if the Secretary determines that the modification or \nelimination of the requirement of subparagraph (A) or the requirements \nof subparagraph (B) is necessary to protect the public health.\n    ``(6)(A) Any person may petition the Secretary to exempt a food \ningredient described in section 201(qq)(2) from the allergen labeling \nrequirements of this subsection.\n    ``(B) The Secretary shall approve or deny such petition within 180 \ndays of receipt of the petition or the petition shall be deemed denied, \nunless an extension of time is mutually agreed upon by the Secretary \nand the petitioner.\n    ``(C) The burden shall be on the petitioner to provide scientific \nevidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) \nthat demonstrates that such food ingredient, as derived by the method \nspecified in the petition, does not cause an allergic response that \nposes a risk to human health.\n    ``(D) A determination regarding a petition under this paragraph \nshall constitute final agency action.\n    ``(E) The Secretary shall promptly post to a public site all \npetitions received under this paragraph within 14 days of receipt and \nthe Secretary shall promptly post the Secretary's response to each.\n    ``(7)(A) A person need not file a petition under paragraph (6) to \nexempt a food ingredient described in section 201(qq)(2) from the \nallergen labeling requirements of this subsection, if the person files \nwith the Secretary a notification containing--\n            ``(i) scientific evidence (including the analytical method \n        used) that demonstrates that the food ingredient (as derived by \n        the method specified in the notification, where applicable) \n        does not contain allergenic protein; or\n            ``(ii) a determination by the Secretary that the ingredient \n        does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human \n        health under a premarket approval or notification program under \n        section 409.\n    ``(B) The food ingredient may be introduced or delivered for \nintroduction into interstate commerce as a food ingredient that is not \na major food allergen 90 days after the date of receipt of the \nnotification by the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines within \nthe 90-day period that the notification does not meet the requirements \nof this paragraph, or there is insufficient scientific evidence to \ndetermine that the food ingredient does not contain allergenic protein \nor does not cause an allergenic response that poses a risk to human \nhealth.\n    ``(C) The Secretary shall promptly post to a public site a list of \nall notifications received under this subparagraph within 14 days of \nreceipt and promptly post any objections thereto by the Secretary.\n    ``(x) Notwithstanding subsection (g), (i), or (k), or any other \nlaw, a spice, flavoring, coloring, or incidental additive that is, or \nthat bears or contains, a food allergen (other than a major food \nallergen), as determined by the Secretary by regulation, shall be \ndisclosed in a manner specified by the Secretary by regulation.''.\n    (b) Effect on Other Authority.--The amendments made by this section \nthat require a label or labeling for major food allergens do not alter \nthe authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) to require \na label or labeling for other food allergens.\n    (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n            (1) Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n        (21 U.S.C. 321) (as amended by section 2(b)) is amended by \n        adding at the end the following:\n    ``(qq) The term `major food allergen' means any of the following:\n            ``(1) Milk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), \n        Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree \n        nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and \n        soybeans.\n            ``(2) A food ingredient that contains protein derived from \n        a food specified in paragraph (1), except the following:\n                    ``(A) Any highly refined oil derived from a food \n                specified in paragraph (1) and any ingredient derived \n                from such highly refined oil.\n                    ``(B) A food ingredient that is exempt under \n                paragraph (6) or (7) of section 403(w).''.\n            (2) Section 403A(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n        Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343-1(a)(2)) is amended by striking \n``or 403(i)(2)'' and inserting ``403(i)(2), 403(w), or 403(x)''.\n    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to any food that is labeled on or after January 1, 2006.\n\nSEC. 4.
