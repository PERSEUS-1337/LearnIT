FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et \n        seq.) established overtime compensation requirements for \n        certain employees when they work more than 40 hours in a given \n        workweek.\n            (2) Under section 13(a)(1) of such Act, Congress delegated \n        to the Secretary of Labor the authority to define and delimit \n        the terms relating to the exemption for bona fide executive, \n        administrative, and professional employees (commonly known as \n        the ``white collar exemption'').\n            (3) For more than 75 years, the Secretary of Labor has \n        exercised its delegated authority to issue regulations that \n        define and delimit the terms relating to the white collar \n        exemption by applying a duties test and applying a minimum \n        compensation level (or salary threshold).\n            (4) The Secretary of Labor began utilizing a salary \n        threshold in the initial regulations defining and delimiting \n        the terms relating to the white collar exemption, which were \n        first issued in 1938.\n            (5) Congress has long approved the use of a salary \n        threshold by the Secretary of Labor, as demonstrated by the \n        fact that Congress has amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n        1938 at least 10 times since 1938 and has not precluded the \n        Secretary from using a salary threshold.\n            (6) The salary threshold became woefully out of date and \n        ineffective as a result of not being sufficiently updated to \n        keep pace with a changing economy, as evidenced by the fact \n        that more than 60 percent of all full-time salaried workers \n        earned less than the salary threshold in 1975 and less than 7 \n        percent of these workers earned less than the salary threshold \n        in 2016.\n            (7) The salary threshold of $455 per week, or $23,660 per \n        year, that was in effect on May 22, 2016, was below the poverty \n        line for a family of 4.\n            (8) The Secretary of Labor updated the salary threshold on \n        May 23, 2016, through a final rule entitled ``Defining and \n        Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, \n        Professional, Outside Sales and Computer Employees'' (81 Fed. \n        Reg. 32391) by increasing the salary threshold to the 40th \n        percentile of earnings of full-time salaried employees in the \n        lowest-wage Census Region, resulting in a salary threshold of \n        $913 per week or $47,476 per year.\n            (9) The final rule would benefit more than 13,000,000 \n        employees by providing overtime compensation protections to \n        4,200,000 new employees and strengthening overtime compensation \n        protections for 8,900,000 additional employees.\n            (10) The Secretary of Labor went through a thorough process \n        in crafting the final rule, seeking public input and conducting \n        extensive economic analysis, including--\n                    (A) spending more than a year meeting with more \n                than 200 interested parties to obtain input before \n                issuing the proposed rule in 2015;\n                    (B) considering more than 270,000 comments received \n                during the 60-day public comment period on the proposed \n                rule; and\n                    (C) making significant changes in response to \n                public input before issuing the final rule.\n            (11) The public comments submitted to the Secretary of \n        Labor regarding the proposed rule were overwhelmingly positive \n        and supportive of the rule.\n            (12) The increase in the salary threshold, included in the \n        final rule, to the 40th percentile of earnings of full-time \n        salaried employees in the lowest-wage Census Region, resulting \n        in a threshold of $913 per week or $47,476 per year, was a \n        strong yet measured increase by almost any measure, including \n        as compared to--\n                    (A) the higher salary threshold of $970 per week or \n                $50,440 per year, initially put forward by the \n                Secretary of Labor in the proposed rule;\n                    (B) the salary threshold of $984 per week or \n                $51,168 per year, which would have fully accounted for \n                the erosion to the value of the salary threshold since \n                1975 due to inflation;\n                    (C) the salary threshold of $1,122 per week or \n                $58,344 per year, which would have covered the same \n                share of all salaried workers as were covered in 1975 \n                after accounting for changes in the economy; and\n                    (D) the salary threshold of $1,327 per week or \n                $69,004 per year, which would have covered the same \n                percentage of all salaried workers as were covered in \n                1975 without accounting for changes in the economy.\n            (13) The United States District Court for the Eastern \n        District of Texas erroneously called the authority of the \n        Secretary of Labor under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n        into question when it issued a preliminary injunction enjoining \n        the Department of Labor from enforcing the final overtime rule.\n            (14) The United States District Court for the Eastern \n        District of Texas issued a final decision invalidating the \n        rule, threatening overtime protections for millions of workers.\n\nSEC. 3.
