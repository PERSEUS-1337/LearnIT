NANOTECHNOLOGY IN SCHOOLS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is \n        generating scientific and technological breakthroughs that will \n        benefit society by improving the way many things are designed \n        and made.\n            (2) Nanotechnology is likely to have a significant, \n        positive impact on the security, economic well-being, and \n        health of Americans as fields related to nanotechnology expand.\n            (3) In order to maximize the benefits of nanotechnology to \n        individuals in the United States, the United States must \n        maintain world leadership in the field, including nanoscience \n        and microtechnology, in the face of determined competition from \n        other nations.\n            (4) According to the National Science Foundation, foreign \n        students on temporary visas earned 33 percent of all science \n        and engineering doctorates awarded in the United States in \n        2007, the last year for which data are available. Foreign \n        students earned 63 percent of the engineering doctorates.\n            (5) To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the \n        United States must make a long-term investment in educating \n        United States students in secondary schools and institutions of \n        higher education, so that the students are able to conduct \n        nanoscience research and develop and commercialize \n        nanotechnology applications.\n            (6) Preparing United States students for careers in \n        nanotechnology, including nanoscience, requires that the \n        students have access to the necessary scientific tools, \n        including scanning electron microscopes designed for teaching, \n        and requires training to enable teachers and professors to use \n        those tools in the classroom and the laboratory.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to strengthen the \ncapacity of United States secondary schools and institutions of higher \neducation to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology by \nproviding grants to those schools and institutions to provide the tools \nnecessary for such preparation.\n    (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n        the National Science Foundation.\n            (2) Eligible institution.--The term ``eligible \n        institution'' means an institution that is--\n                    (A) a public, private, parochial, or charter \n                secondary school that offers 1 or more advanced \n                placement science courses or international \n                baccalaureate science courses;\n                    (B) a community college, as defined in section 3301 \n                of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n                (20 U.S.C. 7011);\n                    (C) a 4-year institution of higher education or a \n                branch, within the meaning of section 498(j) of the \n                Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1099c(j)), of \n                such an institution; or\n                    (D) a informal learning science and technology \n                center.\n            (3) Qualified nanotechnology equipment.--The term \n        ``qualified nanotechnology equipment'' means equipment, \n        instrumentation, or hardware that is--\n                    (A) used for teaching nanotechnology in the \n                classroom; and\n                    (B) manufactured in the United States at least 50 \n                percent from articles, materials, or supplies that are \n                mined, produced, or manufactured, as the case may be, \n                in the United States.\n    (d) Program Authorized.--\n            (1) Program authorized.--The Director shall establish a \n        nanotechnology in the schools program to strengthen the \n        capacity of eligible institutions to provide instruction in \n        nanotechnology.
