FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereafter the \n        ``PLO'') has recognized the State of Israel's right to exist in \n        peace and security; accepted United Nations Security Council \n        Resolutions 242 and 338; committed itself to the peace process \n        and peaceful coexistence with Israel, free from violence and \n        all other acts which endanger peace and stability; and assumed \n        responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in order to \n        assure their compliance, prevent violations, and discipline \n        violators;\n            (2) Israel has recognized the PLO as the representative of \n        the Palestinian people;\n            (3) Israel and the PLO signed a Declaration of Principles \n        on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (hereafter the \n        ``Declaration of Principles'') on September 13, 1993, at the \n        White House;\n            (4) Israel and PLO signed an agreement on the Gaza Strip \n        and the Jericho Area (hereafter the ``Gaza-Jericho Agreement'') \n        on May 4, 1994, which established a Palestinian Authority for \n        the Gaza and Jericho areas;\n            (5) Israel and the PLO signed an Agreement on Preparatory \n        Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities (hereafter the ``Early \n        Empowerment Agreement'') on August 29, 1994, which provided for \n        the transfer to the Palestinian Authority of certain powers and \n        responsibilities in the West Bank outside of the Jericho area;\n            (6) under the terms of the Declaration of Principles, the \n        Gaza-Jericho Agreement and the Early Empowerment Agreement, the \n        powers and responsibilities of the Palestinian Authority are to \n        be assumed by an elected Palestinian Council with jurisdiction \n        in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in accordance with the interim \n        agreement to be concluded between Israel and the PLO;\n            (7) permanent status negotiations relating to the West Bank \n        and Gaza Strip are scheduled to begin by May 1996;\n            (8) the Congress has, since the conclusion of the \n        Declaration of Principles and the PLO's renunciation of \n        terrorism, provided authorities to the President to suspend \n        certain statutory restrictions relating to the PLO, subject to \n        Presidential certifications that the PLO has continued to abide \n        by commitments made in and in connection with or resulting from \n        the good faith implementation of the Declaration of Principles;\n            (9) the PLO commitments relevant to Presidential \n        certifications have included commitments to renounce and \n        condemn terrorism, to submit to the Palestinian National \n        Council for formal approval the necessary changes to those \n        articles of the Palestinian Covenant which call for Israel's \n        destruction, and to prevent acts of terrorism and hostilities \n        against Israel; and\n            (10) the President, in exercising the aforementioned \n        authorities, has certified to the Congress on four occasions \n        that the PLO was abiding by its relevant commitments.\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that although the PLO has recently \nshown improvement in its efforts to fulfill its commitments, it must do \nfar more to demonstrate an irrevocable denunciation of terrorism and \nensure a peaceful settlement of the Middle East dispute, and in \nparticular it must--\n            (1) submit to the Palestine National Council for formal \n        approval the necessary changes to those articles of the \n        Palestinian National Covenant which call for Israel's \n        destruction;\n            (2) make greater efforts to preempt acts of terror, to \n        discipline violators and to contribute to stemming the violence \n        that has resulted in the deaths of 123 Israeli citizens since \n        the signing of the Declaration of Principles;\n            (3) prohibit participation in its activities and in the \n        Palestinian Authority and its successors by any groups or \n        individuals which continue to promote and commit acts of \n        terrorism;\n            (4) cease all anti-Israel rhetoric, which potentially \n        undermines the peace process;\n            (5) confiscate all unlicensed weapons and restrict the \n        issuance of licenses to those with legitimate need;\n            (6) transfer and cooperate in transfer proceedings relating \n        to any person accused by Israel of acts of terrorism; and\n            (7) respect civil liberties, human rights, and democratic \n        norms.\n\nSEC. 4.
