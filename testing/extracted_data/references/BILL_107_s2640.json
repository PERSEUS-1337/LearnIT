FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the 3 elementary schools available for the children of \n        employees of Yosemite National Park are administered by the \n        Bass Lake Joint Union Elementary School District and the \n        Mariposa Unified School District;\n            (2) the elementary schools are in remote mountainous areas \n        that are long distances from other educational and \n        administrative facilities of the local school districts;\n            (3) because of the remote locations of and relatively small \n        number of students at the elementary schools serving the \n        children of employees of the Park, the elementary schools \n        provide fewer services in more basic facilities than other \n        schools located in the local school districts; and\n            (4) because of the long distances involved and adverse \n        weather and road conditions that occur during much of the \n        school year, it is impractical for the children of employees of \n        the Park who live in or near the Park to attend other schools \n        located in the local school districts.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the Secretary \nof the Interior to provide supplemental funding and other services that \nare necessary to assist the State of California or local educational \nagencies in the State in providing educational services for students \nattending schools located in Yosemite National Park.\n\nSEC. 2.
