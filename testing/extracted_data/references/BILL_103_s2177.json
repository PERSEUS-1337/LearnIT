FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has invested $6,500,000,000 in \n        military infrastructure in North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        (NATO) countries.\n            (2) As part of an overall plan to reduce United States \n        troop strength in Europe from 323,432 in 1987 to 100,000 by the \n        end of 1996, the Department of Defense plans to close or reduce \n        United States military presence at 867 military sites overseas.\n            (3) Most of the overseas military sites announced for \n        closure are in Europe where the United States has already \n        closed 434 such sites.\n            (4) When the United States closes military sites in Europe, \n        the United States brings the military personnel home but leaves \n        buildings, roads, sewers, and other real property improvements \n        behind.\n            (5) Through a series of so-called ``residual value'' \n        agreements, some allies have agreed to pay the United States \n        for the value of the real property improvements left behind.\n            (6) Although the United States military drawdown has been \n        rapid since 1990, European allies have been slow to pay the \n        United States the residual value of the sites released by the \n        United States.\n            (7) As of 1994, the United States has recouped only \n        $33,300,000 in cash, and most of that was recovered in 1989.\n            (8) Although the United States has released to Germany over \n        60 percent of the military sites planned for closure by the \n        United States in that country and the current value of United \n        States facilities to be returned to the German government is \n        estimated at approximately $2,700,000,000, the German \n        government has budgeted only $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 \n        for payment of compensation for the United States investment in \n        such improvements.\n\nSEC. 2. POLICY.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the President should redouble efforts to recover the \n        value of the United States investment in the military \n        infrastructure of NATO countries;\n            (2) the President should enter into negotiations with the \n        government of each NATO host country with a presumption that \n        payments to compensate the United States for the fair market \n        value of improvements will be made in cash and deposited in the \n        Department of Defense Overseas Military Facility Investment \n        Recovery Account;\n            (3) the President should enter into negotiations for \n        payments-in-kind only as a last resort and only after informing \n        the Congress that negotiations for cash payments have not been \n        successful; and\n            (4) to the extent that in-kind contributions are received \n        in lieu of cash payments in any fiscal year, the in-kind \n        contributions should directly offset costs that would otherwise \n        be incurred by the Department of Defense for overseas base \n        support that has been approved by Congress or for overseas base \n        support requested by the President in the budget submitted to \n        Congress for the succeeding fiscal year.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS RELATING TO PAYMENTS IN KIND.\n\n    (a) Requirement for Justification for Negotiations for Payments-in-\nKind.--Subsection (e) of section 2921 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1992 (10 U.S.C. 2687 note) is \namended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``Negotiations for Payments-\n        in-Kind.--'';\n            (2) by striking out ``a written notice'' and all that \n        follows and inserting in lieu thereof ``to the congressional \n        defense committees (and one additional copy to each of the \n        Subcommittees on Defense of the Committees on Appropriations of \n        the Senate and the House of Representatives) a written notice \n        regarding the intended negotiations.''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(2) The notice shall contain the following:\n            ``(A) A justification for entering into negotiations for \n        payments-in-kind with the host country.\n            ``(B) The types of benefit options to be pursued by the \n        Secretary in the negotiations.\n            ``(C) The specific overseas base support activities (for \n        which funding has either previously been approved by Congress \n        or requested in the latest budget transmitted by the President \n        to Congress pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United \n        States Code) that could be curtailed, eliminated, terminated, \n        or withdrawn to reduce the amount of United States overseas \n        base support spending by an amount not less that the fair \n        market value of the improvements to be released to the host \n        country in exchange for the payments-in-kind.''.\n    (b) Deficit Reduction Through Payments-in-Kind.--Such section is \namended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(h) Deficit Reduction Through Payments-in-Kind.--(1)(A) Not less \nthan 30 days before the Secretary of Defense enters into an agreement \nwith a host country to accept from the host country any improvement as \na payment-in-kind, the President shall--\n            ``(i) submit to Congress a request for rescission of \n        appropriations for overseas base support;\n            ``(ii) submit to Congress a message recommending a \n        reduction in the request for appropriations for overseas base \n        support that is set forth in the budget transmitted to Congress \n        pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, \n        for the fiscal year that begins in the year that the President \n        submits the message to Congress; or\n            ``(iii) a combination of actions under clauses (i) and \n        (ii).\n    ``(B) The total amount of the reductions proposed to be achieved in \nthe proposed actions submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) in the case \nof a payment-in-kind of a host country may not be less than the fair \nmarket value of the improvements to be released to the host country in \nexchange for such payment-in-kind.\n    ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may not accept as a payment-in-kind \nany improvements to real property that, if undertaken to be made by the \nDepartment of Defense, would be subject to--\n            ``(A) the requirement for authorization of appropriations \n        for military construction set forth in section 114(a)(6) of \n        title 10, United States Code, and\n            ``(B) the requirement set forth in section 2802 of such \n        title, relating to authorization of military construction \n        projects by law,\nunless such improvements comprise a military construction project that \nis authorized by law.''.\n    (c) Overseas Base Support Defined.--Such section, as amended by \nsubsection (b), is further amended by adding at the end the following \nnew subsection:\n    ``(i) Overseas Base Support Defined.--In subsections (e) and (h), \nthe term `overseas base support' means--\n            ``(1) military construction (as defined in section 114(b) \n        of title 10, United States Code) outside the United States;\n            ``(2) maintenance of real property outside the United \n        States for the Department of Defense; and\n            ``(3) contributions for the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization Infrastructure Program as provided in section 2806 \n        of title 10, United States Code.''."
