NATIONAL PARKS OVERFLIGHTS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) noise associated with aircraft overflights at a \n        national park can cause a significant adverse effect on the \n        natural quiet and experience of the park; and\n            (2) aircraft operations in a national park can raise \n        serious concerns regarding public safety, including concerns \n        regarding the safety of park users.\n    (b) Recommendations.--\n            (1) Submission.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n        Administrator recommendations regarding actions necessary--\n                    (A) to protect public health and safety from \n                adverse effects associated with aircraft overflights at \n                any national park;\n                    (B) to protect the resources of any national park \n                experiencing an adverse impact associated with noise \n                from aircraft overflights;\n                    (C) to preserve natural quiet at any national park \n                where natural quiet is a part of the park's natural \n                resources and experience; and\n                    (D) to prevent resource impairment from noise \n                associated with overflights at any national park.\n            (2) Restoration or preservation of quiet.--The \n        recommendations shall provide for--\n                    (A) protection of public health and safety from \n                adverse affects associated with aircraft overflights; \n                and\n                    (B) substantial restoration of the natural quiet or \n                substantial preservation of the natural quiet and \n                experience of the park.\n            (3) Flight-free zones, flight restrictions, and flight \n        bans.--\n                    (A) In general.--The recommendations shall include \n                proposals for flight-free zones, for appropriate flight \n                restrictions, or for banning flights within certain \n                national parks as necessary to meet the goals of \n                paragraph (2).\n                    (B) Administration and emergency operations.--\n                Flight-free zones and flight bans shall provide for \n                flight free areas over a national park, except for \n                purposes of administration, emergency operations, and \n                operations required for transportation of persons and \n                supplies to and from Indian reservations adjacent to \n                any affected national park.\n                    (C) Military and other public operations.--The \n                recommendations may exempt noncommercial general \n                aviation, military, and other public operations from \n                proposed flight-free zones, flight restrictions, or \n                proposals banning flights within a park.\n                    (D) Flight restrictions.--Flight restrictions, \n                including curfews and limitations on the number of \n                flights in a park may be contained in proposed \n                regulations if necessary to preserve, protect, or \n                restore the natural quiet and experience of the park.\n                    (E) Commercial air tours.--Flight bans shall \n                prevent commercial air tours in a park if necessary to \n                preserve, protect, or restore the natural quiet and \n                experience of the park.\n            (4) Prioritization of parks for implementation of \n        recommendations.--The recommendations shall include a proposal \n        for prioritizing the scheduled implementation of plans \n        regulating overflights in the national parks based on the \nresource impairment--\n                    (A) caused by overflights in the national parks; or\n                    (B) threatened by the introduction or increase of \n                overflights in the national parks.\n            (5) Flight altitudes.--The Administrator, after \n        consultation with the Secretary, may--\n                    (A) establish minimum flight altitudes to include \n                in the recommendations;

or\n                    (D) explains why implementation of subparagraphs \n                (A), (B), and (C) is not necessary or appropriate to \n                meet the requirements of paragraph (2).\n    (c) Implementation.--\n            (1) Preparation of plan.--Not later than 90 days after \n        receipt of recommendations under subsection (b) and after \n        notice and opportunity for hearing, the Administrator shall \n        prepare and issue a final plan for the management of air \n        traffic in the airspace above any national park--\n                    (A) experiencing an adverse impact associated with \n                noise from aircraft overflights; or\n                    (B) for which the Secretary determines that air \n                tours need to be regulated in order to prevent resource \n                impairment from overflights.\n            (2) Review of recommendations.--\n                    (A) In general.--The plan shall provide for \n                implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary \n                without change, unless the Administrator determines \n                that implementing the recommendations without change \n                would adversely affect aviation safety.\n                    (B) Review of recommendations.--If the \n                Administrator determines that implementing the \n                recommendations would adversely affect aviation safety, \n                the Administrator shall, not later than 60 days after \n                making the determination, in consultation with the \n                Secretary and after notice and opportunity for \n                hearing--\n                            (i) revise the recommendations consistent \n                        with the requirements of subsection (b) to \n                        eliminate the adverse effects on aviation \n                        safety;
