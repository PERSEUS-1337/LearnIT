FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) the United States commercial airline industry is \n        currently suffering severe financial distress;\n            (2) sustained record losses and excessive debt burdens are \n        causing air carriers to cancel new aircraft options and orders, \n        thereby threatening the economic viability of the United States \n        aerospace manufacturing industry;\n            (3) although most air carriers would benefit from acquiring \n        new generation, quieter, more fuel-efficient aircraft, there is \n        already more capacity than demand for seats, resulting in \n        downsizing, not expansion, of fleets;\n            (4) many air carriers are increasingly unable to obtain \n        financing at reasonable interest rates for purchasing new \n        equipment;\n            (5) the inability of many air carriers to acquire new, \n        quieter Stage 3 aircraft may jeopardize the planned phase out \n        of noisier Stage 2 aircraft;\n            (6) States and local communities, the traveling public, \n        airline employees, and airline shareholders would all benefit \n        from stronger, healthier air carriers operating modern, fuel \n        efficient, quieter aircraft;\n            (7) as the owner and operator of the Nation's air traffic \n        control system, the Federal Government is a partner of the \n        commercial aviation industry and must do its part to strengthen \n        the air carrier and aerospace industries;\n            (8) it is estimated that the Airport and Airway Trust Fund \n        will contain an unobligated surplus in excess of $4,300,000,000 \n        on October 1, 1993;\n            (9) a prudent shift of the investment of the Airport and \n        Airway Trust Fund surplus into modernization of the commercial \n        aviation industry's fleet can provide vitally needed economic \n        stimulus for carriers and manufacturers and will ensure that \n        both industries remain competitive into the next century; and\n            (10) the Airport and Airway Trust Fund surplus should, \n        therefore, be made available to guarantee loans for the \n        acquisition of new aircraft if such acquisition will assure the \n        phasing out of less fuel efficient and noisier or older \n        aircraft at the same time.\n\nSEC. 3.
