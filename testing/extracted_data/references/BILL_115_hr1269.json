FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The State of California has recently experienced one of \n        the driest periods on record, and in 2017 is experiencing one \n        of the wettest years on record. New surface water storage \n        infrastructure with the capacity to store water in wet years \n        for use in dry periods is urgently needed.\n            (2) The Sites Project (sometimes referred to as ``North of \n        Delta Offstream Storage'') has been identified by the State of \n        California and the Federal Government as an important component \n        to integrated water management in the Sacramento Valley that \n        would advance the co-equal objectives of improving water \n        management and restoring ecological health for beneficial uses \n        of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the Sacramento River \n        watershed. Further, the Sites Reservoir was found in the CALFED \n        Record of Decision to be the preferred location to provide \n        North of Delta Offstream Storage and subsequent studies have \n        shown the Sites Reservoir to be technically feasible.\n            (3) Among other things, the Sites Project would--\n                    (A) increase surface water storage to enhance water \n                management flexibility in the Sacramento Valley;\n                    (B) improve the operation of the State's water \n                system to provide improvements in ecosystem and water \n                quality conditions in the Bay-Delta while providing a \n                more reliable water supply for the State of California;\n                    (C) improve conditions for fish, waterfowl, and \n                wildlife in the Sacramento Valley, including anadromous \n                fish in the Sacramento River;\n                    (D) provide local flood control benefits;\n                    (E) integrate with renewable energy sources \n                consistent with applicable Federal and State of \n                California goals;\n                    (F) create both construction and long-term jobs to \n                improve both the local and regional economies in the \n                Sacramento Valley; and\n                    (G) provide additional recreational benefits.\n            (4) The Sites Project has been shown to provide \n        approximately 500,000 acre-feet of additional annualized yield \n        that, when integrated into the operations of the State and \n        Federal reservoirs upstream of the Bay-Delta, can improve the \n        system-wide operational efficiency for both water supply \n        reliability and the environment.\n            (5) Healthy wetlands and wildlife refuges are of vital \n        importance to wildlife in California and require a reliable \n        supply of water and additional surface water storage can help \n        meet water supply goals under the Central Valley Project \n        Improvement Act.\n            (6) It is in the interests of the United States for the \n        Federal Government to work with the Sites Project Authority, \n        which has been established under laws of the State of \n        California as an independent joint exercise of powers authority \n        to, among other things, study, promote, develop, design, \n        finance, acquire, construct, manage, and operate Sites \n        Reservoir and related facilities in order to advance the Sites \n        Project in the most expeditious and cost-effective manner \n        possible.\n\nSEC. 3.
