FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Brigadier General Francis Marion--\n                    (A) was born in 1732 in St. John's Parish, Berkeley \n                County, South Carolina; and\n                    (B) married Mary Esther Videau on April 20, 1786;\n            (2) the Marions had no children, but raised as their own \n        child a son of a relative, who was given Francis Marion's name;\n            (3) Marion commanded the Williamsburg Militia Revolutionary \n        Force in South Carolina and was instrumental in delaying the \n        advance of British forces by leading his troops in disrupting \n        supply lines;\n            (4) Marion's tactics, which were unheard of in rules of \n        warfare at the time, included lightning raids on British \n        convoys, after which Marion and his forces would retreat into \n        the swamps to avoid capture;\n            (5) the legend of ``Swamp Fox'' was born when British \n        Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton stated, in reference to Marion, \n        that ``as for this damned old swamp fox, the devil himself \n        could not catch him'';\n            (6) Marion's victory at the Battle of Eutaw Springs in \n        September of 1781 was officially recognized by Congress;\n            (7) Marion's troops, which were composed of whites, blacks, \n        both free and slave, and Native Americans, are believed to be \n        the first racially integrated force fighting for the United \n        States;\n            (8) as a statesman, Marion represented his parish in the \n        South Carolina senate and the State of South Carolina at the \n        Constitutional Convention;\n            (9) although Congress has authorized the establishment of \n        commemorative works on Federal land in the District of Columbia \n        honoring such celebrated Americans as George Washington, Thomas \n        Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, there is no comparable memorial \n        to Brigadier General Francis Marion commemorating Marion's \n        bravery and leadership during the Revolutionary War, without \n        which the United States would not exist;\n            (10) Brigadier General Marion's legacy must live on;\n            (11) since 1878, United States Reservation 18 has been \n        officially referred to as Marion Park;\n            (12) located between 4th and 6th Streets, S.E., at the \n        intersection of E Street and South Carolina Avenue, S.E., in \n        Washington, DC, Marion Park lacks a formal commemoration to \n        this South Carolina hero who was important to the initiation of \n        the heritage of the United States;\n            (13) the time has come to correct this oversight so that \n        future generations of Americans will know and understand the \n        preeminent historical and lasting significance to the Nation of \n        Marion's contributions; and\n            (14) Marion, a South Carolina hero, deserves to be given \n        proper recognition.\n\nSEC. 3.
