FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Overdoses from opioids have increased dramatically in \n        the United States.\n            (2) Deaths from drug overdose, largely from prescription \n        pain relievers, have tripled among men and increased fivefold \n        among women over the past decade.\n            (3) Nationwide, drug overdoses now claim more lives than \n        car accidents.\n            (4) Overdose deaths from heroin and other opioids can be \n        prevented if the person who overdosed is timely administered an \n        opioid overdose drug.\n            (5) Medical personnel as well as non-medical personnel can \n        be trained to administer opioid overdose drugs safely and \n        effectively.\n            (6) On April 13, 2014, the Food and Drug Administration \n        approved a prescription opioid overdose drug hand held auto-\n        injector for use by family members and caregivers to treat a \n        person known or suspected to have had an opioid overdose.\n            (7) Several States, including Massachusetts, have \n        established programs allowing for the administration of opioid \n        overdose drugs by non-medical personnel, and those programs \n        have saved lives.\n            (8) The willingness of medical and non-medical personnel to \n        administer opioid overdose drugs may be deterred by potential \n        civil liability, and the willingness of physicians to prescribe \n        opioid overdose drugs to persons other than a patient may also \n        be deterred by potential civil liability.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save the lives of \npeople who intentionally or inadvertently overdose on heroin or other \nopioids by providing certain protections from civil liability with \nrespect to the emergency administration of opioid overdose drugs.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``health care professional'' means a person \n        licensed by a State to prescribe prescription drugs;\n            (2) the term ``opioid overdose drug'' means a drug that, \n        when administered, reverses in whole or part the \n        pharmacological effects of an opioid overdose in the human \n        body; and\n            (3) the term ``opioid overdose program'' means a program \n        operated by a local health department, community-based \n        organization, substance abuse treatment organization, law \n        enforcement agency, fire department, other first responder \n        department, or voluntary association or a program funded by a \n        Federal, State, or local government that works to prevent \n        opioid overdoses by in part providing opioid overdose drugs and \n        education to individuals at risk of experiencing an opioid \n        overdose or to an individual in a position to assist another \n        individual at risk of experiencing an opioid overdose.\n\nSEC. 4. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n    (a) Preemption.--Except as provided in subsection (b), this Act \npreempts the law of a State to the extent that such law is inconsistent \nwith this Act, except that this Act shall not preempt any State law \nthat provides additional protection from liability relating to the \nadministration of opioid overdose drugs or that shields from liability \nany person who provides or administers opioid overdose drugs.\n    (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--Sections 5, 6, \nand 7 shall not apply to any civil action in a State court against a \nperson who administers opioid overdose drugs if--\n            (1) all parties to the civil action are citizens of the \n        State in which such action is brought; and\n            (2) the State enacts legislation in accordance with State \n        requirements for enacting legislation--\n                    (A) citing the authority of this subsection;\n                    (B) declaring the election of the State that such \n                sections 5, 6, and 7 shall not apply, as of a date \n                certain, to any civil actions covered by this Act; and\n                    (C) containing no other provisions.\n\nSEC. 5.
