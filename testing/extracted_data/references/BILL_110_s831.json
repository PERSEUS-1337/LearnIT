FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On July 22, 2004, the Senate and the House of \n        Representatives passed concurrent resolutions declaring that \n        ``the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide''.\n            (2) On June 30, 2005, President Bush affirmed that ``the \n        violence in Darfur region is clearly genocide [and t]he human \n        cost is beyond calculation''.\n            (3) The Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006, which \n        was signed into law on October 13, 2006, reaffirms that ``the \n        genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is \n        characterized by acts of terrorism and atrocities directed \n        against civilians, including mass murder, rape, and sexual \n        violence committed by the Janjaweed and associated militias \n        with the complicity and support of the National Congress Party-\n        led faction of the Government of Sudan''.\n            (4) Several States and governmental entities, through \n        legislation and other means, have expressed their desire, or \n        are considering measures--\n                    (A) to divest any equity in, or to refuse to \n                provide debt capital to, certain companies that operate \n                in Sudan; and\n                    (B) to disassociate themselves and the \n                beneficiaries of their public pension and endowment \n                funds from directly or indirectly supporting the Darfur \n                genocide.\n            (5) Efforts of States and other governmental entities to \n        divest their pension funds and other investments of companies \n        that operate in Sudan build upon the legal and historical \n        legacy of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States, a \n        movement which contributed to the end of apartheid in South \n        Africa and the holding of free elections in that country in \n        1994.\n            (6) Although divestment measures should be employed \n        judiciously and sparingly, declarations of genocide by Congress \n        and the President justify such action.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) States and other governmental entities should be \n        permitted to provide for the divestment of certain State assets \n        within their jurisdictions as an expression of opposition to \n        the genocidal actions and policies of the Government of Sudan; \n        and\n            (2) a divestment measure authorized under section 5 does \n        not violate the United States Constitution because such a \n        measure--\n                    (A) is not preempted under the Supremacy Clause;\n                    (B) does not constitute an undue burden on foreign \n                or interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause; and\n                    (C) does not intrude on, or interfere with, the \n                conduct of foreign affairs of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
