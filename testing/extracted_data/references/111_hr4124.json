    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Diabetes Prevention Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of diabetes in the United \n        States has more than doubled in the past quarter-century.\n            (2) The CDC reports that there are now more than 23,600,000 \n        people in the United States living with diabetes and another \n        57,000,000 individuals with ``pre-diabetes'' in the United \n        States, which means that they have higher than normal blood \n        glucose levels or are at increased risk of developing diabetes \n        based on multiple risk factors.\n            (3) In 2002, the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) \n        study found that lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, \n        can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes, and that \n        participants who made such lifestyle changes reduced their risk \n        of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent with some returning to \n        normal blood glucose levels.\n            (4) The New York Times has reported that lifestyle-based \n        interventions to control diabetes have resulted in positive \n        outcomes for patients, yet despite these successes, such \n        interventions were often unsustainable. While insurance \n        companies cover the treatments of complications of unchecked \n        diabetes, they tend not to cover the cheaper interventions to \n        prevent such complications.\n            (5) Emerging research and demonstrations projects funded by \n        the National Institutes of Health and the CDC in partnership \n        with Indiana University and the YMCA show that a carefully \n        designed group lifestyle intervention can be delivered for less \n        than $250 per person per year in community settings and can \n        achieve similar weight loss results to the DPP for adults with \n        pre-diabetes.\n            (6) Diabetes carries staggering costs. In 2007, the total \n        amount of the direct and indirect costs of diabetes was \n        estimated at $174,000,000,000 according to the American \n        Diabetes Association.\n            (7) The Urban Institute reported that if the Nation makes a \n        substantial investment in a national program that supports \n        group-based structured lifestyle intervention programs for \n        individuals at-risk of developing type 2 diabetes offered by \n        trained non-clinicians in community settings, the Nation could \n        save $191,000,000,000 over 10 years and achieve a 50 percent \n        reduction in diabetes cases among participants.\n            (8) There is a need to increase the availability of \n        effective community-based lifestyle programs for diabetes \n        prevention and offer incentive payments to health care \n        providers who refer at-risk patients for enrollment in such \n        programs to prevent diabetes, reduce complications, and lower \n        the costs associated with diabetes treatment in the United \n        States, and the Federal Government should encourage efforts to \n        replicate the results of the Diabetes Prevention Program on a \n        wider scale.\n\nSEC. 3.
