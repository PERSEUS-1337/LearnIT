In considering a motion to intervene \n        filed by a State, local or Tribal government entity, the court \n        shall take due account of whether the movant--\n                    (A) administers jointly with the defendant agency \n                the statutory provisions that give rise to the \n                regulatory duty alleged in the complaint; or\n                    (B) administers State, local or Tribal regulatory \n                authority that would be preempted by the defendant \n                agency's discharge of the regulatory duty alleged in \n                the complaint.\n            (4) If the court grants a motion to intervene in the \n        action, the court shall include the plaintiff, the defendant \n        agency, and the intervenors in settlement discussions. \n        Settlement efforts conducted shall be pursuant to a court's \n        mediation or alternative dispute resolution program, or by a \n        district judge, magistrate judge, or special master, as \n        determined by the assigned judge.\n            (5) The defendant agency shall publish in the Federal \n        Register and by electronic means any proposed consent decree or \n        settlement agreement for no fewer than 60 days of public \n        comment before filing it with the court, including a statement \n        of the statutory basis for the proposed consent decree or \n        settlement agreement and its terms, allowing comment on any \n        issue related to the matters alleged in the complaint or \n        addressed or affected by the consent decree or settlement \n        agreement.\n            (6) The defendant agency shall--\n                    (A) respond to public comments received under \n                paragraph (5); and\n                    (B) when moving that the court enter the consent \n                decree or for dismissal pursuant to the settlement \n                agreement--\n                            (i) inform the court of the statutory basis \n                        for the proposed consent decree or settlement \n                        agreement and its terms;\n                            (ii) submit to the court a summary of the \n                        public comments and agency responses;\n                            (iii) certify the administrative record of \n                        the notice and comment proceeding to the court; \n                        and\n                            (iv) make that record fully accessible to \n                        the court.\n            (7) The court shall include in the judicial record the \n        administrative record certified by the agency under paragraph \n        (6).\n            (8) If the consent decree or settlement agreement requires \n        an agency action by a date certain, the agency shall, when \n        moving for entry of the consent decree or dismissal based on \n        the settlement agreement--\n                    (A) inform the court of any uncompleted mandatory \n                duties to take regulatory action that the decree or \n                agreement does not address;\n                    (B) how the decree or agreement, if approved, would \n                affect the discharge of those duties; and\n                    (C) why the decree's or agreement's effects on the \n                order in which the agency discharges its mandatory \n                duties is in the public interest.\n            (9) The court shall presume, subject to rebuttal, that it \n        is proper to allow amicus participation by any party who filed \n        public comments on the consent decree or settlement agreement \n        during the court's consideration of a motion to enter the \n        decree or dismiss the case on the basis of the agreement.\n            (10) The court shall ensure that the proposed consent \n        decree or settlement agreement allows sufficient time and \n        procedure for the agency to comply with chapter 5 of title 5, \n        United States Code, and other applicable statutes that govern \n        rule making and, unless contrary to the public interest, the \n        provisions of any executive orders that govern rule making.\n            (11) The defendant agency may, at its discretion, hold a \n        public hearing pursuant to notice in the Federal Register and \n        by electronic means, on whether to enter into the consent \n        decree or settlement agreement. If such a hearing is held, \n        then, in accordance with paragraph (6), a summary of the \n        proceedings and certification of the hearing record shall be \n        provided to the court, access to the hearing record shall be \n        given to the court, and the full hearing record shall be \n        included in the judicial record.\n            (12) The Attorney General, in cases litigated by the \n        Department of Justice, or the head of the defendant Federal \n        agency, in cases litigated independently by that agency, shall \n        certify to the court his or her approval of any proposed \n        consent decree or settlement agreement that contains any of the \n        following terms--\n                    (A) in the case of a consent decree, terms that--\n                            (i) convert into mandatory duties the \n                        otherwise discretionary authorities of an \n                        agency to propose, promulgate, revise or amend \n                        regulations;\n                            (ii) commit the agency to expend funds that \n                        Congress has not appropriated and that have not \n                        been budgeted for the action in question, or \n                        commit an agency to seek a particular \n                        appropriation or budget authorization;\n                            (iii) divest the agency of discretion \n                        committed to it by Congress or the \n                        Constitution, whether such discretionary power \n                        was granted to respond to changing \n                        circumstances, to make policy or managerial \n                        choices, or to protect the rights of third \n                        parties; or\n                            (iv) otherwise afford relief that the court \n                        could not enter on its own authority upon a \n                        final judgment in the litigation; or\n                    (B) in the case of a settlement agreement, terms \n                that--\n                            (i) interfere with the agency's authority \n                        to revise, amend, or issue rules through the \n                        procedures set forth in chapter 5 of title 5, \n                        United States Code, or any other statute or \n                        executive order prescribing rule making \n                        procedures for rule makings that are the \n                        subject of the settlement agreement;\n                            (ii) commit the agency to expend funds that \n                        Congress has not appropriated and that have not \n                        been budgeted for the action in question; or\n                            (iii) provide a remedy for the agency's \n                        failure to comply with the terms of the \n                        settlement agreement other than the revival of \n                        the action resolved by the settlement \n                        agreement, if the agreement commits the agency \n                        to exercise its discretion in a particular way \n                        and such discretionary power was committed to \n                        the agency by Congress or the Constitution to \n                        respond to changing circumstances, to make \n                        policy or managerial choices, or to protect the \n                        rights of third parties.\n    (c) Annual Reports.--Each agency shall submit an annual report to \nCongress on the number, identity, and content of complaints, consent \ndecrees, and settlement agreements described in paragraph (1) for that \nyear, the statutory basis for each consent decree or settlement \nagreement and its terms, and any awards of attorneys fees or costs in \nactions resolved by such decrees or agreements.\n\nSEC. 3. MOTIONS TO MODIFY CONSENT DECREES.\n\n    When a defendant agency moves the court to modify a previously \nentered consent decree described under section 2 and the basis of the \nmotion is that the terms of the decree are no longer fully in the \npublic interest due to the agency's obligations to fulfill other duties \nor due to changed facts and circumstances, the court shall review the \nmotion and the consent decree de novo.\n\nSEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    The provisions of this Act apply to any covered consent decree or \nsettlement agreement proposed to a court after the date of enactment of \nthis Act.\n                                                 "
