FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In March 2011, peaceful demonstrations in Syria began \n        against the authoritarian rule of Bashar al-Assad. The regime \n        responded with terrible violence against the citizens of Syria, \n        including the use of weapons of war, torture, extrajudicial \n        killings, arbitrary executions, sexual violence, and \n        interference with access to medical treatment.\n            (2) In December 2011, the Government of Syria agreed to \n        allow an Arab League observer group into the country to assess \n        the humanitarian and political situation on the ground. \n        However, on January 28, 2012, the League officially ended its \n        observer mission, citing escalating violence and the \n        intransigence of the Assad regime.\n            (3) In February 2012, the group Friends of the Syrian \n        People met in Tunis and issued a declaration demanding, among \n        other things, that the Syrian regime ``allow free and unimpeded \n        access by the UN and humanitarian agencies to carry out a full \n        assessment of needs''.\n            (4) On March 16, 2012, United Nations and League of Arab \n        States Special Envoy Kofi Annan presented a six-point peace \n        plan for Syria that called on the Government of Syria to, among \n        other things--\n                    (A) commit to stop the fighting and urgently \n                achieve a United Nations-supervised cessation of \n                violence;\n                    (B) cease military activity in and around civilian \n                population centers;\n                    (C) work with the Envoy in an inclusive Syrian-led \n                political process;\n                    (D) ensure timely provision of humanitarian \n                assistance;\n                    (E) release arbitrarily detained persons;\n                    (F) ensure freedom of movement for journalists; and\n                    (G) respect the freedom of association and the \n                right to demonstrate peacefully.\n            (5) In March 2012, the United Nations Refugee Agency \n        (UNHCR) appealed for $84,100,000 to assist approximately 30,000 \n        Syrian refugees living outside the country. Panos Moumtzis was \n        appointed Regional Refugee Coordinator for Syria by UNHCR, \n        indicating the importance of responding to the growing needs of \n        Syrian refugees.\n            (6) In April 2012, the group Friends of the Syrian People \n        met in Istanbul and committed to increase pressure on the Assad \n        regime, provide greater humanitarian relief to people in need, \n        and support the Syrian opposition as it works toward an \n        inclusive democratic transition.\n            (7) As of July 2012, the London-based Syrian Observatory \n        for Human Rights estimated that more than 20,000 people have \n        been killed as a result of the violence in Syria, while the \n        United Nations has reportedly stopped keeping track of casualty \n        numbers due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate information \n        from inside Syria.\n            (8) As a result of the violence, the United Nations \n        estimates that 1,500,000 people are in need of humanitarian \n        assistance, including access to food, water, shelter, and \n        medical care. Basic services such as health care, education, \n        and electricity have also been cut off in some parts of the \n        country.\n            (9) Syria faces growing food insecurity, as wheat harvests \n        have declined due to drought. The United Nations expects aid \n        agencies to provide food aid to 850,000 Syrians in July 2012, \n        up from 500,000 the previous month.\n            (10) Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have fled the country \n        due to escalating violence. According to the United Nations, \n        there are more than 100,000 Syrian refugees registered in \n        Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq, and even more who are \n        unregistered. According to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, \n        hundreds of thousands of Syrians are displaced within the \n        country. More than three-quarters of refugees and internally \n        displaced persons are women and children, who are particularly \n        vulnerable to economic and physical insecurity.\n            (11) In June 2012, UNHCR more than doubled its appeal for \n        assistance for Syrian refugees to $193,000,000, reflecting the \n        significant increase in the number of refugees in need of \n        assistance.\n            (12) The United Nations requested an additional \n        $189,000,000 to meet humanitarian needs inside Syria. According \n        to a United Nations spokesperson, only about 20 percent of \n        these appeals have been funded. In July 2012, John Ging, \n        Director of Operations for the United Nations Office for the \n        Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said, ``If we don't get \n        more money, people will die.''\n            (13) The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) issued an \n        urgent appeal for $20,000,000 to meet the emergency needs of \n        children and young people who have fled the violence in Syria. \n        UNICEF estimates that it will need to provide humanitarian \n        support and basic services to approximately 90,000 Syrian \n        children between July and December 2012. As of July 2012, \n        UNICEF has received less than $6,000,000 to provide support and \n        protection to the most vulnerable victims of the crisis in \n        Syria.\n            (14) An agreement between the United Nations and the Syrian \n        regime to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance in \n        the country has allowed aid workers greater access to victims \n        of the conflict. However, staff of the International Committee \n        of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent cite security \n        concerns as a major obstacle to aid distribution. The \n        Government of Syria is also refusing to grant visas for aid \n        workers from countries that have criticized the regime, \n        including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and \n        France.\n            (15) In July 2012, Human Rights Watch reported widespread \n        torture and mistreatment of political prisoners being held in \n        detention facilities managed by intelligence agencies of the \n        Government of Syria. The report cites overcrowding, denial of \n        adequate food and medical assistance, and the routine use of a \n        wide range of torture methods. The report also raised concerns \n        that authorities in Syria could choose to kill detainees rather \n        than allow them to be released in the event of a political \n        transition.\n            (16) As of July 2012, the United States Government has \n        pledged $52,000,000 in humanitarian and non-lethal assistance \n        to Syria.\n            (17) According to the Unclassified Report to Congress on \n        the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass \n        Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions Covering 1 \n        January to 31 December 2011, ``Syria has had a [chemical \n        weapons] program for many years and has a stockpile of CW \n        agents, which can be delivered by aerial bombs, ballistic \n        missiles, and artillery rockets.'' In a hearing before the \n        Committee on Armed Services of the Senate in March 2012, \n        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey \n        testified that the magnitude of Syria's chemical weapons \n        arsenal was ``100 times more than we experienced in Libya''. \n        The Government of Syria's stockpiles are thought to include \n        mustard, sarin, and VX gases.\n            (18) There are concerns about the existence of numerous \n        rebel militias and their role in Syria during a post-transition \n        period. On June 30, 2012, during an international meeting on \n        Syria in Geneva, Special Envoy Kofi Annan said, ``A transition \n        must be implemented in a climate of safety for all, stability \n        and calm, including completion of withdrawals and the \n        disarming, demobilization and reintegration of armed groups.''\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to strongly condemn the ongoing violence and widespread \n        human rights violations perpetrated against the Syrian people \n        by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad;\n            (2) to promote the protection of civilians and innocent \n        victims of the conflict in Syria, particularly women and \n        children who are displaced and vulnerable to physical \n        exploitation;\n            (3) to assist the people of Syria in meeting basic needs, \n        including access to food, health care, shelter, and clean \n        drinking water;\n            (4) to support efforts of democratically oriented political \n        opposition groups in Syria to agree upon a political transition \n        plan that is inclusive and reflects the democratic aspirations \n        of all minority ethnic groups in the country;\n            (5) to work with the international community, including \n        multilateral organizations and host countries, to support \n        Syrian refugees living in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq;\n            (6) to support efforts to identify, recover, and dispose of \n        chemical weapons and other conventional and unconventional \n        weapons stockpiled in Syria; and\n            (7) to help ensure that, once a stable transitional \n        government is established in Syria, it is committed to \n        multiparty democracy, open and transparent governance, respect \n        for human rights and religious freedom, promoting peace and \n        stability with its neighbors, enhancing the rule of law, and \n        rehabilitating and reintegrating former combatants.\n\nSEC. 4.
