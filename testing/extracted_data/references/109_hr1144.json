    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Dual Eligible Prescription \nDrug Coverage Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate finds the following:\n            (1) Individuals who are dually eligible for benefits under \n        the medicare program and full benefits under the medicaid \n        program--\n                    (A) are among the most vulnerable populations in \n                our society; and\n                    (B) require adequate outreach, education, and \n                timing in order to adjust to changes in our health care \n                delivery system.\n            (2) The transition of 6,400,000 dual eligibles from \n        prescription drug coverage under the medicaid program to \n        prescription drug coverage under part D of the medicare program \n        is the largest transition ever of individuals from one \n        insurance program to another.\n            (3) In its June 2004 report to Congress, the Medicare \n        Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) suggested that large, \n        private employers with 75,000 employees or less need at least 6 \n        months to transition their employees' drug coverage from one \n        pharmacy benefit management company to another such company. \n        The States and the Federal Government are taking on a far more \n        complex task with 6,400,000 dual eligibles having to make the \n        transition described in paragraph (2).\n            (4) Timely access to prescription drugs leads to higher \n        quality of life and prevents avoidable emergency room visits, \n        hospitalizations, and premature nursing home placements.\n            (5) Since even a short-term gap in prescription drug \n        coverage could have serious health consequences for dual \n        eligibles, Congress must work to guarantee as smooth a \n        transition as possible for dual eligibles so that no dual \n        eligible is without prescription drug coverage even for one \n        day.\n\nSEC. 3. CONTINUING STATE COVERAGE OF MEDICAID PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n              COVERAGE TO MEDICARE DUAL ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES FOR 6 \n              MONTHS.\n\n    (a) Six-Month Transition.--For prescriptions filled during the \nperiod beginning on January 1, 2006, and ending on June 30, 2006, \nsection 1935(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396u-5(d)) shall \nnot apply and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State (as \ndefined for purposes of title XIX of such Act) shall continue to \nprovide (and receive Federal financial participation for) medical \nassistance under such title with respect to prescription drugs as if \nsuch section 1935(d) had not been enacted.\n    (b) Application.--\n            (1) Medicare as primary payer.--Nothing in subsection (a) \n        shall be construed as changing or affecting the primary payer \n        status of a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan under part \n        D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act with respect to \n        prescription drugs furnished to any full-benefit dual eligible \n        individual (as defined in section 1935(c)(6) of such Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 1396u-5(c)(6)) during the 6-month period described in \n        such subsection.\n            (2) Third party liability.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall \n        be construed as limiting the authority or responsibility of a \n        State under section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)) to seek reimbursement from a prescription \n        drug plan, an MA-PD plan, or any other third party, of the \n        costs incurred by the State in providing prescription drug \n        coverage described in such subsection.\n\nSEC. 4. DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAID CLAWBACK PAYMENTS.\n\n    Notwithstanding section 1935(c) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1396u-5(c)), a State or the District of Columbia shall not be \nrequired to provide for a payment under such section to the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services for any month prior to July 1, 2006.\n\nSEC. 5.
