FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many States are facing serious shortages of qualified \n        foster parents and qualified adoptive parents.\n            (2) A 2002 report by the National Conference of State \n        Legislatures found that, while the number of children in foster \n        care increased by 68 percent between 1984 and 1995, the number \n        of foster parents decreased by 4 percent during the same \n        period.\n            (3) The shortage of adoptive parents is equally dire--while \n        only 50,000 children were adopted out of foster care in 2001, \n        as many as 126,000 children were awaiting adoption. On average, \n        each of these waiting children had been in foster care for 44 \n        months.\n            (4) The rapid increase in the annual number of adoptions \n        from foster care since the enactment of the Adoption and Safe \n        Families Act of 1997 has created a growing need for post-\n        adoption services and for service providers with the knowledge \n        and skills required to address the unique issues adoptive \n        families and children may face.\n            (5) One Church, One Child is a national faith and \n        community-based foster care and adoption ministry established \n        in Chicago, Illinois, in 1980 by Father George Clements, whose \n        mission is to provide comprehensive services that promote the \n        well-being of at-risk children and the strengthening and \n        empowerment of adoptive, foster, and kinship families. Since \n        its formation, the organization and programs based on its model \n        have successfully placed more than 140,000 children in adoptive \n        families nationwide.\n            (6) Despite its success as a model for providing \n        recruitment, training, and support services for certified \n        foster and adoptive parents, One Church, One Child programs and \n        programs based on this concept have received limited federal \n        funding.\n            (7) The creation of a federally-funded grant program to \n        support the establishment and expansion of programs for the \n        recruitment of foster parents and adoptive parents which are \n        modeled on the One Church, One Child concept will benefit the \n        Nation's abused and neglected children by increasing the pool \n        of qualified adoptive parents and qualified foster parents.\n\nSEC. 3.
