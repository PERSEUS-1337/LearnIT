    "content": "Title II of the Social Security Act provides that certain individuals may be entitled to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits under the federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program if they meet the following statutory requirements: The individual's medical condition meets the definition of disability as specified in Section 216 of the act; The individual has filed a claim for disability benefits; The individual is insured, generally requiring either a work history or the work history of a parent or spouse, as specified in Section 214 of the act; The individual has not reached normal retirement age as provided in Section 216 of the act; and The individual has completed a five-month waiting period. The waiting period for SSDI benefits consists of five consecutive calendar months beginning with the first full calendar month in which a covered individual satisfied the test of disability. If an individual's disabling condition began before he or she met the insurance requirements, the waiting period would begin with the first full calendar month after insured status was gained. During this waiting period, SSDI benefits cannot be paid. It is important to note that this waiting period begins at the onset of the disabling condition and is not affected by the date a worker applies for SSDI benefits. Workers are encouraged by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to apply for benefits at the onset of their disability. The first month counted as part of the waiting period can be no more than 17 months before the month of application and thus, retroactive benefits are limited to 12 months from the date of application. SSA provides retroactive SSDI benefits when the onset of disability occurred before an application for benefits was filed. In such cases, a beneficiary is entitled to benefits retroactive to five months after the date of disability onset provided that this date is within one year of the date of application. Section 223 of the act provides one exception to the five-month waiting period. A person who, in the five years immediately preceding the onset of a current disability, had either received SSDI benefits or had a disabling condition that met the requirements set forth in Section 216 of the act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7416), is entitled to immediate benefits paid from the onset of disability. A waiting period from the onset of disability to eligibility for benefits has been part of the SSDI program from its inception. In 1954, Congress made the first provisions for loss of work due to disability and included language that exempted a period of disability from being counted when determining retirement benefits. Two years later, Congress authorized the payment of SSDI benefits to persons over the age of 50 after a six-month waiting period. The age requirement was removed in 1960. In recent years, Congress has introduced a variety of legislative initiatives to reduce or eliminate the five-month waiting period. In 1955, the House Ways and Means Committee recommended passage of the proposed Social Security Amendments and discussed the rationale for a six-month waiting period between the onset of disability and eligibility for federal benefits. A committee report cited the unique nature of the federal definition of disability and called its requirement that a disabling condition be expected to result in either death or long duration \"more exacting\" than the disability definitions commonly used by commercial insurance carriers at the time, many of which had their own six-month waiting periods. In addition, the Ways and Means Committee expressed that the six-month waiting period was \"long enough to permit most temporary conditions to be corrected or to show definite signs of probable recovery\" and would be of sufficient length to make it \"unprofitable for a person who can work not to do so.\" Two significant changes to the original six-month waiting period have been passed as part of the creation of the SSDI program. The first change eliminated the waiting period for disabled workers who were previous SSDI recipients or who had a previous disabling condition in the five years prior to the onset of their current disability. To be exempted from the waiting period, the previous disabling condition must have met the statutory definition of disability as provided in Title II of the act. In their reports to the House and Senate on the 1960 Amendments, the Ways and Means and Finance Committees affirmed that the six-month waiting period for those with previous disabilities as a possible barrier to return to work efforts, stating that Most disability insurance beneficiaries who return to work do so despite severe impairments. Where a disabled person becomes employed without any improvement of his condition, a more or less slight change in his situation can result in the loss of his job and make him once again eligible for disability insurance benefits. Other disabled persons, whose medical conditions may improve sufficiently to require termination of benefits, may subsequently grow worse again and become reentitled to benefits. A new six-month qualifying period during which they receive neither earnings nor benefits imposes a hardship on them and their families, and may be a real bar to any further work attempts. The second change to the SSDI waiting period reduced the waiting period from six to five months. The intent of this change was to reduce the financial burden on applicants, and the Ways and Means Committee reported that \"reducing the waiting period from six months to five months would diminish the financial hardships faced by those workers who have little or no savings or other resources to fall back on during the early months of long-term disability.\" The Senate Finance Committee went further than the House and recommended reducing the waiting period to four months. Title XVI of the act authorizes Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for individuals who meet the statutory test of disability or are over the age of 65 and who fall below specific income and asset thresholds. SSI beneficiaries need not have any prior work history or meet the insurance requirements of SSDI, and there is no waiting period between the onset of a disability and eligibility for SSI benefits. In December 2012, of the 8.4 million disabled-worker beneficiaries aged 18-64 receiving SSDI benefits, 1.1 million or 13.1% also received federally administered SSI benefits. Thus, SSI can be used by some disabled workers to lessen the economic hardship faced by the lack of earnings and benefits during the SSDI waiting period. SSI benefits are not available to residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The maximum federal SSI payment, referred to as the federal benefit rate, is $721 per month for an individual living independently and $1,082 for a couple living independently in 2014. Forty-four states and the District of Columbia add a supplement to this benefit for their residents. The amount of the federal benefit, plus any state supplement, may be reduced or offset by some earned and unearned income. Since most SSI recipients have other income, the average monthly SSI payment is less than the federal benefit rate. In December 2013, the average federally administered SSI payment was $546.38 for adults aged 18 to 64. Thirty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands grant Medicaid eligibility to all SSI recipients or have Medicaid eligibility rules that are the same as those of the SSI program. California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and Rhode Island currently administer Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) programs that provide either state or private benefits to workers with disabilities who are not receiving SSDI benefits. The six TDI programs provide temporary benefits, with maximum durations of between 26 and 52 weeks, for those with an earnings history who are unable to work because of a disability and who are not receiving workers' compensation or SSDI benefits. In addition to state TDI, employees of the railroad industry in all states are eligible for TDI benefits administered by the federal Railroad Retirement Board in accordance with provisions of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Workers' compensation systems in each state provide wage replacement and medical benefits to workers unable to work because of an employment-related illness or injury and may be able to pay benefits during the SSDI waiting period. The federal government administers workers' compensation for its employees under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. The federal government also administers workers' compensation systems for some private sector employees in the maritime, mining, and railroad industries through the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Program, the Black Lung Benefits Program, and the Energy Employees' Occupational Illness Compensation Program. In each state, workers covered by state unemployment insurance (UI) systems may be eligible to receive partial wage replacement in the event of a job separation. The states, however, require that those receiving unemployment compensation be able and willing to work, a condition that may exclude many waiting for SSDI eligibility (especially an individual who would earn in excess of the substantial gainful activity), since it is assumed that the individual is unable to work. Unemployment benefits are administered by the states within federal guidelines under Title III of the act, and unemployment compensation provisions for individuals who are ill or disabled vary by state.  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 117,000 individuals (less than 1.0% of all SSDI beneficiaries) received concurrent SSDI and UI cash benefits in fiscal year (FY) 2010. SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary estimated that 0.4% of disabled-worker beneficiaries would be in receipt of both SSDI and UI benefits in 2014. Private disability insurance programs offered by employers can be used to provide wage replacement benefits during the five-month waiting period for SSDI benefits. In March 2013, 39% of private-sector workers participated in some form of short-term disability insurance plan while 32% of private-sector workers were covered by long-term disability insurance. It has been estimated that up to 20% of SSDI beneficiaries have received payments from private disability insurance policies before being eligible for federal benefits.  The five-month waiting period between the onset of disability and eligibility for SSDI may have a negative impact on the income of those seeking to enter the program. During this waiting period, persons with disabilities are either not working or earning less than the substantial gainful activity (SGA) threshold. In addition, claimants are either not receiving monthly benefits to replace lost wages or are receiving only SSI benefits, which are usually lower than SSDI benefits. A July 2012 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the elimination of the five-month waiting period would increase outlays to SSDI by approximately $8.0 billion dollars in 2022 (about 4% of program outlays). One impact that may not be as clear, however, is the role that the waiting period plays in discouraging possible beneficiaries from applying for benefits. This waiting period, and its accompanying loss of income, lessen the overall generosity of the SSDI benefit."
