EMPLOYEE ACTIONS.\n\n    Section 11(c)(1) (29 U.S.C. 660(c)(1) is amended by adding at the \nend the following: ``including reporting any injury, illness or unsafe \ncondition.''\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION.\n\n    Section 11(c) (29 U.S.C. 660(c)) is amended by striking out \nparagraph (2) and inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n            ``(2) No person shall discharge or in any manner \n        discriminate against an employee for refusing to perform the \n        employee's duties when the employee has a reasonable \n        apprehension that performing such duties would result in \n        serious injury or serious impairment of health to the employee \n        or other employees. The circumstances causing the employee's \n        apprehension of serious injury must be of such a nature that a \n        reasonable person would conclude that there is a danger of \n        serious injury or serious impairment of health. In order to \n        qualify for protection, where possible, the employee must have \n        communicated to his employer the danger perceived.''.\n\nSEC. 4. PROCEDURE.\n\n    Section 11(c) (29 U.S.C. 660(c)) is amended by striking out \nparagraph (3) and inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n            ``(3) Any employee who believes that he has been \n        discharged, disciplined, or otherwise discriminate against in \n        violation of paragraph (1) or (2) may, within 180 days after \n        such alleged violation occurs, file (or have filed by any \n        person on the employee's behalf) a complaint with the Secretary \n        alleging such discharge, discipline, or discrimination. Upon \n        receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the \n        person named in the complaint of the filing of the complaint.\n            ``(4)(A) Within 90 days of receipt of a complaint filed \n        under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall conduct an \n        investigation and determine whether there is reasonable cause \n        to believe that the complaint has merit and notify the \ncomplainant and the person alleged to have committed the violation of \nparagraph (1) or (2) of the Secretary's findings. Where the Secretary \nhas concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that a \nviolation has occurred, the Secretary's findings shall be accompanied \nby a preliminary order providing the relief prescribed by paragraph \n(D).\n        ``Thereafter,\n                    ``(i) the person alleged to have committed the \n                violation or the complainant may, within 30 days, file \n                objections to the findings or preliminary order, or \n                both, and request a hearing on the record, except that \n                the filing of such objections shall not operate to stay \n                any reinstatement remedy contained in the preliminary \n                order.\n                    ``(ii) Where a hearing is not timely requested, the \n                preliminary order shall be deemed a final order which \n                is not subject to judicial review.\n            ``(B) If the Secretary has not issued findings under \n        paragraph (4)(A) within 90 days, and the employee or \n        representative of the employee files a request for a hearing \n        with the Secretary, the Secretary shall afford an opportunity \n        for a hearing on the record.\n            ``(C) When requested, a hearing shall be conducted by an \n        administrative law judge of the Department of Labor and a \n        recommended decision and order issued expeditiously. The legal \n        burdens of proof that prevail under section 1221 of title 5, \n        United States Code, shall govern adjudication of violations \n        under this subsection.

The petition for review \n        must be filed within 60 days from the issuance of the \n        Secretary's order. Such review shall be in accordance with the \n        provisions of chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. An \n        order of the Secretary subject to review under this subsection \n        is not subject to judicial review in a criminal or other civil \n        proceeding. The commencement proceedings under this subsection \n        shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of \n        the order of the Secretary.\n            ``(B) Whenever a person has failed to comply with a final \n        order or an order of reinstatement issued under paragraph (4), \n        the Secretary or the person on behalf of whom the order was \n        issued may file a civil action in the United States district \n        court for the district in which the violation was found to \n        occur in order to enforce such order. In actions brought under \n        this subparagraph, the district court shall have jurisdiction \n        to grant additional appropriate relief in light of the \n        noncompliance.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
