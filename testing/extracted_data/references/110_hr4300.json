    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Juvenile Justice Accountability and \nImprovement Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Historically, courts in the United States have \n        recognized the undeniable differences between adult and youth \n        offenders.\n            (2) In fact, while writing for the majority in Roper v. \n        Simmons (125 S. Ct. 1183), a recent Supreme Court decision \n        abolishing use of the death penalty for juveniles, Justice \n        Kennedy declared such differences to be ``marked and well \n        understood.''\n            (3) Notwithstanding such edicts, many youth are being \n        sentenced in a manner that has typically been reserved for \n        adults. These sentences include a term of imprisonment of life \n        without the possibility of parole.\n            (4) The decision to sentence youthful offenders to life \n        without parole is an issue of growing national concern.\n            (5) While only about a dozen youth are serving such \n        sentences in the rest of the world, research indicates that \n        there are at least 2,225 youth offenders serving life without \n        parole in the United States.\n            (6) The estimated rate at which the sentence is imposed on \n        children nationwide remains at least three times higher today \n        than it was fifteen years ago.\n            (7) The majority of youth sentenced to life without parole \n        are first-time offenders.\n            (8) Sixteen percent of these individuals were fifteen or \n        younger when they committed their crimes.\n            (9) Denying such individuals the possibility of a \n        meaningful opportunity for parole is both cruel and unwise. It \n        sends a message to our youth that they are beyond \n        rehabilitation. It also demonstrates a complete lack of \n        confidence in the ability of our penal institutions to \n        accomplish one of their main goals and responsibilities.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHING A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE FOR CHILD \n              OFFENDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--For each fiscal year after the expiration of the \nperiod specified in subsection (d)(1), each State shall have in effect \nlaws and policies under which each child offender who is under a life \nsentence receives, not less than once during the first 15 years of \nincarceration, and not less than once every 3 years of incarceration \nthereafter, a meaningful opportunity for parole. Not later than one \nyear after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General \nshall issue guidelines and regulations to interpret and implement this \nsection.

The system shall conform \nas nearly as practicable to the laws and policies required of a State \nunder section 3.\n\nSEC. 5.
