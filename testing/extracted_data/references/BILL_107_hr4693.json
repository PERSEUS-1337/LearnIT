FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Palestine Liberation Organization \n        (&lt;plus-minus&gt;PLO), under the leadership of Chairman Yasser \n        Arafat, has failed to abide by its promises, enumerated in the \n        Oslo Accords, to commit itself to ``a peaceful resolution of \n        the conflict between the two sides'', that ``all outstanding \n        issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through \n        negotiations'', and that the PLO ``renounces the use of \n        terrorism and other acts of violence and will assume \n        responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in order to \n        assure their compliance, prevent violence, and discipline \n        violators''.\n            (2) Yasser Arafat failed to exercise his authority and \n        responsibility to maintain law and order in the West Bank and \n        Gaza, which has resulted in ongoing acts of terrorism against \n        Israeli and American civilians in the State of Israel.\n            (3) Yasser Arafat has failed, through words and deeds, to \n        offer credible security guarantees to the Palestinian and \n        Israeli peoples, and has once again violated his commitment to \n        peace through the recent purchase of 50 tons of offensive \n        weaponry from Iran.\n            (4) Yasser Arafat and the forces directly under his control \n        are responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocent Israelis \n        and the wounding of thousands more since October 2000.\n            (5) Yasser Arafat has been directly implicated in funding \n        and supporting terrorists who have claimed responsibility for \n        homicide bombings in Israel.\n            (6) Under the present circumstances, Yasser Arafat's \n        failure to adequately respond to end the homicide bombings \n        further complicates the prospects for a resolution of the \n        conflict in that region.\n\nSEC. 3.
