FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become \n        pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest. Timely access \n        to emergency contraception could help many of these rape \n        survivors avoid the additional trauma of facing an unintended \n        pregnancy.\n            (2) A 1996 study of rape-related pregnancies (published in \n        the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology) found that \n        50 percent of the pregnancies described in paragraph (1) ended \n        in abortion.\n            (3) Surveys have shown that many hospitals do not routinely \n        provide emergency contraception to women seeking treatment \n        after being sexually assaulted.\n            (4) The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault has been \n        estimated to be 4.7 percent in survivors who were not protected \n        by some form of contraception at the time of the attack.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n        contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended \n        pregnancy if taken in the first 72 hours of sex.\n            (6) Medical research strongly indicates that the sooner \n        emergency contraception is administered, the greater the \n        likelihood of preventing unintended pregnancy.\n            (7) In light of the safety and effectiveness of emergency \n        contraceptive pills, both the American Medical Association and \n        the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have \n        endorsed more widespread availability of such pills to women of \n        all ages.\n            (8) The American College of Emergency Physicians and the \n        American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agree that \n        offering emergency contraception to female patients after a \n        sexual assault should be considered the standard of care.\n            (9) Approximately one-third of women of reproductive age \n        remain unaware of emergency contraception. Therefore, women who \n        have been sexually assaulted are unlikely to ask for emergency \n        contraception.\n            (10) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n        emergency medical treatment provide emergency contraception as \n        a treatment option to any woman who has been sexually \n        assaulted, so that she may prevent an unintended pregnancy.\n            (11) Victims of sexual assault are at increased risk of \n        contracting sexually transmitted diseases.\n            (12) Some sexually transmitted infections cannot be \n        reliably cured if treatment is delayed, and may result in high \n        morbidity and mortality. HIV has killed over 520,000 \n        individuals in the United States, and the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention currently estimates that over 1,000,000 \n        individuals in the United States are infected with the virus. \n        Even modern drug treatment has failed to cure infected \n        individuals. Nearly 60,000 individuals in the United States are \n        infected with hepatitis B each year, with some individuals \n        unable to fully recover. An estimated 1,250,000 individuals in \n        the United States remain chronically infected with the \n        hepatitis B virus and at present, 1 in 4 of those infected \n        individuals may expect to die of liver failure.\n            (13) It is possible to prevent some sexually transmitted \n        diseases by treating an exposed individual promptly. The use of \n        post-exposure prophylaxis using antiretroviral drugs has been \n        demonstrated to effectively prevent the establishment of HIV \n        infection. Hepatitis B infection may also be eliminated if an \n        exposed individual receives prompt treatment.\n            (14) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        recommended risk evaluation and appropriate application of \n        post-exposure treatment for victims of sexual assault. For such \n        individuals, immediate treatment is the only means to prevent a \n        life-threatening infection.\n            (15) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n        emergency medical treatment provide assessment and treatment of \n        sexually transmitted infections to minimize the harm to victims \n        of sexual assault.\n\nSEC. 3.
