    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Service Fellowship Program \nAct of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that a \n        critical component of our efforts to bolster national and \n        global security is to ``find common ground and common purpose \n        with other peoples'' and to invest in social development.\n            (2) Polling data from Terror Free Tomorrow indicates that \n        nearly 60 percent of the people of Indonesia and 75 percent of \n        the people of Pakistan held more favorable views of the United \n        States following humanitarian assistance after their tsunami \n        and earthquake tragedies, respectively, and these changes in \n        perception of the United States were sustained beyond the \n        initial period of aid and service.\n            (3) International volunteering opportunities are effective \n        means of addressing critical human needs, building bridges \n        across cultures, and promoting mutual understanding.\n            (4) Current volunteer programs, such as the Peace Corps, \n        remain an important part of Federal efforts to promote \n        volunteer service and provide related programming.\n            (5) Financial limitations are a common obstacle to \n        volunteering overseas, and awarding financial fellowships would \n        reduce barriers for many individuals otherwise unable to afford \n        travel overseas.\n            (6) Allowing flexibility in the duration of volunteering \n        opportunities would reduce another barrier to volunteering.\n            (7) A global service fellowship program would provide \n        funding and programmatic flexibility for volunteers of all \n        backgrounds, ages, and geographical locations.\n            (8) Eligible organizations willing to participate in the \n        fellowship program as sponsoring organizations would be in a \n        better position to recruit volunteers for their programs \n        overseas.\n            (9) The United States Agency for International Development \n        has taken important steps towards encouraging this kind of a \n        program through the creation of Volunteers for Prosperity, \n        which promotes international volunteer service by skilled \n        professionals from the United States but has never been \n        formally authorized.\n\nSEC. 3. VOLUNTEERS FOR PROSPERITY.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--Consistent with Executive Order 13317 (68 Fed. \nReg. 56515), the Administrator of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development shall establish the Office of Volunteers for \nProsperity.\n    (b) Purpose.--The Office of Volunteers for Prosperity shall pursue \nthe objectives described in section 4(d)(2), including by--\n            (1) implementing the Global Service Fellowship Program \n        established under section 4;\n            (2) promoting other short and long-term international \n        volunteering opportunities;\n            (3) promoting the efforts of Global Service Fellows as part \n        of the public diplomacy efforts of the United States \n        Government;\n            (4) helping eligible United States sponsoring \n        organizations, as described in section 4(e)(3)(A), to recruit \n        and effectively manage skilled United States professionals for \n        volunteer assignments overseas; and\n            (5) providing recognition for volunteers from the United \n        States who serve internationally, and the organizations \n        sponsoring them.\n\nSEC. 4.
