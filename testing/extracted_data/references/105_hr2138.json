BIOLOGICAL MONITORING AT PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS, \n              MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEMS, AND MUNICIPAL \n              COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS, INCLUDING CONTROL FACILITIES, \n              AND OTHER WET WEATHER CONTROL FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Biological Monitoring Criteria.--Section 303(c)(2) of the \nFederal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1313(c)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (B)--\n                    (A) by striking the period at the end and inserting \n                the following: ``: Provided, That for publicly owned \n                treatment works, municipal separate storm sewer \n                systems, and municipal combined sewer overflows, \n                including control facilities, and other wet weather \n                control facilities, nothing in this Act shall be \n                construed to authorize the use of water quality \n                standards or permit effluent limitations which result \n                in the finding of a violation upon failure of whole \n                effluent toxicity tests or biological monitoring \n                tests.''; and\n                    (B) by inserting after the third sentence the \n                following: ``Criteria for biological monitoring or \n                whole effluent toxicity shall employ an aquatic species \n                that is indigenous to the type of waters, a species \n                that is representative of such species, or such other \n                appropriate species as will indicate the toxicity of \n                the effluent in the specific receiving waters. Such \n                criteria shall take into account the natural biological \n                variability of the species, and shall ensure that the \n                accompanying test method accurately represents actual \n                in-stream conditions, including conditions associated \n                with dry and wet weather.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(C) Where the permitting authority determines that the discharge \nfrom a publicly owned treatment works, a municipal separate storm sewer \nsystem, or municipal combined sewer overflows, including control \nfacilities, or other wet weather control facilities causes, has the \nreasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream excursion \nabove a narrative or numeric criterion for whole effluent toxicity, the \npermit may contain terms, conditions, or limitations requiring further \nanalysis, identification evaluation, or reduction evaluation of such \neffluent toxicity. Such terms, conditions, or limitations meeting the \nrequirements of this section may be utilized in conjunction with a \nmunicipal separate storm sewer system, or municipal combined sewer \noverflows, including control facilities, or other wet weather control \nfacilities only upon a demonstration that such terms, conditions, or \nlimitations are technically feasible, accurately represent toxicity \nassociated with wet weather conditions, and can materially assist in an \nidentification evaluation or reduction evaluation of such toxicity.''.\n    (b) Information on Water Quality Criteria.--Section 304(a)(8) of \nthe Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(8)) is \namended by inserting ``, consistent with subparagraphs (B) and (C) of \nsection 303(c)(2),'' after ``publish''.\n    (c) Use of Biological Monitoring or Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing \nat Publicly Owned Treatment Works, Municipal Separate Storm Sewer \nSystems, or Municipal Combined Sewer Overflows, Including Control \nFacilities, or Other Wet Weather Control Facilities.--Section 402 of \nthe Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(q) Use of Biological Monitoring or Whole Effluent Toxicity \nTesting at Publicly Owned Treatment Works, Municipal Separate Storm \nSewer Systems, or Municipal Combined Sewer Overflows, Including Control \nFacilities, or Other Wet Weather Control Facilities.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Where the Administrator determines that \n        it is necessary in accordance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) of \n        section 303(c)(2) to include biological monitoring, whole \n        effluent toxicity testing, or assessment methods as a term, \n        condition, or limitation in a permit issued to a publicly owned \n        treatment works, a municipal separate storm sewer system, or a \n        municipal combined sewer overflow, including a control \n        facility, or other wet weather control facility pursuant to \n        this section, such permit term, condition, or limitation shall \n        be in accordance with such subparagraphs.\n            ``(2) Responding to test failures.--If a permit issued \n        under this section contains terms, conditions, or limitations \n        requiring biological monitoring or whole effluent toxicity \n        testing designed to meet criteria for biological monitoring or \n        whole effluent toxicity, the permit may establish procedures \n        for further analysis, identification evaluation, or reduction \n        evaluation of such toxicity. The permit shall allow the \n        permittee to discontinue such procedures, subject to future \n        reinitiation of such procedures upon a showing by the \n        permitting authority of changed conditions, if the source of \n        such toxicity cannot, after thorough investigation, be \n        identified.\n            ``(3) Test failure not a violation.--The failure of a \n        biological monitoring test or a whole effluent toxicity test at \n        a publicly owned treatment works, a municipal separate storm \n        sewer system, or a municipal combined sewer overflow, including \n        a control facility, or other wet weather control facility shall \n        not result in a finding of a violation under this Act.''."
