FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The current public/private partnership has succeeded in \n        fulfilling the mission set for it by Congress--delivering loans \n        to students reliably and in a timely fashion--and as such \n        should be preserved.\n            (2) The current Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) \n        program is, however, in need of reform. Many important positive \n        changes were made during the reauthorization of the Higher \n        Education Act in the 102d Congress, but further changes are \n        needed to make the FFEL program more efficient.\n            (3) It would be preferable to improve on a public/private \n        partnership that is known to work rather than dismantle it in \n        favor of an unproved direct Government lending program, which \n        would increase the Federal debt, further enlarge the Federal \n        bureaucracy, add major new financial oversight activities to \n        the already overburdened Department of Education, and force the \n        Congress to depend on estimated savings which may prove \n        illusory.\n            (4) The large Direct Lending Demonstration Program that was \n        begun by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 is only now \n        getting started. It would be better to allow this Demonstration \n        Program to proceed and show some results before expanding it to \n        cover the entire federally insured student lending system.\n            (5) Reforming the FFEL system with the immediate savings \n        and efficiencies that are contained in this bill will in no way \n        prevent the passage and implementation of legislation that \n        would begin a National Service Program, as proposed by the \n        President.\n            (6) Reforming the current FFEL system will produce \n        immediate savings without increasing the size and debt of the \n        Federal Government. It will also assure students and their \n        parents that they will continue to receive the funds they need \n        for higher education when they need them.\n\nSEC. 2. INTEREST RATES.\n\n    Section 427A of the Act (20 U.S.C. 1077a) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i); and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (g) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(h) In-School and Grace Period Interest Rates.--\n            ``(1) Applicable rate.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n        of this section, with respect to any loan for which the first \n        disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1993, the \n        applicable rate of interest for interest which accrues--\n                    ``(A) prior to the beginning of the repayment \n                period of the loan, or\n                    ``(B) during the period in which principal need not \n                be paid (whether or not such principal is in fact paid) \n                by reason of a provision described in section \n                428(b)(1)(M) or 427(a)(2)(C),\n        shall not exceed the rate determined under paragraph (2).\n            ``(2) Method of calculation.--For purposes of paragraph (1) \n        the rate determined under this paragraph shall, during any 12-\n        month period beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30, be \n        determined on the preceding June 1 and be equal to--\n                    ``(A) the bond equivalent rate of 91-day Treasury \n                bills auctioned at the final auction prior to such June \n                1; plus\n                    ``(B) 2.6 percent.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
