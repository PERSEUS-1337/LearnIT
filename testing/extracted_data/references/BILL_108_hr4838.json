FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the natural fire regimes of forested public land have \n        been altered by intensive fire suppression;\n            (2) fire suppression has led to increased risk of \n        unnaturally severe wildfires that in recent years have \n        destroyed thousands of homes, devastated agricultural crops and \n        livestock, reduced biodiversity, and scorched thousands of \n        areas of soil and natural resources;\n            (3) catastrophic wildfires pose a particular threat to \n        communities and wildlife living close to forested wildland, \n        known as the ``wildland-urban interface'';\n            (4) each year millions of dollars are spent to fight severe \n        wildfires and protect communities where municipal water \n        supplies, human lives, and property are threatened;\n            (5) contracts and cooperative agreements between Federal \n        agencies and State and local governments and other entities \n        empower communities and are cost-effective tools that provide \n        positive social and environmental benefits, and the use of such \n        contracts and agreements should be encouraged as a means to \n        prevent unnaturally severe fires, rehabilitate public land \n        affected or altered by fires, and enhance and maintain \n        environmentally important land and water; and\n            (6) joint collaborations between the Federal agencies and \n        service and conservation corps composed of young adults are \n        particularly beneficial, as the collaborations provide--\n                    (A) young adults the opportunity to prepare for \n                productive lives while engaged in meaningful and \n                educational public service opportunities; and\n                    (B) the public with cost-saving human resources to \n                assist in conserving, maintaining, and protecting \n                public land.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to allow service and conservation corps to enter into \n        agreements with public land management agencies to perform \n        rehabilitation and enhancement projects to prevent fire, \n        rehabilitate public land affected or altered by fires, and \n        suppress fires, and provide disaster relief;\n            (2) to offer young adults who are members of a service and \n        conservation corps, particularly young adults who are at-risk \n        or economically disadvantaged, a chance to obtain skills and \n        experience in forest restoration, so that they are better \n        equipped to gain productive employment in the expanding \n        workforce being deployed on National Forest System lands in \n        fuels reduction, post-fire rehabilitation, and other forest \n        health projects, and so that the pool of trained workers in \n        forest restoration is expanded to satisfy the existing and \n        increasing need for such workers;\n            (3) to provide those young adults the opportunity to serve \n        their communities and their country; and\n            (4) to expand educational opportunities by rewarding \n        individuals who participate in the Healthy Forest Youth \n        Conservation Corps with an increased ability to pursue higher \n        education or employment.\n\nSEC. 4.
