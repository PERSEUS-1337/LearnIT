    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bill to Underwrite Increased Lending \nto Domestic (BUILD) Manufacturing Act'' or the ``BUILD Manufacturing \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Manufacturing company.--The term ``manufacturing \n        company'' means a company engaged in the mechanical, physical, \n        or chemical transformation or production of materials, \n        substances, or components into new products.\n            (2) TALF.--The term ``TALF'' means the Term Asset-Backed \n        Securities Loan Facility established by the Board of Governors \n        of the Federal Reserve System and announced on March 3, 2009.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Manufacturing is a crucial component of the United \n        States economy, creating wealth through the value-added \n        production of quality goods.\n            (2) Manufacturing employed 13.5 million Americans in 2008.\n            (3) The manufacturing sector comprises 13.6 percent of the \n        United States national GDP, totaling $1.6 trillion in value as \n        of 2007, and generates approximately two-thirds of the Nation's \n        exports.\n            (4) Domestic manufacturing is vital to our Nation's \n        national security, is a source of long-term strategic \n        advantage, and ensures a reliable and dedicated source of \n        production for essential materials and goods.\n            (5) The current economic crisis has had particularly \n        negative effects on the manufacturing sector, leading to sharp \n        reductions in employment, output, and factory operating rates.\n            (6) Continued reductions in the domestic manufacturing \n        sector would result in increased dependence on foreign \n        factories, greater job loss, and declines in long-term \n        competitiveness of the United States economy.\n            (7) The recovery and expansion of the United States \n        manufacturing sector is being hampered by an absence of \n        affordable and available credit, caused by the financial sector \n        and subprime crisis.\n            (8) While the United States Treasury has made available \n        significant financial resources for recovery of the United \n        States financial sector, lending to commercial and private \n        entities has not followed suit.\n            (9) Available and affordable credit will be crucial to the \n        recovery of the manufacturing sector, enabling renewed capital \n        and asset purchases, facility expansions, investment in new \n        product lines, and increased hiring and employment.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON LENDING TO THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING \n              SECTOR.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the President, acting through \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, should use all available powers to \nencourage financial institutions that are in receipt of Federal \nfinancial support to immediately increase lending to the domestic \nmanufacturing sector.\n\nSEC. 5. MANUFACTURING LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) In general.--There is hereby established within the \n        Department of the Treasury a program to be known as the \n        ``Manufacturing Loan Guarantee Program'' (hereinafter referred \n        to in this section as the ``Program'').\n            (2) Head of the program.--The Program shall be headed by \n        the Administrator of the TALF (hereinafter referred to in this \n        section as the ``Administrator'').\n    (b) Loan Guarantee Program.--\n            (1) Purpose.--The purpose of the Program under this section \n        is to guarantee loans made to manufacturing companies.\n            (2) Application.--An insured depository institution (as \n        such term is defined in section 3(c) of the Federal Deposit \n        Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(c))) that wishes to make loans \n        that are guaranteed under the Program may submit an application \n        to take part in the Program to the Administrator in such form \n        and manner and containing such information as the Administrator \n        may require.\n            (3) Selection criteria.--The Administrator shall approve \n        any depository institution submitting a full and complete \n        application under paragraph (2) for participation in the \n        Program, and shall guarantee loans on a first-come-first-served \n        basis.

The \n        Administrator shall have the discretion to raise such limit \n        from $50,000,000 to $75,000,000 for a particular manufacturing \n        company if the Administrator determines doing so will advance \n        the purpose of this section.\n            (7) Government guarantee.--\n                    (A) Level of participation.--Loans guaranteed under \n                the Program shall be guaranteed in the following \n                percentages:\n                            (i) for loans under $10,000,000, 70 \n                        percent;\n                            (ii) for loans between $10,000,000 and \n                        $30,000,000, 65 percent; and\n                            (iii) for loans over $30,000,000, 60 \n                        percent.\n                    (B) Percentage adjustments.--\n                            (i) In general.--The Administrator shall \n                        have the power to adjust loan guarantee \n                        percentages for loans guaranteed under the \n                        Program in order to maximize lending and \n                        minimize default rates of participating \n                        manufacturers. Any such adjustments must \n                        further the goals of the Program.\n                            (ii) Timing of adjustments.--Adjustments \n                        under clause (i)

under clause (i), the Administrator \n                        shall seek to ensure that such adjustment will \n                        result in the maintained interest of insured \n                        depository institutions in participating in the \n                        Program.\n                    (C) Payment of accrued interest.--\n                            (i) In general.--Any
