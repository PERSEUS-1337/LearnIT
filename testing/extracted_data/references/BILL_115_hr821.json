FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Supplemental Poverty Measure of the \n        Bureau of the Census, the Child tax credit and earned income \n        tax credit lift more children out of poverty than any other \n        Federal policy. According to research published by the Century \n        Foundation, the child tax credit alone now lifts nearly 1 in 8 \n        children who would otherwise be poor out of poverty.\n            (2) Despite the success of the child tax credit, economists \n        have found that families with young children often receive the \n        smallest child tax credits because they do not yet have enough \n        income to receive the full benefit of the credit.\n            (3) Pediatricians and other child development experts have \n        long talked about the critical importance of the earliest years \n        of life.\n            (4) Economists have found similar effects of the importance \n        of income in the earliest years with returns to school \n        achievement.\n            (5) Young children, including babies and toddlers, are \n        among the poorest people in the country by age.\n            (6) Economists have found that large fluctuations in a \n        family's income can be detrimental to the development of young \n        children. Research on scarcity has found it is hard for parents \n        to focus on children if they are worrying about having \n        sufficient income to meet their family's needs.\n            (7) Indexing the value of the child tax credit would end \n        the slow erosion of the child tax credit due to inflation.\n\nSEC. 3. YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n    (a) Special Rule for Young Children.--Section 24 of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(h) Young Child Tax Credit.--\n            ``(1) In general.--In the case of a young qualifying child, \n        subsection (a) shall be applied for the taxable year (after the \n        application of subsection (i)) by substituting `$3,600' for \n        `$1,000'.\n            ``(2) Young qualifying child.--For purposes of paragraph \n        (1), the term `young qualifying child' means a qualifying child \n        who has not attained age 6 as of the close of such taxable \n        year.\n            ``(3) Limitation based on adjusted gross income.--For \n        purposes of applying subsection (b) with respect to a young \n        qualifying child, paragraph (1) of subsection (b) shall be \n        applied by substituting `$180' for `$50'.\n            ``(4) Credit refundable.--The aggregate credits allowed to \n        a taxpayer under subpart C shall be increased by the credit \n        which would be allowed under this section without regard to \n        this subsection, subsection (d), and the limitation under \n        section 26(a). The amount of the credit allowed under this \n        subsection shall not be treated as a credit allowed under this \n        subpart and shall reduce the amount of credit otherwise \n        allowable under subsection (a) without regard to section 26(a).\n            ``(5) Reconciliation of credit and advance credit.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The amount of the credit allowed \n                under subsection (a) by reason of paragraph (1) for any \n                taxable year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by \n                the aggregate amount of any advance payments of such \n                credit under section 7527A for such taxable year.\n                    ``(B) Excess advance payments.--If the aggregate \n                amount of advance payments under section 7527A for the \n                taxable year exceeds the amount of the credit allowed \n                under subsection (a) by reason of paragraph (1) for \n                such taxable year (determined without regard to \n                subparagraph (A)), the tax imposed by this chapter for \n                such taxable year shall be increased by the amount of \n                such excess.''.\n    (b) Advance Payment of Credit.--Chapter 77 of such Code is amended \nby inserting after section 7527 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 7527A.
