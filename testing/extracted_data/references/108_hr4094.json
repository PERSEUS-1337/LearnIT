    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Energy Initiative Act of \n2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal income tax credits have been established for \n        production of energy from renewable energy resources, other \n        than geothermal energy resources, including with respect to \n        wind energy and closed-loop biomass energy.\n            (2) The last national resource assessment of geothermal \n        energy resource sites in the United States was completed in \n        1978. There have been substantial changes in technology and \n        advances in geological science in the intervening 26 years.\n            (3) Many Federal land management agencies, including the \n        Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, are not aware \n        of geothermal energy resources and fail to recognize geothermal \n        energy resources in their land use planning process. Failure to \n        recognize geothermal energy resources during the land use \n        planning process poses significant delays in geothermal \n        resource development.\n            (4) The Bureau of Land Management has a backlog of 230 \n        lease applications for prospecting for geothermal energy. The \n        average age of these lease applications is 9 years. The oldest \n        non-competitive application was received in 1974.\n            (5) There appears to be a lack of focus and priority in the \n        Bureau of Land Management concerning geothermal energy efforts.\n            (6) Development of geothermal energy resources is \n        environmentally safe and clean.\n\nSEC. 3. CREDIT FOR ELECTRICITY PRODUCED FROM GEOTHERMAL ENERGY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 45(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 (relating to qualified energy resources) is amended by striking \n``and'' at the end of subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the \nend of the subparagraph (C) and inserting ``, and'', and by adding at \nthe end the following new subparagraph:\n                    ``(D) geothermal energy.''.\n    (b) Qualified Facility.--Section 45(c)(3) of such Code (defining \nqualified facility) is amended by inserting after subparagraph (E) the \nfollowing new subparagraph:\n                    ``(D) Geothermal energy facility.--In the case of a \n                facility using geothermal energy to produce \n                electricity, the term `qualified facility' means--\n                            ``(i) any facility owned by the taxpayer \n                        which is originally placed in service after \n                        December 31, 2004, and\n                            ``(ii) any facility owned by the taxpayer \n                        which is originally placed in service before \n                        January 1, 2005, but only to the extent of its \n                        incremental production.\n                If such a facility is leased and the operator thereof \n                is the lessee, such lessee (and not the owner) shall be \n                treated for purposes of this section as owning such \n                facility.''.\n    (c) Incremental Production.--Section 45(d) of such Code (relating \nto definitions and special rules) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new paragraph:\n            ``(9) Definition and special rule with respect to \n        incremental geothermal production.--For purposes of \n        subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3)--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `incremental \n                production' means, with respect to a facility described \n                in subsection (c)(3)(D)(ii) for any taxable year, the \n                excess of--\n                            ``(i) the total kilowatt hours of \n                        electricity produced from such facility, over\n                            ``(ii) the average annual kilowatt hours \n                        produced at such facility for five of the \n                        previous seven calendar years prior to the date \n                        of the enactment of this paragraph after \n                        eliminating the highest and lowest kilowatt \n                        hour production years in such seven-year \n                        period.\n                    ``(B) Special rule.--A facility which was placed in \n                service seven years or longer prior to the date of the \n                enactment of this paragraph shall, commencing with the \n                year of such enactment, reduce the amount calculated \n                under subparagraph (A)(ii) each year, on a cumulative \n                basis, by the average decrease in annual kilowatt hour \n                production for the seven-year period described in \n                subparagraph (A)(ii) with such cumulative sum not to \n                exceed 30 percent.''.\n    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to electricity sold after December 31, 2004.\n\nSEC. 4.

ENHANCED ACCESS TO FEDERAL LANDS FOR GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE \n              DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) Revision of Land Use Plans.--\n            (1) Public lands.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n        expedite development of geothermal energy in making revisions \n        to land use plans under section 202 of the Federal Land Policy \n        and Management Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 1712) while protecting \n        other resources.\n            (2) National forest system lands.--The Secretary of \n        Agriculture shall expedite development of geothermal energy in \n        making revisions of land and resource management plans under \n        section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources \n        Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604) while protecting other \n        resources.\n            (3) Issuance of rights-of-way not affected.--Nothing in \n        this subsection shall preclude the issuance of a right-of-way \n        for the development of a geothermal energy project prior to the \n        revision of a land use plan by the appropriate land management \n        agency.\n    (b) Report to Congress.--Within 24 months after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Secretary of the Interior shall develop \nand report to the Congress recommendations on any statutory or \nregulatory changes the Secretary believes would assist in the \ndevelopment of geothermal energy on Federal land.
