FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The ability to digitize information makes carrying out \n        tremendous amounts of commerce and personal communication \n        electronically possible.\n            (2) Miniaturization, distributed computing, and reduced \n        transmission costs make communication via electronic networks a \n        reality.\n            (3) The explosive growth in the Internet and other computer \n        networks reflects the potential growth of electronic commerce \n        and personal communication.\n            (4) The Internet and the global information infrastructure \n        have the potential to revolutionize the way individuals and \n        businesses conduct business.\n            (5) The full potential of the Internet for the conduct of \n        business cannot be realized as long as it is an insecure medium \n        in which confidential business information and sensitive \n        personal information remain at risk of unauthorized viewing, \n        alteration, and use.\n            (6) Encryption of information enables businesses and \n        individuals to protect themselves against the unauthorized \n        viewing, alteration, and use of information by employing widely \n        understood and readily available science and technology to \n        ensure the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of \n        information.\n            (7) In order to promote economic growth and meet the needs \n        of businesses and individuals in the United States, a variety \n        of encryption products and programs should be available to \n        promote strong, flexible, and commercially acceptable \n        encryption capabilities.\n            (8) United States computer, computer software and hardware, \n        communications, and electronics businesses are leading the \n        world technology revolution, as those businesses have developed \n        and are prepared to offer immediately to computer users \n        worldwide a variety of communications and computer hardware and \n        computer software that provide strong, robust, and easy-to-use \n        encryption.\n            (9) United States businesses seek to market the products \n        described in paragraph (8) in competition with scores of \n        foreign businesses in many countries that offer similar, and \n        frequently stronger, encryption products and programs.\n            (10) United States businesses have been discouraged from \n        further developing and marketing products with encryption \n        capabilities because of regulatory efforts by the Secretary of \n        Commerce, acting through the National Institute of Standards \n        and Technology, and other entities to promulgate standards and \n        guidelines in support of government-designed solutions to \n        encryption problems that--\n                    (A) were not developed in the private sector; and\n                    (B) have not received widespread commercial \n                support.\n            (11) Because of outdated Federal controls, United States \n        businesses have been prohibited from exporting strong \n        encryption products and programs.\n            (12) The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National \n        Institute of Standards and Technology, has attempted to \n        leverage the desire of United States businesses to sell \n        commercial products to the United States Government, and sell a \n        single product worldwide, to force the businesses to include \n        features in products sold by the businesses in the United \n        States and in foreign countries that will allow the Federal \n        Government easy access to the plain text of all electronic \n        information and communications.\n            (13) Specifically, the Secretary of Commerce, acting \n        through the National Institute of Standards and Technology, has \n        proposed that United States businesses be allowed to sell \n        products and programs offering strong encryption to the United \n        States Government and in foreign countries only if the products \n        and programs include a feature guaranteeing the Federal \n        Government access to a key that decrypts information (hereafter \n        in this section referred to as ``key escrow encryption'').\n            (14) The key escrow encryption approach to regulating \n        encryption is reflected in the approval in 1994 by the National \n        Institute of Standards and Technology of a Federal information \n        processing standard for a standard of escrowed encryption, \n        known as the ``clipper chip'', that was flawed and \n        controversial.\n            (15) The Federal Government--\n                    (A) has designed key escrow encryption to solve a \n                perceived problem; and\n                    (B) has ignored the fact that--\n                            (i) there is no demonstrated commercial \n                        demand for features which give governments easy \n                        access to information; and\n                            (ii) numerous nonkey escrow encryption \n                        alternatives are available commercially from \n                        foreign suppliers and free of charge from the \n                        Internet.\n            (16) In order to promote electronic commerce in the twenty-\n        first century and to realize the full potential of the Internet \n        and other computer networks--\n                    (A) United States businesses should be encouraged \n                to develop and market products and programs offering \n                encryption capabilities; and\n                    (B) the Federal Government should be prohibited \n                from promulgating regulations and adopting policies \n                that discourage the use and sale of encryption.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote electronic \ncommerce through the use of strong encryption by--\n            (1) recognizing that businesses in the United States that \n        offer computer hardware and computer software made in the \n        United States that incorporate encryption technology are ready \n        and immediately able, with respect to electronic information \n        that will be essential to conducting business in the twenty-\n        first century to provide products that are designed to--\n                    (A) protect the confidentiality of that \n                information; and\n                    (B) ensure the authenticity and integrity of that \n                information;\n            (2) restricting the Department of Commerce with respect to \n        the promulgation or enforcement of regulations, or the \n        application of policies, that impose government-designed \n        encryption standards; and\n            (3) promoting the ability of United States businesses to \n        sell to computer users worldwide computer software and computer \n        hardware that provide the strong encryption demanded by such \n        users by--\n                    (A) restricting Federal or State regulation of the \n                sale of such products and programs in interstate \n                commerce;\n                    (B) prohibiting mandatory key escrow encryption \n                systems; and\n                    (C) establishing conditions for the sale of \n                encryption products and programs in foreign commerce.\n\nSEC. 3.
