    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nChapter 3 (commencing with Section 39150) is added to Part 1 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  3. Minor Violations\n39150.\n(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the purpose of this chapter is to establish an enforcement policy for violations of this division that the enforcement agency finds are minor when the danger they pose to, or the potential that they have for endangering, human health, safety, or welfare or the environment is taken into account.\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this chapter to provide a more resource-efficient enforcement mechanism, faster compliance times, and the creation of a productive and cooperative working relationship between the state board, the districts, and the regulated community while maintaining protection of human\nhealth and safety\nhealth, safety, and welfare\nand the environment.\n(c)\nThe\nExcept as provided in Section 39154, the\nstate board and each district shall, for their respective jurisdictions, implement this chapter by adopting a regulation or a rule that classifies the types of violations of this division, or of the regulations, rules, standards, orders, permit conditions, or other requirements adopted pursuant to this division, that the state board or the district finds are minor violations in accordance with subdivision (d).\n(d) In classifying the types of violations that are minor violations, the state board or the district shall consider all of the following factors:\n(1) The magnitude of the violation.\n(2) The scope of the violation.\n(3) The severity of the violation.\n(4) The degree to which a violation puts human health, safety, or welfare or the environment into jeopardy.\n(5) The degree to which a violation could contribute to the failure to accomplish an important goal or program objective as established by this division.\n(6) The degree to which a violation\nmay\ncould\nmake it difficult to determine if the violator is in compliance with other requirements of this division.\n(e) For purposes of this chapter, a minor violation of this division shall not include any of the following:\n(1) Any knowing, willful, or intentional violation of this division.\n(2) Any violation of this division that enables the violator to benefit economically from noncompliance, either by realizing reduced costs or by gaining a competitive advantage.\n(3) Any violation that is a chronic violation or that is committed by a recalcitrant violator.\n(f) In determining whether a violation is chronic or a violator is recalcitrant, for purposes of paragraph (3) of subdivision (e), the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer shall consider whether there is evidence indicating that the violator has engaged in a pattern of neglect or disregard with respect to the requirements of this division or the requirements adopted pursuant to this division.\n39151.\nFor purposes of this chapter, \u201cnotice to comply\u201d means a written method of alleging a minor violation that is in compliance with all of the following requirements:\n(a) The notice to comply is written in the course of conducting an inspection by an authorized representative of the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer. If testing is required by the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer to determine compliance, and the testing cannot be conducted during the course of the inspection, the representative of the state board or the district or an authorized or designated officer shall have a reasonable period of time to conduct the required testing. If, after the test results are available, the representative of the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer determines that the issuance of a notice to comply is warranted, the representative or officer shall immediately notify the facility owner or operator in writing.\n(b) A copy of the notice to comply is presented to a person who is an owner, operator, employee, or representative of the facility being inspected at the time that the notice to comply is written. If offsite testing is required pursuant to subdivision (a), a copy of the notice to comply may be mailed to the owner or operator of the facility.\n(c) The notice to comply clearly states the nature of the alleged minor violation, a means by which compliance with the requirement cited by the state board\u2019s or district\u2019s representative or an authorized or designated officer may be achieved, and a time limit in which to comply, which shall not exceed 30 days.\n(d) The notice to comply shall contain the information specified in subdivision (h) of Section 39152 with regard to the possible reinspection of the facility.\n39152.\n(a) An authorized representative of the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer, who, in the course of conducting an inspection, detects a minor violation shall issue a notice to comply before leaving the site at which the minor violation is alleged to have occurred if the authorized representative finds that a notice to comply is warranted.\n(b) A person who receives a notice to comply pursuant to subdivision (a) shall have the period specified in the notice to comply from the date of receipt of the notice to comply in which to achieve compliance with the requirement cited on the notice to comply. Within five working days of achieving compliance, the person who received the notice to comply shall sign the notice to comply and return it to the state board\u2019s or district\u2019s representative or an authorized or designated officer, stating that the person has complied with the notice to comply. A false statement that compliance has been achieved is a violation of this division pursuant to Section 42400.2 or 42402.2.\n(c) A single notice to comply shall be issued for all minor violations cited during the same inspection and the notice to comply shall separately list each cited minor violation and the manner in which each minor violation may be brought into compliance.\n(d) A notice to comply shall not be issued for any minor violation that is corrected immediately in the presence of the inspector. Immediate compliance in that manner may be noted in the inspection report, but the person shall not be subject to any further action by the state board\u2019s or district\u2019s representative or an authorized or designated officer.\n(e) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (g), a notice to comply shall be the only means by which the state board\u2019s or district\u2019s representative or an authorized or designated officer shall cite a minor violation. The state board\u2019s or district\u2019s representative or an authorized or designated officer shall not take any other enforcement action specified in this division to enforce the minor violation against a person who has received a notice to comply if the person is in compliance with this section.\n(f) If a person who receives a notice to comply pursuant to subdivision (a) disagrees with one or more of the alleged violations cited in the notice to comply, the person shall give written notice of appeal to the state board or district, which shall develop a process for reviewing and determining the disposition of the appeal.\n(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a person fails to comply with a notice to comply within the prescribed period, or if the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer determines that the circumstances surrounding a particular minor violation are such that immediate enforcement is warranted to prevent harm to\nthe public health or safety or to\nhuman health, safety, or welfare or\nthe environment, the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer may take any needed enforcement action authorized by this division.\n(h) A notice to comply issued to a person pursuant to this section shall contain a statement that the inspected facility may be subject to reinspection at any time. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the reinspection of a facility to ensure compliance or to ensure that minor violations cited in a notice to comply have been corrected.\n(i) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer, on a case-by-case basis, from requiring a person subject to a notice to comply to submit reasonable and necessary documentation to support a claim of compliance by the person.\n(j) Nothing in this section restricts the power of a city attorney, district attorney, county counsel, or the Attorney General to bring, in the name of the people of California, any criminal proceeding otherwise authorized by law. Furthermore, nothing in this section prevents the state board or district, or any representative of the state board or district, from cooperating with, or participating in, such a proceeding.\n(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer determines that the circumstances surrounding a particular minor violation are such that the assessment of a civil penalty pursuant to this division is warranted or required by federal law, in addition to issuance of a notice to comply, the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer shall assess a civil penalty in accordance with this division, if the state board or district or an authorized or designated officer makes written findings that set forth the basis for the determination of the state board or district.\n39153.\nOn or before January 1, 2020, the state board shall report to the Legislature on actions taken by the state board and the districts to implement this chapter and the results of that implementation. Each district shall provide the state board with the information that the state board requests to determine the degree to which the purposes described in subdivision (a) of Section 39150 have been achieved. The report shall be submitted consistent with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\n39154.\nSections 39150, 39151, and 39152 do not apply to a district that, as of January 1, 2015, has in effect a program with provisions similar to those required by this chapter.\nSEC. 2.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act or because costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
