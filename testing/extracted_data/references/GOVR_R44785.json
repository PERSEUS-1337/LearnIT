    "content": "ACA Section 4002 established the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), to be administered by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and provided the PPHF with a permanent annual appropriation. Amounts for each fiscal year are available to the HHS Secretary beginning October 1, the start of the respective fiscal year. Congress may explicitly direct the distribution of PPHF funds and did so for FY2014 through FY2017.  Under the ACA, the PPHF's annual appropriation would increase from $500 million for FY2010 to $2 billion for FY2015 and each subsequent fiscal year. Congress has amended the provision two times, using a portion of PPHF funds as an offset for the costs of other activities. Annual appropriations to the PPHF in current law are as follows:  $500 million for FY2010; $1.0 billion for each of FY2012 through FY2017; $900 million for each of FY2018 and FY2019; $1.0 billion for each of FY2020 and FY2021; $1.5 billion for FY2022; $1.0 billion for FY2023; $1.7 billion for FY2024; and $2.0 billion for FY2025 and each fiscal year thereafter. Section 101 would amend ACA Section 4002(b) by repealing all PPHF appropriations for FY2019 and subsequent fiscal years. It also would rescind any unobligated PPHF balance remaining at the end of FY2018. ACA Section 10503 created the Community Health Center Fund, which provided mandatory appropriations to the health center program from FY2011 through FY2015. These appropriations provided in subsection (a)(1)\u2014of $3.6 billion annually\u2014subsequently were extended through FY2017 by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10 ), Section 221(a).  Prior to the ACA, the health center program had received only discretionary appropriations, which made up the entirety of the program's appropriated funds. Since the Community Health Center Fund's creation, the fund has made up an increasing percentage of the health center program's appropriation, ranging from 39% for FY2011 to 71% for FY2016. Under current law, for FY2018, the Community Health Center Fund will not receive a mandatory appropriation.  Section 102 would provide an additional $422 million for FY2017 to the Community Health Center Fund.  The Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) is an umbrella organization supporting 59 independent affiliates that operate approximately 661 health centers across the United States. Government funding\u2014which includes federal, state, and local funds\u2014constitutes the PPFA's largest source of revenue, an estimated 43% in the year ending June 30, 2015. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal funds accounted for about one-third of PPFA's total revenue in 2013. PPFA receives federal grants (either directly or through another entity, such as a state) and reimbursements for providing services to beneficiaries enrolled in federally funded programs (e.g., Medicaid). It does not receive a direct annual appropriation of any kind. CBO and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PPFA's largest source of federal funding is reimbursements for covered services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. Specifically, CBO estimated that PPFA's federal Medicaid revenue was approximately $390 million in 2013. GAO examined FY2012 PPFA reimbursements and expenditures and found that PPFA had either received reimbursements or expended funds from discretionary programs and from direct spending (as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, 2 U.S.C. 900(c)(8)). Direct spending refers to budget authority provided by laws other than through appropriations acts, entitlement authority, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). PPFA's reimbursements or expenditures from direct spending include reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (listed in order of the amount of reimbursements received, according to GAO), as well as certain expenditures from the Social Service Block Grant, the Crime Victims Assistance Program (administered by the Department of Justice), the Personal Responsibility and Education Program, and SNAP (administered by the Department of Agriculture). PPFA also received funds from a number of discretionary programs, either directly or through another entity (e.g., a state). For example, in FY2012, GAO found that PPFA had expended discretionary funds from the Maternal and Child Health Block Grants programs, which are provided to states; some states provided these funds to PPFA entities to provide services.  Under federal law, federal funds generally are not available to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of a mother's life. This restriction is the result of statutory and legislative provisions such as the Hyde amendment, which has been added to the annual HHS appropriations measure since 1976. Similar provisions exist in the appropriations measures for foreign operations, the District of Columbia, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Justice. Other codified restrictions limit the use of funds made available to the Department of Defense and the Indian Health Service. Section 103 would prohibit federal funds made available to a state through direct spending from being provided to a prohibited entity (as defined), either directly or through a managed care organization, for a one-year period beginning upon enactment of the AHCA. The provision specifies that this prohibition would be implemented notwithstanding certain programmatic rules (e.g., the Medicaid freedom of choice of provider requirement, which requires enrollees to be able to receive services from any willing Medicaid-participating provider and stipulates that states cannot exclude providers solely on the basis of the range of services they provide).  Section 103 does not explicitly specify that certain federal funds would not be made available to PPFA or its affiliated entities; instead it refers to and defines a prohibited entity as an entity that meets the following criteria at enactment: (1) it is designated as a not-for-profit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (2) it is described as an essential community provider that is primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care; (3) it is an abortion provider that provides abortion in cases that do not meet the Hyde amendment exception for federal payment; and (4) it received more than $350 million in Medicaid expenditures (both federal and state) in FY2014. When evaluating nearly identical language included in H.R. 3762 during the 114 th Congress, CBO determined that the prohibited entity likely would be PPFA because few other health care providers would meet the bill's definition.  Prior to the enactment of the ACA, states were permitted to enroll certain groups (e.g., children, pregnant women, certain women with breast and cervical cancer, and individuals eligible for family planning services) for a limited period of time before completed Medicaid applications were filed and processed, based on a preliminary determination of likely Medicaid eligibility by certain specified Medicaid providers (i.e., qualified entities ). Qualified entities had to be certified by the state Medicaid agency as entities that were capable of making presumptive-eligibility determinations. The type of entity that could make presumptive-eligibility determinations depended on the beneficiary's Medicaid eligibility category. For example, certain providers of clinic and outpatient hospital services could determine presumptive eligibility for pregnant women. Agencies that served low-income children under federal programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children or school lunch programs (under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act) could make presumptive-eligibility determinations for children. Individuals who were determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid then had to formally apply for coverage within a given time frame to continue receiving Medicaid benefits.  The ACA expanded the types of entities that are permitted to make Medicaid presumptive-eligibility determinations as well as the groups of individuals for whom presumptive-eligibility determinations may apply. Specifically, the ACA allowed states to permit all hospitals that participate in Medicaid to elect to make presumptive-eligibility determinations for all Medicaid eligibility groups, beginning January 1, 2014. In addition, states that elected the option to provide a presumptive-eligibility period to children or pregnant women are permitted to provide a presumptive-eligibility period for (1) the ACA Medicaid expansion group, (2) the mandatory coverage group for individuals currently or formerly in foster care who are under the age of 26, (3) low-income families eligible under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act (SSA), or (4) the state option for coverage for individuals with income that exceeds 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Section 111(1)(A) would no longer allow hospitals that participate in Medicaid to elect to make presumptive-eligibility determinations effective January 1, 2020, and would terminate hospitals' ability to make such an election after that date by modifying SSA Section 1902(a)(47)(B). On January 1, 2020, Section 111(3) would terminate the authority of certain specified states (i.e., those that elected to provide a presumptive-eligibility period to children or pregnant women) to elect to make presumptive-eligibility determinations for the ACA Medicaid expansion group or the state option for coverage for individuals with income that exceeds 133% of FPL by modifying SSA Section 1920(e). The provision would not modify the authority of such states to elect to make presumptive-eligibility determinations for the mandatory foster care group under the age of 26 or for low-income families eligible under SSA Section 1931 based on a preliminary determination of likely Medicaid eligibility by a specified Medicaid provider. Eligibility for Medicaid is determined by federal and state law. States set individual eligibility criteria within federal standards. Individuals must meet both categorical (e.g., elderly, individuals with disabilities, children, pregnant women, parents, certain non-elderly childless adults) and financial (i.e., income and sometimes asset limits) criteria. In addition, individuals must meet federal and state requirements regarding residency, immigration status, and documentation of U.S. citizenship. Some eligibility groups are mandatory, meaning all states with a Medicaid program must cover them; others are optional. States are permitted to apply to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for a waiver of federal law to expand health coverage beyond the mandatory and optional groups listed in federal statute.  The ACA changed the mandatory Medicaid income eligibility level for poverty-related children aged 6 through 18 from 100% of FPL to 133% of FPL, beginning January 1, 2014. These children sometimes are referred to as stairstep children . For the 21 states that transitioned these children from the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to Medicaid due to the ACA, coverage continues to be financed with states' CHIP annual allotment funding (i.e., state-specific annual limits) at the higher enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP), which is the CHIP federal matching rate.  Section 111(1)(B) would repeal the stairstep children provision by amending SSA Section 1902(l)(2)(C) to specify the end date to the requirement to cover children up to 133% of FPL effective December 31, 2019. After that date, states would still be required to cover children in this group with household incomes of up to 100% of FPL. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. The federal government's share of a state's expenditures for most Medicaid services is called the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate, which varies by state and is designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per capita incomes). Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services.  The ACA Section 2401 established the Community First Choice option under SSA Section 1915(k), which allows states to offer community-based attendant services and supports as an optional Medicaid state plan benefit and receive a six-percentage-point increase to the FMAP rate for covered services. The Community First Choice option provides community-based attendant services and supports to assist eligible aged and disabled Medicaid beneficiaries in accomplishing activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and health-related tasks. In addition, states may provide transition expenses when a beneficiary moves from a nursing facility to a community-based setting or other services that increase independence. According to CMS, eight states have received approval for this option (California, Connecticut, Maryland, Montana, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington) as of January 2017. CMS also is providing technical assistance to states that are considering offering the Community First Choice option. Section 111(2) would repeal the increased FMAP rate for the Community First Choice option on January 1, 2020, by modifying SSA Section 1915(k)(2).  Eligibility for Medicaid is determined by federal and state law. States set individual eligibility criteria within federal standards. Individuals must meet both categorical (e.g., elderly, individuals with disabilities, children, pregnant women, parents, certain non-elderly childless adults) and financial (i.e., income and sometimes asset limits) criteria. In addition, individuals must meet federal and state requirements regarding residency, immigration status, and documentation of U.S. citizenship. Some eligibility groups are mandatory, meaning all states with a Medicaid program must cover them; others are optional. States are permitted to apply to the CMS for a waiver of federal law to expand health coverage beyond the mandatory and optional groups listed in federal statute.  The ACA established 133% of FPL as the new mandatory minimum Medicaid income-eligibility level for most non-elderly adults beginning January 1, 2014. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , finding that the enforcement mechanism for the ACA Medicaid expansion violated the Constitution, which effectively made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional for states. On January 1, 2014, 24 states and the District of Columbia implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion. Since then, seven additional states have decided to implement the expansion.  Section 112(a)(1)(A)(i) and (iii) would codify the ACA Medicaid expansion as optional for states after December 31, 2019, by specifying the end date of the ACA Medicaid expansion (at SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII)) as December 31, 2019, and adding a new Medicaid optional eligibility group (at SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(a)(ii)(XXIII)) beginning January 1, 2020.  In addition to the ACA Medicaid expansion, the ACA created an optional Medicaid eligibility category for all non-elderly individuals with income above 133% of FPL up to a maximum level specified in the Medicaid state plan (or waiver), effective January 1, 2014. As of January 2017, the District of Columbia is the only state that has implemented this option. Section 112(a)(1)(A)(ii) would repeal the state option to extend coverage to non-elderly individuals above 133% of FPL (SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XX)) by specifying an end date of December 31, 2017. Under the ACA, an expansion enrollee is defined as an individual who is a non-elderly, nonpregnant adult with annual income at or below 133% of FPL and who is not entitled to or enrolled for benefits in Medicare Part A or enrolled for benefits under Medicare Part B.  Section 112(a)(1)(B) would incorporate the existing ACA expansion enrollee definition for the purposes of the new optional Medicaid eligibility group for expansion enrollees. It also would define a grandfathered expansion enrollee as an expansion enrollee who was enrolled in Medicaid (under the state plan or a waiver) as of December 31, 2019, and does not have a break in eligibility for more than one month after that date. The provision also would apply these definitions to existing provisions in Medicaid statute that currently reference the ACA Medicaid expansion group (i.e., SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII)), including provisions related to payments to states, medical assistance, alternative benefit plan coverage, presumptive eligibility, and so on. The ACA added a few FMAP exceptions, including the newly eligible federal matching rate (i.e., the matching rate for individuals who are newly eligible for Medicaid due to the ACA Medicaid expansion). The newly eligible individuals are defined as expansion enrollees who would not have been eligible for Medicaid in the state as of December 1, 2009 (or were eligible under a waiver but were not enrolled because of limits or caps on waiver enrollment). States received 100% federal matching rate (i.e., full federal financing) for the cost of providing Medicaid coverage to newly eligible individuals, from CY2014 through CY2016. The rate for newly eligible individuals phases down to 95% in CY2017, 94% in CY2018, 93% in CY2019, and 90% for CY2020 and subsequent years. Section 112(a)(2)(A) would maintain the current structure of the newly eligible matching rate for expenditures before January 1, 2020, for states that covered newly eligible individuals as of March 1, 2017. However, after December 31, 2019, the newly eligible matching rate would apply only to expenditures for newly eligible individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid as of December 31, 2019, and do not have a break in eligibility for more than one month after that date (i.e., grandfathered expansion enrollees). The ACA added a few FMAP exceptions, including the expansion state federal matching rate, which is the federal matching rate available for expansion enrollees without dependent children in expansion states who were eligible for Medicaid on March 23, 2010.  The expansion state federal matching rate varies from state to state. The formula used to calculate the expansion state federal matching rates is based on each state's regular FMAP rate and annual transition percentages set in statute. The annual transition percentages for the expansion state matching rate formula are 50% in CY2014, 60% in CY2015, 70% in CY2016, 80% in CY2017, 90% in CY2018, and 100% for CY2019 and subsequent years.   Table 4 shows the range for the expansion state matching rate. From CY2014 through CY2018, the expansion state federal matching rate is lower than the newly eligible federal matching rate and higher than each state's regular FMAP rate. The expansion state federal matching rate phases up until CY2019, when the expansion state federal matching rate will match the newly eligible federal matching rate for CY2019 and subsequent years.  Section 112(a)(2)(B) would amend SSA Section 1905(z)(2) by amending the formula for the expansion state matching rate so that the matching rate would stop phasing up after CY2017 and the transition percentage would remain at the CY2017 level for each subsequent year. In addition, after December 31, 2019, the expansion state matching rate would apply only to expenditures for eligible individuals who were enrolled in Medicaid as of December 31, 2019, and do not have a break in eligibility for more than one month after that date (i.e., grandfathered expansion enrollees). As an alternative to providing all the mandatory and selected optional benefits under traditional Medicaid, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171 ) gave states the option to enroll state-specified groups (with exceptions for selected special-needs subgroups) in what previously was referred to as benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage but currently is called alternative benefit plans (ABPs). States that choose to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion are required to provide ABP coverage (with exceptions for selected special-needs subgroups), rather than traditional Medicaid, to the individuals eligible for Medicaid through the ACA Medicaid expansion. In addition, states have the option to provide ABP coverage to other subgroups.  The ACA made significant changes to both ABP design and ABP requirements. Among these changes, the ACA required such packages to provide at least the 10 essential health benefits (EHB), which are (1) ambulatory patient services; (2) emergency services; (3) hospitalization; (4) maternity and newborn care; (5) mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; (6) prescription drugs; (7) rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; (8) laboratory services; (9) preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and (10) pediatric services, including oral and vision care. Section 112(b) would specify that SSA Section 1937(b)(5) would not apply after December 31, 2019. This means that Medicaid ABP coverage would no longer be required to include the EHB after that date. SSA Section 1923 requires states to make Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals treating large numbers of low-income patients. This provision is intended to recognize the disadvantaged financial situation of those hospitals because low-income patients are more likely to be uninsured or Medicaid enrollees. Hospitals often do not receive payment for services rendered to uninsured patients, and Medicaid provider payment rates generally are lower than the rates paid by Medicare and private insurance. Whereas most federal Medicaid funding is provided on an open-ended basis, federal Medicaid DSH funding is capped. Each state receives an annual DSH allotment, which is the maximum amount of federal matching funds that each state is permitted to claim for Medicaid DSH payments. The ACA reduced the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through its health insurance coverage provisions. Built on the premise that with fewer uninsured individuals there should be less need for Medicaid DSH payments, the ACA included a provision directing the HHS Secretary to make aggregate reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments for FY2014 through FY2020. However, multiple subsequent laws have amended these reductions. Under current law, the aggregate reductions to the Medicaid DSH allotments are to impact FY2018 through FY2025. After FY2025, allotments will be calculated as though the reductions never occurred, which means the allotments will include the inflation adjustments for the years during the reductions. Section 113 would amend SSA Section 1923(f) by eliminating the Medicaid DSH allotment reductions after FY2019. This would mean that the aggregate reductions to the Medicaid DSH allotments would impact FY2018 and FY2019. Under Section 113, after FY2019, allotments would be calculated as though the reductions never occurred, which means the allotments would include the inflation adjustments for the years during the reductions. In addition, non-expansion states would be exempt from the ACA Medicaid DSH allotment reductions. For this provision, expansion state would be defined as a state that provides eligibility under the ACA Medicaid expansion or the state option for coverage for individuals with incomes that exceed 133% of FPL as of July 1 of the previous fiscal year. A non-expansion state would be defined as a state that is not an expansion state. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 36B, as established under the ACA, provides premium assistance tax credits for individuals to purchase coverage through the health insurance exchanges, among other purposes. IRC Section 36B includes a definition of household income, based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which is used to determine eligibility for various federal health programs, including Medicaid. As of January 1, 2014, MAGI rules are used in determining eligibility for most of Medicaid's non-elderly populations, including the ACA Medicaid expansion. Medicaid's MAGI income-counting rule is set forth in law and regulation. Under the Medicaid MAGI counting rule, the state looks at each individual's MAGI, deducts 5%, which the law provides as a standard disregard for individuals at the highest income limit for coverage, and compares that income to the income standards set by the state in coordination with CMS. For Medicaid, MAGI is defined as the IRC's adjusted gross income (AGI, which reflects a number of deductions, including trade and business deductions, losses from sale of property, and alimony payments) increased by certain types of income (e.g., tax-exempt interest income received or accrued during the taxable year and the nontaxable portion of Social Security benefits). In addition, under Medicaid regulations certain types of income are subtracted (e.g., certain scholarships and fellowships) to arrive at MAGI. Also under Medicaid regulations, irregular income received as a lump sum (e.g., state income tax refund, lottery or gambling winnings, one-time gifts or inheritances) is counted as income only in the month received. In addition to specifying the types of household income that must be considered during eligibility determinations, the regulations also define household . The income of any person defined as a part of an individual's household must be counted when determining that individual's income level for purposes of a Medicaid eligibility determination. Medicaid program regulations make a distinction with regard to the budget period when determining income eligibility for applicants and new enrollees as compared to eligibility redeterminations for current enrollees. Specifically, income eligibility for applicants and new enrollees is based on current monthly household income. When redetermining eligibility for current Medicaid enrollees, states are permitted to use current monthly income and family size or projected annual income and family size for the remaining months of the calendar year. For states that choose the latter measure when redetermining eligibility, Medicaid requires the applicant to predict income and household size for the remaining months of the calendar year. Section 114(a) would amend SSA Section 1902(a)(17) to require states to consider \"qualified lottery winnings\" and/or \"qualified lump sum income\" received by an individual on or after January 1, 2020, when determining eligibility for Medicaid based on MAGI for each such individual. Such income would not be counted as household income when determining Medicaid eligibility for other members (aside from the individual's spouse) of the individual's household.  Winnings and/or income in an amount less than $80,000 would be considered in the month that such winnings and/or income are received. Amounts greater than or equal to $80,000 but less than $90,000 would be prorated over a period of two months. Amounts greater than or equal to $90,000 but less than $100,000 would be prorated over a period of three months. For purpose of prorating winnings and/or income in amounts greater than or equal to $100,000, one additional month would be added for each increment of $10,000 received, not to exceed 120 months (or 10 years) for winnings and/or income of $1,260,000 or more.  The provision would establish a state option for a hardship exemption for individuals for whom the denial of Medicaid eligibility based on such income would cause an undue medical or financial hardship as determined by criteria established by the HHS Secretary. In addition, it would require states to inform individuals in advance of their loss of Medicaid eligibility, as well as the date that such individual would be permitted to reapply. The provision would define qualified lottery winnings as winnings (including amounts awarded as a lump-sum payment) from a state-conducted sweepstakes, lottery, or pool, or from a lottery operated by a multistate or multi-jurisdictional lottery association. The bill would define qualified lump - sum income as income received as a lump sum (1) from monetary winnings from gambling (as defined by the HHS Secretary and including monetary winnings from gambling activities described in Section 1955(b)(4) of Title 18 of the United States Code ) or (2) as liquid assets from the estate of a deceased individual (as defined in Section 1917(b)(4) of SSA). The bill would specify that states may recover lottery winnings awarded to the individual to pay for Medicaid medical assistance furnished to the individual. Eligibility for Medicaid is determined by federal and state law. States set individual eligibility criteria within federal standards. Once an individual is determined eligible for Medicaid, coverage is effective either on the date of application or the first day of the month of application. Benefits must be covered retroactively for services provided in or after the third month before the month of application for individuals who are subsequently determined eligible, if the individual would have been eligible during that period had he or she applied (or had someone applied for him or her), regardless of whether the individual is alive when application for Medicaid is made. Coverage generally stops at the end of the month in which a person no longer meets the requirements for eligibility. Section 114(b) would amend SSA Sections 1902(a)(34) and 1905(a) to limit the effective date for retroactive coverage of Medicaid benefits to the month in which the applicant applied. This provision would apply to Medicaid applications made (or deemed to be made) on or after October 1, 2017. DRA established SSA Section 1917(f), which required limitations on the amount of home equity that an applicant could shield from asset limits that otherwise would disqualify the applicant from Medicaid eligibility for nursing facility services or other Medicaid-covered long-term services and supports (LTSS). Prior to enactment of the DRA, Medicaid deferred to asset-counting rules under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and excluded the entire value of an applicant's home for the purposes of Medicaid LTSS eligibility. Under current law, Medicaid bars eligibility if the applicant's equity interest in the home exceeds a statutorily determined limit, which is annually adjusted. Initially, the minimum and maximum home-equity dollar limits specified in statute were $500,000 and $750,000, respectively. Beginning in 2011, these dollar amounts were updated annually to reflect the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), rounded to the nearest $1,000. In 2017, the minimum home-equity limit is $560,000. However, a state may elect to substitute an amount that exceeds $560,000 but does not exceed $840,000 in 2017. In doing so, states may choose to apply a higher home-equity limit to specific geographic areas within a state. Individuals who have a spouse, child under the age of 21, or child who is blind or disabled (under SSI or as defined by SSA Section 1614) and lawfully residing in the individual's home are able to exempt the home as a countable asset. Also, states can choose not to apply this rule if the state determines that doing so would cause an undue hardship in a given case. In addition to the District of Columbia, the following 10 states choose a home-equity limit that is above the minimum amount: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Wisconsin. Section 114(c) would repeal the authority for states to elect to substitute a higher home-equity limit amount that is above the statutory minimum amount (SSA Section 1917(f)(1)(B)). It would apply to Medicaid eligibility determinations that are made more than 180 days after enactment. In situations where the HHS Secretary determines that state legislation would be required to amend the state plan, then states would have additional time to comply with these requirements. On January 1, 2014, when the ACA Medicaid expansion went into effect, 24 states and the District of Columbia included the expansion as part of their Medicaid programs. Since then, seven additional states have implemented the expansion at different times: Michigan (April 1, 2014), New Hampshire (July 1, 2014), Pennsylvania (January 1, 2015), Indiana (February 1, 2015), Alaska (September 1, 2015), Montana (January 1, 2016), and Louisiana (July 1, 2016). For the most part, states establish their own payment rates for Medicaid providers. Federal statute requires that these rates are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that covered benefits will be available to Medicaid enrollees at least to the same extent they are available to the general population in the same geographic area. In some cases, states make supplemental payments to Medicaid providers that are separate from, and in addition to, the standard payment rates for services rendered to Medicaid enrollees. Medicaid DSH payments are one type of supplemental payment, and federal statute requires that states make Medicaid DSH payments to hospitals treating large numbers of low-income patients. Section 115 would add a new Section 1923A to the SSA to establish safety-net funding for non-expansion states. For FY2018 through FY2022, each state (defined as the 50 states and the District of Columbia) that has not implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion (through the state plan or a waiver) as of July 1 of the preceding year may receive safety-net funding to adjust payment amounts for Medicaid providers. For these payment adjustments using the safety-net funding, non-expansion states would receive an increased matching rate of 100% for FY2018 through FY2021 and 95% for FY2022. The maximum amount of safety-net funding for all non-expansion states would be $2.0 billion for each year, for a total of $10 billion from FY2018 through FY2022. Each non-expansion state's allotment for each year would be determined according to the number of individuals in the state with income below 138% of FPL in 2015 relative to the total number of individuals with income below 138% of FPL for all the non-expansion states in 2015. The 2015 American Community Survey one-year estimates as published by the Bureau of the Census would be used to determine the portion of each state's population that is below 138% of FPL. The payment adjustments to providers may not exceed the provider's costs incurred to furnish health care services for Medicaid enrollees or the uninsured. The provider's costs would be determined by the Secretary, and the costs would be net of other Medicaid payments and payments from uninsured patients. If a non-expansion state implements the ACA Medicaid expansion, the state would no longer be treated as a non-expansion state for safety-net funding for subsequent years. As of January 1, 2014, SSA Section 1902(e)(14) requires states to determine income eligibility based on MAGI for most of Medicaid's non-elderly populations, including the ACA Medicaid expansion and the state option for coverage for individuals with income that exceeds 133% of FPL. For such individuals, states are required to redetermine Medicaid eligibility once every 12 months, except in the case where the Medicaid agency receives information about a change in a beneficiary's circumstances that may affect eligibility. In this case, the Medicaid agency must redetermine Medicaid eligibility at the appropriate time based on such changes. Beginning October 1, 2017, Section 116(a) would amend SSA Section 1902(e)(14) to require states to redetermine Medicaid eligibility at least every six months (or sooner in the case where the Medicaid agency receives information about a change in a beneficiary's circumstances that may affect eligibility) for individuals eligible for Medicaid through (1) the ACA Medicaid expansion or (2) the state option for coverage for individuals with income that exceeds 133% of FPL. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. The federal government's share of a state's expenditures for most Medicaid services is called the FMAP rate, which varies by state and is designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per capita incomes). Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. Most administrative activities receive a 50% federal matching rate. Section 116(b) would increase the federal match for the administrative activities attributable to carrying out the increased frequency of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations required under Section 116(a) by five percentage points. This increased federal match would be available from October 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019. Medicaid is a program that pays for certain medical services furnished to low-income individuals. It is jointly financed by the federal government and participating states. Generally, participating states must have a state medical assistance plan that complies with SSA Section 1902. Among other things, Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) identifies specific categories of beneficiaries that must be covered under a state plan, as well as a requirement in Section 1902(a)(10)(B) that medical assistance offered to any individual in such a mandatory eligibility group may not be less in amount, duration, or scope than assistance made available to any other person under the state plan.  The Medicaid statute does not appear to expressly address whether a state plan may permissibly impose work requirements as a condition of receiving benefits for most beneficiaries. However, SSA Section 1931 authorizes states to terminate Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients' eligibility for medical assistance under Medicaid if the individuals' TANF benefits are denied for failing to comply with work requirements imposed under the TANF program.  Section 117(a) would modify SSA Section 1902 by adding a new Section at 1902(oo) to permit states, effective October 1, 2017, to require nondisabled, non-elderly, nonpregnant adults to satisfy a work requirement as a condition for receipt of Medicaid medical assistance. The provision would define work requirements as an individual's participation in work activities for a specified period of time as administered by the state. The provision would incorporate, by reference, the definition of work activities as they appear in SSA Section 407(d) under Part A of Title IV (Block Grants to States for TANF), and would include unsubsidized employment; subsidized private-sector employment; subsidized public-sector employment; work experience (including work associated with the refurbishing of publicly assisted housing) if sufficient private-sector employment is not available; on-the-job training; job search and job readiness assistance; community service programs; vocational educational training (not to exceed 12 months with respect to any individual); job skills training directly related to employment; education directly related to employment, in the case of a recipient who has not received a high school diploma or a certificate of high school equivalency; satisfactory attendance at secondary school or a course of study leading to a certificate of general equivalence, in the case of a recipient who has not completed secondary school or received such a certificate; and the provision of child-care services to an individual who is participating in a community service program. Participating states would be required to exempt the following groups from participation in the work requirement: (1) pregnant women (for the duration of the pregnancy and through the end of the month in which the 60-day postpartum period ends); (2) individuals under 19 years of age; (3) an individual who is the sole parent or caretaker relative in the family of (a) a child who is under the age of 6 or (b) a child with disabilities; or (4) an individual who is less than 20 years of age, who is married or a head of household and who (a) maintains satisfactory attendance at secondary school or the equivalent or (b) participates in education directly related to employment. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. The federal government's share of a state's expenditures for most Medicaid services is called the FMAP rate, which varies by state and is designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per capita incomes). Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. Most administrative activities receive a 50% federal matching rate. Section 117(b) would increase the federal match for administrative activities to implement the work requirement under Section 117(a) by five percentage points in addition to any other increase to such federal matching rate. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services as well as long-term services and supports. Medicaid is a federal and state partnership. The states are responsible for administering their Medicaid programs, and Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states. In FY2015, Medicaid is estimated to have provided health care services to 70 million individuals at a total cost of $552 billion (including federal and state expenditures). Participation in Medicaid is voluntary, though all states, the District of Columbia, and the territories choose to participate. The federal government sets some basic requirements for Medicaid, and states have the flexibility to design their own version of Medicaid within the federal government's basic framework. In addition, there are several waiver and demonstration authorities that allow states to operate their Medicaid programs outside of federal rules. States incur Medicaid costs by making payments to service providers (e.g., for beneficiaries' doctor visits) and performing administrative activities (e.g., making eligibility determinations). The federal government reimburses states for a share of each dollar spent in accordance with their federally approved Medicaid state plans. The federal government's share of most Medicaid expenditures is called the FMAP. Generally determined annually, the FMAP formula is designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per capita incomes). Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. After a state has made Medicaid expenditures, it can draw down federal matching funds. CMS makes quarterly grant awards to states to cover the federal share of Medicaid expenditures based on the quarterly estimates states submit to CMS on the Form CMS-37. Each state must submit a Form CMS-64 no later than 30 days after the end of each quarter with the state's accounting of actual recorded expenditures. CMS then reviews the expenditures reported on the Form CMS-64 to reconcile the states' estimates from the CMS-37 with the actual documented expenditures to ensure that the reported expenditures are allowable under the Medicaid statute and the Medicaid state plan. Medicaid is an entitlement for both states and individuals. The Medicaid entitlement to states ensures that, so long as states operate their programs within the federal requirements, states are entitled to federal Medicaid matching funds. Medicaid is also an individual entitlement, which means that anyone eligible for Medicaid under his or her state's eligibility standards is guaranteed Medicaid coverage. Federal Medicaid funding to states is open-ended. Section 121 would reform federal Medicaid financing to a per capita cap model (i.e., per enrollee limits on federal payments to states) starting in FY2020. Specifically, each state's spending in FY2016 would be the base to set targeted spending for each enrollee category in FY2019 and subsequent years for that state. Each state's targeted spending amounts would increase annually by the applicable annual inflation factor, which varies by enrollee category. Starting in FY2020, any state with spending higher than its specified targeted aggregate amount would receive reductions to its Medicaid funding for the following fiscal year. One provision would reduce the target amount for New York if certain local government contributions to the state share are required. States would have the option to receive block grant funding (i.e., a predetermined fixed amount of federal funding) instead of per capita cap funding for non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults and children starting in FY2020. Some statutory requirements would not apply under the block grant option. States would elect this option for a 10-year period. Section 121(1) would add references to the new SSA Section 1903A (explained below) in SSA Section 1903, which is the section of statute that lays out how the federal government makes payments to states for the Medicaid program. Section 121(2) would add a new SSA Section 1903A. The following provides a description of what would be the new SSA Section 1903A. Section (a). Application of Per Capita Cap on Payments for Medical Assistance\u00a0 Expenditures Under Section (a) of the new SSA Section 1903A, beginning in FY2020, if a state has excess aggregate medical assistance expenditures for a fiscal year, the state's quarterly Medicaid payments from the federal government for the following fiscal year would be reduced by one-quarter of the excess aggregate medical assistance payments for the previous fiscal year. This section would be applicable to the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Excess aggregate medical assistance expenditures for the state and fiscal year would be the amount by which the adjusted total medical assistance expenditures (defined under Section (b) of the new SSA Section 1903A) exceeds the amount of target total medical assistance expenditures (defined under Section (c) of the new SSA Section 1903A). Excess aggregate medical assistance payments would be the product of the excess aggregate medical assistance expenditures and the federal average medical assistance matching percentage. The federal average medical assistance matching percentage for each state and fiscal year would be the ratio of (1) the amount of federal payments made to the state under SSA Section 1903(a)(1) for medical assistance expenditures in the fiscal year prior to any potential reduction applied under this section to (2) the amount of the state's total medical assistance expenditures for the fiscal year (including both federal and state expenditures). Section (b). Adjusted Total Medical Assistance Expenditures Under Section (b), there would be two formulas for adjusted total medical assistance expenditures : one formula for FY2016 and another formula for FY2019 and subsequent years. Both formulas for adjusted total medical assistance expenditures would exclude expenditures for Medicaid DSH payments under SSA Section 1923, Medicare cost-sharing payments under SSA Section 1905(p)(3), and safety-net provider payment adjustments in non-expansion states.  The FY2016 formula for adjusted total medical assistance expenditures would be the product of (1) the amount of medical assistance expenditures for a state reduced by the amount of any excluded expenditures in FY2016 and (2) the 1903A FY2016 population percentage , which is the HHS Secretary's calculation of the percentage of actual medical assistance expenditures attributable to 1903A enrollees in a state in FY2016 (discussed below, under Section (e)). The FY2019 or subsequent fiscal years formula for adjusted total medical assistance expenditures for a state and fiscal year would be the amount of medical assistance expenditures attributable to 1903A enrollees reduced by any excluded expenditures. Medical assistance expenditures would be defined as medical assistance payments as reported under the medical services category on the Form CMS-64 quarterly expense report (or successor to such form) for which payment is made pursuant to SSA Section 1903(a)(1).  The language specifies that the medical assistance expenditures for FY2019 and subsequent years would include non-DSH supplemental payments (including certain waiver expenditures for delivery system reform incentive pools, uncompensated care pools, and designated state health programs). The medical assistance expenditures for FY2019 and subsequent years would not include expenditures for the Vaccines for Children program.  Section (c). Target Total Medical Assistance Expenditures Under Section (c) of the new SSA Section 1903A, target total medical assistance expenditures for a state and fiscal year would be the sum of the following formula for each 1903A enrollee category (defined under Section (e) of the new SSA Section 1903A): (1) target per capita medical assistance expenditures for the enrollee category times (2) the number of 1903A enrollees for such 1903A enrollee category.  For FY2020, the target per capita medical assistance expenditures for each 1903A enrollee category would be the provisional FY2019 target per capita amount (defined in Section (d) of the new SSA Section 1903A) for such enrollee category for the state increased by the applicable annual inflation factor. For subsequent years, the target per capita medical assistance expenditures for each 1903A enrollee category would be the target per capita medical assistance expenditures for the previous year for such enrollee category for the state increased by the applicable annual inflation factor. The applicable inflation factor would vary by 1903A enrollee category. For the children; expansion enrollee; and other non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adult categories, the applicable inflation factor would be the percentage increase in the medical care component of the CPI-U from September of the previous fiscal year to September of the fiscal year involved. For the elderly and disabled categories, the applicable inflation factor would be the percentage increase in the medical care component of the CPI-U from September of the previous fiscal year to September of the fiscal year involved plus one percentage point. Beginning in FY2020, there would be a decrease in the target total medical assistance expenditures for states that (1) have a Medicaid DSH allotment in FY2016 that was more than six times the national average and (2) require political subdivisions within the state to contribute funds toward medical assistance or other expenditures under Medicaid (including under a waiver) for the fiscal year involved. The decrease would be the amount that political subdivisions in the state are required to contribute under Medicaid without reimbursement from the state other than the following required contributions: (1) from political subdivisions with a population of more than 5 million that impose local income tax upon their residents and (2) for certain administrative expenses required to be paid by the political subdivision as of January 1, 2017. Section (d). Calculation of FY2019 Provisional Target Amount for Each 1903A\u00a0Enrollee\u00a0 Category The HHS Secretary would calculate for each state the provisional FY2019 per capita target amounts for each 1903A enrollee category. The formula for the provisional FY2019 per capita target amounts would be the average per capita medical assistance expenditures for the state for FY2019 for such enrollee category multiplied by the ratio of (1) the product of the FY2019 average per capita amount for the state and the number of 1903A enrollees for the state in FY2019 to (2) the amount of FY2019 adjusted total medical assistance expenditures for the state. This calculation would be subject to treatment of states expanding coverage after FY2016 (discussed in Section (f) of the new SSA Section 1903A). The average per capita medical assistance expenditures for FY2019 for each 1903A enrollee category would be the FY2019 adjusted total medical assistance expenditures for the state divided by the number of 1903A enrollees for the state in FY2019. The FY2019 adjusted total medical assistance expenditures would exclude non-DSH supplemental expenditures (including certain waiver expenditures for delivery system reform incentive pools, uncompensated care pools, and designated state health programs) for FY2019 and would be increased by the non-DSH supplemental payment percentage for FY2016, which is the ratio of the total amount of non-DSH supplemental payments for FY2016 to adjusted total medical assistance expenditures for FY2016.  For each state, the FY2019 average per capita amount would be the FY2016 average per capita medical assistance expenditures increased by the percentage increase in the medical care component of the CPI-U from September 2016 to September 2019. The FY2016 average per capita medical assistance expenditures would be the amount of the FY2016 adjusted total medical assistance expenditures (discussed in Section (b)) divided by the number of 1903A enrollees for the state in FY2016. Section (e). 1903A Enrollee; 1903A Enrollee Category This section would define 1903A enrollees as Medicaid enrollees (i.e., individuals eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid and enrolled under the Medicaid state plan or waiver) for the month in a state that is not covered under the block grant option and does not fall into one of the following categories: individuals covered under a CHIP Medicaid expansion program (SSA Section 2101(a)(2)), individuals who receive medical assistance through an Indian Health Service facility (the third sentence under SSA Section 1905(b)), individuals entitled to medical assistance coverage of breast and cervical cancer treatment due to screening under the Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVIII)), or the following partial-benefit enrollees: unauthorized (illegally present) aliens eligible for Medicaid emergency medical care (SSA Section 1903(v)(2)), individuals eligible for Medicaid family planning options (SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XXI)), individuals infected with tuberculosis (SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XII)), dual-eligible individuals eligible for coverage of Medicare cost sharing (SSA Section 1905(p)(3)(A)(i) or (ii)), or individuals eligible for premium assistance (SSA Section 1906 or 1906A). The enrollment count would be based on the average monthly amount reported through the Form CMS-64 as required under Section (h).  The 1903A enrollee categories would be (1) elderly; (2) blind and disabled; (3) children; (4) expansion enrollees; and (5) other non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults. Section (f). Special Payment Rules Section (f) of the new SSA Section 1903A would provide special payment rules for (1) payments made under Section 1115 waivers or Section 1915 waivers, (2) states that did not have ACA Medicaid expansion in FY2016 and later implement the expansion, and (3) states that fail to satisfactorily submit data in accordance with Section (h)(1) of the new SSA Section 1903A. Section (g). Recalculation of Certain Amounts for Data Errors Section (g) of the new SSA Section 1903A would allow for the recalculation of certain amounts for data errors. Any adjustment under this section would not result in an increase of the target total medical assistance expenditures exceeding 2%. Section (h). Required Reporting and Auditing of CMS-64 Data; Transitional Increase in Federal Matching Percentage for Certain Administrative Expenses In addition to the required reporting for ACA Medicaid expansion on the Form CMS-64 report as of January 1, 2017, Section (h) of the new SSA Section 1903A would impose additional reporting requirements on states starting October 1, 2018. The additional reporting requirements would include data on medical assistance expenditures within categories of services and categories of enrollees (including each 1903A enrollee category and the enrollment categories excluded from the definition of 1903A enrollees). In addition, Section (h) would require reporting of the number of enrollees within each enrollee category. The HHS Secretary would determine the specific reporting requirements. The HHS Secretary also would conduct audits of each state's enrollment and expenditures reported on the Form CMS-64 for FY2016, FY2019, and subsequent years. These audits may be conducted on a representative sample, as determined by the HHS Secretary. This section would provide a temporary increase to the federal matching percentage for the administrative activities related to improving data reporting systems. The temporary increases would impact expenditures on or after October 1, 2017, and before October 1, 2019. Section (i). Flexible Block Grant Option for States Section (i) would provide states with an option to receive block grant funding instead of per capita cap funding for a portion of their Medicaid program starting in FY2020. States would elect this option for a 10-year period. When a state uses the block grant option, the enrollees covered under the block grant would not be counted as 1903A enrollees for the per capita limitations. If the block grant option were not extended after the 10-year period, then the per capita limitations would apply as if the block grant option had never taken place.  The block grant funds could be used only to provide coverage of the health care assistance specified in the block grant state plan, and the coverage provided to the enrollees under the block grant option would be instead of other Medicaid coverage. No payment would be made through the block grant option unless the state has an approved block grant state plan. A block grant state plan would be deemed approved by the HHS Secretary unless within 30 days of receipt the Secretary finds the plan incomplete or actuarially unsound. For the block grant state plan, some statutory requirements would not apply. These requirements are as follows: statewide operation, which requires a state pan to be in effect throughout the state, with certain exceptions (SSA Section 1902(a)(1)); comparability, which means services available to the various population groups must be equal in amount, duration, and scope within a state (SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(B)); reasonable standards for income and resources, meaning states must use eligibility standards and methodologies that are reasonable and consistent with the objectives of Medicaid, with certain exceptions (SSA Section 1902(a)(17)); and freedom of choice, which means enrollees must be able to obtain services from any qualified Medicaid provider that undertakes to provide services to them, with certain exceptions (SSA Section 1902(a)(23)). The block grant state plan would be required to specify who is covered under the block grant, the conditions of eligibility for the block grant, and the services covered under the block grant. Under their block grant, states could cover either  children and other non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults or only other non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults.  Under the block grant option, states would be able to specify the conditions of eligibility. However, states would be required to provide coverage to pregnant women that are currently required to be covered by Medicaid programs under SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i). If children are included in a state's block grant, the state would be required to provide coverage to children that are currently required to be covered by Medicaid programs under SSA Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) and SSA Section 1902(e)(4). This would include the poverty-related populations of pregnant women with income up to 133% of FPL, children aged 0 through 5 with income up to 133% of FPL, and children aged 6 through 18 with income up to 100% of FPL. In addition, this would include deemed newborns, foster care children, and former foster care children up to the age of 26, among others. States using the block grant option would be able to determine the types of items and services covered under the block grant (with the exception of some required services) in addition to the amount, duration, and scope for those services. Also, states would be able to specify the cost-sharing and delivery model for the block grant. This coverage could differ from the Medicaid coverage provided outside of the block grant, but states would be required to provide coverage of the following services under the block grant: hospital care; surgical care and treatment; medical care and treatment; obstetrical and prenatal care and treatment; prescribed drugs, medicines, and prosthetic devices; other medical supplies and services; and health care for children under the age of 18. The block grant funding for the initial fiscal year in the 10-year period would be equal to the sum of the following formula for each block grant category (i.e., children or other, non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults). The formula for each block grant category would be (1) the target per capita medical assistance expenditures for such state and fiscal year times (2) the number of 1903A enrollees for the state for FY2019 times (3) the federal average medical assistance percentage for the state for FY2019. For subsequent fiscal years within the 10-year period, the block grant amount would be equal to the previous year's block grant amount increased by the annual increase in the CPI-U for the fiscal year involved.  Block grant funds for a fiscal year would remain available to a state in the succeeding fiscal year as long as the state is still using the block grant option in the succeeding fiscal year. The federal payment to states under the block grant option would be made from the block grant amount. Quarterly payments would be made to states using the enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) rate used for CHIP as the matching rate for block grant expenditures. The state would be responsible for the balance of the funds necessary to carry out the block grant state plan. As a condition of receiving funds under the block grant option, a state would be required to contract with an independent entity to conduct annual audits of its expenditures made with respect to the activities under the block grant to ensure that the block grant funds are used consistent with the block grant requirements. The audits would need to be made available to the HHS Secretary upon request. ACA Section 1402 authorized subsidies to eligible individuals to reduce the cost-sharing expenses for health insurance plans offered in the individual market through health insurance exchanges. Cost-sharing assistance is provided in two forms. The first form of assistance reduces the out-of-pocket limit applicable for a given exchange plan; the second reduces actual cost-sharing requirements (e.g., lowers the deductible or reduces a co-payment) applicable to a given exchange plan. Both types of assistance provide greater subsidy amounts to individuals with lower household incomes. Individuals who meet applicable eligibility requirements may receive both types of cost-sharing subsidies. Section 131 would repeal ACA Section 1402, terminating the cost-sharing subsidies (and payments to issuers for such reductions), effective for plan years beginning in 2020. Over the years, Congress has taken different actions intended to provide financial assistance for individuals with high-cost medical needs. For example, Congress made appropriations available to fund high-risk pools (HRPs) through legislation enacted prior to the ACA. Prior to the ACA, 35 states established HRPs to provide health insurance options to individuals who sought coverage in the individual market; many such individuals were denied coverage, offered coverage with premiums that exceeded those found in the HRPs, or offered coverage that excluded services to treat preexisting health conditions. The coverage provided through state HRPs generally reflected coverage available in the private individual insurance market in those states. Congress first authorized and provided appropriations for state grants, for the purpose of funding HRPs, during the 107 th Congress. Additional appropriations were made available during the 109 th , 110 th , and 111 th Congresses.  Congress also made appropriations available for HRPs under the ACA. The ACA required the HHS Secretary to establish a temporary HRP, known as the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). The intent of the PCIP was to provide transitional coverage for uninsured individuals with preexisting conditions until January 1, 2014, when most private health insurance plans would be prohibited from having preexisting condition exclusions. The ACA provided appropriations, beginning in 2010, to fund the PCIP program, which terminated at the end of 2013. In another example, Congress established a transitional reinsurance program under the ACA, which was designed to provide payment to non-grandfathered individual market plans that enrolled high-risk enrollees for 2014 through 2016. Under the program, the HHS Secretary collected reinsurance contributions from health insurance issuers and from third-party administrators on behalf of group health plans. The HHS Secretary then used those contributions to make reinsurance payments to issuers who enrolled high-cost enrollees in their non-grandfathered individual market plans both inside and outside of the exchanges. (Statutes required the HHS Secretary to determine how high-risk enrollees are identified, and the HHS Secretary in turn defined high-risk enrollees as high-cost enrollees.) The program covers a portion of the claims costs for these enrollees based on payment parameters set by the HHS Secretary. Section 132 would add a new Title XXII to the SSA. Section 2201 of the new title would establish the Patient and State Stability Fund, which is to be administered by the CMS Administrator. The fund's purpose is to provide funding to the 50 states and the District of Columbia from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2026. Per Section 2202(a) of the new title, states may use payments allocated from the Patient and State Stability Fund for any of the following activities:  a new or existing mechanism that provides financial assistance to certain high-risk individuals who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance to enroll in the individual market; providing incentives to entities to enter into arrangements with the state for the purpose of stabilizing premiums in the individual market; reducing health insurance costs in the individual and small-group markets for individuals who have or are projected to have high health care utilization (as measured by cost) and individuals who face high costs of health insurance coverage due to low population density in the state; promoting health insurance issuer participation and increasing insurance options in the individual and small-group markets; promoting access to preventive, dental, or vision services, or any combination of such services; maternity coverage and newborn care; prevention, treatment, or recovery services for individuals with mental or substance abuse disorders that focus on inpatient or outpatient clinical care of treatment of addiction and mental illness and early identification and intervention for children and young adults with mental illness; providing payments, directly or indirectly, to health care providers for the provision of services specified by the CMS Administrator; and providing assistance to reduce out-of-pocket costs (including premiums) for individuals with health insurance coverage in the state.  Section 2203 of the new title would specify the application process for states to become eligible to receive payments from the Patient and State Stability Fund. The application would include a description of how payments would be used for allowed activities; a certification that states would make required contributions for allowed activities; and other information as required by the CMS Administrator. A state would need to apply only once to be treated as providing applications for subsequent years.  Section 2204(b)(2)(A) of the new title would specify a formula for allocations to states for 2018 and 2019 for one or more of the allowed activities. The formula relies on the medical claims incurred by health insurance issuers in the state, the number of uninsured individuals in the state whose income is below 100% of FPL, and the number of issuers offering coverage through the state's exchange. For 2020 through 2026, Section 2204(b)(2)(B) of the new title would authorize the CMS Administrator to develop a method by which Patient and State Stability Fund payments would be allocated among the states, requiring that the Administrator take into account medical claims incurred by issuers in the state, the number of uninsured individuals in the state whose income is below 100% of FPL, and the number of issuers participating in the state's insurance market. The CMS Administrator would be required to consult with various stakeholders (e.g., health care consumers, issuers, state insurance commissioners) prior to establishing the allocation method for 2020-2026, and the method is to reflect the goals of improving the health insurance risk pool, promoting competition, and increasing choice for health care consumers.  Section 2203(b) would provide that if a state does not have an approved application for the allowed activities for a year, the CMS Administrator, in consultation with the state insurance commissioner, is to use the state's allocation for the year for market stabilization payments to issuers offering coverage in the individual and small-group markets in the state. These payments would be paid to such issuers for claims that exceed $50,000 but do not exceed $350,000 in 2018 and in 2019, in an amount equal to 75% of the claims. The dollar thresholds and the payment percentage are to be specified by the CMS Administrator for years 2020 through 2026. Section 2204(c) would provide for the reallocation of unused funds to states. Section 2204(e) would require states, as a condition of receipt of Patient and State Stability Fund allocations, to make contributions toward the activities or programs for which the application was approved. The state contributions would equal a certain percentage of the fund allocation. For those states carrying out allowed activities, the contributions begin at 7% in 2020 and increase annually to 50% in 2026. For those states with market-stabilization programs, state contributions begin at 10% in 2020, increase to 50% by 2024, and remain at 50% through 2026.  Section 2204(a) would authorize appropriations for the Patient and State Stability Fund and provide specific appropriation amounts. For 2018 and 2019, the appropriation would be $15 billion each year, and states would be able to use appropriated funds for any of the allowed activities. For 2020-2026, the appropriation would be $10 billion each year for any allowed activities. Amounts appropriated and allocated to states are to remain available for expenditure through December 31, 2027. Section 2204(a) also would provide for two additional appropriations for specified activities. For 2020, there would be an additional $15 billion appropriated that states could use only for maternity coverage and newborn care and prevention, treatment, or recovery services for individuals with mental or substance abuse disorders. For 2018-2023, there would be an additional $8 billion that could be allocated to certain states. The only states that could receive funds from the $8 billion would be those with a waiver in effect under new Public Health Service Act (PHSA) Section 2701(b)(1)(C), as would be established by AHCA Section 136. The new PHSA Section 2701(b)(1)(C) would allow states to waive the continuous coverage penalty, as would be implemented under AHCA Section 133, and instead allow issuers to use health status as a factor when developing premiums for individuals subject to an enforcement period. The additional $8 billion would be allocated to states with these waivers in effect according to a methodology specified by the HHS Secretary. States would be required to use the allocations to provide assistance in reducing premiums or out-of-pocket costs for individuals in the state subject to an increase in premiums as a result of the state's waiver. Section 2204(e)(3) would prohibit the CMS Administrator from making an allocation to a state if the state were to use the allocation for purposes not permitted under SSA Section 2105(c)(7), related to abortion. Section 2205 of the new title would establish a Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program within the Patient and State Stability Fund. Like the fund, the program is to be administered by the CMS Administrator. The purpose of the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program would be to provide payments to health insurance issuers to help them offset the medical claims costs of high-cost enrollees (referred to as eligible individuals ). The CMS Administrator would be required to establish the parameters for the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program, including defining eligible individuals ; developing and using health status statements for eligible individuals; identifying health conditions that would automatically qualify individuals as eligible individuals at the time they apply for health insurance; creating a process health insurance issuers could use to voluntarily qualify enrollees who do not automatically qualify as eligible individuals; determining a percentage of an enrollee's paid premiums that would be collected for the program's use; and determining the program's attachment point\u2014the dollar amount of claims for an eligible individual after which the program would make payments to the issuer\u2014and determining the portion of such claims the program would pay. The CMS Administrator must establish the parameters of the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program for plan year 2018 no later than 60 days after enactment, and the CMS Administrator must establish a process for state operation of the program beginning in plan year 2020.  Section 2205 of the new title would appropriate $15 billion to be used for the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2026. IRC Section 5000A, as added by ACA Section 1501, created an individual mandate, a requirement for most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty for noncompliance. To comply with the mandate, most individuals need to maintain minimum essential coverage , which includes most types of private (e.g., employer-sponsored) coverage and public coverage (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid). Certain individuals are exempt from the mandate and its associated penalty. Section 2701 of the PHSA, as amended by ACA Section 1201, provided that premiums for certain plans offered in the individual and small-group markets may vary only by self-only or family enrollment, geographic rating area, tobacco use (limited to a ratio of 1.5:1), and age (limited to a ratio of 3:1 for adults). The age rating ratio means that a plan may not charge an older individual more than three times the premium that the plan charges a 21-year-old individual.  PHSA Section 2702, as amended by ACA Section 1201, provides that most plans offered in the individual, small-group, and large-group markets must be offered on a guaranteed-issue basis. In general, guaranteed issue in health insurance is the requirement that a plan accept every applicant for health coverage, as long as the applicant agrees to the terms and conditions of the insurance offer (e.g., the premium).  PHSA Section 2704(a), as amended by ACA Section 1201, prohibits most private health insurance plans from excluding coverage of preexisting health conditions. Plans cannot exclude benefits based on health conditions for any individual. A preexisting health condition is a medical condition that was present before the date of enrollment for health coverage, whether or not any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received before such date. As described elsewhere in this report, Section 204 would effectively eliminate the annual penalty associated with IRC Section 5000A, the individual mandate, retroactively beginning CY2016. Section 133 would add a new Section 2710A to the PHSA. Under the new section, issuers offering plans in the individual market are to assess a penalty on applicable policyholders by increasing monthly premiums by 30% during an enforcement period. (In essence, the penalty is a variation in premiums.) The requirement would apply to enrollments beginning in plan year 2019, and it also would apply to enrollments that occur in special enrollment periods in plan year 2018. Applicable policyholders are (1) individuals who had a gap in creditable coverage, as currently defined in PHSA Section 2704(c), that exceeded 63 days in the 12 months prior to enrolling in current coverage and (2) individuals who aged out of their dependent coverage (i.e., young adults up to the age of 26) and did not enroll in coverage during the first open enrollment period following the date they aged out of their coverage. The enforcement period, with respect to enrollment beginning plan year 2019, is a 12-month period beginning the first day an individual enrolls in a plan. The enforcement period, with respect to enrollments during a special enrollment period in 2018, is the first month the individual is enrolled in coverage and ends in the last month of the plan year. ACA Section 1302 required certain plans offered in the individual and small-group markets to meet a generosity level. The generosity level (i.e., actuarial value, or AV) is a summary measure of a plan's generosity of coverage. It is expressed as the percentage a given health insurance plan will pay for covered medical expenses, for a standard population. Plans must meet one of the following AV levels: bronze (60% AV), silver (70% AV), gold (80% AV), or platinum (90% AV). On average, as AV increases, consumer cost sharing decreases. For example, for a silver-level plan, on average, a plan pays for 70% of covered services and a consumer pays for 30% of covered services out-of-pocket. Section 134 would amend ACA Sections 1302(a)(3) and 1302(d) to provide that plans offered after December 31, 2019, no longer need to meet a certain generosity level. PHSA Section 2701(a)(1), as amended by ACA Section 1201, provided that premiums for certain plans offered in the individual and small-group markets may vary only by self-only or family enrollment, geographic rating area, tobacco use (limited to a ratio of 1.5:1), and age (limited to a ratio of 3:1 for adults). The age rating ratio means that a plan may not charge an older individual more than three times the premium that the plan charges a 21-year-old individual. PHSA Section 2701(a)(5), as amended by ACA Section 10103, provides that if a state permits large-group coverage to be sold through the state's health insurance exchange, then the rating restrictions apply to all fully insured plans offered in the state's large-group market.  Section 135 would amend PHSA Section 2701(a)(1)(A)(iii) and establish that for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the HHS Secretary may implement, through rulemaking, an age rating ratio of 5:1 for adults. That is, a plan would not be able to charge an older individual more than five times the premium that the plan would charge a 21-year-old individual. States would have the option to implement a ratio for adults that is different from the 5:1 ratio. Current federal law includes a number of restrictions related to the factors that can be used for determining an individual's eligibility for private health insurance coverage and the premium for such coverage. As described earlier, PHSA Section 2701(a)(1), as amended by ACA Section 1201, provided that premiums for certain plans offered in the individual and small-group markets may vary only by self-only or family enrollment, geographic rating area, tobacco use (limited to a ratio of 1.5:1), and age (limited to a ratio of 3:1 for adults). Premiums for such plans cannot vary for any other factors, such as gender or health status.  PHSA Section 2704(a), as amended by ACA Section 1201, prohibited most private health insurance plans from excluding coverage of preexisting health conditions. Plans cannot exclude benefits based on health conditions for any individual or group. A preexisting health condition is a medical condition that was present before the date of enrollment for health coverage, whether or not any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received before such date. PHSA Section 2705(a), as amended by ACA Section 1201, prohibited most private health insurance plans from basing eligibility for coverage on health status-related factors. Such factors include health status, medical condition (including both physical and mental illness), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability (including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence), disability, and any other health status-related factor determined appropriate by the HHS Secretary.  PHSA Section 2705(b)(1) prohibited private health insurance plans from requiring an individual to pay a larger premium than any other similarly situated enrollees of the plan on the basis of a health status-related factor of the individual or any of the individual's dependents. PHSA Section 2705(b)(2) provided that such plans may offer premium discounts or rewards based on enrollee participation in wellness programs. PHSA Section 2705(b)(3) prohibited all group plans from adjusting premiums for the covered group on the basis of genetic information. ACA Section 1302 required certain plans offered in the individual and small-group markets to offer a core package of health care services, known as the\u00a0EHB. The ACA did not specifically define this core package. Instead, ACA Section 1302(b) listed 10 categories from which benefits and services must be included and required the HHS Secretary to further define the EHB. The 10 categories are ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory service; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care. ACA Section 1252 required all standards and requirements adopted by a state pursuant to Title I of the ACA, or any amendments to Title I, to apply uniformly within applicable health insurance markets in the state. ACA Section 1324(a) provides that private health insurance issuers are not subject to federal or state laws (specified under ACA Section 1324(b)) if the laws do not apply to qualified health plans offered under ACA Section 1322 (Consumer-Operated and Oriented Plan [CO-OP] Program) or ACA Section 1334 (Multistate Plan [MSP] Program).  Section 136 would amend PHSA Section 2701 by adding a new subsection (b) that would allow states to apply for waivers from certain federal health insurance requirements. The new subsection (b)(1) would allow states to apply for a waiver for one or more of the following purposes. States could apply for a waiver to implement an age rating ratio for individuals aged 21 and older for plans purchased in the individual and small-group markets that is higher than the ratio specified in PHSA Section 2701(a)(1)(A)(iii), as would be amended by AHCA Section 135. This waiver could apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. States could apply for a waiver from the EHB as specified in ACA Section 1302(b), and instead the state could specify its own EHB for plans purchased in the individual and small-group markets. This waiver could apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2020. States could apply for a waiver of the continuous coverage penalty, as would be implemented under AHCA Section 133. The continuous coverage penalty would require issuers offering coverage in the individual market to assess a penalty on individuals who have a gap in health insurance coverage (i.e., are subject to an enforcement period). A state could apply to waive the application of the penalty and instead allow issuers to use health status as a factor when developing premiums for individuals subject to an enforcement period. Specifically, the new subsection (b)(1)(C)(ii) would provide that PHSA Section 2701(a) would be applied as if health status were included as a factor and PHSA Section 2705(b) would not apply. To obtain this type of waiver, a state must have a program in effect that carries out at least one of the purposes described in (1) or (2) of SSA Section 2202(a) (as would be added under AHCA Section 132) or the state must participate in the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program established under SSA Section 2205 (as would be added under AHCA Section 132). This waiver could apply to coverage obtained during special enrollment periods for plan year 2018 and for all coverage beginning plan year 2019. The new subsection (b)(3) would specify the waiver application requirements. The HHS Secretary would determine the timing and manner for submitting waiver applications. A state's application would be required to explain how approval of the application would provide for one or more of the following outcomes in the state: reducing average premiums for health insurance, increasing enrollment in health insurance, stabilizing the health insurance market, stabilizing premiums for individuals with preexisting conditions, or increasing the choice of health plans. The application also would have to include information about what the state would put in place of the waived provision. For example, if the state applied for a waiver to define the EHB, the application would have to specify the EHB that would be put in place in the state under the waiver. Per new subsection (b)(2), a state's application for a waiver would be approved unless the HHS Secretary notifies the state that the waiver has been denied (and provides the reason for denial) no later than 60 days after the application is submitted. New subsection (b)(4)(A) would provide that a state's waiver cannot extend longer than 10 years unless a state requests continuation. If a state requests continuation, such a request would be granted unless the HHS Secretary denies the request or asks the state for additional information within 90 days of the state's submission of a continuation request.  New subsection (b)(5)(A) would provide that the waivers allowed under the new PHSA Section 2701(b) cannot apply to the following ACA sections: 1301, regarding requirements for qualified health plans (QHPs), to the extent it applies to QHPs offered under ACA Section 1322 (CO-OP program) or ACA Section 1334 (MSP program); 1312(d)(3)(D), regarding health insurance coverage for Members of Congress; 1331, regarding the Basic Health Program; 1332, regarding state innovation waivers; 1333, regarding health care choice compacts; and 1334, regarding the MSP program. New subsection (b)(5)(B) would provide that any standards and requirements a state adopts pursuant to an approved waiver would be deemed compliant with ACA Sections 1252 and 1324(a). Section 137 would provide that nothing in the AHCA is to be construed as allowing issuers to vary health insurance rates by gender or as permitting issuers to limit access to coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. Section 1005 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA; P.L. 111-152 ) established the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund (HIRIF) within HHS and appropriated $1 billion to the HIRIF to help cover the federal administrative costs of implementing the ACA. Through the end of FY2016, a total of $994.9 million had been obligated from the HIRIF. The obligated amounts, by agency, are as follows: IRS, $542.8 million; HHS, $440.9 million; Office of Personnel Management, $6.1 million; Department of Labor, $4.5 million; and Social Security Administration, $0.6 million. Section 141 would establish an American Health Care Implementation Fund within HHS to be used to implement the following AHCA provisions: per capita allotment for medical assistance (Section 121); Patient and State Stability Fund (Section 132); additional modifications to the premium tax credit (Section 202); and refundable tax credit for health insurance coverage (Section 214). Section 141 would appropriate $1 billion to the American Health Care Implementation Fund. IRC Section 36B, as added by ACA Section 1401, and related amendments authorized premium tax credits to help eligible individuals pay for health insurance. The tax credits apply toward premiums for qualified health plans (QHPs) offered in the individual market through health insurance exchanges. QHPs are allowed to be offered outside of exchanges (off-exchange plans), but the premium credits may not be used toward the purchase of such plans. The premium credit is refundable, so individuals may claim the full credit amount when filing their taxes, even if they have little or no federal income tax liability. The credit also is advanceable, so individuals may choose to receive the credit on a monthly basis to coincide with the payment of insurance premiums. ACA Section 1411 generally makes the premium tax credit available to those who do not have access to subsidized public coverage (e.g., Medicaid) or employer-sponsored coverage that meets certain standards. The amount of the premium tax credit varies from individual to individual. The ACA specifies formulas for calculation of the premium tax credit amount and the amount that the individual (or family) must contribute toward the premium. That latter amount\u2014the required premium contribution\u2014is calculated according to a formula that incorporates a certain percentage ( applicable percentage ) of a given individual's (or family's) household income (MAGI) and the premium for the standard plan (i.e., the second-lowest-cost silver plan) in that individual's (or family's) local area. The required premium contribution is capped according to MAGI, with such income measured relative to FPL. A smaller cap applies to lower-income individuals\u2014compared to the cap applicable to higher-income persons\u2014meaning such individuals generally receive greater tax assistance.  ACA Section 1412 establishes an advance payment program, for making the credits available during the year. The advanced amounts are reconciled when individuals file income-tax returns for the actual year in which they receive the credits. If a tax filing unit's income decreases during the tax year, and the filer should have received a larger credit, this additional credit amount will be included in the tax refund for the year. By contrast, any excess amount that was overpaid in credits to the filer will have to be repaid to the federal government as a tax payment. IRC Section 36B(f)(2)(B) imposes limits on the excess amounts to be repaid under certain conditions. For households with incomes below 400% of FPL, the specific limits apply to single and joint filers separately. ACA Section 1414 authorizes the disclosure of taxpayer information by amending IRC Section 6103(l). IRC Section 6055, as added by ACA Section 1502, requires every entity (including employers, insurers, and government programs) that provides minimum essential coverage (including QHPs) to an individual to report that information to the IRS and provide a statement to the covered individual. Section 201 would not apply IRC Section 36B(f)(2)(B), relating to limits on the excess amounts to be repaid with respect to the ACA premium tax credits, to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2020. In other words, for tax years 2018 and 2019, any individual who was overpaid in premium tax credits would have to repay the entire excess amount, regardless of income. Section 202 would disregard certification, plan choice, and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to QHPs and the requirement for QHPs to be offered through an exchange for ACA premium tax credit purposes. Advance payments of the credit, however, would not be allowed for plans offered outside of exchanges. Section 202 would allow the ACA credits to be applied toward the purchase of catastrophic plans but not grandfathered plans, grandmothered plans, or abortion coverage (except if necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest). The section would allow an individual to purchase abortion-only coverage or a plan that includes abortion coverage, and would allow a health insurer to offer such coverage or plan, but would prohibit ACA premium tax credits to be used to pay for either. Section 202 would amend IRC Section 6055, relating to the reporting of minimum essential coverage, to require an entity that offers an off-exchange QHP to report certain specified information. With respect to the formula for calculating required premium contributions, Section 202 would specify age and income-adjusted applicable percentages for tax year 2019. The applicable percentages would range from 2% for those in the lowest income band to 11.5% for those in the highest income band and the oldest age band, which generally would provide greater tax assistance to lower-income individuals. Beginning in tax year 2019, the applicable percentages would be adjusted to take into account premium growth in comparison with other specified economic measures.  Section 202 would go into effect beginning tax year 2018, unless otherwise specified. Section 45R of the IRC, as added by ACA Section 1421, provided for a small business health insurance tax credit. The credit is intended to help make the premiums for small-group health insurance coverage more affordable for certain small employers. The credit generally is available to nonprofit and for-profit employers with fewer than 25 full-time-equivalent employees with average annual wages that fall under a statutorily specified cap. To qualify for the credit, employers must cover at least 50% of the cost of each of their employees' self-only health insurance coverage. As of 2014, small employers must obtain insurance through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchange to receive the credit, and the credit is available for two consecutive tax years only. The two-year period begins with the first year an employer obtains coverage through a SHOP exchange. For example, if an employer first obtains coverage through a SHOP exchange in 2017, the credit will be available to the employer only in 2017 and 2018. Beginning in tax year 2018, Section 203 would amend IRC Section 45R to indicate that the small business health insurance tax credit amount is to be determined based on QHPs that do not include coverage for abortion, except abortions necessary to save the life of the mother or abortions for pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest. The provision further states that an employer would not be prohibited from purchasing for its employees separate coverage for abortion, so long as no tax credit under IRC Section 45R is allowed with respect to employer contributions for such coverage. Section 203 would provide that the small business health insurance tax credit would not be available beginning tax year 2020. IRC Section 5000A, as added by ACA Section 1501, created an individual mandate, a requirement for most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty for noncompliance. To comply with the mandate, most individuals need to obtain minimum essential coverage , which includes most types of private (e.g., employer-sponsored) coverage and public coverage (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid). Certain individuals are exempt from the mandate and its associated penalty.  The individual mandate went into effect in 2014. Individuals who are not exempt from the mandate are required to pay a penalty for each month of noncompliance. The annual penalty is the greater of a percentage of income or a flat dollar amount (but not more than the national average premium of a specified health plan). The percentage of income increased from 1.0% in 2014 to 2.5% in 2016 and beyond. The flat dollar amount increased from $95 in 2014 to $695 in 2016 and is adjusted for inflation thereafter.  Section 204 would effectively eliminate the annual penalty associated with IRC Section 5000A, the individual mandate, by reducing the percentage of income to 0% and the flat dollar amount to $0, retroactively beginning CY2016. IRC Section 4980H, as added by ACA Section 1513, required that employers either provide health coverage or face potential employer tax penalties. The potential employer penalties apply to all common-law employers, including government entities (such as federal, state, local, or Indian tribal government entities) and nonprofit organizations that are exempt from federal income taxes. The penalties are imposed on firms with at least 50 full-time-equivalent employees if one or more of their full-time employees obtain a premium tax credit through a health insurance exchange. The total penalty for any applicable large employer is based on the employer's number of full-time employees (averaging 30 hours or more per week) and whether the employer offers affordable health coverage that provides minimum value. Section 205 would modify the tax penalty associated with IRC Section 4980H, effectively eliminating it by reducing the penalty to $0 retroactively beginning in CY2016. IRC Section 4980I, as added by ACA Section 9001, created a new excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage (the so-called Cadillac tax). Under the ACA, the tax was scheduled to take effect in 2018; however, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ) delayed implementation of the tax until 2020. When it is implemented, the tax is to be imposed at a 40% rate on the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored health coverage that exceeds a specified dollar limit. If a tax is owed, it is levied on the entity providing the coverage (e.g., the health insurance issuer or the employer). Section 206 would delay implementation of IRC Section 4980I (the so-called Cadillac tax) until taxable periods beginning January 1, 2026. Under the IRC, taxpayers may use several different types of tax-advantaged health accounts to pay or be reimbursed for qualified medical expenses: health flexible spending accounts (health FSAs), health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), and health savings accounts (HSAs). ACA Section 9003 amended the relevant IRC provisions (IRC Sections 106, 220, and 223) to provide that, for each of these accounts, amounts paid for medicine or drugs are qualified expenses only in the case of prescribed drugs and insulin. Section 207 would repeal the language in IRC Sections 106, 220, and 223 stipulating that a medicine or drug must be a prescribed drug or insulin to be considered a qualified expense in terms of spending from a tax-advantaged health account. The provision would be generally effective beginning tax year 2017. ACA Section 9004 imposed a 20% tax on distributions from Archer MSAs and HSAs that are used for purposes other than paying for qualified medical expenses. Prior to the ACA, IRC Section 220 applied a 15% rate on such distributions if made from an Archer MSA and IRC Section 223 applied a 10% rate on such distributions if made from an HSA. Section 208 would amend IRC Sections 220 and 223 to reduce the applicable rate to 15% and 10% for Archer MSAs and HSAs, respectively. The lower rates would apply to distributions made after December 31, 2016. IRC Section 125 allowed employers to establish cafeteria plans , benefit plans under which employees may choose between receiving cash (typically additional take-home pay) and certain normally nontaxable benefits (such as employer-paid health insurance) without being taxed on the value of the benefits if they select the latter. (A general rule of taxation is that when given a choice between taxable and nontaxable benefits, taxpayers will be taxed on whichever they choose because they are deemed to be in constructive receipt of the cash.) ACA Section 9005 amended IRC Section 125(i) to provide that a health FSA cannot be a nontaxable benefit under a cafeteria plan unless the cafeteria plan provides that an employee may not elect for any taxable year to have a salary reduction contribution in excess of $2,500 made to such arrangement. Also, the $2,500 limit is indexed for cost-of-living adjustments for plan years beginning after December 31, 2013. Section 209 would repeal IRC Section 125(i), the contribution limit for health FSAs, effective beginning tax year 2017. Section 1405 of the HCERA created a new excise tax that is imposed on the sale of certain medical devices. The tax is codified in IRC Section 4191. The tax is equal to 2.3% of the device's sales price and generally is imposed on the manufacturer or importer of the device. The tax took effect on January 1, 2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ) provided a two-year moratorium on the tax. The tax does not apply to sales in the period beginning January 1, 2016, and ending December 31, 2017.  Section 210 would provide that the medical device excise tax does not apply to sales after December 31, 2016. Employers that provide Medicare-eligible retirees with prescription drug coverage that meets or exceeds set federal standards are eligible for federal subsidy payments. The subsidies are equal to 28% of plans' actual spending for prescription drug costs in excess of $400 and not to exceed $8,250 (for 2017). The subsidies were created as part of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (Medicare Modernization Act of 2003; P.L. 108-173 ) to provide employers with an incentive to maintain drug coverage for their retirees.  Employers are allowed to exclude qualified retiree prescription drug plan subsidies from gross income for the purposes of corporate income tax. Prior to implementation of the ACA, employers also were allowed to claim a business deduction for their qualified retiree prescription drug expenses, even though they also received the federal subsidy to cover a portion of those expenses. ACA Section 9012 amended IRC Section 139A, beginning in 2013, to require employers to coordinate the subsidy and the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage. The amount allowable as a deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage is reduced by the amount of the federal subsidy received.  Section 211 would repeal the ACA change to IRC Section 139A and reinstate business-expense deductions for retiree prescription drug costs without reduction by the amount of any federal subsidy. The change would be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. Under IRC Section 213, taxpayers who itemize their deductions may deduct qualifying medical expenses. The medical-expense deduction may be claimed only for expenses that exceed 10% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI), which was reduced for taxable years ending before January 1, 2017, to 7.5% if the taxpayer or spouse was aged 65 or older. The 10% threshold was imposed by ACA Section 9013. Prior to the ACA, the AGI threshold was 7.5% for all taxpayers. Section 212 would amend IRC Section 213(a) to reduce the AGI threshold to 5.8% for all taxpayers, effective tax year 2017. ACA Sections 9015 and 10906 imposed a Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) surtax at a rate equal to 0.9% of an employee's wages or a self-employed individual's self-employment income. The surtax, which is found in IRC Sections 1401 and 3101, applies only to taxpayers with taxable income in excess of $250,000 if married filing jointly; $125,000 if married filing separately; and $200,000 for all other taxpayers. The tax is in addition to the regular Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Self-Employment Contributions Act taxes that generally apply (i.e., Social Security and Medicare taxes). Section 213 would amend IRC Sections 1401(b) and 3101(b) to repeal the 0.9% Medicare surtax, effective for remuneration received and taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The federal tax code currently allows two credits to help eligible individuals and dependents pay for health insurance that meets specified standards. The Health Coverage Tax Credit, codified in IRC Section 35, was reauthorized under the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 with a sunset date of January 1, 2020. In addition, the ACA authorized a premium tax credit for eligible individuals enrolled in exchange coverage, codified in IRC Section 36B, with no sunset date.  Section 214 would amend IRC Section 36B by replacing the text with completely new language, effective beginning tax year 2020. It would establish a refundable, advanceable tax credit for health insurance purposes. To be eligible for the tax credit, an individual would be required to be covered under a state-certified QHP; to not be eligible for private or public coverage as specified in the section; to be a citizen, national, or qualified alien of the United States; and to not be incarcerated (except incarceration pending disposition of charges). For tax credit purposes, a QHP would be any coverage offered in the individual health insurance market; such coverage would exclude grandfathered plans, grandmothered plans, abortion coverage (except if necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest), and coverage that consists substantially of either excepted benefits or short-term limited-duration insurance (as defined under current law).  Qualifying family members would include only the individual's spouse, any dependent of the individual, and any child (aged 26 or younger) of the individual who is enrolled in the same QHP as the individual (or other parent). A qualifying spouse must file a joint tax return with the eligible individual if married to that individual at the end of the tax year (with exceptions). A credit would be allowed for a dependent only by the individual who claims such a dependent for income-tax purposes. The credit amount would be the lesser of flat credit amounts adjusted by age for an eligible individual and that individual's qualifying family members or the amounts equal to the premiums paid by an eligible individual and that individual's qualifying family members for a QHP. The age-adjusted credit amounts for 2020 would be $2,000 for eligible individuals under the age of 30; $2,500 for those between 30 and 39 years of age; $3,000 for those between 40 and 49 years of age; $3,500 for those between 50 and 59 years of age; and $4,000 for those who aged 60 and older.  The calculation of a given family's credit would take into account the age-adjusted credit amounts applicable to the five oldest individuals only. The total credit amount would be reduced (but not below zero) by 10% of any amount that MAGI (as defined in the section) exceeds $75,000, or $150,000 for a joint tax return (MAGI limitation). The maximum tax credit amount allowed for an eligible individual and qualifying family members for a given tax year ( aggregate dollar limitation ) would be $14,000. Beginning in 2021, the age-adjusted credit amounts, the dollar amounts under the MAGI limitation, and the aggregate dollar limitation would be adjusted annually by the CPI-U, as specified. If an eligible individual or qualifying family member has a qualified small - employer health - reimbursement arrangement , the age-adjusted credit amount would be reduced (but not below zero) by the permitted benefit provided under such an arrangement. For any month in which an individual elects to receive the Health Coverage Tax Credit, authorized under IRC Section 35, such an individual would not be eligible to receive the tax credit authorized under IRC Section 36B. The current deduction allowed for health insurance premiums paid by self-employed individuals for coverage for such individuals (and their families), authorized under IRC Section 162(l), would be reduced (not below zero) by the new tax credit amounts (including advance payments) provided to such individuals. An individual who makes an erroneous claim for an excessive tax credit amount would be liable for a penalty equal to 25% of the excessive amount. Section 214 would amend ACA Section 1412, relating to the advance payment program, to require the HHS Secretary and the Treasury Secretary to promulgate regulations that they deem necessary relating to protection of taxpayer information, verification of eligibility, proper and timely payments, and program integrity.  Section 214 would go into effect beginning tax year 2020. IRC Section 223 provided for HSAs, which are tax-exempt trusts or custodial accounts established for paying the health-related expenses of an account beneficiary. HSAs are established and owned by individuals. Eligible individuals can establish and fund HSAs when they have a qualifying high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and no other health plan, with some exceptions. To be HSA-qualified, the HDHP must have a minimum deductible, it must limit out-of-pocket expenditures for covered benefits to no more than a certain maximum level, and only preventive care services can be covered prior to the deductible being met. The minimum deductible amounts and out-of-pocket limits are set by statute and adjusted for inflation. For 2017, the minimum deductible is $1,300 for single coverage and $2,600 for family coverage. The out-of-pocket limit is $6,550 for single coverage and $13,100 for family coverage. Contributions to HSAs are subject to an annual limit, which is adjusted for inflation. In 2017, the contribution limit is $3,400 for account holders enrolled in self-only coverage and $6,750 for account holders enrolled in family coverage. HSA contributions are either deductible as an above-the-line deduction or excluded from an account holder's gross income.  Section 215 would increase the HSA annual contribution limits for self-only and family coverage to match the out-of-pocket limits for HSA-qualified HDHPs for self-only and family coverage. The change would go into effect beginning in tax year 2018.  IRC Section 223 established HSAs, which are tax-exempt trusts or custodial accounts established for paying the health-related expenses of the account beneficiary. Eligible individuals can establish and contribute to HSAs when they have a qualifying HDHP and no other health plan, with some exceptions. Contributions to HSAs may be made by eligible individuals, as well as by other individuals or entities on their behalf. Thus, individuals may contribute to accounts of eligible family members, and employers may contribute to accounts of eligible employees. HSA contributions are deductible as an above-the-line deduction if made by individuals. Contributions made by employers, including through salary-reduction agreements, are excluded from income, Social Security, and Medicare taxes. The aggregate contributions to HSAs are subject to an annual limit, which is adjusted for inflation each year. In 2017, the contribution limit is $3,400 for self-only coverage and $6,750 for family coverage. Individuals aged 55 and older who are not yet eligible for Medicare are allowed to contribute an additional $1,000 each year. This \"catch-up\" contribution is not adjusted for inflation.  IRC Section 223(b)(5) established contribution rules for married couples. In the case of a married couple, if either spouse has HSA-qualified family coverage and both spouses have their own HSAs, then both spouses are treated as if they have only one family plan for purposes of the HSA contribution limit. In other words, the spouses' aggregate contributions to their respective HSAs cannot be more than the annual contribution limit for family coverage. Their annual contribution limit is first reduced by any amount paid to Archer MSAs of either spouse for the taxable year, and then the remaining contribution amount is divided equally between the spouses unless they agree on a different division. Each spouse is allowed to make catch-up contributions to his or her respective HSA, provided each spouse is eligible to do so.  Section 216 would amend IRC Section 223(b)(5) to provide that, with respect to the contribution limit to an HSA, married persons do not have to take into account whether their spouse is also covered by an HSA-qualified HDHP. In other words, spouses' aggregate contributions to their respective HSAs could be more than the annual contribution limit for family coverage. Their annual contribution limit would be reduced by any amount paid to Archer MSAs of either spouse for the taxable year, and then the remaining contribution amount would be divided equally between the spouses unless they agreed on a different division. If both spouses are eligible to make catch-up contributions before the close of the taxable year, then each spouse's catch-up contribution is included when dividing up the contribution amounts between the spouses. This provision would effectively allow both spouses to make catch-up contributions to one HSA and would apply to taxable years beginning in 2018. In general, withdrawals from HSAs are exempt from federal income taxes if used for qualified medical expenses described in IRC Section 213(d), except for health insurance. However, withdrawals from HSAs are not exempt from federal income taxes if used to pay qualified medical expenses incurred before the HSA was established. Section 217 would amend IRC Section 223(d)(2) to provide a circumstance under which HSA withdrawals can be used to pay qualified medical expenses incurred before the HSA was established. If an HSA were established within 60 days of when an individual's coverage under an HSA-qualified plan begins, then the HSA would be treated as having been established on the date the coverage begins for purposes of determining whether an HSA withdrawal is used for a qualified medical expense. Section 217 would apply to coverage beginning after December 31, 2017. ACA Section 9008 imposed an annual tax on covered entities engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs. In general, the tax is imposed on covered manufacturers and importers with aggregated branded prescription drug sales of more than $5\u00a0million to specified government programs or pursuant to coverage under these programs. Section 221 would amend ACA Section 9008 to provide that the tax would not be imposed effective calendar year 2017. ACA Section 9010 imposed an annual fee on certain health insurers beginning in 2014. The ACA fee is based on net health care premiums written by covered issuers during the year prior to the year that payment is due. The aggregate ACA fee is set at $8.0 billion in 2014, $11.3 billion in 2015 and in 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017, and $14.3 billion in 2018. After 2018, the fee is indexed to the annual rate of U.S. health insurance premium growth. Each year, the IRS apportions the fee among affected insurers based on (1) their net premiums written in the previous calendar year as a share of total net premiums written by all covered insurers and (2) their dollar value of business. Covered insurers are not subject to the fee on their first $25 million of net premiums written. The fee is imposed on 50% of net premiums above $25 million and up to $50 million, and it is imposed on 100% of net premiums in excess of $50 million.  Certain types of health insurers or insurance arrangements are not subject to the fee, including self-insured plans; voluntary employees' beneficiary associations; and federal, state, or other governmental entities, including Indian tribal governments and nonprofit entities incorporated under state law that receive more than 80% of their gross revenues from government programs that target low-income, elderly, or disabled populations. In addition, only 50% of net premiums written by tax-exempt entities are included in determining an entity's market share. ACA Section 9010(j) made these provisions effective for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ) provides a one-year moratorium on the tax for calendar year 2017. Section 222 would amend ACA Section 9010 to provide that the annual fee would not be imposed effective calendar year 2017.  ACA Section 10907 created a new excise tax on indoor tanning services. The tax is equal to 10% of the amount paid for such services. The provision is codified in Chapter 49 of the IRC. Section 231 would repeal the tax on indoor tanning services (IRC Chapter 49), effective for services performed after June 30, 2017. Generally, employers may deduct the remuneration paid to employees as \"ordinary and necessary\" business expenses under IRC Section 162, subject to any statutory limitations. ACA Section 9014(b) added a statutory limitation for certain health insurance providers. Under the provision, which is codified at IRC Section 162(m)(6), covered health insurance providers may not deduct the remuneration paid to an officer, director, or employee in excess of $500,000. Section 241 would terminate IRC Section 162(m)(6), effective beginning tax year 2017. HCERA Section 1402 imposed a net investment tax on high-income taxpayers. The tax, which is codified in Chapter 2A of Subtitle A of the IRC, applies at a rate of 3.8% to certain net investment income of individuals, estates, and trusts with income above amounts specified in the statute.  Section 251 would repeal the net investment tax (Chapter 2A of IRC Subtitle A), effective beginning tax year 2017.
