MORATORIUM ON OFFSHORE FRACTURING AND ACID WELL STIMULATION \n              TREATMENT.\n\n    Notwithstanding the terms of any lease or permit issued before the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, no person may engage in hydraulic \nfracturing or acid well stimulation treatment in the Pacific Outer \nContinental Shelf Region until the Secretary of the Interior has \npublished a report under section 3 and issued a final environmental \nimpact statement under section 4.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY OF CONDUCT AND IMPACTS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING AND ACID \n              WELL STIMULATION IN THE PACIFIC OCS REGION.\n\n    (a) In General.--To ensure the relevant agencies' data incorporate \nthe latest science and practices of the oil and gas industry, the \nSecretary of the Interior shall conduct a study of the conduct and \nimpacts of hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation treatments in \nthe Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region.\n    (b) Included Topics.--The study shall include, but shall not be \nlimited to--\n            (1) preparation of a descriptive inventory of all chemicals \n        used in offshore oil and gas development and production \n        activities in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region, \n        including chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and acid well \n        stimulation treatments;\n            (2) the volumes of chemicals used and disposed of in such \n        activities;\n            (3) the risks of a spill of such chemicals;\n            (4) an analysis of the methods by which such chemicals \n        enter the environment during hydraulic fracturing and acid well \n        stimulation treatments;\n            (5) a quantification, to the extent possible, of the amount \n        of such chemicals that enter the environment during hydraulic \n        fracturing and acid well stimulation treatments; and\n            (6) any other related matters the Secretary determines \n        necessary.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress and \npublish a report on the study conducted under this section.\n\nSEC. 4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT.\n\n    Not later than 18 months after the issuance of the report under \nsection 3, the Secretary of the Interior shall, in coordination with \nthe Environmental Protection Agency and in consultation with \nappropriate State agencies, issue an environmental impact statement \nunder section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \nU.S.C. 4332) regarding the impacts on the marine environment and public \nhealth of offshore hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation \ntreatments conducted in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region.\n\nSEC. 5. PUBLIC NOTICE.\n\n    The Secretary shall notify all relevant State and local regulatory \nagencies and publish a notice in the Federal Register--\n            (1) within 30 days after receiving any application for a \n        permit that would allow the conduct of offshore hydraulic \n        fracturing or an acid well stimulation treatment in the Pacific \n        Outer Continental Shelf Region; and\n            (2) within 30 days after the conduct of offshore hydraulic \n        fracturing or acid well stimulation treatment in such region \n        under a permit or other authorization issued by the Secretary.\n\nSEC. 6. COMPILATION AND DISCLOSURE OF ACTIVITIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall compile and \nmaintain a list of all offshore hydraulic fracturing and acid well \nstimulation treatments that have taken place, or that take place after \nthe enactment of this Act, in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf \nRegion.\n    (b) Included Information.--For each instance of offshore hydraulic \nfracturing or an acid well stimulation treatment, the Secretary shall \ninclude on the list--\n            (1) the date the offshore hydraulic fracturing or acid well \n        stimulation treatment was conducted;\n            (2) the location where the offshore hydraulic fracturing or \n        acid well stimulation treatment was conducted;\n            (3) the chemicals used, including identification of the \n        chemical constituents of mixtures, Chemical Abstracts Service \n        numbers for each chemical and constituent, material safety data \n        sheets if available, and the amount of each chemical used;\n            (4) the total volume of fluid used in the hydraulic \n        fracturing or acid well stimulation treatment;\n            (5) the volume of wastewater generated during the hydraulic \n        fracturing or acid well stimulation treatment and the manner in \n        which it was disposed of; and\n            (6) the intended purpose and results of the offshore \n        hydraulic fracturing or acid well stimulation treatments.\n    (c) Unavailable Information.--If any information listed in \nsubsection (b) is not available for a given instance of offshore \nhydraulic fracturing or acid well stimulation treatment, the Secretary \nshall note the absence of the information and provide an explanation of \nwhy the information is not available.\n    (d) Public Availability.--The Secretary shall make the list created \nunder subsection (b) available to the public, including by publishing \nit on the Internet site of the Department of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Hydraulic fracturing.--The term ``hydraulic \n        fracturing'' means an operation conducted in an individual \n        wellbore designed to increase the flow of hydrocarbons from a \n        rock formation to the wellbore through modifying the \n        permeability of reservoir rock by fracturing it, except that \n        such term does not include enhanced secondary recovery, \n        including water flooding, tertiary recovery, and other types of \n        well stimulation operations.\n            (2) Acid well stimulation treatment.--The term ``acid well \n        stimulation treatment''--\n                    (A) means a well stimulation treatment that uses, \n                in whole or in part, the application of one or more \n                acids to the well or underground geologic formation; \n                and\n                    (B) includes--\n                            (i) such stimulation treatment at any \n                        applied pressure or in combination with \n                        hydraulic fracturing treatments or other well \n                        stimulation treatments;\n                            (ii) acid treatments conducted at pressures \n                        lower than the applied pressure necessary to \n                        fracture the underground geologic formation \n                        (commonly referred to as acid matrix \n                        stimulation treatments); and\n                            (iii) acid fracturing treatments."
