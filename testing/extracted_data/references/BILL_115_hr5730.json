TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS INTEGRATION FACILITY.\n\n    (a) In General.--There is established in the Administration a \nTransportation Security Administration Systems Integration Facility \n(TSIF) for the purposes of testing and evaluating advanced \ntransportation security screening technologies related to the mission \nof the Administration. The TSIF shall--\n            (1) evaluate such technologies to enhance the security of \n        transportation systems through screening and threat mitigation \n        and detection;\n            (2) conduct testing of such technologies to support \n        identified mission needs of the Administration and to meet \n        requirements for acquisitions and procurement;\n            (3) to the extent practicable, provide original equipment \n        manufacturers with test plans to minimize requirement \n        interpretation disputes and adhere to provided test plans;\n            (4) collaborate with other technical laboratories and \n        facilities for purposes of augmenting TSIF's capabilities;\n            (5) deliver advanced transportation security screening \n        technologies that enhance the overall security of domestic \n        transportation systems; and\n            (6) to the extent practicable, provide funding and promote \n        efforts to enable participation by a small business concern (as \n        such term is described under section 3 of the Small Business \n        Act (15 U.S.C. 632)) that has an advanced technology or \n        capability but does not have adequate resources to participate \n        in testing and evaluation processes.\n    (b) Staffing and Resource Allocation.--The Administrator shall \nensure adequate staffing and resource allocations for the TSIF in a \nmanner which--\n            (1) prevents unnecessary delays in testing and evaluating \n        advanced transportation security screening technologies for \n        acquisitions and procurement determinations;\n            (2) ensures the issuance of final paperwork certification \n        does not exceed 45 days after the conclusion of such testing \n        and evaluation; and\n            (3) collaborates with technology stakeholders to close \n        capabilities gaps in transportation security.\n    (c) Timeframe.--\n            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall notify the \n        appropriate congressional committees whenever testing and \n        evaluation by TSIF of an advanced transportation security \n        screening technology under this section exceeds 180 days as \n        determined from the date on which the owner of such technology \n        turned over such technology to the Administration after \n        installation for testing and evaluation purposes, as evidenced \n        by a signed Test Readiness Notification from such owner to the \n        Administration. Such notification shall include--\n                    (A) information relating to the arrival date of \n                such technology;\n                    (B) reasons why the testing and evaluation process \n                has exceeded 180 days; and\n                    (C) an estimated time for completion of such \n                testing and evaluation.\n            (2) Retesting and evaluation.--Advanced transportation \n        security screening technology that fails testing and evaluation \n        by the TSIF may be retested and evaluated.\n    (d) Relationship to Other Department Entities and Federal \nAgencies.--The authority of the Administrator under this title shall \nnot affect the authorities or responsibilities of any officer of the \nDepartment or of any officer of any other department or agency of the \nUnited States with respect to research, development, testing, and \nevaluation, including the authorities and responsibilities of the \nUndersecretary for Science and Technology of the Department and the \nCountering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office of the Department.\n\nSEC. 4.
