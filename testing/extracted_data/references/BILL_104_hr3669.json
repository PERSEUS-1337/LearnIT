FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) although the United States Customs Service has \n        collected increased duties, merchandise fees, and revenues from \n        other commerce-related activities because of the approval and \n        implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, \n        these increased revenues have not been accompanied by Federal \n        funding for improving transportation facilities along the \n        international borders of the United States to ensure the free \n        and safe flow of trade destined for all States and regions of \n        the United States;\n            (2) because of NAFTA, all 4 States along the United States-\n        Mexico border will require significant investments in highway \n        infrastructure capacity and motor carrier safety enforcement at \n        a time when border States face extreme difficulty in meeting \n        current highway funding needs;\n            (3) the full benefits of increased international trade can \n        be realized only if delays at the borders are significantly \n        reduced; and\n            (4) the increased revenues to the general fund of the \n        Treasury described in paragraph (1) should be sufficient to \n        provide Federal funding for transportation improvements \n        required to accommodate NAFTA-generated traffic, in an amount \n        above and beyond regular Federal transportation funding \n        apportionments.\n\nSEC. 3.
