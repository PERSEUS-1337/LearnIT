FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The proportion of the population of the United States \n        that is 60 years of age or older will drastically increase in \n        the next 30 years as more than 76,000,000 baby boomers approach \n        retirement and old age.\n            (2) Each year, anywhere between 500,000 and 5,000,000 \n        seniors in the United States are abused, neglected, or \n        exploited.\n            (3) Senior abuse, neglect, and exploitation have no \n        boundaries and cross all racial, social class, gender, and \n        geographic lines.\n            (4) Millions of individuals in the United States are \n        victims of financial exploitation, including mail, \n        telemarketing, and Internet fraud, each year and many of the \n        individuals who fall prey to these crimes are seniors.\n            (5) It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of fraud \n        targeting seniors because cases are severely underreported and \n        national statistics on senior fraud do not exist.\n            (6) The Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that a senior \n        may be less likely to report fraud because the senior--\n                    (A) does not know to whom to report the fraud;\n                    (B) is ashamed to have been a victim of fraud;\n                    (C) does not know that the senior has been a victim \n                of fraud; or\n                    (D) in some cases, is concerned that relatives may \n                come to the conclusion that the senior no longer has \n                the mental capacity to take care of the financial \n                affairs of the senior.\n            (7) According to a 2011 report by the MetLife Mature Market \n        Institute, the annual financial loss by victims of senior \n        financial abuse is estimated to be at least $2,900,000,000.\n            (8) As victims of senior financial abuse, many seniors have \n        been robbed of their hard-earned life savings, and even their \n        homes, and can suffer severe emotional and health-related \n        consequences.\n            (9) Perpetrators of fraud targeting seniors often operate \n        outside the United States, reaching their victims through the \n        mail, telephone lines, and the Internet.\n            (10) The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act \n        (Public Law 106-168; 113 Stat. 1806) increased the power of the \n        United States Postal Service to protect consumers against \n        persons who use deceptive mailings, such as those featuring \n        games of chance, sweepstakes, skill contests, and facsimile \n        checks.\n            (11) During fiscal year 2007, analysts prepared more than \n        27,000 letters and informative postcards in response to mail \n        fraud complaints. During that same fiscal year, postal \n        inspectors investigated 2,909 mail fraud cases in the United \n        States and arrested 1,236 mail fraud suspects, of whom 1,118 \n        were convicted. Postal inspectors also reported 162 \n        telemarketing fraud investigations with 83 arrests and 61 \n        convictions resulting from the investigations.\n            (12) In 2000, the Special Committee on Aging of the Senate \n        reported that, each year, consumers lose approximately \n        $40,000,000,000 to telemarketing fraud and estimated that \n        approximately 10 percent of the 14,000 telemarketing firms in \n        the United States were fraudulent.\n            (13) Some researchers estimate that only one in 10,000 \n        fraud victims reports the crime to the authorities.\n            (14) A 2003 report by AARP, Inc., found that the crime of \n        telemarketing fraud is grossly underreported among senior \n        victims, but that individuals who are properly counseled by \n        trained peer volunteers are less likely to fall victim to \n        fraudulent practices.\n            (15) The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that the \n        threat of fraud to seniors is growing and changing. Many \n        younger baby boomers have considerable computer skills and \n        criminals are modifying their targeting techniques by using not \n        only traditional telephone calls and mass mailings, but also \n        online scams like phishing and e-mail spamming.\n            (16) The Internet Crime Complaint Center is a partnership \n        between the National White Collar Crime Center and the Federal \n        Bureau of Investigation that serves as a vehicle to receive, \n        develop, and refer criminal complaints regarding cybercrime. \n        The Internet Crime Complaint Center processed more than 219,553 \n        complaints of Internet crime in 2007 and, from these \n        submissions, the center referred 90,008 complaints of Internet \n        crime, representing a total dollar loss of $239,090,000, to \n        Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies in the \n        United States for further consideration.\n            (17) Consumer awareness is the best protection from fraud.\n\nSEC. 3.
