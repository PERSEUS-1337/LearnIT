FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Soledad Canyon area has been used to mine \n        construction aggregate resources since the 1960s.\n            (2) In 1987, the State of California classified Soledad \n        Canyon as a ``regionally significant construction aggregate \n        resource area''.\n            (3) The construction sand and gravel industry is valued at \n        more than $5,900,000,000 by the United States Geological \n        Survey, with an estimated 4,000 companies performing 6,400 \n        construction sand and gravel operations in 50 States. \n        California leads the Nation in gross tonnage of sand and gravel \n        mined.\n            (4) Sand and gravel are estimated to be used in accordance \n        with the following percentages:\n                    (A) 41 percent for concrete aggregates.\n                    (B) 25 percent for road base, coverings, and \n                stabilization.\n                    (C) 13 percent as construction fill.\n                    (D) 12 percent for asphalt.\n                    (E) 4 percent for plaster.\n                    (F) 5 percent for miscellaneous products, including \n                filtration and railroad ballasts, bricks, and pipes.\n            (5) Two privately held valid Federal contracts, numbered \n        CA-20139 and CA-22901, issued under the Act of July 31, 1947 \n        (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.; 61 Stat 681; commonly known as the \n        Materials Act of 1947), authorize the extraction of \n        approximately 56,000,000 tons of sand and gravel from the \n        Federal mineral estate in lands located in Soledad Canyon \n        adjacent to the city of Santa Clarita, California.\n            (6) Those Federal contracts were awarded in 1990 to Transit \n        Mixed Concrete. Southdown, the parent company of Transit Mixed \n        Concrete, was acquired by CEMEX in 2000, resulting in CEMEX \n        holding the Federal contracts.\n            (7) The Bureau of Land Management approved a mining plan of \n        operations and prepared a draft environmental impact statement \n        with respect to the Soledad Canyon Mine, which was released on \n        May 6, 1999. The environmental impact statement was \n        subsequently modified to address growing concerns among Santa \n        Clarita residents about the impact mining operations in Soledad \n        Canyon had on air quality and health, truck traffic, and \n        declining property values in Santa Clarita.\n            (8) The final environmental impact statement was released \n        to the public on June 2, 2000, with a list of eight \n        alternatives for mining the Soledad Canyon site.\n            (9) The county of Los Angeles was required, with respect to \n        mining in Soledad Canyon, under the California Environmental \n        Quality Act (Cal. Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq.) \n        to prepare an environmental impact report to comply with the \n        California Surface Mining Reclamation Act (Cal. Public \n        Resources Code, section 2710 et seq.). The final environmental \n        impact report was released in April 2001, but the County Board \n        of Supervisors voted to deny a permit under such Act (Cal. \n        Public Resources Code, section 2710 et seq.) in early 2002, \n        citing the right and responsibility of the county to impose \n        reasonable environmental and resource protection and regulation \n        on mining in Soledad Canyon.\n            (10) Numerous lawsuits were filed between 2002 and 2004 \n        involving the city of Santa Clarita, the county of Los Angeles, \n        the Center for Biological Diversity, and CEMEX.\n            (11) Exhibit H to the Consent Decree resulting from the \n        settlement of CEMEX Inc. v. County of Los Angeles, filed on May \n        20, 2004, in the United States District Court for the Central \n        District of California, Western Division, contains the \n        mitigation agreement between CEMEX and the county of Los \n        Angeles (entitled ``Settlement Project Conditions''), which \n        lists 40 conditions that CEMEX is required to meet in order to \n        mitigate the environmental, health, traffic, endangered \n        species, and safety concerns raised by the county, local \n        residents, and the city of Santa Clarita.\n            (12) Congressman Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon of California \n        has introduced the following bills with respect to the Soledad \n        Canyon Mine:\n                    (A) H.R. 3060 (106th Congress) to withdraw \n                specified lands from the operation of Federal mining \n                and mineral leasing laws and to nullify any existing \n                permits issued on such lands.\n                    (B) H.R. 679 (107th Congress) to reintroduce H.R. \n                3060 from the 106th Congress.\n                    (C) H.R. 3529 (108th Congress), the Soledad Canyon \n                Mine Lease Cancellation Act, to cancel two mining \n                permits for the Soledad Canyon Mine and to prohibit the \n                Secretary of the Interior from issuing permits for \n                mining above historical levels in Soledad Canyon.\n                    (D) H.R. 5471 (109th Congress), the Soledad Canyon \n                Mine Leases Adjustment Act--\n                            (i) to cancel two mining permits for the \n                        Soledad Canyon Mine;\n                            (ii) to direct the Secretary of the \n                        Interior to provide additional financial and \n                        mineral production opportunities in exchange \n                        for the economic value invested to date on the \n                        two permits;
