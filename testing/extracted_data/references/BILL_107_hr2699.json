FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals were convened \n        following World War II, the United States has been the world's \n        leading proponent of international justice. Today, the United \n        States is pursuing justice for the architects of genocide and \n        other gross crimes in Cambodia, East Timor, Rwanda, Sierra \n        Leone, and the former Yugoslavia.\n            (2) Bringing the perpetrators of genocide, war crimes, and \n        crimes against humanity to justice is consistent with United \n        States national interests and fundamental values.\n            (3) Such crimes cause massive humanitarian tragedies, and \n        refugee emergencies, that often significantly affect United \n        States national interests.\n            (4) The International Criminal Court will be a permanent \n        court designed to investigate and bring to justice individuals \n        who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. \n        The International Criminal Court will be established under the \n        Rome Statute, a treaty adopted in Rome on July 17, 1998, at a \n        United Nations diplomatic conference.\n            (5) On December 31, 2000, the United States signed the Rome \n        Statute. As of June 28, 2001, 139 countries have signed the \n        treaty and 36 countries have ratified it. Every member of the \n        European Union and 18 of 19 members of the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization have signed the Rome Statute.\n            (6) United States servicemembers and United States \n        officials involved in national security affairs deserve the \n        full protection of the United States Government and should not \n        be the subject of frivolous or politically motivated \n        prosecutions by the International Criminal Court or any other \n        foreign tribunal.\n            (7) United States negotiators succeeded in ensuring that \n        the Rome Statute contains numerous safeguards designed to \n        protect United States citizens, including due process rights \n        that former State Department Legal Adviser Monroe Leigh has \n        called ``more detailed and comprehensive'' than those contained \n        in the United States Bill of Rights. The Department of Justice \n        has never objected to the Rome Statute on constitutional \n        grounds.\n            (8) Under the Rome Statute, the International Criminal \n        Court must defer to United States jurisdiction in cases \n        involving United States citizens or service personnel. The \n        International Criminal Court may proceed in such cases only if \n        it determines that the United States has decided not to \n        prosecute the person concerned and that the decision resulted \n        from the unwillingness or inability of the United States \n        genuinely to prosecute the matter.\n            (9) Upon signing the Rome Statute, President Clinton stated \n        he did not intend to submit the Rome Statute in its present \n        form to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification. The \n        Bush Administration has also stated that it will not seek the \n        Senate's advice and consent to ratification of the Rome \n        Statute.\n            (10) Many issues important to United States interests are \n        still being negotiated by signatories to the Rome Statute. \n        Continued United States engagement with the International \n        Criminal Court can help protect United States interests.\n\nSEC. 3.
