FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Prostate cancer has reached epidemic proportions, \n        particularly among African-American men, and strikes and kills \n        men in numbers comparable to the number of women who lose their \n        lives from breast cancer.\n            (2) Life-saving breakthroughs in screening, diagnosis, and \n        treatment of breast cancer resulted from the development of \n        advanced imaging technologies led by the Federal Government.\n            (3) Men should have accurate and affordable prostate cancer \n        screening exams and minimally-invasive treatment tools, similar \n        to what women have for breast cancer.\n            (4) While it is important for men to take advantage of \n        current prostate cancer screening techniques, a recent NCI-\n        funded study demonstrated that the most common available \n        methods of detecting prostate cancer (PSA blood test and \n        physical exams) are not foolproof, causing numerous false \n        alarms and false reassurances.\n            (5) The absence of advanced imaging technologies for \n        prostate cancer causes the lack of accurate information \n        critical for clinical decisions, resulting in missed cancers \n        and lost lives, as well as unnecessary and costly medical \n        procedures, with related complications.\n            (6) With prostate imaging tools, men and their families \n        would face less physical, psychological, financial and \n        emotional trauma and billions of dollars could be saved in \n        private and public health care systems.\n\nSEC. 3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER IMAGING \n              TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n    (a) Expansion of Research.--The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary''), acting through \nthe Director of the National Institutes of Health and in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Defense, shall carry out a program to expand and \nintensify research to develop innovative advanced imaging technologies \nfor prostate cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment comparable to \nstate-of-the-art mammography technologies.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section, $100,000,000 for each of fiscal \nyears 2008 through 2012.\n\nSEC. 4. PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGN.\n\n    (a) National Campaign.--The Secretary shall carry out a national \ncampaign to increase the awareness and knowledge of Americans with \nrespect to the need for prostate cancer screening and for improved \ndetection technologies.\n    (b) Requirements.--The national campaign conducted under subsection \n(a) shall include--\n            (1) roles for the Health Resources Services Administration, \n        the Office on Minority Health of the Department of Health and \n        Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n        and the Office of Minority Health of the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention; and\n            (2) the development and distribution of written educational \n        materials, and the development and placing of public service \n        announcements, that are intended to encourage men to seek \n        prostate cancer screening and to create awareness of the need \n        for improved imaging technologies for prostate cancer detection \n        and minimally invasive treatment.\n    (c) Racial Disparities.--In developing the national campaign under \nsubsection (a), the Secretary shall recognize and address the racial \ndisparities in the incidences of prostate cancer and mortality rates \nwith respect to such disease.\n    (d) Grants.--The Secretary shall establish a program to award \ngrants to nonprofit private entities to enable such entities to test \nalternative outreach and education strategies to increase the awareness \nand knowledge of Americans with respect to the need for prostate cancer \nscreening and improved imaging technologies.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section, $10,000,000 for each of fiscal \nyears 2008 through 2012.\n\nSEC. 5. IMPROVING PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING BLOOD TESTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary \nof Defense, shall carry out research to develop an improved prostate \ncancer screening blood test using in-vitro detection.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section, $20,000,000 for each of fiscal \nyears 2008 through 2012.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE.\n\n    (a) Report and Strategy.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report \nthat details the strategy of the Secretary for implementing the \nrequirements of this Act and the status of such efforts.\n    (b) Full Compliance.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall \nsubmit to Congress a report that--\n            (1) contains assurances that the provisions of this Act are \n        fully implemented; and\n            (2) certifies such compliance, or in the case of a Federal \n        agency that has not complied, an explanation as to such failure \n        to comply."
