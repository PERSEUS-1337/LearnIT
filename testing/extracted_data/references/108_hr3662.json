FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--\n            (1) The majority of States are facing their worst fiscal \n        crisis since World War II. Soaring healthcare costs are \n        deepening the crisis. Healthcare costs grew an average of 11 \n        percent in 2002 and are expected to grow to 13 percent in \n        fiscal year 2004. Healthcare spending currently accounts for \n        approximately 30 percent of total State budgets.\n            (2) As the economy continues to struggle, State revenues \n        continue to fall dramatically while spending pressure has \n        grown. Thirty-seven States reduced fiscal 2003 enacted budgets \n        by nearly $14,500,000,000, the largest spending cut since 1979.\n            (3) State drug expenditures for public employees, \n        dependents and retirees, medicaid beneficiaries, and the \n        uninsured are rising each year. As more Americans lose jobs and \n        health care coverage for themselves and their dependents, \n        States' share of medicaid costs grew by 13 percent in fiscal \n        year 2002. This growth is expected to rise by an estimated 8 \n        percent in fiscal year 2003 and 4.9 percent in fiscal year 2004 \n        based on governors' fiscal 2004 budget proposals.\n            (4) In February 2002, the National Governor's Association \n        passed a resolution urging Congress to review Federal laws \n        which may be contributing to the ``high cost of prescription \n        drugs''.\n            (5) Several States and localities are currently seeking to \n        reimport drugs from Canada and other foreign countries in an \n        attempt to lower prescription drug costs.\n            (6) Foreign nations and Federally funded health care \n        programs use purchasing power to obtain prescription drugs at \n        low prices. States and localities are not legally allowed to \n        reimport prescription drugs. This Act will provide an \n        appropriate alternative by allowing states and localities to \n        purchase prescription drugs domestically at prices roughly \n        equivalent to those available in foreign nations and Federally \n        funded health care programs.\n            (7) Implementation of the policy set forth in this Act may \n        reduce prices for brand name prescription drugs for many States \n        and localities by up to 40 percent.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to make prescription drugs \navailable to States and local governments and residents thereof at \nprices that are substantially lower than current United States prices.\n\nSEC. 3. PARTICIPATING MANUFACTURERS.\n\n    (a) Availability of Drugs for Purchase.--\n            (1) In general.--Each participating manufacturer of a \n        covered outpatient drug shall make available for purchase in \n        whole or in part by each State for the benefit of residents \n        within the State whose cost of covered outpatient drugs are \n        paid for by the State through a group health program, a retiree \n        health program, a State or local pharmaceutical assistance \n        program, or other similar program (including, to the extent \n        provided under subsection (f)(2), a State medicaid program), \n        such covered outpatient drug in the amount described in \n        subsection (b) at the price described in subsection (c).\n            (2) Direct purchases by agents.--The requirements of \n        paragraph (1) shall apply in the case of purchases by an \n        organization or agent of the State that directly purchases \n        covered outpatient prescription drugs on behalf of the State, \n        or on behalf of a county or municipality of such State, for \n        residents described in such paragraph.\n    (b) Description of Amount of Drugs.--The amount of a covered \noutpatient drug that a participating manufacturer shall make available \nfor purchase by a State or local government (or agent thereof) is an \namount equal to the aggregate amount of the covered outpatient drug \nsold or distributed to residents described in subsection (a) in that \nState.\n    (c) Description of Price.--\n            (1) In general.--The price at which a participating \n        manufacturer shall make a covered outpatient drug available for \n        purchase by a pharmacy is a price no greater than the \n        manufacturer's average foreign price.\n            (2) Handling fee.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n        construed to prevent a pharmacy from assessing a reasonable (as \n        determined by the Secretary in consultation with pharmacy \n        stakeholders) handling fee in connection with the provision of \n        covered outpatient prescription drugs to residents described in \n        subsection (a)(1).\n    (d) Enforcement.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary, any wholesaler or retailer \n        in the United States, or any resident described in subsection \n        (a)(1) that is aggrieved by a violation of this Act may bring a \n        civil action in a United States district court against a \n        manufacturer or other person that violates this Act for an \n        order enjoining the violation and awarding damages in the \n        amount that is equal to 3 times the amount of the value of the \n        difference between--\n                    (A) the price that the manufacturer or other person \n                sold a covered outpatient prescription drug to the \n                wholesaler, retailer, or individual; and\n                    (B) the manufacturer's average foreign price for \n                the prescription drug.\n            (2) Repeat violations.--The United States shall debar a \n        manufacturer of drugs or biologicals that commits repeated \n        violations of the provisions of this Act.\n    (e) Application to Local Governments.--The provisions of this \nsection shall apply with respect to the purchase of covered outpatient \ndrugs by local governments if such purchase was made for the benefit of \nindividuals within the jurisdiction of the local government whose cost \nof covered outpatient drugs are paid for by the local government (or \nagent thereof) through a group health program, a retiree health \nprogram, a local pharmaceutical assistance program, or other similar \nprogram, in the same manner as such provisions apply to States.\n    (f) Relation to Medicaid Rebate Agreement.--A State, with respect \nto its provision of medical assistance for covered outpatient drugs \nunder title XIX of the Social Security Act, may elect for a year (or \nother period specified by the Secretary) either of the following to \napply (and such election shall apply to all such covered outpatient \ndrugs under such title):\n            (1) Continuation of rebate agreement.--\n                    (A) In general.--The provisions of section 1927 of \n                such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8) shall continue to apply.\n                    (B) Disregard of manufacturer's average foreign \n                price in determining best price under rebate \n                agreement.--The price under subsection (c) at which a \n                participating manufacturer makes a covered outpatient \n                drug available under this Act shall be disregarded for \n                purposes of determining the best price under a rebate \n                agreement under such section 1927 of the Social \n                Security Act.\n            (2) Use of manufacturer's foreign price.--The provisions of \n        such section do not apply and such drugs shall be made \n        available for purposes of such title in the quantities under \n        subsection (b) and at the prices specified under subsection \n        (c).\n    (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to prevent a State or local government from implementing \nprograms that provide for the purchase and distribution of outpatient \ndrugs at prices that are lower than the price provided for under \nsubsection (c).\n\nSEC. 4.
