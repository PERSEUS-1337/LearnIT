FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Small businesses are critical to the economic recovery \n        of the United States.\n            (2) As a consequence of the recession that began in \n        December 2007, even fundamentally healthy small businesses have \n        been unable to access the credit they need.\n            (3) Data released by the Federal Deposit Insurance \n        Corporation indicate that lending to small businesses fell in \n        2009 by ``the largest percentage decline since 1942''.\n            (4) Limited access to credit has forced many small business \n        owners to use their personal assets, including retirement \n        savings, to ensure that their enterprises survive.\n            (5) Such actions have helped to mitigate further job \n        losses.\n            (6) While it is appropriate for Congress to resist calls to \n        allow individual retirement account holders to withdraw loans \n        during normal economic times, the current recession represents \n        an extraordinary situation during which extraordinary measures \n        must be taken.\n            (7) A targeted and temporary suspension of penalties for \n        loans made from retirement accounts will help small businesses \n        recover and provide a direct infusion of funds into the \n        economy.\n\nSEC. 3. LOANS FROM INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT PLANS FOR CERTAIN SMALL \n              BUSINESS EXPENSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subsection (e) of section 408 of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 (relating to tax treatment of accounts and \nannuities) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(7) Temporary exception for loans from individual \n        retirement plans for
