ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONTROLS ON COMPUTERS.\n\n    Section 4 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. \n2403) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(h) Review of Export Controls on Computer Equipment and \nTechnology.--\n            ``(1) In general.--In order to ensure that requirements of \n        validated licenses and other licenses authorizing multiple \n        exports are periodically removed as computer equipment, \n        computer communications and networking equipment, computer \n        software, and related technology, that are subject to such \n        requirements become obsolete with respect to the specific \n        objectives of the export controls requiring such licenses, the \n        Secretary shall conduct periodic reviews of such controls. The \n        Secretary shall complete such a review not later than 6 months \n        after the date of the enactment of this subsection, and not \n        later than the end of each 1-year period thereafter.\n            ``(2) Review elements.--In conducting each review under \n        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall do the following with \n        respect to the export controls requiring a license described in \n        paragraph (1):\n                    ``(A) Objectives of control.--The Secretary shall \n                identify the specific objectives of the export \n                controls, for the 12-month period beginning on the date \n                on which the review is completed, for each country for \n                which a validated license is required. When an \n                objective of an export control is to defer the \n                development of a specific capability in such country, \n                the Secretary shall specify for what period of time the \n                controls are expected to defer such capability.\n                    ``(B) Quantity and performance.--The Secretary \n                shall estimate, for the 12-month period described in \n                subparagraph (A), the quantity and performance \n                (measured in Composite Theoretical Performance or other \n                relevant performance metrics) of computer systems that \n                must be obtained by each country for which a validated \n                license is required in order to defeat the objectives \n                of the export controls.\n                    ``(C) Availability to controlled destinations.--The \n                Secretary shall evaluate the effectiveness of the \n                export controls in achieving their specific objectives, \n                including explicit descriptions of the availability, \n                during the 12-month period described in subparagraph \n                (A), to controlled countries of computer equipment, \n                computer communications and networking equipment, \n                computer software, and related technology on which the \n                export controls are in effect--\n                            ``(i) from sources that do not control the \n                        export of such items, and from sources from \n                        which no effective export controls on such \n                        items exist;\n                            ``(ii) as a result of actual or potential \n                        diversion, including potential diversion of \n                        software over international computer or \n                        telephone networks;\n                            ``(iii) as a result of export license \n                        authorizations from countries other than the \n                        United States;\n                            ``(iv) as a result of indigenous production \n                        in controlled countries; and\n                            ``(v) as a result of United States \n                        regulations permitting exports to such \n                        countries of items with minimal United States \n                        content by value.\n                    ``(D) Economic impact.--The Secretary shall \n                evaluate the economic impact, during the 12-month \n                period described in subparagraph (A), of the export \n                controls on exporting companies, including estimates of \n                lost sales, loss in market share, and administrative \n                overhead.\n            ``(3) Increase in thresholds.--After completing each review \n        under this subsection, the Secretary shall increase, if \n        warranted by the findings of the review, the following export \n        control thresholds, consistent with the obligations of the \n        United States under bilateral and multilateral agreements:\n                    ``(A) The performance levels at which computer \n                systems are eligible for delivery under a distribution \n                license.\n                    ``(B) The performance levels at which computer \n                systems may be shipped under a general license to \n                countries other than controlled countries.\n                    ``(C) The performance levels defining a \n                `supercomputer'.\n                    ``(D) The performance levels at which a validated \n                license is required for the export to a controlled \n                country of computer systems and peripherals, software, \n                parts, and communications equipment normally supplied \n                with such computer systems.\n        In any recommendation or publication for such increase, the \n        Secretary shall include the specific rationale for the \n        increase.\n            ``(4) Default provisions.--If on the date by which a review \n        under this subsection must be completed, the review is not \n        completed or a report on the review has not been transmitted to \n        the Congress under paragraph (5), the performance levels \n        described in paragraph (3) then in effect, stated in terms of \n        Composite Theoretical Performance or other relevant performance \n        metrics, shall double, effective 90 days from that date.
