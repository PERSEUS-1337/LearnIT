FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nearly \\1/3\\ of American women report being physically \n        or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in \n        their lives.\n            (2) Fifty-six percent of women who experience any partner \n        violence are diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Twenty-nine \n        percent of all women who attempt suicide were battered, 37 \n        percent of battered women have symptoms of depression, 46 \n        percent have symptoms of anxiety disorder, and 45 percent \n        experience post-traumatic stress disorder.\n            (3) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely \n        to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including \n        depression, anxiety, and violence toward peers. They are also \n        more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run \n        away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit \n        sexual assault crimes.\n            (4) Each year, at least 6 percent of all pregnant women, \n        equal to about 240,000 pregnant women, are battered by the men \n        in their lives.\n            (5) Complications of pregnancy, including low weight gain, \n        anemia, and first and second trimester bleeding are \n        significantly higher for abused women, as are maternal rates of \n        depression, suicide attempts, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit \n        drug use.\n            (6) A major domestic violence program in St. Petersburg, \n        Florida, reports that 70 percent of the families that come to \n        their shelter have substance abuse in their family--either the \n        woman, her children, or her batterer. One study of a low-income \n        Chicago neighborhood found that 42 percent of women \n        experiencing severe abuse in the past 12 months reported \n        depression.\n\nSEC. 3.
