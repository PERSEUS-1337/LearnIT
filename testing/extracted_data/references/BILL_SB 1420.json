    "title": "SB 1420",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Improving occupational health and safety in all lines of work is a priority for the State of California, and that focus should extend to child care caregivers.\n(b) Child care caregivers are at risk for occupational health and safety risks on the job, including from toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical hazards such as lifting and bending. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, child care workers have musculoskeletal injury rates comparable to those of industrial truck and tractor operators and construction equipment operators.\n(c) The federal Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (CCDBG) (42 U.S.C. Sec. 9857 et. seq) was reauthorized in 2014 (Public Law 113-186). The changes to the CCDBG include a requirement that caregivers complete preservice or orientation training on topics including infectious disease prevention and control, building and physical premises safety, emergency preparedness and disaster response, and handling/storage of hazardous materials and disposal of biocontaminants. Requiring caregivers to complete occupational health and safety training will satisfy several of the new CCDBG health and safety requirements and will also help caregivers with child development permits satisfy the 105 hours of professional growth activities necessary to renew their permits. The training will also improve health and safety for caregivers and the children in their care, and will therefore benefit the families of the children served and the economy of the state.\nSEC. 2.\nArticle 19.5 (commencing with Section 8430) is added to Chapter 2 of Part 6 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code, to read:\nArticle  19.5.
