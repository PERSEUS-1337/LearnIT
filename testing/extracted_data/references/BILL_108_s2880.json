FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Given the increasing costs of health care in the United \n        States, there is a compelling public interest in ensuring that \n        there is full and free competition in the medical device and \n        hospital supply industries so that the best and safest products \n        are available to physicians and patients at a competitive \n        price.\n            (2) By aggregating purchases, hospital group purchasing can \n        reduce the cost of acquiring medical equipment and hospital \n        supplies so long as such purchasing is done in a manner \n        consistent with antitrust law and free competition.\n            (3) Some practices engaged in by certain hospital group \n        purchasing organizations have had the effect of reducing \n        competition in the medical device and hospital supply \n        industries by denying some suppliers and device makers access \n        to the hospital marketplace.\n            (4) There is a compelling public interest in having the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with \n        the Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission, engage in \n        oversight and supervision of the current Federal health care \n        program anti-kickback exemption (also known as the safe harbor) \n        provided to group purchasing organizations under subparagraphs \n        (C) and (E) of section 1128B(b)(3) of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)(3)). This oversight and supervision \n        should ensure that the safe harbor does not shield conduct that \n        harms competition in the hospital supply and medical device \n        industries.\n\nSEC. 3. ENSURING FULL AND FREE COMPETITION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1128B(b)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act \n(42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)(3)(C)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (i), by striking ``, and'' at the end and \n        inserting a semicolon; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new clauses:\n                            ``(iii) the contracting, business, and \n                        ethical practices of the person are not \n                        inconsistent with regulations promulgated by \n                        the Secretary pursuant to subsection (g)(1);\n                            ``(iv) the person has been certified by the \n                        Secretary under subsection (g)(2) to be in \n                        compliance with the regulations promulgated \n                        pursuant to subsection (g)(1); and\n                            ``(v) the amount to be paid the person does \n                        not exceed a total of 3 percent of the purchase \n                        price of the goods or services provided by that \n                        vendor;''.\n    (b) Regulations.--Section 1128B of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1320a-7b) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubsection:\n    ``(g)(1)(A) The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral and the Federal Trade Commission, shall, not later than 1 year \nafter the date of enactment of the Medical Device Competition Act of \n2004, issue proposed regulations, and shall, not later than 2 years \nafter such date of enactment, promulgate final regulations, specifying \ncontracting, business, and ethical practices of persons described in \nparagraph (4) that are contrary to antitrust law and competitive \nprinciples, to ethical standards, or to the goal of ensuring that \nproducts necessary for proper patient care or worker safety are readily \navailable to physicians, health care workers, and patients.\n    ``(B) In issuing and promulgating regulations under subparagraph \n(A), the Secretary shall take into account--\n            ``(i) the compelling public policy goals of--\n                    ``(I) encouraging competition and innovation in the \n                hospital supply and medical device markets; and\n                    ``(II) reducing the cost of health care as a result \n                of aggregating buying power;\n            ``(ii) the potentially detrimental impact of certain \n        anticompetitive contracting practices;
