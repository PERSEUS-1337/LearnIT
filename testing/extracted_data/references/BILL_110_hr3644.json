FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) catastrophic hazards, including tornadoes, earthquakes, \n        volcanoes, landslides, tsunamis, flooding, and hurricanes, \n        directly affect hundreds of millions of people each year;\n            (2) during the 1990s, 2,800 natural disasters killed more \n        than 500,000 people and directly affected 1,300,000,000 people \n        worldwide;\n            (3) property damage from natural catastrophes has \n        dramatically increased in recent decades, roughly doubling \n        every seven years--a 14-fold increase over the past 40 years;\n            (4) risk costs have particularly soared in coastal areas, \n        where hurricane frequency and severity has significantly \n        increased, along with home values and building costs;\n            (5) increased risk costs are being reflected in increased \n        catastrophe insurance and reinsurance costs;\n            (6) an inefficient legal and regulatory environment in some \n        States has further exacerbated insurance cost increases, \n        including through ineffective price controls, restrictions on \n        capital movement, sub-optimal solvency regulation, and \n        duplicative or unnecessary regulation;\n            (7) consumers further suffer from temporary rate and \n        availability volatility after major catastrophes while the \n        marketplace adjusts to the losses;\n            (8) government catastrophe mitigation requirements have \n        been sub-optimal, sometimes ineffective, and uncoordinated;\n            (9) some State efforts to reduce insurance prices in \n        catastrophe-prone areas have sometimes reduced long-term \n        availability and competitive affordability of coverage, as well \n        as subsidized excessive development in environmentally \n        sensitive areas at the expense of taxpayers;\n            (9) several proposals have been introduced in the Congress \n        to address the affordability of natural catastrophe insurance, \n        but there is little consensus on the appropriate role of the \n        Federal Government in facilitating the private insurance \n        marketplace while avoiding cross-subsidies; and\n            (10) therefore, an efficient and effective approach to \n        assessing natural catastrophe risk management and insurance is \n        to establish a nonpartisan commission to study the management \n        of natural catastrophe risk, and to require such commission to \n        report to the Congress on its findings before the next \n        hurricane season begins.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a nonpartisan Commission on Natural \nCatastrophe Risk Management and Insurance (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.

DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n    The Commission shall examine and report to the Congress on the \nnatural catastrophe insurance marketplace, including the extent to \nwhich insurance costs and availability are affected by the factors \ndescribed in section 2, which factors the Federal Government can and \nshould address to increase catastrophe insurance availability and \ncompetitiveness, and which actions the Federal Government can undertake \nto achieve this goal without requiring a long-term cross-subsidy from \nthe taxpayers.
