The consolidation may be physical or operational. The state board may also order the extension of service to an area within a disadvantaged community that does not have access to an adequate supply of safe drinking water so long as the extension of service is an interim extension of service in preparation for consolidation.

Any domestic well owner within the consolidation or extended service area who does not provide written consent shall be ineligible, until the consent is provided, for any future water-related grant funding from the state other than funding to mitigate a well failure, disaster, or other emergency.\n(9) (A) Hold at least one public meeting at the initiation of this process in a place as close as feasible to the affected areas. The state board shall make reasonable efforts to provide a 30-day notice of the meeting to the ratepayers, renters, and property owners to receive water service through service extension or in the area of the subsumed water system and all affected local government agencies and drinking water service providers. The meeting shall provide representatives of the potentially subsumed water system, affected ratepayers, renters, property owners, and the potentially receiving water system an opportunity to present testimony. The meeting shall provide an opportunity for public comment.\n(B) An initial public meeting shall not be required for a potentially subsumed area that is served only by domestic wells.\n(c) Upon expiration of the deadline set by the state board pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b), the state board shall do the following:\n(1) Consult with the potentially receiving water system and the potentially subsumed water system, if any.\n(2) (A) Conduct a public hearing, in a location as close as feasible to the affected communities.\n(B) The state board shall make reasonable efforts to provide a 30-day notice of the hearing to the ratepayers, renters, and property owners to receive water service through service extension or in the area of the subsumed water system and to all affected local government agencies and drinking water service providers.\n(C) The hearing shall provide representatives of the potentially subsumed water system, affected ratepayers, renters, property owners, and the potentially receiving water system an opportunity to present testimony.\n(D) The hearing shall provide an opportunity for public comment.\n(d) Before ordering consolidation or extension of service, the state board shall find all of the following:\n(1) The potentially subsumed water system has consistently failed to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water.\n(2) All reasonable efforts to negotiate consolidation or extension of service were made.\n(3) Consolidation of the receiving water system and subsumed water system or extension of service is appropriate and technically and economically feasible.\n(4) There is no pending local agency formation commission process that is likely to resolve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.\n(5) Concerns regarding water rights and water contracts of the subsumed and receiving water systems have been adequately addressed.\n(6) Consolidation or extension of service is the most effective and cost-effective means to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water.\n(7) The capacity of the proposed interconnection needed to accomplish the consolidation is limited to serving the current customers of the subsumed water system.\n(e) Upon ordering consolidation or extension of service, the state board shall do all of the following:\n(1) As necessary and appropriate, make funds available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the receiving water system for the costs of completing the consolidation or extension of service, including, but not limited to, replacing any capacity lost as a result of the consolidation or extension of service, providing additional capacity needed as a result of the consolidation or extension of service, and legal fees. Funding pursuant to this paragraph is available for the general purpose of providing financial assistance for the infrastructure needed for the consolidation or extension of service and does not need to be specific to each individual consolidation project. The state board shall provide appropriate financial assistance for the infrastructure needed for the consolidation or extension of service. The state board\u2019s existing financial assistance guidelines and policies shall be the basis for the financial assistance.\n(2) Ensure payment of standard local agency formation commission fees caused by state board-ordered consolidation or extension of service.\n(3) Adequately compensate the owners of a privately owned subsumed water system for the fair market value of the system, as determined by the Public Utilities Commission or the state board.\n(4) Coordinate with the appropriate local agency formation commission and other relevant local agencies to facilitate the change of organization or reorganization.\n(f) (1) For the purposes of this section, the consolidated water system shall not increase charges on existing customers of the receiving water system solely as a consequence of the consolidation or extension of service unless the customers receive a corresponding benefit.\n(2) For purposes of this section, fees or charges imposed on a customer of a subsumed water system shall not exceed the cost of consolidating the water system with a receiving system or the extension of service to the area.\n(g) Division 3 (commencing with Section 56000) of Title 5 of the Government Code shall not apply to an action taken by the state board pursuant to this section.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 116686 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n116686.\n(a) (1) To provide affordable, safe drinking water to disadvantaged communities and to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, the state board may do both of the following, if sufficient funding is available and if the state board finds that consolidation with another system or extension of service from another system is either not appropriate or not technically and economically feasible:\n(A) (i) Contract with an administrator to provide administrative and managerial services to a designated public water system to assist the designated public water system with the provision of an adequate and affordable supply of safe drinking water.\n(ii) To fulfill the requirements of this section, the state board may contract with more than one administrator, but only one administrator may be assigned to provide services to a given designated public water system.\n(iii) An administrator may provide administrative and managerial services to more than one designated public water system.\n(B) Order the designated public water system to accept administrative and managerial services, including full management and control, from an administrator selected by the state board.\n(2) In performing its duties pursuant to paragraph (1), the state board may use criteria from the policy handbook adopted pursuant to Section 116760.43.\n(b) Before the state board determines that a public water system is a designated public water system, the state board shall do both of the following:\n(1) Provide the public water system with notice and an opportunity to show either of the following:\n(A) That the public water system has not consistently failed to provide an adequate and affordable supply of safe drinking water.\n(B) That the public water system has taken steps to timely address its failure to provide an adequate and affordable supply of safe drinking water.\n(2) (A) Conduct a public meeting in a location as close as feasible to the affected community.\n(B) The state board shall make reasonable efforts to provide a 30-day notice of the meeting to affected ratepayers, renters, and property owners.\n(C) Representatives of the public water system, affected ratepayers, renters, and property owners shall be provided an opportunity to present testimony at the meeting.\n(D) The meeting shall provide an opportunity for public comment.\n(c) The state board shall make financial assistance available to an administrator for a designated public water system, as appropriate and to the extent that funding is available.\n(d) An administrator may do any of the following:\n(1) Expend available moneys for capital infrastructure improvements that the designated public water system needs to provide an adequate and affordable supply of safe drinking water.\n(2) Set and collect user water rates and fees, subject to approval by the state board.
