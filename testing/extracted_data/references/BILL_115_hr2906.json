FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Bureau of Health Workforce, the United \n        States faces a shortage of physicians.\n            (2) A 2016 study entitled ``Supply and Demand of General \n        Surgeons: Projections From 2014-2030'', prepared by the \n        University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the American \n        College of Surgeons, found that the supply of general surgeons \n        will grow slightly by 2030 but will not keep up with overall \n        growth in the United States population or demand for surgical \n        services.\n            (3) A 2017 report released by the Association of American \n        Medical Colleges projects shortages of between 19,800 and \n        29,000 surgeons by 2030.\n            (4) In order to accurately prepare for future physician \n        workforce demands, comprehensive, impartial research and high \n        quality data are needed to inform dynamic projections of \n        physician workforce needs.\n            (5) A variety of factors, including health outcomes, \n        utilization trends, growing and aging populations, and delivery \n        system changes, influence workforce needs and should be \n        considered as part of flexible projections of workforce needs.\n            (6) Given the particularly acute needs in many rural and \n        other surgical workforce shortage areas, additional efforts to \n        assess the adequacy of the current general surgeon workforce \n        are necessary.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY ON DESIGNATION OF GENERAL SURGERY SHORTAGE AREAS.\n\n    Part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n254b et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n             ``Subpart XIII--General Surgery Shortage Areas\n\n``SEC. 340J.
