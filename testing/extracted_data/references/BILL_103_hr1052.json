In \nestablishing the process to assure the availability of adequate solid \nwaste management capacity, the State shall take into account solid \nwaste management compacts in effect on the date of enactment of the \nStates Solid Waste Regulatory Authority Act that exist within the State \nand one or more States.\n    ``(7) The plan shall require laws, regulations, and ordinances for \ndevelopment of new and expanded solid waste management facilities \nnecessary to provide adequate capacity, as determined by the process \nestablished under paragraph (6), including the establishment of a \nprocess for the siting of such facilities and a schedule for the \napproval and construction of such facilities. To the extent any \ncapacity is provided outside the planning unit, the State shall act to \nensure such capacity is available and is identified in the plan. The \nplan shall reserve to the State authority to take such actions as may \nbe necessary on behalf of a regional or local planning unit, including \ncompacts with other States if appropriate, to assure the availability \nof such capacity when such planning unit has failed in a timely way to \nprovide adequate capacity for waste volumes identified in the plan \npursuant to paragraph (6).\n    ``(8) The plan shall describe solid waste management practices and \nprograms, based on the State's environmental and economic conditions, \nthat promote source reduction and recycling. Such programs shall \ninclude public education campaigns, and the plan's description of such \nprograms shall include, but not be limited to, the following areas:\n            ``(A) Coordination among State and local officials, \n        including public education officials.\n            ``(B) Course curriculum development for primary and \n        secondary schools regarding the benefits of and opportunities \n        to participate in source reduction and recycling programs.\n            ``(C) Projects to inform all members of the public and \n        private sectors, including government agencies, institutions, \n        the industrial and business communities, and consumers, of the \n        benefits of and opportunities to participate in source \n        reduction and recycling programs.\n    ``(9) The plan shall identify existing State and regional markets \nfor recyclable materials and actions that the State will take to \npromote and develop recycling markets.\n    ``(10) The plan shall provide for a program requiring that all \nsolid waste management facilities register with the State and requiring \nthat only registered facilities may manage solid waste identified in \nthe plan.
