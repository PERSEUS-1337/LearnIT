FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fire, bark beetles, and other insects that feed on \n        trees are natural parts of the Rocky Mountain forest ecology \n        that have some beneficial effects and help shape the forests by \n        thinning dense tree stands and promoting cyclical re-growth.\n            (2) However, in various parts of the Rocky Mountain region, \n        large-scale infestations of bark beetles and other insects, in \n        combination with other factors, have increased the likelihood \n        of unusually severe wildfires that pose a threat to lives and \n        property in nearby communities.\n            (3) This increased wildfire danger is the result of the \n        following factors:\n                    (A) A century-long policy of suppressing even small \n                fires on Federal lands, which combined with a more \n                recent reduction in the quantity of timber harvesting \n                on Federal lands, has resulted in unusually dense \n                vegetation that can provide fuel for unusually severe \n                wildfires.\n                    (B) A pronounced and prolonged drought that has \n                weakened trees and made them more susceptible to both \n                wildfire and insects.\n                    (C) Population growth in mountain communities \n                adjacent to Federal lands and the development of ski \n                areas and other recreational facilities on and in the \n                vicinity of Federal lands, with a resulting increase in \n                the number of people, homes, and businesses at risk;\n            (4) The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law \n        108-148; 16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq) addressed the need to reduce \n        the volume of fuel that can feed the most severe fires that \n        threaten communities.\n            (5) However, provisions of the Healthy Forests Restoration \n        Act of 2003 and other laws need to be modified to help further \n        reduce the risks to communities in the Rocky Mountain region \n        associated with current insect infestations.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate a swifter \nresponse by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the \nInterior to reduce the increased risk of severe wildfires to \ncommunities in the Rocky Mountain region resulting from the effects of \nwidespread infestations of bark beetles and other insects.\n\nSEC. 3. RESPONSE TO WIDESPREAD INFESTATIONS OF BARK BEETLES AND OTHER \n              INSECTS ON FEDERAL LAND IN ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 101 of the Healthy Forests Restoration \nAct of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (12) through (16) as \n        paragraphs (13), (14), (16), (17), and (18), respectively;\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (11) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(12) Insect-emergency area.--The term `insect-emergency \n        area' means Federal land in the Rocky Mountain region that--\n                    ``(A) the Secretary determines is subject to a \n                widespread infestation of bark beetles or other \n                insects;\n                    ``(B) is identified for hazardous fuel reduction \n                treatment in a community wildfire protection plan; and\n                    ``(C) is characterized by insect-induced tree \n                mortality that the Secretary determines has, or within \n                one year will have, produced a condition such that an \n                immediate reduction in hazardous fuels is required in \n                order to reduce the risks to human life and property or \n                to a municipal water supply from a severe wildfire.''; \n                and\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (14), as redesignated by \n        paragraph (2), the following new paragraph:\n            ``(16) Rocky mountain region.--The term `Rocky Mountain \n        region' means the States of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, \n        New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.''.\n    (b) Funding Allocation Prioritization for Federal Lands in Rocky \nMountain Region.--Section 103(d)(1) of the Healthy Forests Restoration \nAct of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6513(d)(1)(B)) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new subparagraph:\n                    ``(D) Special rule for rocky mountain region.--The \n                Secretary shall allocate not less than 70 percent of \n                the funds allocated for authorized hazardous fuel \n                reduction projects in the Rocky Mountain region for--\n                            ``(i) projects in the wildland-urban \n                        interface; and\n                            ``(ii) lands that are in proximity to a \n                        municipal water supply system or a stream \n                        feeding such a system within a municipal \n                        watershed and that have been identified for \n                        such projects in community wildfire protection \n                        plans.''.\n    (c) Alternative Analysis Process.--Section 104(d)(2) of the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6514(d)(2)) is amended by \ninserting after ``at-risk community'' the following: ``or on any other \nlands identified for such a project in a community wildfire protection \nplan for an at-risk community in or adjacent to an insect-emergency \narea''.\n    (d) Insect Emergencies.--Title I of the Healthy Forests Restoration \nAct of 2003 is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating sections 107 and 108 as sections 109 \n        and 110, respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 106 the following new \n        section:\n\n``SEC. 107.
