FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Specialized food is often medically necessary for the \n        safe and effective management of many digestive and inherited \n        metabolic disorders that impact digestion, absorption, and \n        metabolism of nutrients.\n            (2) Although medically necessary food is essential for \n        patients, it is often expensive and not uniformly reimbursed by \n        health insurance, leaving many families with an insurmountable \n        financial burden.\n            (3) As a result, many patients who cannot afford medically \n        necessary food may experience adverse health consequences from \n        suboptimal disease management, including hospitalization, \n        intellectual impairment, behavioral dysfunction, inadequate \n        growth, nutrient deficiencies, and even death.\n\nSEC. 3.
