FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On November 15, 1999, the United States Trade \n        Representative announced the completion of a bilateral \n        agreement with the People's Republic of China regarding \n        accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade \n        Organization.\n            (2) Congress must grant the People's Republic of China \n        permanent normal trade relations status in order for the United \n        States to receive all the benefits of China's accession to the \n        World Trade Organization.\n            (3) The People's Republic of China has been a centrally \n        planned, nonmarket economy since its founding in 1949.\n            (4) In 1978, the People's Republic of China initiated the \n        first in a series of economic reforms and has made some \n        meaningful and desirable progress in opening up its economy to \n        imports, exports, and investment.\n            (5) Granting permanent normal trade relations to China \n        would help cement the economic reforms that have taken place \n        thus far and would help those Chinese leaders who are committed \n        to economic reform to institutionalize these reforms.\n            (6) Despite these reforms, the People's Republic of China \n        is still largely a nonmarket economy and the People's Republic \n        of China is still a long way from meeting international \n        standards of transparency, legal accountability, reliability of \n        statistics, and uniform application of law.\n            (7) The viability and credibility of the World Trade \n        Organization and the health of the world trading system require \n        that the People's Republic of China adheres fully to the \n        bilateral and multilateral commitments it makes during the \n        accession process.\n            (8) Current trade monitoring and enforcement mechanisms \n        within the United States Government and within the World Trade \n        Organization are not designed to take account of the unique \n        Chinese economic structure.\n            (9) The General Accounting Office has reported that even \n        simple recordkeeping of agreements in various executive \n        agencies is inadequate and incomplete.\n            (10) It is necessary to establish new mechanisms, both \n        within the executive branch and within Congress, to ensure \n        adequate and continual monitoring and enforcement of China's \n        commitments at the World Trade Organization.\n            (11) The opaque features of the Chinese economy, the \n        nonuniform implementation of Chinese Government economic \n        policies, the decentralized nature of Chinese Government \n        economic management, and the new nature of Chinese Government \n        commitments under the World Trade Organization, make it \n        necessary to create a comprehensive, multiagency effort to \n        monitor China's compliance with its commitments.\n            (12) Various Federal agencies should be tasked with \n        different aspects of monitoring China's compliance with its \n        commitments.\n\nSEC. 3.
