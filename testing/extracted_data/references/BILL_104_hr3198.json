FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in enacting the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 \n        (43 U.S.C. 31a et seq.), Congress found, among other things, \n        that--\n                    (A) during the 2 decades preceding enactment of \n                that Act, the production of geologic maps had been \n                drastically curtailed;\n                    (B) geologic maps are the primary data base for \n                virtually all applied and basic earth-science \n                investigations;\n                    (C) Federal agencies, State and local governments, \n                private industry, and the general public depend on the \n                information provided by geologic maps to determine the \n                extent of potential environmental damage before \n                embarking on projects that could lead to preventable, \n                costly environmental problems or litigation;\n                    (D) the lack of proper geologic maps has led to the \n                poor design of such structures as dams and waste-\n                disposal facilities;\n                    (E) geologic maps have proven indispensable in the \n                search for needed fossil fuel and mineral resources; \n                and\n                    (F) a comprehensive nationwide program of geologic \n                mapping is required in order to systematically build \n                the Nation's geologic-map data base at a pace that \n                responds to increasing demand;\n            (2) the geologic mapping program called for by that Act has \n        not been fully implemented; and\n            (3) it is time for this important program to be fully \n        implemented.\n\nSEC. 3.
