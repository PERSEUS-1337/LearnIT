WILD AND SCENIC RIVER DESIGNATION, EIGHTMILE RIVER, \n              CONNECTICUT.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Eightmile River Wild and Scenic River Study Act of \n        2001 (Public Law 107-65; 115 Stat. 484) authorized the study of \n        the Eightmile River in the State of Connecticut from its \n        headwaters downstream to its confluence with the Connecticut \n        River for potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic \n        Rivers System.\n            (2) The segments of the Eightmile River covered by the \n        study are in a free-flowing condition, and the outstanding \n        resource values of the river segments include the cultural \n        landscape, water quality, watershed hydrology, unique species \n        and natural communities, geology, and watershed ecosystem.\n            (3) The Eightmile River Wild and Scenic Study Committee has \n        determined that--\n                    (A) the outstanding resource values of these river \n                segments depend on sustaining the integrity and quality \n                of the Eightmile River watershed;\n                    (B) these resource values are manifest within the \n                entire watershed; and\n                    (C) the watershed as a whole, including its \n                protection, is itself intrinsically important to this \n                designation.\n            (4) The Eightmile River Wild and Scenic Study Committee \n        took a watershed approach in studying and recommending \n        management options for the river segments and the Eightmile \n        River watershed as a whole.\n            (5) During the study, the Eightmile River Wild and Scenic \n        Study Committee, with assistance from the National Park \n        Service, prepared a comprehensive management plan for the \n        Eightmile River watershed, dated December 8, 2005 (in this \n        section referred to as the ``Eightmile River Watershed \n        Management Plan''), which establishes objectives, standards, \n        and action programs that will ensure long-term protection of \n        the outstanding values of the river and compatible management \n        of the land and water resources of the Eightmile River and its \n        watershed, without Federal management of affected lands not \n        owned by the United States.\n            (6) The Eightmile River Wild and Scenic Study Committee \n        voted in favor of inclusion of the Eightmile River in the \n        National Wild and Scenic Rivers System and included this \n        recommendation as an integral part of the Eightmile River \n        Watershed Management Plan.\n            (7) The residents of the towns lying along the Eightmile \n        River and comprising most of its watershed (Salem, East Haddam, \n        and Lyme, Connecticut), as well as the Boards of Selectmen and \n        Land Use Commissions of these towns, voted to endorse the \n        Eightmile River Watershed Management Plan and to seek \n        designation of the river as a component of the National Wild \n        and Scenic Rivers System.\n            (8) The State of Connecticut General Assembly enacted \n        Public Act 05-18 to endorse the Eightmile River Watershed \n        Management Plan and to seek designation of the river as a \n        component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n    (b) Designation.--Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act \n(16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nparagraph:\n    ``(_) Eightmile River, Connecticut.--Segments of the main stem and \nspecified tributaries of the Eightmile River in the State of \nConnecticut, totaling approximately 25.3 miles, to be administered by \nthe Secretary of the Interior as follows:\n            ``(A) The entire 10.8-mile segment of the main stem, \n        starting at its confluence with Lake Hayward Brook to its \n        confluence with the Connecticut River at the mouth of Hamburg \n        Cove, as a scenic river.\n            ``(B) The 8.0-mile segment of the East Branch of the \n        Eightmile River starting at Witch Meadow Road to its confluence \n        with the main stem of the Eightmile River, as a scenic river.\n            ``(C) The 3.9-mile segment of Harris Brook starting with \n        the confluence of an unnamed stream lying 0.74 miles due east \n        of the intersection of Hartford Road (State Route 85) and Round \n        Hill Road to its confluence with the East Branch of the \n        Eightmile River, as a scenic river.\n            ``(D) The 1.9-mile segment of Beaver Brook starting at its \n        confluence with Cedar Pond Brook to its confluence with the \n        main stem of the Eightmile River, as a scenic river.\n            ``(E) The 0.7-mile segment of Falls Brook from its \n        confluence with Tisdale Brook to its confluence with the main \n        stem of the Eightmile River at Hamburg Cove, as a scenic \n        river.''.\n    (c) Management.--The segments of the main stem and certain \ntributaries of the Eightmile River in the State of Connecticut \ndesignated as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System \nby the amendment made by subsection (b) (in this section referred to as \nthe ``Eightmile River'') shall be managed in accordance with the \nEightmile River Watershed Management Plan and such amendments to the \nplan as the Secretary of the Interior determines are consistent with \nthis section.
