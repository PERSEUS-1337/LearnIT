SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Helium \nPrivatization Act of 1995''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States Government's helium recovery program \n        was instituted in 1925, when helium conservation was deemed to \n        be a matter of national security and no private sector helium \n        recovery industry existed;\n            (2) today, as compared to 1925, there is little likelihood \n        that the United States will have to field a fleet of blimps on \n        an emergency basis;\n            (3) private sources of helium are more than adequate for \n        serving existing and foreseeable future national needs;\n            (4) since 1925, there has been a dramatic increase in \n        private industry's involvement in helium recovery, as a result \n        of the free market discovery of numerous commercial uses for \n        helium;\n            (5) currently, private industry accounts for 90 percent of \n        all helium extraction and consumption;\n            (6) the Government's helium recovery program currently owes \n        the Department of the Treasury $1,400,000,000 and in recent \n        years has lost as much as an additional $120,000,000 yearly on \n        interest alone, and there is no prospect for repayment of this \n        debt without significant reform; and\n            (7) with combined public and private helium reserves \n        considerably in excess of foreseeable national helium needs, \n        there is no longer any need for the Federal Government to own \n        and operate a helium extraction and reserve program.\n\nSEC. 2. AMENDMENT OF HELIUM ACT.\n\n    Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an \namendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal \nof, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to \nbe made to a section or other provision of the Helium Act (50 U.S.C. \n167 to 167n).\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY.\n\n    Sections 3, 4, and 5 are amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 3. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY.\n\n    ``(a) Extraction and Disposal of Helium on Federal Lands.--(1) The \nSecretary may enter into agreements with private parties for the \nrecovery and disposal of helium on Federal lands upon such terms and \nconditions as he deems fair, reasonable and necessary. The Secretary \nmay grant leasehold rights to any such helium. The Secretary may not \nenter into any agreement by which the Secretary sells such helium other \nthan to a private party with whom the Secretary has an agreement for \nrecovery and disposal of helium. Such agreements may be subject to such \nrules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary.\n    ``(2) Any agreement under this subsection shall be subject to the \nexisting rights of any affected Federal oil and gas lessee. Each such \nagreement (and any extension or renewal thereof) shall contain such \nterms and conditions as deemed appropriate by the Secretary.\n    ``(3) This subsection shall not in any manner affect or diminish \nthe rights and obligations of the Secretary and private parties under \nagreements to dispose of helium produced from Federal lands in \nexistence at the enactment of the Helium Privatization Act of 1995 \nexcept to the extent that such agreements are renewed or extended after \nsuch date.\n    ``(b) Storage, Transportation, and Sale.--The Secretary is \nauthorized to store, transport, and sell helium only in accordance with \nthis Act.\n    ``(c) Monitoring and Reporting.--The Secretary is authorized to \nmonitor helium production and helium reserves in the United States and \nto periodically prepare reports regarding the amounts of helium \nproduced and the quantity of crude helium in storage in the United \nStates.\n\n``SEC. 4. STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE HELIUM.\n\n    ``(a) Storage and Transportation.--The Secretary is authorized to \nstore and transport crude helium and to maintain and operate existing \ncrude helium storage at the Bureau of Mines Cliffside Field, together \nwith related helium transportation and withdrawal facilities.\n    ``(b) Cessation of Production, Refining, and Marketing.--Effective \none year after the date of enactment of the Helium Privatization Act of \n1995, the Secretary shall cease producing, refining and marketing \nrefined helium and shall cease carrying out all other activities \nrelating to helium which the Secretary was authorized to carry out \nunder this Act before the date of enactment of the Helium Privatization \nAct of 1995, except those activities described in subsection (a). The \namount of helium reserves owned by the United States and stored in the \nBureau of Mines Cliffside Field at such date of cessation, less \n600,000,000 cubic feet, shall be the helium reserves owned by the \nUnited States required to be sold pursuant to section 8(b) hereof.\n    ``(c) Disposal of Facilities.--(1) Within one year after the date \nof enactment of the Helium Privatization Act of 1995, the Secretary \nshall dispose of all facilities, equipment, and other real and personal \nproperty, together with all interests therein, held by the United \nStates for the purpose of producing, refining and marketing refined \nhelium. The disposal of such property shall be in accordance with the \nprovisions of law governing the disposal of excess or surplus \nproperties of the United States.\n    ``(2) All proceeds accruing to the United States by reason of the \nsale or other disposal of such property shall be treated as moneys \nreceived under this chapter for purposes of section 6(f). All costs \nassociated with such sale and disposal (including costs associated with \ntermination of personnel) and with the cessation of activities under \nsubsection (b) shall be paid from amounts available in the helium \nproduction fund established under section 6(f).\n    ``(3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any facilities, equipment, \nor other real or personal property, or any interest therein, necessary \nfor the storage and transportation of crude helium or any equipment \nneeded to maintain the purity, quality control, and quality assurance \nof helium in the reserve.\n    ``(d) Existing Contracts.--All contracts which were entered into by \nany person with the Secretary for the purchase by such person from the \nSecretary of refined helium and which are in effect on the date of the \nenactment of the Helium Privatization Act of 1995 shall remain in force \nand effect until the date on which the facilities referred to in \nsubsection (c) are disposed of. Any costs associated with the \ntermination of such contracts shall be paid from the helium production \nfund established under section 6(f).\n\n``SEC. 5. FEES FOR STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION AND WITHDRAWAL.\n\n    ``Whenever the Secretary provides helium storage, withdrawal, or \ntransportation services to any person, the Secretary is authorized and \ndirected to impose fees on such person to reimburse the Secretary for \nthe full costs of providing such storage, transportation, and \nwithdrawal. All such fees received by the Secretary shall be treated as \nmoneys received under this Act for purposes of section 6(f).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
