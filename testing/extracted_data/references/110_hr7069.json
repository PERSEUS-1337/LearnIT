FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is the policy of the United States to provide \n        statistics to the public and to the Government that are \n        accurate, timely, relevant to public purposes, and credible in \n        that they are collected impartially and are available to all.\n            (2) Pursuant to section 2 of article I of the Constitution, \n        it is the obligation of the United States to conduct a census \n        of population every 10 years, such census being necessary to \n        the basic workings of our representative democracy.\n            (3) Knowledge of who we are as a people is basic to \n        informed policymaking, public edification, and scientific \n        research, and, therefore, there should be regularly conducted a \n        census of the economy and the collection of other relevant \n        information on the population and economy of the United States \n        at appropriate intervals between censuses.\n            (4) In all of the data collections envisioned in title 13, \n        United States Code, it is fundamentally important that data be \n        collected in an impartial manner, using modern statistical, \n        computational, and operational methods to the fullest extent \n        possible, consonant with applicable law.\n            (5) The credibility and impartiality of data from a Federal \n        statistical agency depends critically on whether the agency \n        operates from a strong position of independence; therefore, the \n        authority for conducting the decennial census of population and \n        any economic or other censuses or surveys should be vested in \n        an agency with a clear and well-defined position of \n        independence.\n            (6) In addition to a formal, strong position of \n        independence, the operating principles of the agency (as \n        described in paragraph (5)) should include--\n                    (A) openness about the sources and limitations of \n                the data provided;\n                    (B) dissemination of data as widely as possible, \n                according to published schedules for release of key \n                statistics;\n                    (C) continual search for the development of more \n                useful data, in terms of cost-effectiveness, accuracy, \n                timeliness, and relevance to public purposes;\n                    (D) regular evaluation of major data collection \n                programs to identify ways to improve their cost-\n                effectiveness, accuracy, timeliness, and relevance;\n                    (E) commitment to quality and professional \n                standards of practice as a statistical agency;\n                    (F) fair treatment of data providers, including \n                individuals and organizations, with respect for privacy \n                and the protection of confidential information;\n                    (G) maintenance of an active research program, not \n                only in methodology and operations, but also in using \n                data for reporting of conditions and trends; and\n                    (H) cooperation and coordination with other \n                statistical agencies.\n\nSEC. 3.
