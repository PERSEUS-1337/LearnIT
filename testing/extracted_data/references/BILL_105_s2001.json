FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1988, Congress enacted section 405 of the Indian \n        Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1645) that established a \n        demonstration program to authorize 4 tribally-operated Indian \n        Health Service hospitals or clinics to test methods for direct \n        billing and receipt of payment for health services provided to \n        patients eligible for reimbursement under the medicare or \n        medicaid programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.), and other \n        third-party payors.\n            (2) The 4 participants selected by the Indian Health \n        Service for the demonstration program began the direct billing \n        and collection program in fiscal year 1989 and unanimously \n        expressed success and satisfaction with the program. Benefits \n        of the program include dramatically increased collections for \n        services provided under the medicare and medicaid programs, a \n        significant reduction in the turn-around time between billing \n        and receipt of payments for services provided to eligible \n        patients, and increased efficiency of participants being able \n        to track their own billings and collections.\n            (3) The success of the demonstration program confirms that \n        the direct involvement of tribes and tribal organizations in \n        the direct billing of, and collection of payments from, the \n        medicare and medicaid programs, and other third payor \n        reimbursements, is more beneficial to Indian tribes than the \n        current system of Indian Health Service-managed collections.\n            (4) Allowing tribes and tribal organizations to directly \n        manage their medicare and medicaid billings and collections, \n        rather than channeling all activities through the Indian Health \n        Service, will enable the Indian Health Service to reduce its \n        administrative costs, is consistent with the provisions of the \n        Indian Self-Determination Act, and furthers the commitment of \n        the Secretary to enable tribes and tribal organizations to \n        manage and operate their health care programs.\n            (5) The demonstration program was originally to expire on \n        September 30, 1996, but was extended by Congress to September \n        30, 1998, so that the current participants would not experience \n        an interruption in the program while Congress awaited a \n        recommendation from the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        on whether to make the program permanent.\n            (6) It would be beneficial to the Indian Health Service and \n        to Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native \n        organizations to provide permanent status to the demonstration \n        program and to extend participation in the program to other \n        Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska Native health \n        organizations who operate a facility of the Indian Health \n        Service.\n\nSEC. 3. DIRECT BILLING OF MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND OTHER THIRD PARTY \n              PAYORS.\n\n    (a) Permanent Authorization.--Section 405 of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act (25 U.S.C. 1645) is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(a) Establishment of Direct Billing Program.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a program \n        under which Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Alaska \n        Native health organizations that contract or compact for the \n        operation of a hospital or clinic of the Service under the \n        Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act may \n        elect to directly bill for, and receive payment for, health \n        care services provided by such hospital or clinic for which \n        payment is made under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.)
