Such procedures may include \nidentifying categories of individuals on the basis of whose wages and \nself-employment income benefits which are not payable (in whole or in \npart) under this subsection are likely to be paid and requesting that \nthey estimate their adjusted gross income (or the total adjusted gross \nincome of them and their spouses) more frequently than other persons \nsubject to this subsection.\n    ``(6) Benefits which would, but for the provisions of paragraph \n(1), be payable under this title, on the basis of the wages and self-\nemployment income of the individual referred to in paragraph (1), to \nany other individual (other than the individuals to whom benefits based \non such wages and self-employment income are not payable by reason of \nparagraph (1)) shall be payable as though such individuals were \nreceiving such benefits.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply with respect to benefits otherwise payable in taxable years \nending after December 31, 1995.\n\nSEC. 3.
