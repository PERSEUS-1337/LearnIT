    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Commission to Study the Potential \nCreation of a National Museum of the American Latino Community Act of \n2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) American Latinos are an ethnically and racially diverse \n        population. Still, whether known by the term ``Hispanic'' or \n        ``Latino'', or by the various national identities from which \n        they obtain their ethnicity, American Latinos share a common \n        heritage rooted in the mixture of the cultures of the \n        indigenous peoples of the American continent, of the European \n        colonizers from Spain, and of Africans who were brought to \n        those colonies as slaves.\n            (2) While the history of the United States formally dates \n        from 1776, American civilization was already centuries old by \n        then. Latinos were present on the continent for more than 200 \n        years prior to the Declaration of Independence. Spanish \n        colonists founded the first permanent settlement on future \n        United States territory in St. Augustine, Florida in 1565. \n        Indigenous nations that had thrived for centuries prior to the \n        landing of Columbus would later mix with colonists of various \n        ethnicities from Spain to create a third culture, one that \n        continues to thrive in various forms throughout the Americas \n        today.\n            (3) Since before our Nation's founding, Latinos have come \n        to this land searching for opportunity, prosperity, and chance. \n        In this regard, not much has changed in over 3 centuries. \n        Through every era of our Nation's history, whether in the \n        fields of plenty or on the field of battle, a Latino presence \n        was felt. Through every war and conflict, Latinos have served \n        honorably and proudly next to their fellow Americans to defend \n        the ideals of freedom, democracy, and liberty worldwide, \n        earning countless awards for valor and sacrifice.\n            (4) The history, art, politics, economy, and culture of the \n        United States have been enriched by the influence of American \n        Latinos and their traditions and innovations. Both native and \n        foreign-born Latinos in the United States continue to make \n        significant contributions to the arts and humanities, academia, \n        and the popular culture that have benefitted all Americans.\n            (5) According to the Bureau of the Census, the population \n        of American Latinos recently grew to become the largest \n        demographic minority group in the country. As of July 2002, \n        there were an estimated 38.8 million Latinos in the United \n        States. One out of every three of these is under the age of 18. \n        The youthfulness and rapid growth of this population ensure \n        that American Latinos will have a substantial role in American \n        life ranging from public policy to popular entertainment. \n        Greater understanding of this role will benefit all of American \n        society.\n            (6) The American Latino population historically has been \n        concentrated in certain regions of the United States. In the \n        last several decades, however, there has been more dispersed \n        growth of the community throughout the entire country.\n            (7) Despite the contributions that American Latinos make to \n        the cultural life of the United States, there remains a lack of \n        awareness by other Americans about the rich and diverse \n        character of Latino culture and history, which may contribute \n        to stereotypes or misconceptions about Latinos. Greater effort \n        is needed at a national level to educate other Americans about \n        Latinos and to celebrate and disseminate information about \n        Latino culture and history. Americans of all backgrounds \n        benefit from greater understanding of the diversity that exists \n        in the United States.\n            (8) The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest \n        museum and research complex, with 16 museums in the District of \n        Columbia and New York City. The Smithsonian Institution museums \n        play a unique and important role in educating visitors to the \n        Nation's capital about our history, arts, and culture. The \n        American people and international visitors recognize the \n        Smithsonian Institution as the premier American museum, \n        representing the vast diversity of cultural history of the \n        United States.\n            (9) A task force appointed to examine the Smithsonian \n        Institution's representation of American Latinos in its \n        permanent exhibits and other public programs published \n        ``Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian Institution and U.S. \n        Latinos'' (May 1994) and ``Toward a Shared Vision: U.S. Latinos \n        and the Smithsonian Institution'' (October 1997). The reports \n        indicate that the Smithsonian historically had a poor record of \n        representing Hispanics. This criticism led to the creation of \n        the Smithsonian's Center for Latino Initiatives in 1998.\n            (10) The Center for Latino Initiatives has increased the \n        profile of Latino arts and culture and should be commended for \n        promoting diversity and understanding of American Latino \n        culture by the Smithsonian's patrons. The Center's short \n        history has shown that American Latino exhibits and programs \n        are well received by the public and by the Latino community. \n        However, given American Latino history, demography, and \n        contributions to the American cultural landscape, a more \ncomplete representation is in order.\n            (11) Fro these reasons, it is necessary to establish a \n        commission to draft a plan of action for creating a National \n        Museum of the American Latino Community within the Smithsonian \n        Institution, on or near the National Mall in Washington, DC.\n\nSEC. 3.
