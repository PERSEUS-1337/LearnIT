EXPRESSION OF RECOGNITION.\n\n    The purpose of the medals authorized by this Act are to express \nrecognition by the United States and its citizens and to honor the \nNative American Code Talkers who distinguished themselves in performing \nhighly successful communications operations of a unique type that \ngreatly assisted in saving countless lives and in hastening the end of \nWorld War I and World War II.\n\n                      TITLE I--SIOUX CODE TALKERS\n\nSEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Sioux Indians used their native languages, Dakota, \n        Lakota, and Nakota Sioux, as code during World War II.\n            (2) These people, who manned radio communications networks \n        to advise of enemy actions, became known as the Sioux Code \n        Talkers.\n            (3) Under some of the heaviest combat action, the Code \n        Talkers worked around the clock to provide information which \n        saved the lives of many Americans in the Pacific and Europe, \n        such as the location of enemy troops and the number of enemy \n        guns.\n            (4) The Sioux Code Talkers were so successful that military \n        commanders credit the code with saving the lives of countless \n        American soldiers and being instrumental to the success of the \n        United States in many battles during World War II.\n\nSEC. 102. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro \nTempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the \npresentation, on behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate \ndesign, to each Sioux Code Talker, including the following:\n            (1) Eddie Eagle Boy.\n            (2) Simon Brokenleg.\n            (3) Iver Crow Eagle, Sr.\n            (4) Edmund St. John.\n            (5) Walter C. John.\n            (6) John Bear King.\n            (7) Phillip ``Stoney'' LaBlanc.\n            (8) Baptiste Pumpkinseed.\n            (9) Guy Rondell.\n            (10) Charles Whitepipe.\n            (11) Clarence Wolfguts.\n\n                    TITLE II--COMANCHE CODE TALKERS\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On December 7, 1941, the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl \n        Harbor, Hawaii, and the Congress declared war the following \n        day.\n            (2) The military code, developed by the United States for \n        transmitting messages, had been deciphered by the Axis powers, \n        and United States military intelligence sought to develop a new \n        means to counter the enemy.\n            (3) The United States Government called upon the Comanche \n        Nation to support the military effort by recruiting and \n        enlisting Comanche men to serve in the United States Army to \n        develop a secret code based on the Comanche language.\n            (4) At the time, the Comanches were second-class citizens, \n        and they were a people who were discouraged from using their \n        own language.\n            (5) The Comanches of the 4th Signal Division became known \n        as the ``Comanche Code Talkers'' and helped to develop a code \n        using their language to communicate military messages during \n        the D-Day invasion and in the European theater during World War \n        II.\n            (6) To the enemy's frustration, the code developed by these \n        Native American Indians proved to be unbreakable and was used \n        extensively throughout the European theater.\n            (7) The Comanche language, discouraged in the past, was \n        instrumental in developing one of the most significant and \n        successful military codes of World War II.\n            (8) The Comanche Code Talkers contributed greatly to the \n        Allied war effort in Europe and were instrumental in winning \n        the war in Europe. Their efforts saved countless lives.\n            (9) Only 1 of the Comanche Code Talkers of World War II \n        remains alive today.\n            (10) The time has come for the United States Congress to \n        honor the Comanche Code Talkers for their valor and their \n        service to the Nation.\n            (11) The congressional gold medals authorized by this title \n        are the recognition and honor by the United States and its \n        citizens of the Comanche Code Talkers who distinguished \n        themselves in performing a unique, highly successful \n        communications operation that greatly assisted in saving \n        countless lives and in hastening the end of World War II in \n        Europe.\n\nSEC. 202. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro \nTempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the \npresentation, on behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate \ndesign to each of the following Comanche Code Talkers of World War II, \nin recognition of their contributions to the Nation:\n            (1) Charles Chibitty.\n            (2) Haddon Codynah.\n            (3) Robert Holder.\n            (4) Forrest Kassanovoid.\n            (5) Willington Mihecoby.\n            (6) Perry Noyebad.\n            (7) Clifford Otitivo.\n            (8) Simmons Parker.\n            (9) Melvin Permansu.\n            (10) Dick Red Elk.\n            (11) Elgin Red Elk.\n            (12) Larry Saupitty.\n            (13) Morris Sunrise.\n            (14) Willie Yackeschi.\n\n                    TITLE III--CHOCTAW CODE TALKERS\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On April 6, 1917, the United States, after \n        extraordinary provocations, declared war on Germany, thus the \n        United States entered World War I, the War to End All Wars.\n            (2) At the time of this declaration of war, Indian people \n        in the United States, including members of the Choctaw Nation, \n        were not accorded the status of citizens of the United States.\n            (3) Without regard to this lack of citizenship, many \n        members of the Choctaw Nation joined many members of other \n        Indian tribes and nations in enlisting in the Armed Forces to \n        fight on behalf of their native land.\n            (4) Members of the Choctaw Nation were enlisted in the \n        force known as the American Expeditionary Force, which began \n        hostile actions in France in the fall of 1917, and \n        specifically, members of the Choctaw Nation were incorporated \n        in a company of Indian enlistees serving in the 142d Infantry \n        Company of the 36th Division.\n            (5) A major impediment to Allied operations in general, and \n        American operations in particular, was the fact that the German \n        forces had deciphered all codes used for transmitting \n        information between Allied commands, leading to substantial \n        loss of men and materiel during the first year of American \n        action.\n            (6) Because of the proximity and static nature of the \n        battle lines, a method to communicate without the knowledge of \n        the enemy was needed.\n            (7) An American commander realized the fact that he had \n        under his command a number of men who spoke a native language. \n        While the use of such native languages was discouraged by the \n        American Government, the commander sought out and recruited 18 \n        Choctaw Indians to use for transmission of field telephone \n        communications during an upcoming campaign.\n            (8) Because the language used by the Choctaw soldiers in \n        the transmission of information was not based on a European \n        language or on a mathematical progression, the Germans were \n        unable to understand any of the transmissions.\n            (9) The Choctaw soldiers were placed in different command \n        positions, to achieve the widest possible area for \n        communications.\n            (10) The use of the Choctaw Code Talkers was particularly \n        important in the movement of American soldiers in October of \n        1918 (including securing forward and exposed positions), in the \n        protection of supplies during American action (including \n        protecting gun emplacements from enemy shelling), and in the \n        preparation for the assault on German positions in the final \n        stages of combat operations in the fall of 1918.\n            (11) In the opinion of the officers involved, the use of \n        Choctaw Indians to transmit information in their native \n        language saved men and munitions, and was highly successful. \n        Based on this successful experience, Choctaw Indians were being \n        withdrawn from frontline units for training in transmission of \n        codes so as to be more widely used when the war came to a halt.\n            (12) The Germans never succeeded in breaking the Choctaw \n        code.\n            (13) This was the first time in modern warfare that such \n        transmission of messages in a native American language was used \n        for the purpose of confusing the enemy.\n            (14) This action by members of the Choctaw Nation is \n        another example of the commitment of American Indians to the \n        defense of our great Nation and adds to the proud legacy of \n        such service.\n            (15) The Choctaw Nation has honored the actions of these 18 \n        Choctaw Code Talkers through a memorial bearing their names \n        located at the entrance of the tribal complex in Durant, \n        Oklahoma.\n\nSEC. 302. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro \nTempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the \npresentation, on behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate \ndesign honoring the Choctaw Code Talkers.\n\n                      TITLE IV--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 401.
