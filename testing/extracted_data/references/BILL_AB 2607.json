six months, or a law enforcement officer may file a petition requesting that the court issue an ex parte gun violence restraining order enjoining the subject of the petition from having in his or her custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm or ammunition.\n(2) For purposes of this subdivision, \u201cimmediate family member\u201d has the same meaning as in

subdivision (a) of Section 18155, and any additional information provided to the court shows that there is a substantial likelihood that both of the following are true:\n(1) The subject of the

receiving a firearm as determined by considering the factors listed in Section 18155.\n(2) An ex parte gun violence restraining order is necessary to prevent personal injury to the subject of the

reason for believing that they exist.\n(d) An ex parte order under this chapter shall be issued or denied on the same day that the petition is submitted to the court, unless the petition is filed too

of the court.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 18170 of the Penal Code is amended to read:\n18170.\n(a) (1) An immediate family member, an employer, a coworker, a mental health worker who has seen the person as a

three months before the expiration of a gun violence restraining order.\n(2) For purposes of this subdivision, \u201cimmediate family member\u201d has the same meaning as in paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 422.4.\n(3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a person described in paragraph (1) to seek a gun violence restraining order.\n(b) A court may, after notice and a hearing, renew a gun violence restraining order issued under this chapter if the petitioner proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 18175 continue to be true.\n(c) In determining whether to renew a gun violence restraining order issued under this chapter, the court shall consider evidence of the facts identified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 18155 and any other evidence of an increased risk for violence, including, but not limited to, evidence of any of the facts identified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 18155.\n(d) At the hearing, the petitioner shall have the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (b) of Section
