FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Ensuring secure access to energy is in the highest \n        national security interests of the United States.\n            (2) Without secure access to oil supplies, the United \n        States economy, which depends heavily on oil for \n        transportation, could be severely affected. Two-thirds of the \n        oil used in the United States is consumed by the transportation \n        sector. Passenger vehicles alone account for 40 percent of \n        United States oil use.\n            (3) In the year 2000, the United States imported 58 percent \n        of its oil needs, 45 percent of which came from Organization of \n        Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) nations.\n            (4) Over the next 20 years, according to the Energy \n        Information Administration, the United States's demand for oil \n        is projected to increase by 33 percent.\n            (5) In 1973 OPEC placed an embargo on sales of oil to the \n        United States, creating severe oil shortages and driving up oil \n        prices in the United States. OPEC's action was a major factor \n        in the recession which followed shortly thereafter.\n            (6) Under the ``Carter Doctrine'', announced by President \n        Carter in 1980, ``An attempt by any outside forces to gain \n        control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an \n        assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, \n        and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, \n        including military force.''.\n            (7) Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the \n        United States sent more than 500,000 troops to the Persian Gulf \n        to expel the Iraqi troops, liberate Kuwait, protect Saudi \n        Arabia, and ensure access to Persian Gulf oil.\n            (8) As of March 19, 2003, the United States is on the verge \n        of fighting yet another war against Iraq to further ensure \n        access to vital oil supplies.\n            (9) Many major oil producing nations do not share United \n        States values of democracy, freedom of expression, thought, and \n        religion, and equality for women.\n            (10) During the Afghanistan conflict and the war on \n        terrorism, many oil producing nations did not openly support \n        the United States campaign to end the terror, and many of the \n        terrorists of September 11 came from major OPEC nations.\n            (11) It is in the highest national security interests of \n        the United States to substantially reduce our dependence on oil \n        as soon as possible, to secure our access to oil supplies, and \n        to reduce our dependence on nations which do not share our \n        interests and values.\n            (12) Because most oil is consumed by the transportation \n        sector, reduction of our dependence on oil can only come from \n        major increases in fuel efficiency in cars, sport utility \n        vehicles, light trucks, and other vehicles.\n            (13) To protect United States national security interests \n        after September 11, the United States Government has invested \n        heavily in securing many industrial sectors, including airlines \n        and the national health system.\n\nSEC. 2.
