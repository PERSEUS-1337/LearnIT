FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A reliable source of groundwater is an essential \n        element of the economy of the communities on the High Plains.\n            (2) The High Plains Aquifer and the Ogallala Aquifer are \n        closely related hydrogeographic structures. The High Plains \n        Aquifer consists largely of the Ogallala Aquifer with small \n        components of other geologic units.\n            (3) The High Plains Aquifer experienced a dramatic decline \n        in water table levels in the latter half of the twentieth \n        century. The average weighted decline in the aquifer from 1950 \n        to 1997 was 12.6 feet (USGS Fact Sheet 124-99, Dec. 1999).\n            (4) The decline in water table levels is especially \n        pronounced in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, reporting that \n        large areas in the States of Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas \n        experienced declines of over 100 feet in that period (USGS Fact \n        Sheet 124-99, Dec. 1999).\n            (5) The saturated thickness of the High Plains Aquifer has \n        declined by over 50 percent in some areas (1186 USGS Circular \n        27, 1999). Furthermore, the survey has reported that the \n        percentage of the High Plains Aquifer which has a saturated \n        thickness of 100 feet or more declined from 54 percent to 51 \n        percent in the period from 1980 to 1997 (USGS Fact Sheet 124-\n        99, Dec. 1999).\n            (6) The decreased water levels in the High Plains Aquifer \n        coupled with higher pumping lift costs raise concerns about the \n        long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the High \n        Plains. (``External Effects of Irrigators' Pumping Decisions, \n        High Plains Aquifer'' Alley and Schefter, American Geophysical \n        Union paper #7W0326; Water Resources Research, Vol. 23, No. 7 \n        1123-1130, July 1987).\n            (7) Hydrological modeling by the United States Geological \n        Survey indicates that in the context of sustained high \n        groundwater use in the surrounding region, reductions in \n        groundwater pumping at the single farm level or at a very local \n        level of up to 100 square miles, have a very time limited \n        impact on conserving the level of the local water table, thus \n        creating a disincentive for individual water users to invest in \n        water conservation measures. (``External Effects of Irrigators' \n        Pumping Decisions, High Plains Aquifer'', Alley and Schefter, \n        American Geophysical Union, paper #7W0326; Water Resources \n        Research, Vol. 23, No. 7 1123-1130, July 1987).\n            (8) Incentives must be created for conservation of \n        groundwater on a regional scale, in order to achieve an \n        agricultural economy on the Southern High Plains that is \n        sustainable.\n            (9) For water conservation incentives to function, Federal, \n        State, tribal, and local water policymakers, and individual \n        groundwater users must have access to reliable information \n        concerning aquifer recharge rates, extraction rates, and water \n        table levels at the local and regional levels on an ongoing \n        basis.\n    (b) Purposes.--To promote groundwater conservation on the Southern \nHigh Plains in order to extend the usable life of the Southern Ogallala \nAquifer.\n\n SEC. 3.

The program shall include on a county-by-county \nbasis--\n            (1) a map of the hydrological configuration of the Aquifer; \n        and\n            (2) an analysis of--\n                    (A) the current and past rate at which groundwater \n                is being withdrawn and recharged, and the net rate of \n                decrease or increase in aquifer storage;\n                    (B) the factors controlling the rate of horizontal \n                migration of water within the Aquifer;\n                    (C) the degree to which aquifer compaction caused \n                by pumping and recharge methods in impacting the \n                storage and recharge capacity of the groundwater body; \n                and\n                    (D) the current and past rate of loss of saturated \n                thickness within the Aquifer.\n    (b) Annual Report.--Not later than one year after the enactment of \nthis Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a report \non the status of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources of the Senate, the Committee on Resources \nof the House of Representatives, and the Governors of the States of New \nMexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Kansas.\n\nSEC. 5. GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) Federal Assistance.--The Secretary of Agriculture, working \nthrough the Natural Resources Conservation Service, shall establish a \ngroundwater conservation assistance program for Southern Ogallala \nAquifer.\n    (b) Design and Planning.--The Secretary shall provide financial and \ntechnical assistance, including modeling and engineering design to \nStates, tribes, and counties, conservation districts, or other \npolitical subdivisions recognized under State law, for the development \nof comprehensive groundwater conservation plans within the Southern \nHigh Plains. This assistance shall be provided on a cost-share basis \nensuring that--\n            (1) the Federal funding for the development of any given \n        plan shall not exceed 50 percent of the cost; and\n            (2) the Federal funding for groundwater water conservation \n        planning for any one county, conservation district, or similar \n        political subdivision recognized under State law shall not \n        exceed $50,000.\n    (c) Certification.--The Secretary shall create a certification \nprocess for comprehensive groundwater conservation plans developed \nunder this program, or developed independently by States, tribes, \ncounties, or other political subdivisions recognized under State law. \nTo be certified, a plan must--\n            (1) cover a sufficient geographic area to provide a benefit \n        to the groundwater resource over at least a 20 year period;\n            (2) include a set of goals for water conservation; and\n            (3) include a process for an annual evaluation of the \n        plan's implementation to allow for modifications if goals are \n        not being met.\n\nSEC. 6. IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Farming operations within jurisdictions which have \na certified conservation plan in accordance with section 5(c) shall be \neligible assistance for projects described in subsection (b).\n    (b) Eligible Projects.--Projects eligible for assistance under \nsubsection (a) are as follows:\n            (1) Water conservation cost-share assistance.--The \n        Secretary, working through the Natural Resources Conservation \n        Service, may provide grants to individual farming operations of \n        up to $50,000 for implementing on farm water conservation \n        measures including the improvement of irrigation systems and \n        the purchase of new equipment. The Federal share of the water \n        conservation investment in any one operation be no greater than \n        50 percent.\n            (2) Irrigated land reserve.--Through the 2020 calendar \n        year, the Secretary shall formulate and carry out the \n        enrollment of lands in a groundwater conservation reserve \n        program through the use of multiple year contracts for \n        irrigated lands which would result in significant per acre \n        savings of groundwater resources if converted to dryland \n        agriculture.\n            (3) Conservation reserve program enhancement.--Lands \n        eligible for the Conservation Reserve Program established under \n        section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 which would \n        result in significant per acre savings of groundwater resources \n        if removed from agricultural production shall be awarded 20 \n        Conservation Reserve Program bid points, to be designated as \n        groundwater conservation points, in addition to any other \n        ratings the lands may receive.\n\nSEC. 7.
