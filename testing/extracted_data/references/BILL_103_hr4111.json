FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) intercity rail passenger service is an essential \n        component of the integrated national transportation system; \n        however, to achieve its full potential the National Railroad \n        Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) must provide a quality \n        transportation product in the form of clean, comfortable, and \n        on-time service;\n            (2) Amtrak's management and employees are dedicated to \n        providing the high quality service that Amtrak's customers \n        deserve; however, additional capital investment is needed to \n        acquire the modern equipment and efficient facilities that are \n        essential to satisfy the demand for superior intercity rail \n        passenger service;\n            (3) significant levels of Federal capital investment will \n        enable Amtrak to provide the world class service American rail \n        passengers deserve, and will reduce operating costs in the long \n        term;\n            (4) Amtrak's management should be held accountable to \n        ensure that all capital investment by the Federal Government is \n        effectively used to improve the quality of service and the \n        long-term financial health of Amtrak;\n            (5) the Secretary of Transportation, as an ex officio \n        member of Amtrak's board of directors, should use this position \n        to evaluate Amtrak's costs and revenue elements to ensure that \n        Amtrak provides excellent service to its customers and that \n        Amtrak uses its Federal investment wisely and efficiently;\n            (6) States can play a significant role in providing cost-\n        efficient intercity rail passenger transportation and in \n        addressing local transportation needs and air quality control; \n        and\n            (7) the freight railroads represent a critical part of the \n        Nation's transportation infrastructure, which should help to \n        provide expeditious and cost-effective delivery of passenger \n        trains.\n\nSEC. 3.
