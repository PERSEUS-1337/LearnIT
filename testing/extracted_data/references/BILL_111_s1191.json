FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States, the People's Republic of China, and \n        the Republic of India are some of the world's largest emitters \n        of greenhouse gases;\n            (2) a global solution to climate change requires action by \n        all 3 countries that is commensurate with their national \n        circumstances and level of economic development;\n            (3) awareness of steps each country is taking to reducing \n        emissions is critical in building confidence in a cooperative \n        approach to climate change; and\n            (4) understanding challenges each country faces in reducing \n        emissions can help identify areas of potential collaboration.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide Congress and the American public with a \n        better understanding of the steps China and India are taking to \n        reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and\n            (2) to identify the means by which the United States can \n        assist China and India in achieving such a reduction.\n\nSEC. 3.
