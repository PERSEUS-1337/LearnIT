FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Promoting safety on our Nation's highways is a national \n        priority. The Department of Transportation has promulgated the \n        Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to further this \n        purpose. The systematic maintenance, repair, and inspection of \n        equipment traveling in interstate commerce are an integral part \n        of the safety regime.\n            (2) Intermodal transportation plays a significant role in \n        expanding our Nation's commerce. The Nation's economy depends \n        heavily upon the ability to transport goods via the various \n        modes of transportation.\n            (3) Motor carriers and their drivers often receive \n        trailers, chassis, containers and other pieces of intermodal \n        equipment to be transported in interstate commerce. Motor \n        carriers do not, however, possess the requisite level of \n        control or authority over this intermodal equipment to perform \n        the systematic maintenance, repair and inspection necessary to \n        ensure compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n        Regulations and to ensure the safety of our Nation's highways.\n            (4) As a result of roadside inspections, motor carriers and \n        their drivers are cited and fined for violations of the Federal \n        Motor Carrier Safety Regulations attributable to intermodal \n        equipment that motor carriers and their drivers neither \n        systematically maintain nor have the opportunity to \n        systematically maintain. Additionally, violations of the \n        Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations attributable to \n        intermodal equipment are assigned to the motor carrier's safety \n        record. Congress should exercise its power to ensure that only \n        those parties who control the equipment, thus having the \n        opportunity and authority to systematically maintain, repair \n        and inspect intermodal equipment, assume responsibility for the \n        safety of that equipment as it travels in interstate commerce.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 5901 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n            ``(9) Motor carrier.--The term `motor carrier' means a \n        person providing motor vehicle transportation for compensation \n        or a motor private carrier as that term is defined in chapter \n        131 of this title.\n            ``(10) Equipment.--The term `equipment' means equipment \n        commonly used in the road transport of intermodal freight, \n        including trailers, chassis, containers and associated devices, \n        and used as an instrumentality of foreign or interstate \n        commerce.\n            ``(11) Equipment interchange agreement.--The term \n        `equipment interchange agreement' means a written document \n        executed by an equipment controller or its agent and a motor \n        carrier which establishes the responsibilities and liabilities \n        of both parties as they relate to the interchange of the \n        equipment.\n            ``(12) Equipment controller.--The term `equipment \n        controller' means any party with any legal right, title, or \n        interest in the equipment, except that a motor carrier is not \n        an equipment controller only because of providing or arranging \n        for any part of the intermodal transportation of the equipment. \n        In no instance shall a motor carrier who has not been \n        contractually delegated responsibility for systematic \n        maintenance and repair of equipment be considered a controller \n        of that equipment.\n            ``(13) Interchange.--The term `interchange' means the act \n        of providing equipment to a motor carrier for the purpose of \n        transporting the equipment for loading or unloading by any \n        party or repositioning the equipment for the benefit of the \n        equipment controller. Such term does not mean the leasing of \n        equipment to a motor carrier for use in the motor carrier's \n        over-the-road freight hauling operations.\n            ``(14) Federal motor carrier safety regulations.--The term \n        `Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations' means the \n        regulations promulgated by the United States Department of \n        Transportation governing the condition and maintenance of \n        commercial motor vehicles as set forth in title 49 of the Code \n        of Federal Regulations.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
