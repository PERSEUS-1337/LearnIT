FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Government of Iran has engaged in a brutal \n        crackdown on the Iranian people in the aftermath of the \n        disputed presidential election of June 12, 2009, stifling \n        freedom of speech, press, and assembly and violating \n        fundamental human rights.\n            (2) On June 23, 2009, President Obama denounced the \n        crackdown on the Iranian people, saying ``The United States \n        respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and \n        is not at all interfering in Iran's affairs. But we must also \n        bear witness to the courage and dignity of the Iranian people, \n        and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society''.\n            (3) On June 19, 2009, the House of Representatives adopted \n        H. Res. 560 by a vote of 405-1, ``expressing support for all \n        Iranian citizens who struggle for freedom, human rights, civil \n        liberties, and the protection of the rule of law''.\n            (4) Iran's security forces, particularly the Iranian \n        Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij volunteer \n        militia, have been largely responsible for the violence and \n        brutality committed against the Iranian people in the recent \n        unrest.\n            (5) Thousands of Iranian protesters have been arrested and \n        detained for taking part in public demonstrations, with many \n        being raped and tortured to extract false confessions to be \n        used against them and others as part of government-run ``show \n        trials''.\n            (6) On June 20, 2009, twenty-six year old Neda Agha Soltan \n        was shot and killed by a member of the Basij militia, \n        symbolizing for Iranians and people all over the world the \n        government's brutal crackdown against peaceful demonstrators.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nUnited States--\n            (1) respects the sovereignty, proud history, and rich \n        culture of the Iranian people;\n            (2) respects the universal values of freedom of speech, \n        freedom of the press, and the freedom to assemble;\n            (3) respects and admires the Iranian people as they take \n        steps to peacefully express their voices, opinions, and \n        aspirations;\n            (4) deplores and condemns the use of coerced confessions \n        and ``show trials'' as tools of political repression in Iran;\n            (5) urges the Government of Iran to intensify its \n        cooperation on the case of Robert Levinson with the Embassy of \n        Switzerland in Tehran and to share the results of its \n        investigation into the disappearance of Robert Levinson with \n        the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and\n            (6) recognizes the importance of diplomacy with Iran in \n        order to advance the national security interests of the United \n        States, but such diplomacy should not be construed as official \n        recognition of the declared results from the June 12, 2009, \n        Iranian presidential election.\n    (c) Statement of Policy.--It should be the policy of the United \nStates to--\n            (1) work to ensure that sanctions are clearly targeted at \n        the Government of Iran and individuals within the Government of \n        Iran, rather than the Iranian society as a whole, in order to \n        avoid creating hardship and inflicting harm on the Iranian \n        people;\n            (2) encourage United States allies to freeze bank accounts \n        held or controlled by Iranian Government officials who have \n        carried out human rights abuses against the people of Iran;\n            (3) encourage United States allies to deny entrance visas \n        for non-official business to Iranian Government officials who \n        have carried out human rights abuses against the people of \n        Iran;\n            (4) work in the United Nations Security Council to impose \n        multilateral political and financial sanctions against Iranian \n        Governmental officials, including officials of the IRGC and \n        Basij militia, who have carried out human rights abuses against \n        the people of Iran;\n            (5) work within the United Nations to focus international \n        attention on and investigate human rights abuses in Iran, and \n        to secure the release of prisoners of conscience;\n            (6) apply targeted political and financial sanctions \n        against a foreign person or foreign entity that provides \n        illicit support to the IRGC and Basij militia;\n            (7) encourage cooperation between United States and Iranian \n        nongovernmental organizations, particularly with regard to \n        facilitating people-to-people exchanges; and\n            (8) expedite admission to the United States of any national \n        of Iran who is under threat of severe penalty as a result of \n        participating in or reporting on pro-democracy activities \n        inside Iran, and should encourage other governments to accept \n        such Iranian refugees for resettlement, provided applicants \n        have not engaged in or provided support for acts of terrorism \n        and satisfy all criteria for acquiring refugee status.\n\nSEC. 3.
