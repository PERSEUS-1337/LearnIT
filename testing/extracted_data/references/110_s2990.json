FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is a human blood \n        plasma derived product, which over the past 25 years has become \n        an invaluable therapy for many primary immunodeficiency \n        diseases, as well as a number of neurological, autoimmune, and \n        other chronic conditions and illnesses. For many of these \n        disorders, IVIG is the most effective and viable treatment \n        available, and has dramatically improved the quality of life \n        for persons with these conditions and has become a life-saving \n        therapy for many.\n            (2) The Food and Drug Administration recognizes each IVIG \n        brand as a unique biologic. The differences in basic \n        fractionation and the addition of various modifications for \n        further purification, stabilization, and virus inactivation/\n        removal yield clearly different biological products. As a \n        result, IVIG therapies are not interchangeable, with patient \n        tolerance differing from one IVIG brand to another.\n            (3) The report of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for \n        Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, ``Analysis of Supply, Distribution, Demand, and \n        Access Issues Associated with Immune Globulin Intravenous \n        (IGIV)'', that was issued in May 2007, found that IVIG \n        manufacturing is complex and requires substantial up-front cash \n        outlay and planning and takes between 7 and 12 months from \n        plasma collection at donor centers to lot release by the Food \n        and Drug Administration.\n            (4) The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n        Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173; 117 Stat. 2066) \n        changed Medicare's reimbursement methodology for IVIG from \n        average wholesale price (AWP) to average sales price plus 6 \n        percent (ASP+6 percent), effective January 1, 2005, for \n        physicians, and January 1, 2006, for hospital outpatient \n        departments, thereby reducing reimbursement rates paid to those \n        providers of IVIG on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.\n            (5) An April 2007 report of the Office of Inspector General \n        of the Department of Health and Human Services, ``Intravenous \n        Immune Globulin: Medicare Payment and Availability'', found \n        that Medicare reimbursement for IVIG was inadequate to cover \n        the cost many providers must pay for the product. During the \n        third quarter of 2006, 44 percent of IVIG sales to hospitals \n        and 41 percent of sales to physicians by the 3 largest \n        distributors occurred at prices above Medicare payment amounts.\n            (6) The report of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for \n        Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, ``Analysis of Supply, Distribution, Demand, and \n        Access Issues Associated with Immune Globulin Intravenous \n        (IGIV)'' notes that, after the new reimbursement rules for \n        physicians were instituted in 2005, 42 percent of Medicare \n        beneficiaries who had received their IVIG treatment in their \n        physician's office at the end of 2004 were shifted to the \n        hospital outpatient setting by the beginning of 2006. This \n        shift in site of care has resulted in a lack of continuity of \n        care and has had an adverse impact on health outcomes and \n        quality of life.\n            (7) The Office of Inspector General of the Department of \n        Health and Human Services also reported that 61 percent of \n        responding physicians indicated that they had sent patients to \n        hospitals for IVIG treatment, largely because of their \n        inability to purchase IVIG at prices below the Medicare payment \n        amounts. In addition, the Office of Inspector General found \n        that some physicians had stopped providing IVIG to Medicare \n        beneficiaries altogether.\n            (8) The Office of Inspector General's 2007 report concluded \n        that whatever improvement some providers saw in the \n        relationship of Medicare reimbursement for IVIG to prices paid \n        during the first 3 quarters of 2006 would be eroded if \n        manufacturers were to increase prices for IVIG in the future.\n            (9) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in \n        recognition of dislocations experienced by patients and \n        providers in obtaining IVIG since the change to the ASP+6 \n        reimbursement methodology, has provided a temporary additional \n        payment during 2006 and 2007 for IVIG preadministration-related \n        services to compensate physicians and hospital outpatient \n        departments for the extra resources they have had to expend in \n        locating and obtaining appropriate IVIG products and in \n        scheduling patient infusions.\n            (10) Approximately 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries receive \n        IVIG treatment for their primary immunodeficiency disease in a \n        variety of different settings. Those beneficiaries have no \n        other effective treatment for their condition.\n            (11) The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n        Modernization Act of 2003 established an IVIG home infusion \n        benefit for persons with primary immune deficiency disease, \n        paying only for IVIG and specifically excluding coverage of \n        items and services related to administration of the product.\n            (12) The report of the Office of the Assistant Secretary \n        for Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health and \n        Human Services, ``Analysis of Supply, Distribution, Demand, and \n        Access Issues Associated with Immune Globulin Intravenous \n        (IGIV)'', noted that, because of limitations in the Medicare \n        Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 \n        provision, Medicare's IVIG home infusion benefit is not \n        designed to provide reimbursement for more than the cost of \n        IVIG and does not cover the cost of infusion services (such as \n        nursing and clinical services and supplies) in the home. As a \n        consequence, the report found that home infusion providers \n        generally do not accept new patients who have primary immune \n        deficiency disease and only have Medicare coverage. These \n        limitations in service are caused by health care providers--\n                    (A) not being able to acquire IVIG at prices at or \n                below the Medicare part B reimbursement level; and\n                    (B) not being reimbursed for the infusion services \n                provided by a nurse.\n            (13) Access to home infusion of IVIG for patients with \n        primary immune deficiency disease, who have a genetic or \n        intrinsic defect in their human immune system, will reduce \n        their exposure to infections at a time when their antibodies \n        are compromised and will improve the quality of care and health \n        of the patient.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR INTRAVENOUS IMMUNE GLOBULINS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1842(o) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395u(o)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)(E)(ii), by inserting ``, plus an \n        additional amount (if applicable) under paragraph (7)'' before \n        the period at the end;\n            (2) by redesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph (8); and\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(7)(A) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n        enactment of the Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2008, the \n        Secretary shall--\n                    ``(i) collect data on the differences, if any, \n                between payments to physicians for intravenous immune \n                globulin under paragraph (1)(E)(ii) and costs incurred \n                by physicians for furnishing such products; and\n                    ``(ii) review available data, including survey and \n                pricing data collected by the Federal Government and \n                data presented by members of the intravenous immune \n                globulin community on the access of individuals \n                eligible for services under this part to intravenous \n                immune globulin and the differences described in clause \n                (i).\n            ``(B) Subject to subparagraph (C), in the case of \n        intravenous immune globulin furnished on or after the date of \n        enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary shall continue the \n        IVIG preadministration-related services payment established \n        under the final rule promulgated by the Secretary in the \n        Federal Register on November 27, 2007 (72 Fed.
