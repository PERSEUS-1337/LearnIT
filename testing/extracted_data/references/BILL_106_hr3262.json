FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress declares and finds the following:\n            (1) The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia are \n        descendants of and political successors to those Indians known \n        as the original Creek Indian Nation at the time of initial \n        European contact with America.\n            (2) The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia are \n        descendants and political successors to the signatories of the \n        1832 Treaty of Washington which was a treaty made while the \n        Creeks were one nation, before removal. The Treaty involved all \n        Creeks, including the Upper, Middle, and Lower Creeks, when the \n        Creek Nation was whole and intact.\n            (3) The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia \n        consists of over 2,500 eligible members, most of whom continue \n        to reside close to their ancestral homeland within the State of \n        Georgia. Pursuant to Article XII of the 1832 Treaty of \n        Washington, the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia \n        declined to be removed and continued to operate as a sovereign \n        Indian tribe comprising those Lower Creeks declining removal \n        under the Treaty of 1832.\n            (4) The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia \n        continues its political and social existence with a viable \n        tribal government carrying out many of its governmental \n        functions through its traditional form of collective \n        decisionmaking and social interaction.\n            (5) In 1972, when the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of \n        Georgia (also known as the Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe East of \n        the Mississippi River) petitioned the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n        for Federal recognition, the tribal leaders were not well \n        educated and the Tribe could not afford competent counsel \n        adequately versed in Federal Indian law. The Tribe was unable \n        to obtain technical assistance in its petition which \n        consequently lacked critical and pertinent historical \n        information necessary for recognition. Thus, due to technical \n        omissions, the petition was denied on December 21, 1981.\n            (6) Despite the denial of the petition, the United States \n        Government, the government of the State of Georgia, and local \n        governments, have recognized the political leaders of the Lower \n        Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia as leaders of a distinct \n        political governmental entity.\n\nSEC. 3.
