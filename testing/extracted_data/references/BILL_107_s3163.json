FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An estimated 2,000,000 new teachers will be needed over \n        the next decade.\n            (2) Under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, States must \n        recruit highly qualified teachers by 2006, yet schools in rural \n        areas and high poverty schools have trouble attracting and \n        retaining such teachers.\n            (3) A 2000 study by the Education Trust reports that high \n        poverty schools are twice as likely not to have teachers \n        certified in the fields in which they teach as schools that are \n        not high poverty schools, which highlights that high poverty \n        schools will need special help to meet the goals of the No \n        Child Left Behind Act of 2001.\n            (4) If the Nation is to improve student achievement and \n        success in school, the United States must encourage and support \n        the training and development of our Nation's teachers, who are \n        the single most important in-school influence on student \n        learning.\n            (5) A majority of graduates of schools of education believe \n        that traditional teacher preparation programs left them ill \n        prepared for the challenges and rigors of the classroom.\n            (6) Fewer than 36 percent of new teachers feel very well \n        prepared to implement curriculum and performance standards.\n            (7) Highly qualified teachers are more effective in \n        impacting student academic achievement because such teachers \n        have high verbal abilities, high content knowledge, and an \n        enhanced ability to know how to teach the content using \n        appropriate pedagogical strategies.\n            (8) The difference in annual student achievement growth \n        between having an effective and ineffective teacher can be more \n        than 1 grade level of achievement in academic performance.\n            (9) Studies have consistently documented the important \n        connection between a teacher's verbal and cognitive abilities \n        and student achievement.\n            (10) Research has shown that there is a positive effect on \n        student achievement when students are taught by teachers with a \n        strong subject-matter background.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide grants to \nteacher preparation programs to better prepare teachers to educate all \nchildren.\n\nSEC. 3.
