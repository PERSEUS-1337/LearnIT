    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The President has proposed a multibillion dollar \n        reconstruction project for Iraq.\n            (2) The President's plan includes resources to rebuild \n        potable water and wastewater treatment facilities; schools and \n        health facilities; ports and airports; the electric power \n        system, roads, and bridges; railroad infrastructure; solid \n        waste management services; irrigation systems; and selected \n        local government buildings.\n            (3) State and local governments in the United States have \n        their own unmet infrastructure and social services needs.\n            (4) State and local governments represent a significant \n        segment of the national economy whose economic health is \n        essential to national economic prosperity.\n            (5) Present national economic problems have imposed \n        considerable hardships on State and local government budgets.\n            (6) Those governments, because of their own fiscal \n        difficulties, are being forced to take budget-related actions \n        which tend to undermine Federal Government efforts to stimulate \n        the economy.\n            (7) Efforts to stimulate the economy through reductions in \n        Federal Government tax obligations or increased spending on \n        Federal programs are weakened when State and local governments \n        are forced to increase taxes or cut spending.\n            (8) Efforts by the Federal Government to stimulate the \n        economic recovery will be substantially enhanced by a program \n        of emergency Federal Government assistance to State and local \n        governments to help prevent those governments from taking \n        budget-related actions which undermine the Federal Government \n        efforts to stimulate economic recovery.\n            (9) State and local governments deserve, at a minimum, the \n        same level of Federal investment to address infrastructure and \n        social services shortfalls as the amount of relief and \n        reconstruction funds provided to Iraq.\n\nSEC. 2.

Such amounts shall be in addition to, \nand not in lieu of, other amounts appropriated for payments to States \nand local governments.\n    (c) Availability to Local Governments.--Not less than one-third of \nthe amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization in subsection (b) \nshall be made available to local governments under the applicable laws \nof a given State.\n\nSEC. 3.
