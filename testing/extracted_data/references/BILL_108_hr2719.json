MODIFICATION OF FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN PLANS.\n\n    (a) Funding Rules for Certain Plans.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any provision of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or the Employee Retirement Income \n        Security Act of 1974 to the contrary, the provisions of \n        subsections (b), (c), and (d) shall apply for any plan year \n        beginning after December 27, 2002, in the case of a defined \n        benefit plan--\n                    (A) that is established and maintained by a \n                commercial passenger air carrier; and\n                    (B) that has a funded percentage of less than 80 \n                percent as of January 1, 2003.\n            (2) Funded percentage.--For purposes of this section, the \n        term ``funded percentage'' means the quotient (expressed as a \n        percentage) derived by dividing--\n                    (A) the market value of plan assets as of January \n                1, 2003 (excluding receivable contributions), by\n                    (B) the current liability of the plan as of January \n                1, 2003.\n            (3) Interest rate.--In determining current liability for \n        purposes of paragraph (2), the assumed interest rate shall be \n        6.65 percent.\n            (4) Estimation of current liability.--If the valuation date \n        for the plan is not January 1, 2003, the current liability as \n        of January 1, 2003, shall be estimated based on generally \n        accepted actuarial principles and practices.\n    (b) Moratorium on Deficit Reduction Contribution.--\n            (1) In general.--In applying section 412(l)(9)(A) of such \n        Code and section 302(d)(9)(A) of such Act with respect to a \n        plan described in subsection (a)(1), the funded current \n        liability percentage of the plan shall be treated as not less \n        than 90 percent for plan years beginning after December 27, \n        2002 and before December 27, 2007.\n            (2) Termination of moratorium in certain cases.--If the \n        funded current liability percentage of the plan, without \n        application of paragraph (1), is 90 percent or greater during \n        any plan year beginning after December 27, 2002 and before \n        December 27, 2007, paragraph (1) shall cease to apply to the \n        plan for plan years beginning with or after such plan year.\n            (3) Extension of amortization periods.--For plan years for \n        which paragraph (1) applies in the case of the plan, net \n        experience gains and net experience losses shall be amortized \n        under sections 412(b)(2)(B)(iv) and 412(b)(3)(B)(ii) of such \n        Code (respectively) and sections 302(b)(2)(B)(iv) and \n        302(b)(3)(B)(ii) of such Act (respectively), over a period of \n        15 plan years.\n            (4) Option to combine or to offset amortization bases.--For \n        the first plan year for which paragraph (1) applies with \n        respect to the plan, amounts required to be amortized under \n        paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 412(b) of such Code and \n        paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 302(b) of such Act may be \n        combined into one amount under such sections, and may be offset \n        against other amounts required to be amortized under such \n        sections, with the resulting amount in either case to be \n        amortized over a period of 15 plan years.\n    (c) Amortization of 2008 Unfunded Current Liability.--\n            (1) In general.--In such form and manner as the Secretary \n        of the Treasury may prescribe, the sponsor of a plan described \n        in subsection (a)(1) may make a one-time, irrevocable election \n        with the Secretary of the Treasury to amortize the unfunded \n        current liability for the first plan year beginning after \n        December 27, 2007, on an interest-only basis for the first 5 \n        plan years (beginning with such first plan year) and thereafter \n        in equal annual installments over a period of 15 plan years \n        (beginning with the first plan year after December 27, 2012).\n            (2) Determination of 2008 unfunded current liability in \n        calculating deficit reduction contribution after moratorium \n        ends.--If the plan sponsor makes an election under paragraph \n        (1) with respect to the plan, the unfunded current liability of \n        the plan for the first plan year after December 27, 2007, shall \n        be calculated as follows:\n                    (A) such unfunded current liability shall equal the \n                unfunded current liability as of the first day of such \n                first plan year, and\n                    (B) such unfunded current liability shall be \n                calculated using the actuarial value of assets as of \n                the first day of such first plan year.\n            (3) Use of 2008 unfunded current liability in calculating \n        deficit reduction after moratorium ends.--If the plan sponsor \n        makes an election under paragraph (1) with respect to the plan, \n        the plan's unfunded old liability, for purposes of section \n        412(l) of such Code and section 302(l) of such Act, shall be \n        deemed equal to the unfunded current liability calculated under \n        paragraph (2) for the first plan year after December 27, 2007, \n        and the plan's unfunded old liability amount for any plan year, \n        for purposes of section 412(l) of such Code and section 302(l) \n        of such Act, shall be the amount necessary to amortize the \n        unfunded old liability under the plan as described in paragraph \n        (1).\n            (4) Cessation of modifications.--If the funded current \n        liability percentage of the plan, determined without regard to \n        this section, is 90 percent or greater for any plan year after \n        December 27, 2002, this subsection shall cease to apply to the \n        plan for plan years beginning with or after such plan year.\n    (d) Recognition of Waiver in Deficit Reduction Contribution.--For \nany plan described in subsection (a)(1), the amount referred to in \nclause (ii) of section 412(l)(8)(A) of such Code and section \n302(d)(8)(A) of such Act shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the \nsum of--\n            (1) the value of the plan's assets determined under section \n        412(c)(2) of such Code and section 302(c)(2) of such Act, and\n            (2) the unamortized portion of any waived funding \n        deficiency.\n\nSEC. 3.
