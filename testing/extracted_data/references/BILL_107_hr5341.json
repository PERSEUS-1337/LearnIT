ACTIONS TO ADDRESS FIRE HAZARDS DUE TO INSECT AND DISEASE \n              INFESTATION AND TREE OVERCROWDING IN NATIONAL FOREST \n              SYSTEM LANDS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Forest health conditions within National Forest System \n        lands are deteriorating and immediate action to cut timber on \n        these lands is in the public interest.\n            (2) Pending litigation prevents timely action to reduce the \n        risk of wildfire in National Forest System lands.\n            (3) Existing administrative and legal processes cannot \n        address the fire danger in time to enable the Secretary of \n        Agriculture to take action to reduce the danger.\n            (4) Immediate action to address the fire danger in an \n        environmentally responsive manner is supported by the States \n        and local governments, local industry users, and some \n        environmental groups.\n            (5) The Forest Service and State and local fire officials \n        are encouraged to take actions as necessary to create a \n        defensible fuel zone within State owned lands adjacent to \n        National Forest System lands.\n    (b) Fire and Insect Risk Reduction in Existing Timber Sale Analysis \nAreas.--\n            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary is \n        authorized to cut additional timber within or outside the \n        existing cutting units for National Forest System timber sales \n        and within the analysis areas for these sales as is necessary \n        to reduce insect and disease infestation or fire hazard.\n            (2) Criteria.--In implementing additional timber harvests \n        within the timber sale analysis areas referred to in paragraph \n        (1), the Secretary shall use, in order of priority, the \n        following criteria:\n                    (A) Areas within \\1/4\\ mile of private properties \n                where private property owners have taken or are taking \n                actions to cut timber on their lands.\n                    (B) Stands that are a fire hazard or insect and \n                disease infested, and are near private lands or in \n                proximity to communities.\n                    (C) Areas that have the highest intensity or \n                concentration of insect or disease infestation that \n                will move to other areas.\n                    (D) Stands that are a fire hazard or insect and \n                disease infested, and are near areas of high resource \n                value where retaining green trees is important, such as \n                wildlife habitats, sensitive landscapes, forest growth, \n                recreation areas, and developments.\n                    (E) Stands that are a high fire hazard or insect \n                and disease infested, and are within skidding distance \n                of existing roads.\n                    (F) Concentrations of insect or disease infested \n                trees or areas that are high fire hazards due to \n                accumulated forest debris.\n                    (G) Stands with the highest density that are most \n                susceptible to insect or disease attack and are in \n                close proximity to infested trees.\n    (c) Use of
