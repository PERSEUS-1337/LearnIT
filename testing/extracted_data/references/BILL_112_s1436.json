SHORT TITLE; ETC.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation and \nRegional Infrastructure Project Bonds Act of 2011'' or ``TRIP Bonds \nAct''.\n    (b) References to Internal Revenue Code of 1986.--Except as \notherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or \nrepeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \nsection or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be \nmade to a section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Our Nation's highways, transit systems, railroads, \n        ports, and inland waterways drive our economy, enabling all \n        industries to achieve growth and productivity that makes \n        America strong and prosperous.\n            (2) The establishment, maintenance, and improvement of the \n        national transportation network is a national priority, for \n        economic, environmental, energy, security, and other reasons.\n            (3) The ability to move people and goods is critical to \n        maintaining State, metropolitan, rural, and local economies.\n            (4) The construction of infrastructure requires the skills \n        of numerous occupations, including those in the contracting, \n        engineering, planning and design, materials supply, \n        manufacturing, distribution, and safety industries.\n            (5) Investing in transportation infrastructure creates \n        long-term capital assets for the Nation that will help the \n        United States address its enormous infrastructure needs and \n        improve its economic productivity.\n            (6) Investment in transportation infrastructure creates \n        jobs and spurs economic activity to put people back to work and \n        stimulate the economy.\n            (7) Every billion dollars in transportation investment has \n        the potential to create up to 30,000 jobs.\n            (8) Every dollar invested in the Nation's transportation \n        infrastructure yields at least $5.70 in economic benefits \n        because of reduced delays, improved safety, and reduced vehicle \n        operating costs.\n            (9) Numerous experts have noted that the estimated cost to \n        maintain and improve our Nation's highways, bridges, and other \n        critical transportation infrastructure significantly exceeds \n        what is currently being provided by all levels of government.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide financing for \nadditional transportation infrastructure capital investments.\n\nSEC. 3.
