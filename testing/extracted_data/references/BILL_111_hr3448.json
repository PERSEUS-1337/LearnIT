PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall supersede, mitigate, detract from, or in \nanyway decrease the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's ability to maintain \nthe highest possible levels of public health and safety standards, \nconsistent with the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. No \nauthority granted by this Act shall be executed in a manner that \njeopardizes, minimizes, reduces, or lessens public health and safety \nstandards.\n\nSEC. 3. STREAMLINING COMBINED CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATING LICENSE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall establish \nand implement an expedited procedure for issuing a Combined \nConstruction and Operating License.\n    (b) Qualifications.--To qualify for the expedited procedure under \nthis section, an applicant shall--\n            (1) apply for construction of a reactor based on a design \n        approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;\n            (2) construct the new reactor on or adjacent to a site \n        where an operating nuclear power plant already exists;\n            (3) not be subject to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission order \n        to modify, suspend, or revoke a license under section 2.202 of \n        title 10, Code of Federal Regulations; and\n            (4) submit a complete Combined Construction and Operating \n        License application that is docketed by the Commission.\n    (c) Expedited Procedure.--With respect to a license for which the \napplicant has satisfied the requirements of subsection (b) and seeks \nfast track consideration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall \nfollow the following procedures:\n            (1) Undertake an expedited environmental review process and \n        issue a draft Environmental Impact Statement within 12 months \n        after the application is accepted for docketing.\n            (2) Complete any public licensing hearings and related \n        processes within 24 months of accepting for docketing the \n        expedited Combined Construction and Operating License \n        application. Such hearings shall begin with the issuance of a \n        draft Environmental Impact Statement.\n            (3) Complete the technical review process and issue the \n        Safety Evaluation Report and the final Environmental Impact \n        Statement within 18 months after the application is accepted \n        for docketing.\n            (4) Make a final decision on whether to issue the Combined \n        Construction and Operating License within 25 months after \n        docketing the application.\n    (d) Goals.--The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall present \nrecommendations to Congress within 90 days of the date of enactment of \nthis Act for procedures that would further facilitate the licensing of \nnew nuclear reactors in a timely manner.\n\nSEC. 4. REACTOR DESIGN CERTIFICATION.\n\n    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall reduce by one half the time \nnecessary to certify a reactor design and may include designs under \nconsideration for certification by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as \nof the date of enactment of this Act. Such a schedule shall be \npresented to Congress within one year of date of enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL PLANT DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\n    Within one year of date of enactment of this Act, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission shall outline to the Congress an approach that \nwill allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop technology-\nneutral guidelines for nuclear plant licensing in the future that would \nallow for the more seamless entry of new technologies into the \nmarketplace.\n\nSEC. 6. ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND PERSONNEL RESOURCES.\n\n    Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission shall transmit to the Congress a request \nfor such additional funding and personnel resources as are necessary to \ncarry out sections 2 through 5 without delaying consideration of \napplications for Combined Construction and Operating Licenses or \nreactor design certifications not subject to expedited procedures under \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 7. NATIONAL LABORATORY SUPPORT.\n\n    Each national laboratory with expertise in the nuclear field shall, \nin coordination with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, dedicate \npersonnel to supporting either or both the expedited licensing \nprocedures under section 3 and the expedited design certification \nprocedures under section 4.\n\nSEC. 8. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FUNDS.\n\n    To both support the Nation's effort to efficiently license new \nnuclear power plants and build the expertise and workforce necessary to \nregulate and operate those plants, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nand the Department of Energy shall direct educational funding to \nprograms to enhance or directly support the activities authorized by \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 9. NATIONAL NUCLEAR ENERGY COUNCIL.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) The Secretary of Energy shall establish a National \n        Nuclear Energy Council (in this section referred to as the \n        ``Council'').\n            (2) The Council shall be subject to the requirements of the \n        Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).\n    (b) Purpose.--The Council shall--\n            (1) serve in an advisory capacity to the Secretary of \n        Energy regarding nuclear energy on matters submitted to the \n        Council by the Secretary of Energy;\n            (2) advise, inform, and make recommendations to the \n        Secretary of Energy with respect to any matter relating to \n        nuclear energy;\n            (3) help nuclear energy related investors to navigate the \n        Federal bureaucracy to efficiently bring their products and \n        services to the marketplace; and\n            (4) not participate in any research and development or \n        commercialization activities.\n    (c) Membership and Organization.--\n            (1) The members of the Council shall be appointed by the \n        Secretary of Energy.\n            (2) The Council may establish such study and administrative \n        committees as it considers appropriate.\n\nSEC. 10. NUCLEAR POWER 2010.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated for the Nuclear Power 2010 \n$121,000,000 to accomplish its original mission of defining the plant \npermitting and design certification process by September 30, 2010, at \nwhich date the program shall cease to exist.\n\nSEC. 11. NEXT GENERATION NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.\n\n    The Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nshall reevaluate the Next Generation Nuclear Power Plant schedule with \nthe purpose of significant acceleration. Within 180 days of the date of \nenactment of this Act, program managers shall submit to the Congress a \nrevised schedule, including funding requirements, that would allow for \nprogram completion as near as is possible to 2015 (halving the current \nschedule of program completion in 2021).\n\nSEC. 12. URANIUM MINING ON FEDERAL LANDS.\n\n    The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 shall not be \nused to arbitrarily prevent uranium mining from taking place on Federal \nlands. The Federal Government shall not collect additional leasing \nfees, beyond that which are currently applicable, to mine uranium on \nFederal lands. Any fees collected in association with commercial \nuranium mining on Federal lands that should be applied for remediation \npurposes, shall only be applied to the remediation of sites that \nincurred damage as a result of commercial nuclear activities. Such fees \nshall not be applied to the remediation of any sites that incurred \ndamage as a result of Government or Government-sponsored activities."
