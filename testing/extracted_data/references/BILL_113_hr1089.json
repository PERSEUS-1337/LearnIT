FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Technology and the Internet have transformed nearly \n        every aspect of both the global economy and our daily lives. In \n        a technology-rich world, no amount of memorizing information \n        will make a student competitive in the global labor market. \n        America needs an education system that supports students from \n        all walks of life in becoming inquisitive, resourceful thinkers \n        who use technology to pursue knowledge, collaborate across \n        geographic and cultural boundaries, acquire new skills, and \n        solve complex problems.\n            (2) Equality and equity of access is more than access to \n        the same hardware, software, and broadband connections. It \n        includes access to the best digital learning resources and \n        access to teachers who know how to orchestrate the use of these \n        resources in ways that inspire students and produce better \n        learning outcomes.\n            (3) Technology by itself will not improve student outcomes. \n        What is needed are carefully designed innovations that include \n        not just technology but also good learning content, effective \n        instructional strategies, supports for teachers and school \n        systems figuring out how to use the new approach, and the \n        capacity to collect, analyze and reflect on data that will show \n        whether or not the innovation is having the intended effects.\n            (4) Effective learning technology implementations \n        addressing the challenging aspects of language arts, \n        mathematics and science that all students are expected to \n        master. This will require partnerships among education \n        agencies, education researchers, and technology developers with \n        the common goal of harnessing technology to provide \n        opportunities for deeper learning to students who would not \n        otherwise experience them.\n\nSEC. 3. OFFICE OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS \n              EDUCATION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.\n\n    (a) Assistant Secretary.--Section 202 of the Department of \nEducation Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3412) is amended in subsection \n(b)(1)--\n            (1) in subparagraph (E) by striking ``and'' at the end;\n            (2) by redesignating subparagraph (F) as (G); and\n            (3) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following:\n                    ``(F) an Assistant Secretary for Science, \n                Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (in \n                this Act referred to as the `Assistant Secretary for \n                STEM Education'); and''.\n    (b) Office.--Title II of the Department of Education Organization \nAct (20 U.S.C. 3411 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 221.
