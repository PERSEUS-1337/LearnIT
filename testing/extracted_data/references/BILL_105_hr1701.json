FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) a national surface transportation system that includes \n        a national network of highways and that provides for efficient \n        and safe interstate travel in every State is vital to the \n        economic and social well-being of the United States;\n            (2) Federal policy for allocating resources to maintain an \n        efficient and safe national surface transportation system \n        should reflect the unique needs and circumstances of each \n        State's ability to participate in the transportation system;\n            (3) low-density States that comprise large geographic land \n        areas--\n                    (A) bear unique financial burdens in maintaining \n                their share of the national surface transportation \n                system; and\n                    (B) typically support higher per-mile costs of \n                maintaining highways and contribute more per capita to \n                the Highway Trust Fund than other States;\n            (4) many rural States have to maintain large highway \n        systems, which provide interstate access between major \n        population centers, but have small local populations to support \n        their highways;\n            (5) since the approval and implementation of the North \n        American Free Trade Agreement, many rural States along the \n        northern border of the United States have experienced increased \n        use of, and demands on, their share of the national surface \n        transportation system due to increased international trade \n        activities;\n            (6) Federal funding for surface transportation should \n        include adjustments that reflect reasonable and appropriate \n        resource allocations to ensure that rural, low-density States \n        that comprise large geographic land areas can adequately \n        participate in the national surface transportation system; and\n            (7) contributions from all States permit the Federal \n        Government to provide support for essential intermodal national \n        priorities, such as a national system of highways, mass \n        transit, maritime activities, airports and air service, and \n        passenger rail service.\n\nSEC. 3. MINIMUM HIGHWAY FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF STATES.\n\n    Section 157(a)(4) of title 23, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``In fiscal'' and inserting the following:\n                    ``(A) In general.--In fiscal''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(B) Low-density, large-geographic-area states.--\n                            ``(i) Definition of eligible state.--In \n                        this subparagraph, the term `eligible State' \n                        means a State that--\n                                    ``(I) has a population density of \n                                less than 25 individuals per square \n                                mile;
