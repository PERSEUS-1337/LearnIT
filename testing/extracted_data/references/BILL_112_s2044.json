STUDY OF HEALTH EFFECTS OF BACKSCATTER X-RAY MACHINES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Under Secretary for Science and Technology in \nthe Department of Homeland Security shall provide for the conduct of an \nindependent study of the effects on human health caused by the use of \nbackscatter x-ray machines at airline checkpoints operated by the \nTransportation Security Administration.\n    (b) Requirements for Study.--\n            (1) Conduct.--The study required under subsection (a) shall \n        be--\n                    (A) initiated not later than 90 days after the date \n                of the enactment of this Act;\n                    (B) conducted by an independent laboratory selected \n                by the Under Secretary, in consultation with the \n                National Science Foundation, from among laboratories \n                with expertise in the conduct of similar studies; and\n                    (C) to the maximum extent practicable, consistent \n                with standard evaluations of radiological medical \n                equipment.\n            (2) Testing equipment.--In conducting the study, the \n        laboratory shall, to the maximum extent practicable--\n                    (A) use calibration testing equipment developed by \n                the laboratory for purposes of study; and\n                    (B) use commercially available calibration testing \n                equipment as a control.\n            (3) Elements.--In conducting the study, the laboratory \n        shall, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with \n        recognized protocols for independent scientific testing--\n                    (A) dismantle and evaluate one or more backscatter \n                x-ray machine used at airline checkpoints operated by \n                the Transportation Security Administration in order to \n                determine--\n                            (i) the placement of testing equipment so \n                        that radiation emission readings during the \n                        testing of such machines are as accurate as \n                        possible; and\n                            (ii) how best to measure the dose emitted \n                        per scan;\n                    (B) determine the failure rates and effects of use \n                of such machines;\n                    (C) include the use of alternative testing methods \n                in the determination of levels of radiation exposure \n                (such as an examination of enzyme levels after x-ray \n                exposure to determine if there is a biological response \n                to cellular damage caused by such an exposure);\n                    (D) assess the fail-safe mechanisms of such \n                machines in order to determine the optimal operating \n                efficacy of such machines;\n                    (E) ensure that any tests performed are replicable;\n                    (F) obtain peer review of any tests performed; and\n                    (G) meet such other requirements as the Under \n                Secretary shall specify for purposes of the study.\n            (4) Report.--\n                    (A) Evaluation.--The Under Secretary shall provide \n                for an independent panel, in consultation with the \n                National Science Foundation, with expertise in \n                conducting similar evaluations, to evaluate the data \n                collected under the study to assess the health risks \n                posed by backscatter x-ray machines to individuals and \n                groups of people screened or affected by such machines, \n                including--\n                            (i) frequent air travelers;\n                            (ii) employees of the Transportation \n                        Security Administration;\n                            (iii) flight crews;\n                            (iv) other individuals who work at an \n                        airport;

SIGNAGE REQUIREMENT RELATING TO BACKSCATTER X-RAY MACHINES.\n\n    The Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration \nshall ensure that large, easily readable signs or equivalent electronic \ndisplays are placed at the front of airline passenger check point \nqueues where backscatter advanced imaging technology machines are used \nfor screening to inform airline passengers, particularly passengers who \nmay be sensitive to radiation exposure, that they may request to \nundergo alternative screening procedures instead of passing through a \nbackscatter x-ray machine."
