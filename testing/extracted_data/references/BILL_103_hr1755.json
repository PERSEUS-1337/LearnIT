FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Voting participation in the United States is lower than \n        in any other advanced industrialized democracy.\n            (2) The rights of eligible citizens to seek election to \n        office, vote for candidates of their choice and associate for \n        the purpose of taking part in elections, including the right to \n        create and develop new political parties, are fundamental in a \n        democracy. The rights of citizens to participate in the \n        election process, provided in and derived from the first and \n        fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, having consistently \n        been promoted and protected by the Federal Government. These \n        rights include the right to cast an effective vote and the \n        right to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, \n        which includes the ``constitutional right . . . to create and \n        develop new political parties.'' Norman v. Reed, 502 \n        U.S.______, 112 S.Ct. 699 (1992). It is the duty of the Federal \n        Government to see that these rights are not impaired in \n        elections for Federal office.\n            (3) Certain restrictions on access to the ballot impair the \n        ability of citizens to exercise these rights and have a direct \n        and damaging effect on citizens' participation in the electoral \n        process.\n            (4) Many States unduly restrict access to the ballot by \n        nonmajor party candidates and nonmajor political parties by \n        means of such devices as excessive petition signature \n        requirements, insufficient petitioning periods, \n        unconstitutionally early petition filing deadlines, petition \n        signature distribution criteria, discriminatory petition \n        signature fees, and limitations on eligibility to circulate and \n        sign petitions.\n            (5) Many States require political parties to poll an unduly \n        high number of votes or to register an unduly high number of \n        voters as a precondition for remaining on the ballot.\n            (6) In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional an \n        Ohio law requiring a nonmajor party candidate for President to \n        qualify for the general election ballot earlier than major \n        party candidates. This Supreme Court decision, Anderson v. \n        Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) has been followed by many lower \n        courts in challenges by nonmajor parties and candidates to \n        early petition filing deadlines. See, e.g., Stoddard v. Quinn, \n        593 F. Supp. 300 (D.Me. 1984); Cripps v. Seneca County Board of \n        Elections, 629 F. Supp. 1335 (N.D.Oh. 1985); Libertarian Party \n        of Nevada v. Swackhamer, 638 F. Supp. 565 (D. Nev. 1986); \n        Cromer v. State of South Carolina, 917 F.2d 819 (4th Cir. \n        1990); New Alliance Party of Alabama v. Hand, 933 F. 2d 1568 \n        (11th Cir. 1991).\n            (7) In 1992, 26 States still required nonmajor party \n        candidates for President to qualify for the ballot before the \n        second major party national convention (California, Colorado, \n        Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, \n        Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, North \n        Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, \n        Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, \n        West Virginia). Nine of these States required nonmajor party \n        candidates to qualify before the first major party national \n        convention (Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, \n        North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas).\n            (8) In 1992, nonmajor party candidates for President had to \n        obtain 806,401 petition signatures to be listed on the ballots \n        of all 50 States and the District of Columbia--32 times more \n        signatures than the 25,500 required of Democratic Party \n        candidates and 15 times more signatures than the 54,250 \n        required of Republican Party candidates. To be listed on the \n        ballot in all 50 States and the District of Columbia with a \n        party label, nonmajor party candidates for President had to \n        obtain approximately 649,092 petition signatures and 79,136 \n        registrants. In 1992, 32 of the 41 States that held \n        Presidential primaries required no signatures of major party \n        candidates for President (Arkansas, California, Colorado, \n        Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, \n        Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, \n        Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, \n        North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, \n        South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, \n        Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin). Only two States required \n        no signatures of nonmajor party candidates for President \n        (Arkansas and Louisiana; Louisiana, however, requires a $500 \n        filing fee).\n            (9) The number of petition signatures required by the \n        States to list a major party candidate for Senate on the ballot \n        in 1992 ranged from zero to 15,111. The number of petition \n        signatures required to list a nonmajor party candidate for \n        Senate ranged from zero to 180,935. Thirty-one States required \n        no signatures of major party candidates for Senate (Alabama, \n        Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, \n        Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, \n        Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, \n        Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, \n        Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington, West \n        Virginia, Wyoming). Only one State required no signatures of \n        nonmajor party candidates for Senate, provided they were \n        willing to be listed on the ballot without a party label \n        (Louisiana, although a $600 filing fee is required, and to run \n        with a party label, a candidate must register 106,146 voters \n        into his or her party).\n            (10) The number of petition signatures required by the \n        States to list a major party candidate for Congress on the \n        ballot in 1992 ranged from zero to 2,000. The number of \n        petition signatures required to list a nonmajor party candidate \n        for Congress ranged from zero to 12,252. Thirty-one States \n        required no signatures of major party candidates for Congress \n        (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \n        Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, \n        Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, \n        Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, \n        Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, \n        Wyoming). Only one State required no signatures of nonmajor \n        party candidates for Congress, provided they were willing to be \n        listed on the ballot without a party label (Louisiana, although \n        a $600 filing fee is required).\n            (11) Eight States required additional signatures to list a \n        nonmajor party candidate for President on the ballot with a \n        party label (Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, North \n        Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee). Thirteen States required additional \n        signatures to list a nonmajor party candidate for Senate or \n        Congress on the ballot with a party label (Alabama, Arizona, \n        Arkansas, California, Idaho, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, North \n        Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee). Two of these States \n        (Ohio and Tennessee, respectively) required 5,000 signatures \n        and 25 signatures, respectively, to list a nonmajor party \n        candidate for President or Senate on the ballot in 1992, but \n        required 34,777 signatures and 19,759 signatures, respectively, \n        to list the candidate on the ballot with her or his party \n        label. One State (California) required a nonmajor party to have \n        78,992 registrants in order to have its candidate for President \n        listed on the ballot with a party label.\n            (12) In 1992 one State (Arizona) required nonmajor party \n        candidates for President or Senate to obtain 10,555 signatures \n        in 10 days, but allowed major party candidates for Senate 45 \n        days to obtain approximately half that number of signatures, \n        and required no signatures of major party candidates for \n        President. Another State (California) required nonmajor party \n        candidates for President or Senate to obtain 134,781 signatures \n        in 105 days, but required major party candidates for Senate to \n        obtain only 65 signatures in 105 days, and required no \n        signatures of major party candidates for President. Another \n        State (Texas) required nonmajor party candidates for President \n        or Senate to obtain 38,900 signatures in 75 days, and required \n        no signatures of major party candidates for President or \n        Senate.\n            (13) Two States required all nonmajor party candidates to \n        pay fees of ten and five cents per petition signature, while \n        requiring no fees or signatures of major party candidates \n        (Florida and North Carolina, respectively).\n            (14) Seven States require nonmajor party candidates for \n        President or Senate to collect a certain number or percentage \n        of their petition signatures in each congressional district or \n        in a specified number of congressional districts (Michigan, \n        Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, \n        Virginia). Only three of these States impose a like requirement \n        on major party candidates for President or Senate (Michigan, \n        New York, Virginia).\n            (15) Twenty States restrict the circulation of petitions \n        for nonmajor party candidates to residents of those States \n        (California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, \n        Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, \n        New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, \n        Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin). Three States restrict the \n        circulation of petitions for nonmajor party candidates to the \n        county or congressional district where the circulator lives \n        (Kansas, Nebraska, Virginia).\n            (16) Four States prohibit people who voted in a primary \n        election from signing petitions for nonmajor party candidates \n        (Nebraska, New York, Texas, West Virginia). Twelve States \n        restrict the signing of petitions to people who indicate intent \n        to support or vote for the candidate or party (California, \n        Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New \n        York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Utah). Five of these 12 \n        States require no petitions of major party candidates \n        (Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah), and only \n        one of the six remaining States restricts the signing of \n        petitions for major party candidates to people who indicate \n        intent to support or vote for the candidate or party (New \n        Jersey).\n            (17) Restrictions on the ability of citizens to exercise \n        the rights identified in this subsection have \n        disproportionately impaired participation in the electoral \n        process by various groups, including racial minorities.\n            (18) The establishment of fair and uniform national \n        standards for access to the ballot in elections for Federal \n        office would remove barriers to the participation of citizens \n        in the electoral process and thereby facilitate such \n        participation and maximize the rights identified in this \n        subsection.\n            (19) The Congress has authority, under the provisions of \n        the Constitution of the United States in sections 4 and 8 of \n        article I, section 1 of article II, article VI, the thirteenth, \n        fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, and other provisions of \n        the Constitution of the United States, to protect and promote \n        the exercise of the rights identified in this subsection.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish fair and uniform standards regulating \n        access to the ballot by eligible citizens who desire to seek \n        election to Federal office and political parties, bodies, and \n        groups which desire to take part in elections for Federal \n        office; and\n            (2) to maximize the participation of eligible citizens in \n        elections for Federal office.\n\nSEC. 3. BALLOT ACCESS RIGHTS.\n\n    (a) An individual shall have the right to be placed as a candidate \non, or to have such individual's political party, body, or group \naffiliation in connection with such candidacy placed on, a ballot or \nsimilar voting materials to be used in a Federal election, if such \nindividual presents a petition stating in substance that the \nsignatories desire such individual's name and political party, body or \ngroup affiliation, if any, to be placed on the ballot or other similar \nvoting materials to be used in the Federal election with respect to \nwhich such rights are to be exercised, and\n            (1) with respect to a Federal election for the office of \n        President, Vice President, or Senator, such petition has a \n        number of signatures of persons qualified to vote for such \n        office equal to one-tenth of one percent of the number of \n        persons who voted in the most recent previous Federal election \n        for such office in the State, or 1,000 signatures, whichever is \n        greater;\n            (2) with respect to a Federal election for the office of \n        Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the \n        Congress, such petition has a number of signatures of persons \n        qualified to vote for such office equal to one-half of one \n        percent of the number of persons who voted in the most recent \n        previous Federal election for such office, or, if there was no \n        previous Federal election for such office, 1,000 signatures;\n            (3) with respect to a Federal election the date of which \n        was fixed 345 or more days in advance, such petition was \n        circulated during a period beginning on the 345th day and \n        ending on the 75th day before the date of the election;\n            (4) with respect to a Federal election the date of which \n        was fixed less than 345 days in advance, such petition was \n        circulated during a period established by the State holding the \n        election, or, if no such period was established, during a \n        period beginning on the day after the date the election was \n        scheduled and ending on the tenth day before the date of the \n        election, provided, however, that the number of signatures \n        required under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be reduced by \\1/\n        270\\th for each day less than 270 in such period.\n    (b) An individual shall have the right to be placed as a candidate \non, or to have such individual's political party, body, or group \naffiliation in connection with such candidacy placed on, a ballot or \nsimilar voting materials to be used in a Federal election, without \nhaving to satisfy any requirement relating to a petition under \nsubsection (a), if that or another individual, as a candidate of that \npolitical party, body, or group, received one percent of the votes cast \nin the most recent general Federal election for President or Senator in \nthat State.\n\nSEC. 4.
