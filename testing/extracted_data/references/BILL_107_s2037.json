CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September \n        11, 2001, many private-sector technology and science experts \n        provided valuable assistance to rescue and recovery efforts by \n        donating their time and expertise. However, many who wished to \n        help had significant difficulty determining how they could be \n        most useful. They were hampered by the lack of any \n        organizational structure to harness their abilities and \n        coordinate their efforts.\n            (2) A prompt and well-coordinated volunteer base of \n        technology and science expertise could help save lives, aid \n        rescue efforts, and rebuild critical technology infrastructures \n        in the event of a future major terrorist attack, natural \n        disaster, or other emergency. Technology and science expertise \n        also could help minimize the vulnerability of critical \n        infrastructure to future attacks or natural disasters.\n            (3) Police, fire personnel, and other local emergency \n        responders frequently could benefit from timely technological \n        assistance, and efforts to organize a system to assist in \n        locating the desired help should be expedited.\n            (4) Efforts to develop and deploy innovative new \n        technologies for use by government emergency prevention and \n        response agencies would be improved by the designation of a \n        clear contact point within the Federal Government for intake \n        and evaluation of technology ideas.\n            (5) The creation of compatible communications systems would \n        strengthen emergency response efforts of police, fire, and \n        other emergency response personnel to communicate effectively \n        with each other and with their counterparts from nearby \n        jurisdictions. Some programs, such as the Capital Wireless \n        Integrated Network (CapWIN), have made significant progress in \n        addressing the issue of interoperable communications between \n        emergency service providers in particular urban areas and the \n        Federal Government has sought to address the issue through the \n        Public Safety Wireless Networks program. Relatively few States \n        and localities, however, have achieved a sufficient level of \n        communications interoperability.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reinforce, focus, and \nexpedite ongoing efforts to mobilize America's extensive capability in \ntechnology and science in responding to the threats posed by terrorist \nattacks, natural disasters, and other major emergencies, by creating--\n            (1) a national emergency technology guard or ``NET Guard'' \n        that includes--\n                    (A) rapid response teams of volunteers with \n                technology and science expertise, organized at the \n                local level; and\n                    (B) opportunities for NET Guard volunteers to \n                assist with non-emergency tasks related to local \n                preparedness and prevention, including reducing the \n                vulnerability of government information technology \n                systems;\n            (2) a national clearinghouse for innovative civilian \n        technologies relating to emergency prevention and response; and\n            (3) a pilot program to assist state efforts to achieve the \n        interoperability of communications systems used by fire, law \n        enforcement, and emergency preparedness and response agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY TECHNOLOGY GUARD.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the President shall designate an appropriate department, \nagency, or office to compile and maintain a repository database of \nnongovernmental technology and science experts who have offered, and \nwho can be mobilized, to help Federal agencies counter terrorism.\n    (b) Net Guard Disaster Response Teams.--\n            (1) Certification procedures.--The President shall also \n        designate an appropriate department, agency, or office (which \n        may be the department, agency, or office designated under \n        subsection (a)) to develop a procedure to encourage groups of \n        volunteers with technological or scientific expertise to team \n        with individuals from State and local governments, local \n        emergency response agencies, and nongovernmental emergency aid, \n        assistance, and relief organizations.\n            (2) Team formation.--The department, agency, or office \n        designated under paragraph (1) may develop and implement a \n        system for facilitating the formation of local teams of such \n        volunteers by helping individuals that wish to participate in \n        such teams to locate and contact one another.\n            (3) Criteria for certification.--The department, agency, or \n        office designated under paragraph (1) shall establish criteria \n        for the certification of such teams, including--\n                    (A) the types of expertise, capabilities, and \n                equipment required; and\n                    (B) minimum training and practice requirements, \n                including participation in not less than two emergency \n                drills each year.\n            (4) Certification and credentials.--The department, agency, \n        or office designated under paragraph (1) shall--\n                    (A) certify any group of individuals requesting \n                certification as a NET Guard disaster response team \n                that complies with the procedures established under \n                paragraph (1) and meets the criteria established under \n                paragraph (3);\n                    (B) issue credentials and forms of identification \n                as appropriate identifying each such team and its \n                members; and\n                    (C) suspend, withdraw, or terminate certification \n                of and recover credentials and forms of identification \n                from any NET Guard disaster response team, or any \n                member thereof, when the head of the entity designated \n                deems it appropriate.\n            (5) Compensation; per diem, travel, and transportation \n        expenses.--The department, agency, or office designated under \n        paragraph (1) may authorize the payment to a member of a NET \n        Guard disaster response team, for the period that member is \n        engaged in performing duties as such member at the request of \n        the United States--\n                    (A) compensation as employees for temporary or \n                intermittent services as experts or consultants under \n                section 3109 of title 5, United States Code; and\n                    (B) travel or transportation expenses, including \n                per diem in lieu of subsistence, as provided by section \n                5703 of title 5.\n    (c) Additional Authorities.--The head of the department, agency, or \noffice designated under paragraph (1) may--\n            (1) activate NET Guard disaster response teams in an \n        emergency (as defined in section 102(1) of the Robert T. \n        Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 5122(1)) or a major disaster (as defined in section \n        102(2) of that Act);\n            (2) provide for access by team members to emergency sites; \n        and\n            (3) assign, on a voluntary basis, NET Guard volunteers to \n        work, on a temporary basis on--\n                    (A) the development and maintenance of the database \n                described in subsection (a) and the procedures for \n                access to the database; and\n                    (B) such other technology related projects to \n                improve emergency preparedness and prevention as may be \n                appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4.
