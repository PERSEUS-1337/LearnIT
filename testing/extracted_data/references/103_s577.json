    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Pursuant to the invitation and requirements contained \n        in the 15th paragraph under the heading ``Surveying the Public \n        Lands'' in the Act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 11, 36), as \n        amended or supplemented by the Acts of June 6, 1900 (31 Stat. \n        588, 614), March 4, 1901 (31 Stat. 1010, 1037), and September \n        22, 1922 (42 Stat. 1067), certain landowners or entrymen within \n        forest reserves acted to transfer their lands to the United \n        States as the basis for an in lieu selection of other Federal \n        lands (hereafter in this Act referred to as ``lieu lands'') in \n        exchange for such lands within such reserves (hereafter in this \n        Act referred to as ``base lands'').\n            (2) By the Act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. 1264), Congress \n        repealed the in lieu selection provisions of the Act of June 4, \n        1897, as amended, and terminated the right to select lieu \n        lands, but expressly preserved the rights of land owners who \n        had valid pending applications for in lieu selections, most of \n        which have subsequently been granted.\n            (3) Other persons affected by the Acts cited in paragraphs \n        (1) and (2) who acted to transfer base lands, or their \n        successors in interest, have never obtained either (A) a patent \n        to the lieu lands or any other consideration for their \n        relinquishment, or (B) a quitclaim of their base lands, \n        notwithstanding relief legislation enacted in 1922 and 1930.\n            (4) By the Act of July 6, 1960 (74 Stat. 334), Congress \n        established a procedure to compensate persons affected by the \n        Acts cited in paragraphs (1) and (2) who had not received \n        appropriate relief under prior legislation. However, no \n        payments of such compensation were made under that Act.\n            (5) Section 4 of the Act of July 6, 1960, further provided \n        that lands with respect to which compensation under that Act \n        were or could have been made, and not previously disposed of by \n        the United States, shall be a part of any national forest, \n        national park, or other area withdrawn from the public domain \n        wherein they are located.\n            (6) Absent further legislation, lengthy and expensive \n        litigation will be required to resolve existing questions about \n        the title to lands covered by section 4 of the 1960 Act.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to resolve the status of \nthe title to base lands affected by the past legislation cited in \nsubsection (a).\n\nSEC. 2. IDENTIFICATION AND QUITCLAIM OF FEDERAL INTEREST IN BASE LANDS.\n\n    (a) Quitclaim.--Except as otherwise provided by this Act, and \nsubject to valid existing rights, but notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, the United States hereby quitclaims to the listed \nowner or entryman, his heirs, devisees, successors, and assigns, all \nright, title, and interest of the United States in and to the base \nlands described on a final list published pursuant to subsection \n(d)(1), effective on the date of publication of such list.\n    (b) Preparation of Initial Lists.--(1) Not later than 6 months \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior, \nwith respect to lands under such Secretary's jurisdiction, and the \nSecretary of Agriculture with respect to National Forest System lands, \nshall each prepare an initial list of all parcels of base lands that \nwere relinquished to the United States pursuant to the Act of June 4, \n1897 (as amended), and for which selection or other rights under that \nAct or supplemental legislation were not realized or exercised.\n    (2) The initial lists prepared under paragraph (1) shall be based \non information in the actual possession of the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture on the date of enactment of this Act, \nincluding information submitted to Congress pursuant to the directive \ncontained in Senate Report No. 98-578, issued for the Fiscal Year 1985 \nInterior and Related Agencies Appropriation, as revised and updated. \nThe initial lists shall be published and distributed for public review \nin accordance with procedures adopted by the Secretary concerned.\n    (3) For a period of 180 days after publication of a list pursuant \nto paragraph (2), persons asserting that particular parcels omitted \nfrom such a list should have been included may request the Secretary \nconcerned to add such parcels to the appropriate list. The Secretary \nconcerned shall add to the list any such parcels which the Secretary \ndetermines meet the conditions specified in paragraph (1).\n    (c) Nationally Significant Lands.--(1) During preparation or \nrevision of an initial list under subsection (b), the Secretary \nconcerned shall identify those listed lands which are located wholly or \npartially within any conservation system unit and all other listed \nlands which Congress has designated for specific management or which \nthe Secretary concerned decides, in the concerned Secretary's sole \ndiscretion, should be retained in order to meet public, resource \nprotection, or administrative needs. For purposes of this paragraph, \nthe term ``conservation system unit'' means any unit of the National \nPark System, National Wildlife Refuge System, National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System, National Trails System, or National Wilderness \nPreservation System, a national forest monument, or a national \nconservation area, a national recreation area, or any lands being \nstudied for possible designation as part of such a system or unit.\n    (2) The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to any lands \nidentified by the Secretary concerned pursuant to paragraph (1). The \nSecretary concerned shall not include any such lands on any list \nprepared pursuant to subsection (d). Subject to valid existing rights \narising from factors other than those described in subsection (b)(1), \nany right, title, and interest in and to lands identified pursuant to \nparagraph (1) and not previously vested in the United States is hereby \nvested and confirmed in the United States.\n    (3) In the same manner as the initial list was published and \ndistributed pursuant to subsection (b)(2), the Secretary concerned \nshall publish and distribute an identification of all lands in which \nright, title, and interest is vested and confirmed in the United States \nby paragraph (2).\n    (d) Final Lists.--(1) As soon as possible after considering any \nrequests made pursuant to subsection (b)(3) and the identification of \nlands pursuant to subsection (c), the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture shall each publish a final list, consisting of \nlands included on each Secretary's initial list not identified pursuant \nto subsection (c)(1). Unless a Secretary has published a final list on \nor before the date -1-8 24 months after the date of publication, \npursuant to subsection (b)(2), of such Secretary's initial list, the \ninitial list prepared by such Secretary shall be deemed on such date to \nbe the final list required to be published by such Secretary, and \nthereafter no lands included on such initial list shall be excluded \nfrom operation of subsection -(-a-)-. (a) except lands located wholly \nor partially within a conservation system unit or any other area which \nCongress has designated for specific management.\n    (2) If after publication of a final list a court makes a final \ndecision that a parcel of land was arbitrarily and capriciously \nexcluded from -o-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n -o-f -s-u-b-s-e-c-t-i-o-n -(-a-)-, an \ninitial list as provided by subsection 2(b), such parcel shall be \ndeemed to have been included on a final list published pursuant to \nparagraph (1), unless such parcel is located wholly or partially inside \na conservation system unit or any other area which Congress has \ndesignated for specific management, in which case such parcel shall be \nsubject to the provisions of subsection (c)(2).\n    (e) Issuance of Instruments.--(1) Except as otherwise provided in \nthis Act, no later than 6 months after the date on which the Secretary \nconcerned publishes a final list of lands pursuant to subsection (d), \nthe Secretary concerned shall issue -d-e-e-d-s documents of disclaimer \nof interest confirming the quitclaim made by subsection (a) of this \nsection of all right, title, and interest of the United States in and \nto the lands included on such final list, subject to valid existing \nrights arising from factors other than a relinquishment to the United \nStates of the type described in subsection (b). Each such confirmatory \n-d-e-e-d document of disclaimer of interest shall operate to estop the \nUnited States from making any claim of right, title, or interest of the \nUnited States in and to the base lands described in the -d-e-e-d \ndocument of disclaimer of interest, shall be made in the name of the \nlisted owner or entryman, his heirs, devisees, successors, and assigns, \nand shall be in a form suitable for recordation and shall be filed and \nrecorded by the United States with the recorder of deeds or other like \nofficial of the county or counties within which the lands covered by \nsuch confirmatory -d-e-e-d document of disclaimer of interest are \nlocated so that the title to such lands may be determined in accordance \nwith applicable State law.\n    (2) The United States shall not adjudicate and, notwithstanding any \nprovision of law to the contrary, does not consent to be sued in any \nsuit instituted to adjudicate the ownership of, or to quiet title to, \nany base land included in a final list and described in a confirmatory \n-d-e-e-d document of disclaimer of interest .\n    (3) Neither the Secretary of the Interior nor the Secretary of \nAgriculture shall be required to inspect any lands included on a final \nlist nor to inform any member of the public regarding the condition of \nsuch lands prior to the issuance of the confirmatory -d-e-e-d-s \ndocuments of disclaimer of interest required by this subsection, and \nnothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting any valid rights \nwith respect to lands covered by a confirmatory -d-e-e-d document of \ndisclaimer of interest deed issued pursuant to this subsection that \nwere in existence on the date of issuance of such confirmatory -d-e-e-d \ndocument of disclaimer of interest.\n    (4) For purposes of this Act, the term ``document of disclaimer of \ninterest'' means a memorandum or other document, however styled or \ndescribed, that references the quitclaim made by subsection (a) of this \nsection and that meets the requirements for recordation established by \napplicable laws of the State in which the lands to which such document \nrefers are located.\n    (f) Waiver of Certain Claims Against the United States.--Any person \nor entity accepting the benefits of this Act or failing to act to seek \nsuch benefits within the time allotted by this Act with respect to any \nbase or other lands shall be deemed to have waived any claims against \nthe United States, its agents or contractors, with respect to such \nlands, or with respect to any revenues received by the United States \nfrom such lands prior to the date of enactment of this Act. All non-\nFederal, third party rights granted by the United States with respect \nto base lands shall remain effective subject to the terms and \nconditions of the authorizing document. The United States may reserve \nany rights-of-way currently occupied or used for Government purposes.\n\nSEC. 3.
