FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Senior citizens are the major consumers of prescription \n        drugs in the United States and are paying the highest prices \n        for prescription drugs.\n            (2) The discriminatory pricing practices of major drug \n        manufacturers results in senior citizens paying over twice the \n        price that drug manufacturers charge their most-favored \n        customers, such as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and \n        hospital chains.\n            (3) Medicare beneficiaries without prescription drug \n        coverage represent the most vulnerable segment of prescription \n        drug customers. Making prescription drugs available to them at \n        lower prices would lower the health care costs for this \n        population, improve the health and well-being of this \n        population and consequently, lower the cost to the taxpayers of \n        the Medicare program.\n            (4) Authorizing the wholesale purchase of prescription \n        drugs at the Federal Supply Schedule prices plus administrative \n        costs will result in a benefit to the Medicare population \n        without cost to the taxpayers.\n            (5) Authorizing similar benefits through hospice programs \n        will assist in extending the benefits of lower prescription \n        drug prices to those with terminal illnesses.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers and to \nmake prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at \nsubstantially reduced prices, by allowing pharmacies to purchase drugs \nfor Medicare beneficiaries at the substantially reduced price available \nunder the Federal Supply Schedule.\n\nSEC. 3.
