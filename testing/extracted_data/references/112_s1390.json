    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Tax Lien Simplification Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The present decentralized system for filing Federal tax \n        liens in local property offices, which was established before \n        the advent of modern computers, the Internet, and e-government \n        programs, is inefficient, burdensome, and expensive.\n            (2) Current technology permits the creation of a \n        centralized Federal tax lien filing system which can provide \n        for enhanced public notice of and access to accurate tax lien \n        information in a manner that is more efficient, more timely, \n        and less burdensome than the existing tax lien filing system; \n        which would expedite the release of liens; and which would be \n        less expensive for both taxpayers and users.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to simplify and modernize \nthe process for filing notices of Federal tax liens, to improve public \naccess to tax lien information, and to save taxpayer dollars by \nestablishing a nationwide, Internet accessible, and fully searchable \nfiling system for Federal tax liens which would replace the current \nsystem of local tax lien filings.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL TAX LIEN FILING SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Filing of Notice of Lien.--Subsection (f) of section 6323 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(f) Filing of Notice; Form.--\n            ``(1) Filing of notice.--The notice referred to in \n        subsection (a) shall be filed in the Federal tax lien registry \n        operated under subsection (k). The filing of a notice of lien, \n        or a certificate of release, discharge, subordination, or \n        nonattachment of lien, or a notice of withdrawal of a notice of \n        lien, in the Federal tax lien registry shall be effective for \n        purposes of determining lien priority regardless of the nature \n        or location of the property interest to which the lien \n        attaches.\n            ``(2) Form.--The form and content of the notice referred to \n        in subsection (a) shall be prescribed by the Secretary. Such \n        notice shall be valid notwithstanding any other provision of \n        law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien.\n            ``(3) Other national filing systems.--Once the Federal tax \n        lien registry is operational under subsection (k), the filing \n        of a notice of lien shall be governed by this title and shall \n        not be subject to any other Federal law establishing a place or \n        places for the filing of liens or encumbrances under a national \n        filing system.''.\n    (b) Refiling of Notice.--Paragraph (2) of section 6323(g)
