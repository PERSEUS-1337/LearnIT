FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In its 2007 report, Beyond Bias and Barriers, the \n        National Academies state that, to maintain its scientific and \n        engineering leadership amid increasing economic and educational \n        globalization, the United States must aggressively pursue the \n        innovative capacity of all of its people--women and men.\n            (2) Women make up an increasing proportion of science and \n        engineering majors at all institutions of higher education, \n        including at top-rated programs such as those at the \n        Massachusetts Institute of Technology where women make up 51 \n        percent of its science undergraduates and 35 percent of its \n        engineering undergraduates.\n            (3) Despite this progress, however, women still receive \n        only 20 percent of all bachelor's degrees awarded in \n        engineering and physics.\n            (4) For women to participate to their full potential across \n        all science and engineering fields, they must see a career path \n        that allows them to reach their full intellectual potential; \n        much remains to be done to achieve that goal.\n            (5) The Federal Government provides over 60 percent of \n        research funding at institutions of higher education.\n            (6) Women are a small portion of the science and \n        engineering faculty members at major research universities, and \n        they typically receive fewer institutional resources for their \n        research activities than their male colleagues.\n            (7) Unintentional biases and outmoded institutional \n        structures are hindering the access and advancement of women in \n        science and engineering.\n            (8) Women hold a small portion of leadership positions in \n        our institutions of higher education, scientific and \n        professional societies, and honorary organizations.\n            (9) Neither our institutions of higher education nor our \n        Nation can afford such underuse of precious human capital in \n        science and engineering.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n            (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n        the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive \n        Office of the President, acting through the National Science \n        and Technology Council.\n            (2) Federal science agency.--The term ``Federal science \n        agency'' means any Federal agency that is responsible for at \n        least 2 percent of the total Federal obligation for research \n        and development at institutions of higher education, according \n        to the most recent data available from the National Science \n        Foundation.\n            (3) Institution of higher education.--The term \n        ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given such \n        term in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n        U.S.C. 1001(a)).\n\nSEC. 4.
