FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \n        established the National Urban Search and Rescue Response \n        System in 1989 pursuant to requirement in the Earthquakes \n        Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 which directed FEMA to provide \n        adequate search and rescue capacity in the event of an \n        earthquake;\n            (2) once the President has issued a major disaster \n        declaration following a request by a governor, FEMA may \n        activate up to three task forces that are closest to the \n        disaster and additional task forces may be activated as \n        necessary;\n            (3) each task force must be able to deploy all personnel \n        and equipment within six hours of activation and are expected \n        to be able to sustain themselves for the first 72 hours of \n        operations;\n            (4) each task force must be capable of deploying at least \n        62 fully trained individuals, with each position staffed three \n        deep to ensure the availability of at least two alternatives \n        available in reserve for each position for a total of 186 \n        members in each task force;\n            (5) task forces are supported by Incident Support Teams \n        which provide technical assistance to state and local emergency \n        managers, coordinate the activities of multiple task forces, \n        and provide logistical support;\n            (6) in fiscal year 2001, FEMA provided $7,200,000 to the \n        task forces for training and equipment, allocated according to \n        need;\n            (7) in fiscal year 2001, FEMA provided some $6,000,000 for \n        upgrading the capability of six task forces to respond to \n        disaster resulting from the use of weapons of mass destruction, \n        including the capacity to search and provide assistance in an \n        environment with chemical, biological, or radiological \n        contamination;\n            (8) there currently are 28 task forces throughout the \n        United States;\n            (9) since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the \n        need for fully equipped and trained task forces is obvious;\n            (10) by noon of September 12, 2001, eight task forces were \n        working valiantly with the courageous New York firefighters to \n        address the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the World \n        Trade Center, four task forces responded to the attacks on the \n        Pentagon, and 25 of 28 task forces were deployed over a three-\n        week period;\n            (11) each task force is currently in need of additional \n        training and support equipment with each task force being \n        deployed with some 80,000 pounds of search, rescue, and support \n        equipment valued at some $1,800,000;\n            (12) each task force is supported by some $150,000 per year \n        in operating costs with needs of approximately $1,500,000 to \n        maintain optimum operational efficiency;\n            (13) many task forces have inadequate transportation to \n        ensure a timely response to disasters, including acts of \n        terrorism;\n            (14) the cost of maintaining FEMA's Incident Support Teams \n        as part of the search and rescue task forces is $5,000,000 per \n        year;\n            (15) the Federal Government needs to ensure that each task \n        force is adequately trained and equipped to perform urban \n        search and rescue functions in all environments, including the \n        aftermath from acts of terrorism involving weapons of mass \n        destruction;\n            (16) the Federal Government needs to ensure that each task \n        force has adequate equipment to meet all operational needs and \n        staff support;\n            (17) the Federal Government needs to ensure that each task \n        force has the capability to put two full teams in the field to \n        meet any disaster or act of terrorism;\n            (18) the Federal Government needs to ensure that designated \n        task forces have the capability to deploy internationally to \n        provide search and rescue functions vital to our interests and \n        those of our allies; and\n            (19) while these task forces were originally created for \n        earthquake response, these highly capable task forces have an \n        expanding and vital role in responding to acts of terrorism, \n        including those involving weapons of mass destruction.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this act is to provide the needed \nfunds, equipment, and training to ensure that all urban search and \nrescue task forces have the full capability to respond to all emergency \nsearch and rescue needs arising from any disaster, including acts of \nterrorism involving a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nSEC. 103.
