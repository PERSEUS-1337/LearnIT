FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Involvement in sports can have tremendous benefits for \n        the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development of \n        students.\n            (2) All students have the right to know the risks of \n        concussions because concussions, though a mild traumatic brain \n        injury, present such a significant risk to not only the \n        physical well-being of a developing student, but also the \n        academic performance of the student.\n            (3) Mild traumatic brain injuries, including concussions, \n        represent 80 to 90 percent of all traumatic brain injuries.\n            (4) Children and adolescents are more vulnerable to brain \n        injury than adults because their brains are still developing.\n            (5) Surveys suggest that the prevalence of sport-related \n        concussions is much higher than reported and the occurrence of \n        concussions is higher at the high school level than at the \n        collegiate level. According to recent research, 400,000 \n        students sustained a concussion while participating in five \n        different sports in a high school athletics program during the \n        2005-2008 school years. Few statistics are available for the 41 \n        million children participating in non-scholastic youth sports, \n        but schools report that concussions are occurring on the \n        playground and during physical education classes.\n            (6) A recent study estimated that more than 40 percent of \n        high school athletes return to participate in school athletics \n        before they have fully recovered from concussions, which \n        increases the susceptibility of the student athlete to greater \n        injury or death.\n            (7) The failure to recognize brain injuries and the \n        mismanagement of such injuries increases the vulnerability of a \n        student athlete to successive injury, cumulative negative \n        health consequences, or chronic impairment.\n            (8) Timely recognition and response to concussions aids \n        recovery and helps prevent successive injury, chronic \n        impairment, or death. Only 42 percent of schools have access to \n        an athletic trainer and only 53 percent of schools meet the \n        nurse-to-student ratio recommended by the Federal Government.\n            (9) Concussion treatment and management is sporadic in \n        schools and often neglects the athlete's role as a student.\n            (10) Medical care from hospitalization and emergency room \n        visits due to a concussion is costly, and treatment is often \n        arbitrary.\n            (11) Students should gradually return to physical activity \n        and academic activities only as the symptoms of a concussion \n        permit because research suggests that overexertion from \n        physical activity and academic activities exacerbates symptoms \n        and protracts recovery time for student athletes.\n            (12) Instituting best practices offers a reasonable means \n        for protecting student athletes from the risks and consequences \n        of concussions.\n\nSEC. 3. MINIMUM STATE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    Beginning with fiscal year 2013, in order to be eligible to receive \nfunds for such year or a subsequent fiscal year under the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) each State \neducational agency shall issue regulations establishing the following \nminimum requirements:\n            (1) Local educational agency concussion safety and \n        management plan.--Each local educational agency in the State, \n        in consultation with members of the community in which such \n        agency is located, shall develop and implement a standard plan \n        for concussion safety and management that includes--\n                    (A) the education of students, parents, and school \n                personnel about concussions, such as--\n                            (i) the training and certification of \n                        school personnel, including coaches, athletic \n                        trainers, and school nurses, on concussion \n                        safety and management; and\n                            (ii) using and maintaining standardized \n                        release forms, treatment plans, observation, \n                        monitoring and reporting forms, recordkeeping \n                        forms, and post-injury fact sheets;\n                    (B) supports for students recovering from a \n                concussion, such as--\n                            (i) guiding such student in resuming \n                        participation in athletic activity and academic \n                        activities with the help of a multi-\n                        disciplinary team, which may include--\n                                    (I) a health care professional, the \n                                parents of such student, a school \n                                nurse, or other relevant school \n                                personnel; and\n                                    (II) an individual who is assigned \n                                by a public school to oversee and \n                                manage the recovery of such student;\n                            (ii) providing appropriate academic \n                        accommodations; and\n                            (iii) referring students whose symptoms of \n                        concussion reemerge or persist upon the \n                        reintroduction of cognitive and physical \n                        demands for evaluation of the eligibility of \n                        such students for services under the Individual \n                        with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 \n                        et seq.) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 \n                        U.S.C. 701 note et seq.); and\n                    (C) best practices designed to ensure, with respect \n                to concussions, the uniformity of safety standards, \n                treatment, and management, such as--\n                            (i) disseminating information on concussion \n                        management safety and management to the public;
