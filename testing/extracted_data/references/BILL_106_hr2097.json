FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The U.S.S. New Jersey was launched December 7, 1942, \n        the start of nearly 50 years of dedicated service to our Nation \n        prior to final decommissioning in 1991.\n            (2) After commissioning, the U.S.S. New Jersey was sent to \n        the Pacific, and played a key role in operations in the \n        Marshalls, Marianas, Carolines, Philippines, Iwo Jima, and \n        Okinawa, with a particular highlight being the U.S.S. New \n        Jersey's service as the flagship for Commander 3d Fleet, \n        Admiral William ``Bull'' Halsey, during the Battle of Leyte \n        Gulf in October 1944.\n            (3) After the Allied victory in World War II, the U.S.S. \n        New Jersey was deactivated in 1948 until being called to \n        service for the second time, in November 1950.\n            (4) The U.S.S. New Jersey served two tours in the Western \n        Pacific during the Korean War, serving as flagship for \n        Commander 7th Fleet.\n            (5) After her valiant service during the Korean War, the \n        U.S.S.

New Jersey served a successful tour during \n        the Vietnam conflict, providing critical major-caliber fire \n        support for friendly troops, before again being decommissioned \n        in December 1969.\n            (7) The U.S.S. New Jersey's service to our country did not \n        end with the Vietnam conflict, as she was again called to \n        active duty status in December 1982 and provided a show of \n        strength off the coast of Nicaragua, in Central America in \n        1983.\n            (8) The Navy again called upon the U.S.S. New Jersey to \n        provide critical support by sending her to the Mediterranean in \n        1983 to provide critical fire support to Marines in embattled \n        Beirut, Lebanon.\n            (9) The U.S.S. New Jersey continued to serve the Navy in a \n        variety of roles, including regular deployments in the Western \n        Pacific.\n            (10) The U.S.S. New Jersey was decommissioned for the \n        fourth and final time in February 1991.\n            (11) In 1998 Congress passed legislation to decommission \n        the U.S.S. New Jersey and permanently berth her in the State of \n        New Jersey.\n            (12) The State has strongly endorsed bringing the U.S.S. \n        New Jersey home, and has issued commemorative license plates \n        and taken other steps to raise funds for the costs of \nrelocating the U.S.S. New Jersey.\n            (13) The New Jersey congressional delegation is united in \n        its support for bringing the U.S.S. New Jersey home to New \n        Jersey.\n\nSEC. 3.
