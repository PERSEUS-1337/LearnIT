TRANSITION TO SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Within 180 days after the close of fishing year \n2010 (within the meaning given that term in the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802 et seq.), the \nSecretary of Commerce shall determine, with respect to each fishery for \nwhich a fishery management plan that meets the requirements of section \n303(a)(15) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1853(a)(15)) is in effect that \ncontains a complete prohibition on the retention of stocks subject to \noverfishing within the fishery for the entire fishing season, whether \nthe prohibition is sufficient to prevent or end overfishing for the \nstocks, or stocks undergoing overfishing, to which it applies.\n    (b) Remedial Action.--If the Secretary determines that the \nprohibition contained in such a fishery management plan is not \nsufficient to prevent or end overfishing for the stocks to which it \napplies, the Secretary may authorize retention of fish that are not \nundergoing overfishing within that fishery, notwithstanding that \ndiscard mortality of stocks for which retention is prohibited may be \ninconsistent with provisions on ending or preventing overfishing, if, \nwithin 90 days after a determination by the Secretary under subsection \n(a), the Regional Fishery Management Council with jurisdiction over the \nfishery implements--\n            (1) measures to minimize bycatch and bycatch mortality to \n        the extent practicable;\n            (2) an enhanced data collection requirement, such as an \n        electronic logbook data collection system, for recreational, \n        for hire, and commercial fishers;\n            (3) a program of on-board observers for charter, for-hire, \n        and commercial fishers that will monitor and collect data on \n        bycatch and bycatch mortality in multispecies fisheries with \n        prohibitions on retention on one or more species in the \n        fisheries; and\n            (4) in coordination with the Secretary, other measures to \n        ensure accountability of the fishery, including those that will \n        substantially contribute to addressing data gaps in stock \n        assessments.\n    (c) Additional Requirements.--The Secretary shall take such action \nas may be necessary to ensure that, with respect to any stock subject \nto overfishing in a fishery to which a determination under subsection \n(b) applies--\n            (1) a monitoring and research program to monitor the \n        recovery of the affected stocks of fish is implemented for the \n        fishery within 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act;\n            (2) a stock assessment for the overfished species within \n        the affected stocks of fish is initiated, taking into account \n        relevant life history of the stock, within 6 months after the \n        date on which the Secretary makes such a determination; and\n            (3) the Regional Fishery Management Council with \n        jurisdiction over the affected fishery submits a report to \n        Congress and the Secretary detailing a long-term plan for \n        reducing discard mortality of the affected stocks of fish to \n        which a determination under subsection (a) applies within 2 \n        years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (d) Further Action Required.--If the Secretary determines that--\n            (1) the Regional Fishery Management Council with \n        jurisdiction over a fishery has complied with the requirements \n        of paragraphs (b) and (c), and\n            (2) the fishery management plan's prohibition on the \n        retention of stocks subject to overfishing continues to be \n        insufficient to prevent or end overfishing for those stocks,\nthe Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to end \noverfishing for the stocks to which the prohibition applies before the \nend of fishery year 2015.\n\nSEC. 3. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 208 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (16 U.S.C. \n1891b) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' after the semicolon in subsection \n        (b)(6);\n            (2) by striking ``materia.'' in subsection (b)(7) and \n        inserting ``materia; and'';\n            (3) by adding at the end of subsection (b) the following:\n            ``(8) the economic assistance program under subsection \n        (f).'';\n            (4) by striking ``and'' after the semicolon in subsection \n        (c)(2)(A);\n            (5) by striking ``section.'' in subsection (c)(2)(B) and \n        inserting ``section; and'';\n            (6) by adding at the end of subsection (c)(2) the \n        following:\n                    ``(C) fees collected under permit programs for a \n                fishery significantly affected by a prohibition on the \n                retention of stocks to end or prevent overfishing.''; \n                and\n            (7) by adding at the end thereof the following:\n    ``(f) Economic Assistance Program.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish an \n        economic assistance program to assist recreational and \n        commercial fishery participants, fishing industries, and \n        fishing communities significantly affected by a prohibition on \n        the retention of stocks to end or prevent overfishing or \n        rebuild overfished stocks and use amounts in the Fund to \n        provide such assistance.\n            ``(2) Criteria for assistance.--In the administration of \n        the program, the Secretary shall develop criteria for \n        prioritizing economic assistance requests, including \n        consideration of the conservation and management history of the \n        fishery, the sustainability of conservation and management \n        approaches, the magnitude of the economic impact of the \n        retention prohibition, and community and social impacts.\n            ``(3) Application process.--The Secretary shall develop an \n        application process to determine eligibility for economic \n        assistance under the program and shall consult with States \n        whose recreational and commercial fishery participants, fishing \n        industries, or fishing communities have been affected by the \n        prohibition.

An emergency may include increasing or decreasing a \ncatch limit, or modifying a time or area closure or retention \nprohibition in response to new science or stock assessment information, \nbut only if such action is needed to address serious conservation or \nmanagement problems in the fishery.''.\n\nSEC. 5. FISHERY STUDIES AND REPORTS.\n\n    Status of Fishery Report.--Section 304(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1854(e)) is \namended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(A)'' before ``The Secretary'';\n            (2) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses \n        (i) and (ii); and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(B) In the review, the Secretary shall consider--\n            ``(i) a stock assessment conducted pursuant to subsection \n        (c);\n            ``(ii) an analysis of the local, regional, and national \n        social and economic impacts on fishing communities and \n        industries directly and indirectly related to the fishery; and\n            ``(iii) fishery management measures to enhance the \n        sustainability of stocks of fish that are overfished, and an \n        evaluation of alternative management approaches that may be \n        implemented to enhance such sustainability.\n    ``(C) Stock assessment updates for each stock of fish that is \noverfished or undergoing overfishing shall be conducted at 2 year \nintervals, and a full stock assessment pursuant to subsection (c) shall \nbe conducted no less frequently than once every 5 years.\n    ``(D) The Secretary shall include a summary of reviews conducted \nunder subparagraph (A) in the report required by paragraph (1) of this \nsubsection.
