MODERN-DAY SLAVERY.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``modern-day slavery'' means the recruitment, \nharboring, transportation, receipt, procurement, or control of persons \nthrough the use of force, fraud, coercion, abduction, deception, abuse \nof power, or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or \nreceiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person \nhaving control over another person, for the purpose of subjection to \ndebt bondage, serfdom, involuntary servitude, forced labor, chattel, \nforced marriage, peonage, sexual exploitation, or trafficking.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Declaration of Independence recognizes the inherent \n        dignity and worth of all people and states that all people are \n        created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain \n        unalienable rights, and the right to be free from slavery and \n        involuntary servitude is among those unalienable rights.\n            (2) Despite international laws outlawing modern-day \n        slavery, modern-day slavery affects virtually every country in \n        the world, and as many as 27,000,000 people are victims. \n        Modern-day slavery is one of the fastest growing areas of \n        international criminal activity and is an increasing concern to \n        the United States Administration, Congress, and the \n        international community; the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n        estimated that modern-day slavery generates over $9,000,000,000 \n        every year.\n            (3) Traffickers use threats, intimidation manipulation, \n        coercion, fraud, shame, and violence to force victims into \n        modern-day slavery. Traffickers capitalize on areas of conflict \n        and post-conflict, transitioning states, sudden political \n        change, economic collapse, civil unrest, internal armed \n        conflict, chronic unemployment, widespread poverty, personal \n        disaster, lack of economic opportunity, and natural disasters.\n            (4) Modern-day slavery: contributes to the breakdown of \n        societies due to the loss of family support networks; has a \n        negative impact on the labor market in countries; brutalizes \n        men, women, and children and exposes them to rape, torture, \n        HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, violence, \n        dangerous working conditions, poor nutrition, drug and alcohol \n        addiction, severe psychological trauma from separation, \n        coercion, sexual abuse, and depression; and strips human beings \n        of dignity, respect, and hope for their future.\n            (5) The United States has given priority to combating human \n        trafficking through the Victims of Trafficking and Violence \n        Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-386) and the Trafficking \n        Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-\n        164).\n            (6) The State Department issued its sixth congressionally \n        mandated Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP) in June, 2006, \n        which categorizes countries into tiered groups according to the \n        efforts they are making to combat trafficking. The countries \n        that do not cooperate in the fight against trafficking (Tier 3 \n        Countries) have been made subject to United States sanctions \n        since 2003, under the President's direction.\n\nSEC. 4.
