DEFINITIONS.\n\n            (1) The term ``lobbyist'' means any individual who is \n        employed or retained by another for financial or other \n        compensation to perform services that include lobbying \n        contacts, other than an individual whose lobbying activities \n        are only incidental to, and are not a significant part of, the \n        services provided by such individual to the client.\n            (2) The term ``client'' means any person who employs or \n        retains another person for financial or other compensation to \n        conduct lobbying activities on its own behalf.

In the case of a \n        coalition or association that employs or retains persons to \n        conduct lobbying activities on behalf of its membership, the \n        client is the coalition or association and not its individual \n        members.\n            (3) The term ``lobbying activities'' means lobbying \n        contacts and efforts in support of such contacts, including \n        preparation and planning activities, research and other \n        background work that is intended for use in contacts, and \n        coordination with the lobbying activities of others.
