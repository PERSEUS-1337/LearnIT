suspend, or terminate any \n        economic sanction (or portion thereof) with respect to a \n        foreign country, if the President determines and reports to \n        Congress that initiating or

of any sanction \n        delayed or suspended under paragraph (1), the President may \n        impose or resume imposition of the sanction, as the case may \n        be, if the President notifies the appropriate congressional \n        committees 30 days in advance.\n    (b) Contents of Reports.--\n            (1) In general.--A report submitted under subsection (a) \n        shall contain a description of the sanction (or portion \n        thereof) that the President proposes to delay, suspend, or \n        terminate and a detailed explanation of the events that have \n        occurred to make the imposition or continuation of the sanction \n        not in United States important national interests.\n            (2) With respect to suspended sanctions.--In the case of \n        any sanction delayed or suspended under subsection (a), the \n        report required by that subsection shall include a statement of \n        the terms and conditions under which the sanction is delayed

termination of a sanction (or portion \n        thereof) described in a report submitted pursuant to subsection \n        (a), the suspension or termination shall take effect 30 days \n        after the President has submitted such report to Congress, \n        unless before that time, Congress has enacted a joint \n        resolution disapproving the determination made under subsection \n        (a).\n            (2) Delays of sanctions.--In the case of a delay of a \n        sanction described in a report submitted pursuant to subsection \n        (a), the delay of a new sanction shall take effect immediately \n        following the submission of a report to Congress under \n        subsection (b)(1) of this section and shall remain in effect \n        until the President determines

representatives.--For the purpose of \n        expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions \n        under this section, a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n        any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the \n        appropriate committee shall be treated as highly privileged in \n        the House of Representatives.\n    (e) Definitions.--In this
