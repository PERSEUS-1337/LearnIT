    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Agricultural Export Facilitation Act \nof 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The export sector of United States agriculture makes an \n        important positive contribution to this country's trade \n        balance.\n            (2) According to the United States Department of \n        Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service, the total value of \n        United States exports of agricultural products shipped to Cuba \n        since 2000 when such sales were first authorized by Congress is \n        approximately $2,511,600,000, excluding transportation, port \n        fees, and insurance costs beyond the port of exportation. \n        During the 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 \n        calendar years Cuba purchased from United States exporters \n        approximately $4,600,000; $139,800,000; $247,600,000; \n        $383,900,000; $346,000,000; $320,800,000; $431,200,000; and \n        $691,103,000 in food and agricultural products, respectively. \n        Cuba is therefore an important source of revenue for United \n        States agriculture and its affiliated industries, such as \n        manufacturers and distributors of value-added food products.\n            (3) To be competitive in sales to Cuban purchasers, United \n        States exporters of agricultural products and their \n        representatives, including representatives of United States air \n        or sea carriers, ports, and shippers, must have ready and \n        reliable physical access to Cuba. Such access is currently \n        uncertain because, under existing regulations, United States \n        exporters and their representatives must apply for and receive \n        special Department of the Treasury licenses to travel to Cuba \n        to engage in sales-related activities. The issuance of such \n        licenses is subject to both administrative delays and periodic \n        denials. A blanket statutory authorization for sales and \n        transport-related travel to Cuba by United States exporters \n        will remove the current bureaucratic impediment to agricultural \n        product sales endorsed by Congress when it passed the Trade \n        Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.\n            (4) On many occasions visas to enter the United States have \n        been delayed and often denied to prospective Cuban purchasers \n        of products authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and \n        Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The result has been that family \n        farmers and other small producers and distributors of \n        agricultural products who lack the resources to fund sales \n        delegations to Cuba have been denied access to potential \n        purchasers in that country. A simple solution is to issue visas \n        to Cuban nationals who demonstrate an itinerary of meetings \n        with prospective United States exporters of products authorized \n        under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of \n        2000. In addition, visas should be issued to Cuban \n        phytosanitary inspectors who require entry into the United \n        States to conduct on-premise inspections of production and \n        processing facilities and the products of potential United \n        States exporters.\n            (5) The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act \n        of 2000 requires ``payment of cash in advance'' for United \n        States agricultural exports to Cuba. Some Federal agencies \n        responsible for the implementation of the Trade Sanctions \n        Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 have expressed the \n        view that ``cash in advance'' requires that payment be received \n        by a United States exporter in advance of shipment of goods to \n        Cuba. Indeed, in late 2004 payments due United States exporters \n        from purchasers in Cuba were frozen in United States banks \n        while the terms of those payments were reviewed unnecessarily. \n        This action by the Department of the Treasury has created a \n        climate of commercial uncertainty that has inhibited \n        agricultural sales to Cuba under the Trade Sanctions Reform and \n        Export Enhancement Act of 2000.\n            (6) There is nothing in either the Trade Sanctions Reform \n        and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 itself or its legislative \n        history to support the view that Congress intended payment to \n        be made in advance of the shipment of goods from the United \n        States to Cuba. It was and is the intent of Congress that a \n        seller of a product authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform \n        and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 receive payment only before \n        a Cuban purchaser takes physical possession of that product.\n            (7) At present it is the policy of the United States \n        Government to prohibit direct payment between Cuban and United \n        States financial institutions. As a result, Cuban purchasers of \n        products authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n        Enhancement Act of 2000 must route their payments through third \n        country banks that charge a fee for this service. Allowing \n        direct payments between Cuban and United States financial \n        institutions will permit the United States exporters to receive \n        payment directly to their financial institutions within hours \n        instead of days and will eliminate an unnecessary transactional \n        fee, thereby allowing Cuban purchasers to purchase more United \n        States origin agricultural products.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to restate the intent of \nCongress with respect to the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \nEnhancement Act of 2000, to remove impediments to present and future \nsales of United States agricultural products to Cuba under such Act, \nand to otherwise facilitate such sales.\n\nSEC. 3.
