FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Each year tens of thousands of young people are \n        initiated into the drug culture at ``rave'' parties or events \n        (all-night, alcohol-free dance parties typically featuring \n        loud, pounding dance music).\n            (2) Some raves are held in dance clubs with only a handful \n        of people in attendance. Other raves are held at temporary \n        venues such as warehouses, open fields, or empty buildings, \n        with tens of thousands of people present.\n            (3) The trafficking and use of ``club drugs'', including 3, \n        4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy or MDMA), Ketamine \n        hydrochloride (Ketamine), Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), and Gamma \n        hydroxybutyrate (GHB), is deeply embedded in the rave culture.\n            (4) Many rave promoters go to great lengths to try to \n        portray their events as alcohol-free parties that are safe \n        places for young adults to go to dance with friends, and some \n        even go so far as to hire off-duty, uniformed police officers \n        to patrol outside of the venue to give parents the impression \n        that the event is safe.\n            (5) Despite such efforts to convince parents that raves are \n        safe, promotional flyers with slang terms for Ecstasy or \n        pictures of Ecstasy pills send the opposite message to \n        teenagers, and in effect promote Ecstasy along with the rave. \n        According to the National Drug Intelligence Center, raves have \n        become little more than a way to exploit American youth.\n            (6) Because rave promoters know that Ecstasy causes the \n        body temperature in a user to rise and as a result causes the \n        user to become very thirsty, many rave promoters facilitate and \n        profit from flagrant drug use at rave parties or events by \n        selling over-priced bottles of water and charging entrance fees \n        to ``chill-rooms'' where users can cool down.\n            (7) To enhance the effects of the drugs that patrons have \n        ingested, rave promoters sell--\n                    (A) neon glow sticks;\n                    (B) massage oils;\n                    (C) menthol nasal inhalers; and\n                    (D) pacifiers that are used to combat the \n                involuntary teeth clenching associated with Ecstasy.\n            (8) Ecstasy is the most popular of the club drugs \n        associated with raves. Thousands of teenagers are treated for \n        overdoses and Ecstasy-related health problems in emergency \n        rooms each year. The Drug Abuse Warning Network reports that \n        Ecstasy mentions in emergency visits grew 1,040 percent between \n        1994 and 1999.\n            (9) Ecstasy damages neurons in the brain which contain \n        serotonin, the chemical responsible for mood, sleeping and \n        eating habits, thinking processes, aggressive behavior, sexual \n        function, and sensitivity to pain. According to the National \n        Institute on Drug Abuse, this can lead to long-term brain \n        damage that is still evident 6 to 7 years after Ecstasy use.\n            (10) An Ecstasy overdose is characterized by an increased \n        heart rate, hypertension, renal failure, visual hallucinations, \n        and overheating of the body (some Ecstasy deaths have occurred \n        after the core body temperature of the user goes as high as 110 \n        degrees, causing all major organ systems to shutdown and \n        muscles to breakdown), and may cause heart attacks, strokes, \n        and seizures.\n\nSEC. 3. OFFENSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 416(a) of the Controlled Substances Act \n(21 U.S.C. 856(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``open or maintain any \n        place'' and inserting ``open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any \n        place, whether permanently or temporarily,''; and\n            (2) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n            ``(2) manage or control any place, whether permanently or \n        temporarily, either as an owner, lessee, agent, employee, \n        occupant, or mortgagee, and knowingly and intentionally rent, \n        lease, profit from, or make available for use, with or without \n        compensation, the place for the purpose of unlawfully \n        manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled \n        substance.''.\n    (b) Technical Amendment.--The heading to section 416 of the \nControlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 856) is amended to read as \nfollows:\n\n``SEC. 416.
