(back) The problem for dates is even moreacute than simply reclaiming lost market share. Demand for dates in international markets is likelyquite inelastic -- i.e., not very price responsive. Therefore, any significant increase in supplies of dates oninternational markets is likelyto lead to substantially greater declines in the international market price. 72. (back) Gazdar and Hussain (2002), p. 62. 73. (back) These data should be viewed withcaution. Although they are from FAOSTAT, they reflect the data officially reported by the Iraqigovernment to the FAO. Rising usage rates may be more a reflection of declining area to which fertilizer is applied,rather than increasingwidespread availability.  74. (back) Ahmad (2002), p. 191. 75.

However, this official rate bears no relationship with thecurrency's true value. The black market rate has shown considerable variation over the past decade, often in relationto the U.N. sanctionsstatus and international petroleum prices. During 1996 the dinar rose from its lowest value of ID3,000 per U.S.dollar to ID1,000, reportedlyin anticipation of the adoption and implementation of the OFFP. [Ahmad (2002), p.174.] In March 2003, the blackmarket rate wasestimated to be U.S. $1 = 2,700 ID. [ The Economist , Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Report: Iraq,April 2003 Updater.] 91.
