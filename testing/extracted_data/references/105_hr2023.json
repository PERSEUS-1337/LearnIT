FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Women have entered the workforce in record numbers.\n            (2) Even in the 1990s, women earn significantly lower pay \n        than men for work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and \n        responsibility and that are performed under similar working \n        conditions.\n            (3) The existence of such pay disparities--\n                    (A) depresses the wages of working families who \n                rely on the wages of all members of the family to make \n                ends meet;\n                    (B) prevents the optimum utilization of available \n                labor resources;\n                    (C) has been spread and perpetuated, through \n                commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of \n                commerce, among the workers of the several States;\n                    (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n                commerce;\n                    (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition in \n                commerce;\n                    (F) leads to labor disputes burdening and \n                obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in \n                commerce; and\n                    (G) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing \n                of goods in commerce.\n            (4)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n        discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex \n        continue to exist more than 3 decades after the enactment of \n        the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) \n        and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).\n            (B) Elimination of such barriers would have positive \n        effects, including--\n                    (i) providing a solution to problems in the economy \n                created by unfair pay disparities;\n                    (ii) substantially reducing the number of working \n                women earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the \n                dependence on public assistance; and\n                    (iii) promoting stable families by enabling all \n                family members to earn a fair rate of pay.\n            (5) Only with increased information about the provisions \n        added by the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and generalized wage data, \n        along with more effective remedies, will women recognize and \n        enforce their rights to equal pay for work on jobs that require \n        equal skill, effort, and responsibility and that are performed \n        under similar working conditions.\n            (6) Certain employers have already made great strides in \n        eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their \n        achievements should be recognized.\n\nSEC. 3.
