    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Education Technology Corps \nAct'' or as the ``NET Corps Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Elementary and secondary school students who receive \n        regular access in school to Internet-accessible computers enjoy \n        higher quality educational opportunities and are better \n        prepared to succeed in college or the workplace.\n            (2) Local educational agencies have made extraordinary \n        gains in the acquisition of computers and other information \n        technology equipment for schools. The Department of Education \n        reported in January 2001 that each school contains on average \n        100 computers. In 1999, 63 percent of school rooms used for the \n        instruction of students had access to the Internet.\n            (3) However, local educational agencies are dedicating \n        almost all of their information technology resources to \n        equipment acquisition, while information technology training \n        for teachers and other school staff receives little financial \n        support. A CEO Forum on Education and Technology study \n        indicated that, in the 1997-1998 school year, schools expended \n        just five percent of their information technology budget on \n        teacher training.\n            (4) The Department of Education reported in 1999 that only \n        33 percent of public school teachers with access to computers \n        and the Internet indicated that they were ``well prepared'' to \n        integrate the use of computers and the Internet into their \n        instruction.\n            (5) As new information technologies are introduced into \n        classrooms, teachers will need regular access to professional \n        technology training.\n            (6) The Corporation for National and Community Service \n        established by section 191 of the National and Community \n        Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12651) has a proven record of \n        mobilizing the most intelligent, qualified, and altruistic \n        members of our communities for the purpose of meeting our \n        Nation's most urgent needs.\n            (7) The Volunteers in Service to America program, commonly \n        known as VISTA, which is administered by the Corporation to \n        efforts to eliminate and alleviate poverty and poverty-related \n        problems in the United States, would provide a ready means to \n        facilitate the expanded use of information technology in \n        schools, libraries, and community centers, particularly in low-\n        income areas, and to provide information technology training \n        for teachers and administrators of school, library, and \n        community center information technology networks.\n\nSEC. 3. CREATION OF NATIONAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY CORPS AS A PART OF \n              VISTA.\n\n    The Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 is amended by inserting \nafter section 109 (42 U.S.C. 4959) the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 109A.
