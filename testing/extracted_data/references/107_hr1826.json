    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Alternative Routes to Teacher \nCertification and Licensure Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. PROGRAM REAUTHORIZED.\n\n    The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended by inserting after \ntitle VII (20 U.S.C. 1133 et seq.) the following new title:\n\n``TITLE VIII--ALTERNATIVE ROUTES TO TEACHER CERTIFICATION AND LICENSURE\n\n``SEC. 801. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``The Congress finds that--\n            ``(1) effective elementary and secondary schools require \n        competent teachers and strong leadership;\n            ``(2) school systems would benefit greatly by increasing \n        the pool of qualified individuals from which to recruit \n        teachers;\n            ``(3) many talented professionals who have demonstrated a \n        high level of subject area competence outside the education \n        profession may wish to pursue careers in education, but have \n        not fulfilled the requirements to be certified or licensed as \n        teachers;\n            ``(4) alternative routes can enable qualified individuals \n        to fulfill State certification or licensure requirements and \n        would allow school systems to utilize the expertise of such \n        professionals and improve the pool of qualified individuals \n        available to local educational agencies as teachers; and\n            ``(5) alternative routes to certification or licensure \n        requirements that do not exclude qualified individuals from \n        teaching solely because such individuals do not meet \n        traditional certification or licensure requirements would allow \n        school systems to take advantage of these professionals and \n        improve the supply of well-qualified teachers.\n\n``SEC. 802. PURPOSE.\n\n    ``It is the purpose of this title to improve the supply of well-\nqualified elementary and secondary school teachers by encouraging and \nassisting States to develop and implement programs for alternative \nroutes to teacher certification or licensure requirements. Such \nprograms shall place special emphasis on the participation of \nindividuals who are members of minority groups.\n\n``SEC. 803. ALLOTMENTS.\n\n    ``(a) Allotments to States.--\n            ``(1) In general.--From the amount appropriated to carry \n        out this title, the Secretary shall allot to each State the \n        lesser of either the amount the State applies for under section \n        556 or an amount that is proportional to the State's share of \n        the total population of children ages 5 through 17 in all the \n        States (based on the most recent data available that is \n        satisfactory to the Secretary).\n            ``(2) Reallocation.--If a State does not apply for its \n        allotment, or the full amount of its allotment, under the \n        preceding paragraph, the Secretary may reallocate the excess \n        funds to one or more other States that demonstrate, to the \n        satisfaction of the Secretary, a current need for the funds.\n    ``(b) Special Rule.--Notwithstanding section 412(b) of the General \nEducation Provisions Act, funds awarded under this title shall remain \navailable for obligation by a recipient for a period of 2 calendar \nyears from the date of the grant.\n\n``SEC. 804.
