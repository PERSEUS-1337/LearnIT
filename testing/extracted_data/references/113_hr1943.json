FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Carbon dioxide is estimated to account for 55 to 60 \n        percent of anthropogenic radiative forcing (or manmade global \n        warming), while the remainder is driven by non-carbon dioxide \n        climate pollutants, primarily short-lived climate pollutants. \n        These short-lived climate pollutants, or ``super pollutants'', \n        have shorter atmospheric lifespans than carbon dioxide but \n        cause much more warming per molecule, and in many cases the \n        emissions are growing much faster than carbon dioxide.\n            (2) Several of the short-lived climate pollutants are also \n        potent air pollutants that harm human health and reduce crop \n        yields. Reducing these pollutants can save thousands of lives \n        every year in the United States and millions globally, while \n        also increasing agricultural production.\n            (3) International efforts to address short-lived climate \n        pollutants are underway, including the Climate and Clean Air \n        Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants, led by the \n        Department of State and the United Nations Environment \n        Programme, the Global Methane Initiative, and the negotiation \n        of amendments to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that \n        Deplete the Ozone Layer.\n            (4) Many of the technologies to reduce short-lived climate \n        pollutants already exist, but adoption of such technologies has \n        been slow.\n            (5) The Federal Government has a number of programs and \n        initiatives some of which aim to, or the outcomes of which, \n        reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, but these \n        programs are scattered across multiple agencies and there is \n        insufficient coordination to maximize reductions of these \n        pollutants. In February 2012, the Government Accountability \n        Office published an annual report, ``Opportunities to Reduce \n        Duplication, Overlap and Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and \n        Enhance Revenue'', which examined the efficiency and efficacy \n        of government programs, including those that address diesel \n        emissions that contain black carbon, a short-lived climate \n        pollutant.\n            (6) Executive Order 13514 requires Federal agencies to \n        develop plans for reducing hydrofluorocarbons and methane, but \n        few agencies have focused on these compounds in their annual \n        Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans.\n            (7) Because of their short atmospheric lifetimes, reducing \n        global emissions of short-lived climate pollutants can quickly \n        cut the rate of global temperature rise in half, by 2050, and \n        help stabilize global temperatures below 2\u000fC above pre-\n        industrial temperatures by 2100, when combined with reductions \n        of global emissions of carbon dioxide. Cutting short-lived \n        climate pollutants along with carbon dioxide can also reduce \n        the rate of projected global sea-level rise by half and total \n        sea-level rise by a third. Steps to reduce short-lived climate \n        pollutants are likely to have air quality and public health \n        benefits as well.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--\n            (1) coordinate and optimize the Federal Government's \n        existing efforts to address short-lived climate pollutants;\n            (2) reduce overlap and duplication of such efforts; and\n            (3) encourage Federal operations, programs, policies, and \n        initiatives to reduce short-lived climate pollutants by--\n                    (A) ensuring that the coordinated Federal programs \n                are effective and forward-looking in their efforts to \n                control short-lived climate pollutants;\n                    (B) ensuring coordination of such Federal \n                operations, programs, policies, and initiatives with \n                State, local, regional, tribal, and industry efforts; \n                and\n                    (C) supporting such State, local, regional, tribal, \n                and industry efforts.\n\nSEC. 3. TASK FORCE ON SUPER POLLUTANTS.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the President shall establish the ``Task Force \non Super Pollutants'' (referred to in this section as the ``Task \nForce'').\n    (b) Duties.--The Task Force shall--\n            (1) review existing and potential policies and measures \n        that promote reduction of short-lived climate pollutants, in \n        part by identifying and evaluating programs and activities of \n        the Federal government that contribute, or could contribute, to \n        such reduction;\n            (2) identify and recommend specific existing Federal \n        programs and activities evaluated under paragraph (1) that are \n        unnecessarily duplicative and can be consolidated to achieve \n        greater efficiency and effectiveness;\n            (3) identify gaps where programs do not exist, and \n        recommend focused programs and activities to fill these gaps to \n        achieve reductions of short-lived climate pollutants, with an \n        emphasis on industry standards and public-private partnerships \n        where possible;\n            (4) identify, compile, evaluate, and develop best practices \n        for reductions of short-lived climate pollutants, including \n        by--\n                    (A) identifying and evaluating both domestic and \n                international best practices and standards practiced \n                and set by governments, industry in each sector listed \n                in subsection (c)(5), standards bodies, and other \n                relevant institutions; and\n                    (B) identifying and evaluating cost-effective \n                mitigation projects, strategies, and policies at the \n                State, local, and tribal level, with the greatest \n                potential for reduction of short-lived climate \n                pollutants; and\n            (5) not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, submit to Congress a report on the findings and \n        recommendations developed under paragraphs (1) through (4).\n    (c) Members.--The task force established under subsection (a) shall \ninclude representatives of--\n            (1) all relevant Federal agencies, including--\n                    (A) the Secretary of Energy;\n                    (B) the Administrator of the Environmental \n                Protection Agency;\n                    (C) the Secretary of the Interior;\n                    (D) the Secretary of Transportation;\n                    (E) the Secretary of Agriculture;\n                    (F) the Secretary of State;\n                    (G) the Secretary of Commerce; and\n                    (H) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n            (2) relevant offices and councils within the Executive \n        Office of the President, including--\n                    (A) the Office of Management and Budget;\n                    (B) the Office of Science and Technology Policy; \n                and\n                    (C) the Council on Environmental Quality;\n            (3) State, local, and tribal governments or associations;\n            (4) academic and non-governmental organizations with \n        expertise in short-lived climate pollutants; and\n            (5) relevant industry organizations, representing at least \n        the following sectors:\n                    (A) Energy supply and transmission, including \n                fossil fuels.\n                    (B) Solid waste.\n                    (C) Transportation.\n                    (D) Chemical manufacturing and user industries.\n                    (E) Agriculture.\n                    (F) Wastewater.\n                    (G) Buildings.\n                    (H) Other sectors as determined appropriate by the \n                President.\n    (d) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``short-lived climate \npollutant'' means any of the following:\n            (1) Black carbon.\n            (2) Methane.\n            (3) Hydrofluorocarbons.\n            (4) Tropospheric ozone and its precursors.\n            (5) Emissions from banks of ozone-depleting substances."
