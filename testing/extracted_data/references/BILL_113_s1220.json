FINDING.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the United States, there are an estimated 1,181 \n        inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Among these facilities is \n        a small group of rehabilitation institutions that are important \n        for the future of rehabilitation care and medicine, as well as \n        to patient recovery.\n            (2) This unique category of inpatient rehabilitation \n        institutions treat the most complex conditions, such as \n        traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, childhood \n        disease, burns, and wartime injuries.\n            (3) These leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions are \n        all not-for-profit or Government-owned institutions and serve a \n        high volume of Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries.\n            (4) Each member of this small group of inpatient \n        rehabilitation institutions has been recognized by the Federal \n        Government for its contributions to cutting-edge research to \n        develop solutions that enhance quality of care, improve patient \n        outcomes, and reduce health care costs.\n            (5) This cohort of inpatient rehabilitation institutions \n        helps to improve the practice and standard of rehabilitation \n        medicine across the Nation by training physicians, medical \n        students, and other clinicians.\n            (6) It is vital that these unique inpatient rehabilitation \n        institutions are supported so they can continue to lead the \n        Nation's efforts to--\n                    (A) advance integrated, multidisciplinary \n                rehabilitation research;\n                    (B) provide cutting-edge medical care to the most \n                complex rehabilitation patients;\n                    (C) serve as education and training facilities for \n                the physicians, nurses, and other health professionals \n                who serve rehabilitation patients; and\n                    (D) ensure Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries \n                receive state-of-the-art, high-quality rehabilitation \n                care.\n\nSEC. 3.
