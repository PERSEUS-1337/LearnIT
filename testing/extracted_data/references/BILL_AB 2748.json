Any such partial or interim payment or reimbursement shall not be conditioned upon the recipient\u2019s agreement to release the polluter from liability for any current or future claim.\n(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a payment or reimbursement made in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or any agent or entity related to the responsible polluter to any recipient may be credited against the liability of the polluter, agent, or entity to the recipient for any current or future claim that is related to the environmental disaster.\n(c) A temporary or final settlement of any kind made in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or any agent or entity related to the responsible polluter, to any claimant, shall release the responsible polluter, agent, or entity from liability to the claimant only for acts, omissions, or injuries that are believed by the claimant to have occurred prior to the date of the settlement, and shall not release any claim that is unknown to the claimant at the time of the settlement, occurs subsequent to the settlement, or that is unrelated to the environmental disaster.\n(d) Any agreement in violation of subdivision (a) or (c) that is entered into on or after February 1, 2017, is void as a matter of law and against public policy.\n(e) For purposes of this section, a \u201cpartial or interim payment or reimbursement\u201d is a payment of the recipient\u2019s immediate out-of-pocket expenses, including, but not limited to, food, clothing, and shelter.\n(f) The provisions of this section shall only apply to an agreement relating to acts, omissions, or injuries in connection with an environmental disaster that occurred at Southern California Gas

Section 340.8, in any civil action for injury or illness based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance, the time for commencement of the action shall be no later than either three years from the date of injury, or three years after the plaintiff becomes aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, (1) an injury, (2) the physical cause of the injury, and (3) sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the injury was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another, whichever occurs later.\n(b) Notwithstanding Section 340.8, in an action for the wrongful death of any plaintiff\u2019s decedent, based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance, the time for commencement of an action shall be no later than either (1) three years from the date of the death of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, or (2) three years from the first date on which the plaintiff is aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, the physical cause of the death and sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the death was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another, whichever occurs later.\n(c) For purposes of this section:\n(1) A \u201ccivil action for injury or illness based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance\u201d does not include an action subject to Section 340.2 or 340.5.\n(2) Media reports regarding the hazardous material or toxic substance contamination do not, in and of themselves, constitute sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the injury or death was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another.\n(d) The provisions of this section shall only apply to an action relating to exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance in connection with an environmental disaster that occurred at Southern California Gas Company\u2019s Aliso Canyon gas storage facility or contamination surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon.\n(e) This section shall not apply to any action against a public entity as defined in Section 811.2 of the Government Code.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 1021.3 is added to the

environmental disaster that occurred at Southern California Gas Company\u2019s Aliso Canyon gas storage facility or contamination surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon.\n(c) This section shall not apply to any action against a public entity as defined in Section 811.2 of the Government Code.\nSEC. 4.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that a special law is

involving the unique circumstances of damages resulting from specific environmental disasters within the state."
