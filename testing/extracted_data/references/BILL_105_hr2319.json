CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There has been a recent trend toward issuing debit \n        cards which can be used like credit cards, largely as \n        replacements for debit cards which could be used only with a \n        personal identification number at automated teller machines and \n        a limited number of retail establishments.\n            (2) According to industry analysts, as many as 1,300,000 \n        new debit cards which can be used like credit cards are issued \n        each month.\n            (3) If current trends continue, debit cards that can be \n        used like credit cards will soon rival the popularity of credit \n        cards and some banking experts predict that more than \\2/3\\ of \n        the households in the United States will have such a card by \n        the year 2000.\n            (4) Many times, debit cards that can be used like credit \n        cards have been issued without providing adequate disclosure \n        that--\n                    (A) the card may be used to initiate an electronic \n                fund transfer without the use of a personal \n                identification number or similar code or means of \n                access; and\n                    (B) even though the card may carry a logo \n                associated with credit cards, the card is not a credit \n                card and the consumer may bear a significantly larger \n                liability for an unauthorized transaction involving \n                such debit card than would be the case for a similar \n                unauthorized transaction involving a credit card.\n            (5) Thus, millions of Americans are--\n                    (A) receiving cards in a form they didn't request; \n                and\n                    (B) are carrying such cards around with them--\n                            (i) without realizing that the cards have \n                        an expanded capability without the protections \n                        against unauthorized transfers which are \n                        typical of cards issued to make cash \n                        withdrawals from automated teller machines; and\n                            (ii) without fully appreciating the risks \n                        associated with such cards.\n            (5) Economic stimulation would be enhanced and competition \n        among the various financial institutions and other companies \n        which issue debit cards would be strengthened by the informed \n        use of debit cards by consumers.\n\nSEC. 3. DEBIT CARD CONSUMER PROTECTION.\n\n    (a) Issuance of Debit Cards.--Section 911 of the Electronic Fund \nTransfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693i) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new subsections:\n    ``(d) Warning to Consumer.--\n            ``(1) In general.--If, in response to a request or \n        application by a consumer for a card for use in initiating \n        electronic fund transfers at automated teller machines and \n        other electronic terminals which require a code or other unique \n        form of identification in order to access the account of the \n        consumer, a financial institution issues a card which can be \n        used to initiate electronic fund transfers from the account of \n        the consumer without the protection of a code or other means of \n        access which uniquely identifies the consumer, the issuer of \n        such card shall include a statement in bold type in a prominent \n        and conspicuous location on such card, or on a notice \n        accompanying the card, which warns the consumer that such card \n        can be used without a code or means of access which uniquely \n        identifies the consumer and protects the consumer from \n        unauthorized transfers.\n            ``(2) Replacement cards.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply \n        with respect to a card issued as a replacement for, or in \n        renewal of, a card previously issued to the consumer which can \n        be used to initiate electronic fund transfers from the account \n        of the consumer without the protection of a code or other means \nof access which uniquely identifies the consumer.\n            ``(3) Signature not treated as means of access which \n        uniquely identifies consumer.--A signature shall not be treated \n        as a means of access which uniquely identifies the consumer for \n        purposes of this section.\n    ``(e) Preference of Consumer.--If--\n            ``(1) in response to a request or application by a consumer \n        for a card for use in initiating electronic fund transfers at \n        automated teller machines and other electronic terminals which \n        requires a code or other unique form of identification in order \n        to access the account of the consumer, a financial institution \n        issues a card which can be used to initiate electronic fund \n        transfers from the account of the consumer without the \n        protection of a code or other means of access which uniquely \n        identifies the consumer; and\n            ``(2) the consumer refuses to accept the card as issued,\nthe issuer shall promptly issue such consumer a card which requires a \ncode or other unique form of identification in order to access the \naccount of the consumer.''.\n    (b) Liability of Consumer for Unauthorized Transfers.--\n            (1) Consumer liability limited to $50.--Section 909(a) of \n        the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693g(a)) is \n        amended by striking the penultimate sentence and the last \n        sentence.\n            (2) Consumer not liable if the only form of identification \n        required is a signature.--The 1st sentence of section 909(a) of \n        the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693g(a)) is \n        amended by striking ``signature, photograph,'' and inserting \n        ``photograph''.\n    (c) Provisional Recredit Provisions.--\n            (1) Provisional recredit after 3 days.--Section 908(c) of \n        the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693f(c)) is \n        amended by striking ``ten business days'' and inserting ``3 \n        business days''.\n            (2) Provisional recredit required upon notice of error \n        involving transactions initiated without code or unique \n        access.--\n                    (A) In general.--Section 908(c) of the Electronic \n                Fund Transfer Act (as amended by paragraph (1) of this \n                subsection) is amended--\n                            (i) by striking ``(c) If a financial \n                        institution'' and inserting ``(c) Provisional \n                        Recredit in Case of Error.--\n            ``(1) In general.--If a financial institution'';
