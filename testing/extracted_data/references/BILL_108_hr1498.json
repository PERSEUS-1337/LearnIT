        ``(1) In general.--If an existing S corporation has a net \n        recognized built-in gain for any taxable year in the \n        recognition period (determined by taking into account only \n        assets held on March 27, 2003) and elects the application of \n        this subsection, the amount of such gain on which tax is \n        imposed by subsection (a) shall not exceed the amount equal to \n        the excess of--\n                    ``(A) the amount realized on the disposition of \n                those assets that resulted in such gain, over\n                    ``(B) the

``(2) Payment of tax.--If--\n                    ``(A) the return of an S corporation shows that no \n                tax is required to be paid on an amount of recognized \n                built-in gain for any taxable year by reason of \n                paragraph (1) because the S corporation anticipates \n                making qualified expenditures during the succeeding \n                taxable year, and\n                    ``(B) as of the close of such succeeding taxable \n                year, tax is required to be paid on such amount because \n                of the failure to make such expenditures,\n        then the tax imposed by this chapter for the first taxable year \n        of the nonrecognition period shall be increased by 10 percent \n        of the increase in tax (determined without regard to this \n        paragraph) for such year by reason of the failure to make such \n        expenditures.\n            ``(3) Qualified expenditures.--For purposes of this \n        subsection, the term `qualified expenditures' means--\n                    ``(A) amounts chargeable to capital account for \n                property used in a trade or business of the S \n

and local taxes) on amounts attributable to the \n                disposition of those assets that resulted in such net \n                recognized built-in gain.\n        Payments of principal as part of a refinancing of pre-effective \n        date debt shall not be taken into account under subparagraph \n        (B).\n            ``(4) Nonrecognition period.--For purposes of this \n        subsection, the term `nonrecognition period' means, with \n        respect to a taxable year for which an S corporation has a net \n        recognized built-in gain, such taxable year and the
