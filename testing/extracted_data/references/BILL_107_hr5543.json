FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A 1995 Federal study conservatively estimated that each \n        year--\n                    (A) 100,000 police-reported motor vehicle crashes \n                are caused by the drowsiness or fatigue of the \n                operator;\n                    (B) 1,550 deaths and 71,000 injuries are the direct \n                result of a driver falling asleep at the wheel of a \n                motor vehicle; and\n                    (C) these crashes represent at least \n                $12,500,000,000 in diminished productivity and property \n                loss.\n            (2) Scientific research further demonstrates that--\n                    (A) 1,000,000 crashes are caused by driver \n                inattention each year; and\n                    (B) sleep deprivation and fatigue make such \n                attention lapses more likely to occur.\n            (3) An insufficient amount of statistical data and \n        documentation concerning fatigue-related motor vehicle crashes \n        is available. Federal statistics significantly under-report the \n        problem of driver fatigue because the statistics are derived \n        primarily from police accident reports, and studies indicate \n        that less than one-half of all crashes are reported to the \n        police.\n            (4) Further complicating the collection of accurate data \n        are the following facts:\n                    (A) Most police officers are not trained to detect \n                sleep-related crashes.\n                    (B) There is no test to determine sleepiness as \n                there is for drunk drivers.\n                    (C) There are still States that do not have proper \n                codes for sleepiness on their crash report forms.\n                    (D) Based on clinical studies, many people are \n                unable to accurately recognize when they have nodded-\n                off for a short period of time (microsleep), thus \n                raising questions about the reliability of self-\n                reporting.\n            (5) In 1999, a scientifically conducted national survey of \n        Americans found that 23 percent of respondents reported that \n        they personally know someone who crashed in the past year due \n        to falling asleep at the wheel.\n            (6) In 2001, a scientifically conducted national survey of \n        Americans found that in the past year--\n                    (A) 53 percent of all adults reported driving while \n                drowsy;\n                    (B) 19 percent reported that they had actually \n                dozed off while driving; and\n                    (C) one percent reported that they had crashed \n                because they dozed off.\n            (7) Studies confirm that while anyone can be at risk for \n        drowsy driving, there are several population groups that are \n        significantly at higher risk--\n                    (A) young people under the age of 26, who tend to \n                stay up late, sleep too little, and drive at night, \n                represent about 55 percent of all fall asleep crashes;\n                    (B) there are over 20,000,000 shift workers in \n                America and studies suggest that 20 percent to 30 \n                percent of individuals with nontraditional work \n                schedules have had a fatigue-related driving mishap in \n                the last year;\n                    (C) commercial drivers are susceptible to fatigue-\n                related crashes due to their driving schedules and the \n                amount of miles they drive during the year;\n                    (D) commercial drivers have a high prevalence of a \n                sleep and breathing disorder called sleep apnea; and\n                    (E) 40,000,000 Americans suffer from sleep \n                disorders; left untreated, disorders such as sleep \n                apnea can increase crash risk 3 to 7 times.\n            (8) In 1995, a study found that some roads, such as high-\n        speed, long, boring, rural highways, are more dangerous than \n        others for sleep-deprived motorists. The New York State Police \n        estimated that 40 percent of all fatal crashes along the New \n        York Thruway were the result of a driver falling asleep at the \n        wheel.\n            (9) Studies, such as the following, indicate that \n        continuous shoulder rumble strips are effective countermeasures \n        to drift-off-the-road crashes, which are characteristic of \n        drowsy driving, and fall-asleep crashes--\n                    (A) New York State reports that accidents caused by \n                drivers falling asleep at 13 sites on the New York \n                Thruway were reduced by 84 percent following the \n                installation of continuous shoulder rumble strips.\n                    (B) Pennsylvania reports a reduction of guard rail \n                or embankment accidents at 5 sites on the Pennsylvania \n                Turnpike following rumble strip installation.\n                    (C) In 1995, an expert panel consisting of \n                university and federal researchers convened to assess \n                the current research regarding the effectiveness of \n                continuous shoulder rumble strips and to make \n                recommendations about their use. The panel concluded \n                that rumble strips reduce drift-off-the-road crashes \n                anywhere from 15 to 70 percent depending on road type \n                and rumble strip design being used.\n\nSEC. 3.
