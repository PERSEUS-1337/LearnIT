FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The volume of electronic devices in the United States \n        is substantial and will continue to grow. The Environmental \n        Protection Agency estimates that over 2 billion computers, \n        televisions, wireless devices, printers, gaming systems, and \n        other devices have been sold since 1980, generating 2 million \n        tons of unwanted electronic devices in 2005 alone.\n            (2) Electronic devices can be recycled or refurbished to \n        recover and conserve valuable materials, such as gold, copper, \n        and platinum. However, according to the Environmental \n        Protection Agency, only 15 to 20 percent of electronic devices \n        discarded from households reach recyclers.\n            (3) The electronic device recycling industry in the United \n        States is growing; however, challenges remain for the recycling \n        of electronic devices by households and other small generators. \n        Collection of such electronic devices is expensive, and \n        separation and proper recycling of some of the materials \n        recovered, like lead from cathode-ray tube televisions, is \n        costly.\n            (4) The export of unwanted electronic devices to developing \n        countries also presents a serious challenge. The crude methods \n        of many of the recycling operations in these countries can \n        expose workers to harmful chemicals, jeopardizing their health \n        and polluting the environment.\n            (5) Some of the challenges to increasing the recyclability \n        of electronic devices can be addressed by improving the \n        logistics and technology of the collection and recycling \n        process, designing electronic devices to avoid the use of \n        hazardous materials and to be more easily recycled, and \n        encouraging the use of recycled materials in more applications.\n            (6) The public currently does not take full advantage of \n        existing electronic device recycling opportunities. Studying \n        factors that influence behavior and educating consumers about \n        responsible electronic device recycling could help communities \n        and private industry develop recycling programs that draw more \n        participation.\n            (7) The development of tools and technologies to increase \n        the lifespan of electronic devices and to promote their safe \n        reuse would decrease the impact of the production of electronic \n        devices on the environment and likely increase the \n        recyclability of such devices.\n            (8) Accurately assessing the environmental impacts of the \n        production of electronic devices and the recycling of such \n        devices is a complex task. Data, tools, and methods to better \n        quantify these impacts would help policymakers and others \n        determine the best end-of-life management options for \n        electronic devices.\n\nSEC. 3.
