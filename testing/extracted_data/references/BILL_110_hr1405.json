FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the ongoing panzootic of highly pathogenic avian \n        influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1 in Asia and Eurasia is a threat to \n        global human health and the global poultry industry;\n            (2) the HPAI virus is capable of causing massive avian die-\n        offs, and response can easily involve the culling of tens of \n        millions of domestic poultry or domestic waterfowl, resulting \n        in significant economic losses;\n            (3) the fatality rate due to infection in humans may be 30 \n        to 50 percent or more;\n            (4) it has long been known that wild birds are a reservoir \n        host for avian influenza viruses worldwide;\n            (5) the 1918 pandemic, the most lethal of the three \n        pandemics that killed over 40,000,000 people worldwide, was \n        caused by an influenza virus that initially jumped directly \n        from birds to humans and subsequently evolved an ability to \n        transmit from human-to-human;\n            (6) this precedent for an avian influenza virus to transmit \n        directly from birds to humans, then spread among humans, \n        significantly raises the concern about the current H5N1 \n        influenza strain;\n            (7) increased surveillance, including on migratory birds, \n        is critical to controlling avian influenza and preparing for \n        other potential emerging infectious diseases;\n            (8) the capacity to proactively detect the threats could \n        result in significantly improved disease prediction and \n        prevention capabilities;\n            (9) international wildlife health surveillance does not \n        clearly fall under the jurisdiction of any Federal or \n        international agency;\n            (10) there is a continued inability to share real-time data \n        across the human, agricultural, wildlife, and veterinary \n        agencies on zoonotic threats;\n            (11) while surveillance at domestic poultry and domestic \n        waterfowl production facilities and farms is an immediate and \n        on-going monitoring need and is being supported through \n        relevant agencies, surveillance in wild bird populations that \n        may have been exposed to the virus is a critical component to \n        determine the spread of the virus, implement control measures, \n        and protect human, livestock, and wildlife health;\n            (12) monitoring and surveillance of wild migratory and \n        resident water birds are critically important to identifying \n        all strains of influenza viruses in wild birds as a library of \n        possible genotypes, determining their role in the spread of the \n        virus, and anticipating where outbreaks may occur to enhance \n        preparedness;\n            (13) improving surveillance of wildlife health around the \n        world would close significant jurisdictional and scientific \n        gaps in current emerging infectious disease preparedness;\n            (14) other emerging diseases beyond bird flu merit similar \n        attention, in terms of the potential threats to global public \n        health as well as agribiosecurity and biodiversity;\n            (15) the majority of emerging infectious diseases \n        identified in the past several decades have moved from wildlife \n        to humans, largely due to human incursions into or alterations \n        of wildlife habitats and hunting, consumption, and trade of \n        wildlife species;\n            (16) the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus moved \n        from chimpanzees to humans via these mechanisms;\n            (17) many factors contribute to disease emergence and \n        spread from wildlife to domestic animals and humans, including \n        environmental degradation and the handling, consumption, and \n        trade of wildlife and wildlife-derived products;\n            (18) from avian influenza to the severe acute respiratory \n        syndrome (SARS), from bovine tuberculosis to the Ebola virus, \n        and from HIV/AIDS to monkey pox, a long list of zoonotic \n        diseases negatively impacts people's lives and livelihoods and \n        costs the global economy billions of dollars; and\n            (19) the Government of the United States lacks a \n        comprehensive program to monitor wildlife health around the \n        world, a program that could proactively inform preparedness not \n        just in the case of a potential H5N1 influenza strain pandemic, \n        but also for a broader array of emerging infectious disease \n        threats that often arise at the interface between wildlife, \n        humans, and their domestic animals.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a Wildlife Global Animal \nInformation Network for Surveillance--\n            (1) to more rapidly and efficiently detect, verify, and \n        report on the presence of infectious diseases, such as highly \n        pathogenic avian influenza, in birds and other wildlife around \n        the world;\n            (2) to use information on pathogens found during \n        surveillance of wildlife to better delineate potential threats \n        to domestic animals, humans, as well as wildlife itself;\n            (3) to use information on when and where HPAI and other \n        pathogens of concern are identified in wildlife--\n                    (A) to better guide preparedness in the United \n                States and around the world; and\n                    (B) to carry out a strategic wildlife health \n                surveillance initiative that will provide regions, \n                countries, and specific locations with early warning \n                information that will help target resources toward \n                enhancement of agribiosecurity, surveillance, public \n                health vigilance, and related areas;\n            (4) to create an open access database within which \n        information on HPAI and other pathogens of interest identified \n        in wild birds and other wildlife can be shared as close to real \n        time as possible;\n            (5) to protect the health and safety of United States \n        citizens and officials traveling or living abroad; and\n            (6) to protect the economic interests of the United States \n        and its partners from threats to health, agriculture, and \n        natural resources, including wildlife itself.\n\nSEC. 4.
