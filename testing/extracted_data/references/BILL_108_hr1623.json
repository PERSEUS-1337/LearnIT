FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is no clear accountability for Presidential \n        gifts, since multiple lists of such gifts are separately \n        maintained by different Federal agencies, including by the \n        White House Gifts Unit, the National Park Service, and the \n        National Archives and Records Administration.\n            (2) House Report 107-768, ``Problems with the Presidential \n        Gifts System'', presents additional information about the \n        complexity of and problems with the current system.\n            (3) The lack of a consolidated record of the receipt, \n        administration, and disposition of Presidential gifts creates \n        confusion about the status of some of those gifts.\n            (4) Requiring the National Archives and Records \n        Administration to maintain an inventory of Presidential gifts \n        would eliminate such confusion and ensure accountability.\n\nSEC. 3.
