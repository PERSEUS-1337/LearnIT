FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the building sector uses more than 40 percent of the \n        energy of the Nation;\n            (2) emerging building energy monitoring and control \n        technologies are enabling a transition of the building sector \n        to ``smart'' buildings that have dramatically reduced energy \n        use and improved quality of service to occupants;\n            (3) an analysis of select private-sector smart buildings by \n        the Department of Energy would document the costs and benefits \n        of those emerging technologies, promote their adoption, and \n        accelerate that transition;\n            (4) with over 400,000 buildings, the Federal Government is \n        the largest building owner in the United States; and\n            (5) the Federal Government can also accelerate the \n        transition to smart building technologies by demonstrating and \n        evaluating emerging smart building technologies using existing \n        programs and funding to showcase selected Federal smart \n        buildings.\n\nSEC. 3.

FEDERAL SMART BUILDING PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a program to \nestablish 1 or more smart buildings under the jurisdiction of several \nkey Federal agencies, including buildings that are owned by the Federal \nGovernment but are commercially operated, to demonstrate the costs and \nbenefits of smart buildings.\n    (b) Federal Agency Described.--The key Federal agencies referred to \nin subsection (a) shall include--\n            (1) the Department of Defense;\n            (2) the Department of Energy;\n            (3) the Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n            (4) the General Services Administration.\n    (c) Requirement.--In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall \nleverage existing procurement mechanisms.\n    (d) Evaluation.--Using the guidelines of the Federal Energy \nManagement Program relating to whole-building evaluation, measurement, \nand verification, the Secretary shall evaluate the costs and benefits \nof the buildings selected under this section including an \nidentification of--\n            (1) which advanced building technologies--\n                    (A) are most cost-effective; and\n                    (B) show the most promise for--\n                            (i) increasing building energy savings;\n                            (ii) increasing service performance to \n                        building occupants; and\n                            (iii) reducing environmental impacts; and\n            (2) any other information the Secretary determines to be \n        appropriate.\n\nSEC. 6.
