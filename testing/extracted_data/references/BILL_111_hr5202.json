FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and \n        the School Breakfast Program (SBP), school food service has \n        played an integral role in the health and nutrition of American \n        children, and remains one of the key safety-nets in place to \n        alleviate childhood hunger and malnutrition domestically. In \n        2009, the NSLP served more than 31,000,000 students every day, \n        while the SBP fed over 11,000,000 students.\n            (2) The NSLP and SBP are shared responsibilities between \n        the Federal, State, and local governments.\n            (3) In 2009 the Federal Government spent more than \n        $12,000,000,000 to support the NSLP and the SBP, to ensure \n        students across the country received at least one healthy meal \n        every school day.\n            (4) Faced with growing student participation and increased \n        costs, school food service programs across the country are \n        facing unprecedented budget crises.\n            (5) According to a recent study by the School Nutrition \n        Association, 52 percent of school food service programs are \n        charged indirect costs by local educational agencies. Indirect \n        costs are costs incurred for a common purpose that benefit more \n        than one programmatic objective.\n            (6) According to the study, there is an overall lack of \n        consistency amongst local educational agencies nationwide about \n        what method should be used to identify and calculate indirect \n        costs, and what constitute appropriate direct cost charges to \n        school food authorities.\n            (7) School food service must operate on a nonprofit basis, \n        balance cost with revenue, and ensure all revenue generated is \n        used to support or improve the food service.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) ensure Federal funds are being appropriately spent to \n        benefit the health and nutrition of American children;\n            (2) study the impact of indirect and direct costs charged \n        to the NSLP and SBP programs;\n            (3) study the types and amounts of indirect and direct \n        costs charged and recovered by local educational agencies; and\n            (4) encourage the Secretary to issue regulations to ensure \n        the effectiveness of Federal support for the NSLP and SBP.\n\nSEC. 3.
