PROHIBITION ON ANTICOMPETITIVE CONTRACTS BY BROADBAND ACCESS \n              TRANSPORT PROVIDERS.\n\n    In any civil action based on a claim arising under section 1, 2, or \n3 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1, 2, 3), evidence that a broadband \naccess transport provider that has market power in the broadband \nservice provider market has offered access to a service provider on \nterms and conditions, other than terms justified by demonstrable cost \ndifferentials, that are less favorable than those offered by such \noperator to itself, to an affiliated service provider, or to another \nservice provider, or restrains unreasonably the ability of a service \nprovider from competing in its provision of broadband services, shall \nbe sufficient to establish a presumption of a violation of such \nsection.\n\nSEC. 103. PROHIBITION ON ANTICOMPETITIVE OR DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR BY \n              BROADBAND ACCESS TRANSPORT PROVIDERS.\n\n    It shall be unlawful for a broadband access transport provider to \nengage in unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or \npractices, the purpose or effect of which is to discriminate in favor \nof a service provider that is affiliated with a broadband access \ntransport provider or to restrain unreasonably the ability of a service \nprovider that is not affiliated with a broadband access transport \nprovider from competing in its provision of any of the services \nprovided by a service provider as set forth in section 105(3).\n\nSEC. 104.

ACCELERATED DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND SERVICES.\n\n    ``(a) Broadband Services Plans.--\n            ``(1) Plan required.--Within 180 days after the effective \n        date of this section, each local exchange carrier shall submit \n        to the State commission in each State in which such carrier \n        does business a plan to provide broadband telecommunications \n        service in all local exchange areas in which such carrier has \n        telephone exchange service customers as soon as such broadband \n        telecommunications service is economically reasonably and \n        technically feasible. The plan shall include all terms and \n        conditions, including pricing, under which the services shall \n        be provided. The test of economic reasonability and technical \n        feasibility shall be made separately by the local exchange \n        carrier for each local exchange, and the plan shall be \n        considered certified 45 days after submission unless the State \n        commission rejects the plan within such 45 days. Upon rejection \n        of a plan, successive plans shall be submitted until approval \n        is obtained. The plan shall be implemented within 180 days of \n        the certification of the plan in each local exchange in which \n        the provision of the service is both economically reasonable \n        and technically feasible. Upon certification of its plan, the \n        carrier shall be obligated by terms of the plan (including any \n        modifications that it requests that are thereafter certified) \n        but shall otherwise provide such services free of Federal and \n        State price, rate, rate of return, and profit regulation. Upon \n        a determination by the State commission that a local exchange \n        is served by another provider of broadband telecommunications \n        services, or any broadband Internet access transport provider, \n        or upon a determination by such State commission that the local \n        exchange carrier makes broadband telecommunications services \n        available to 70 percent of the access lines in an exchange, a \n        local exchange carrier shall no longer be obligated by the \n        terms of any such plan in such local exchange.\n            ``(2) State modifications prohibited.--Except upon request \n        of the carrier, the State commission shall have no authority to \n        modify any plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (1).\n            ``(3) No commission authority.--The Commission shall have \n        no authority with respect to the terms of any plan and shall \n        have no authority with respect to the approval or rejection of \n        any such plan.\n    ``(b) Supersession of Other Requirements.--An incumbent local \nexchange carrier's provision of broadband local telecommunications \nservices shall not be subject to the requirements of sections 251(c)(3) \nand 251(c)(4) of the Act in any State in which that carrier certifies \nto the State commission that--\n            ``(1) in central offices in which it provides local loops \n        that are conditioned for broadband services, it provides such \n        loops to other carriers at least as quickly as it provides them \n        for its own customers;\n            ``(2) in central offices in which it does not currently \n        provide local loops that are conditioned for broadband \n        services, but in which such service is economically reasonable \n        and technically feasible, it will provide such loops within 120 \n        days of a request for such conditioning from another carrier; \n        and\n            ``(3) conditioned loops are provided upon such prices and \n        other terms and conditions as the parties shall agree, or in \n        any event of disagreements, as are determined through \n        commercial arbitration, in which the commercial arbitrator \n        shall establish the price based upon the cost of the loops and \n        the costs for such conditioning that have been incurred by the \n        local exchange carrier plus a reasonable profit.''.\n\n SEC. 202. ACCELERATED DEPLOYMENT OF INTERNET BACKBONE.\n\n    (a) InterLATA Internet Services.--Paragraph (21) of section 3 of \nthe Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153(21)), relating to the \ndefinition of interLATA service, is amended by inserting before the \nperiod the following: ``, except that such term shall not include \nservices that consist of or include the transmission of any data or \ninformation, including any writing, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds \nrelated to the transmission of such data or information, by means of \nthe Internet or any other network that employs Internet Protocol-based \nor other packet-switched technology''.\n    (b) Voice InterLATA Internet Services.--Neither a Bell operating \ncompany, nor any affiliate of a Bell operating company, may provide, by \nmeans of the Internet or any other network that employs Internet \nProtocol-based or other packet-switched technology, two-way voice-only \ninterLATA telecommunications services originating in any of its in-\nregion States until such time as the Federal Communications Commission \napproves the application of such company for such State pursuant to \nsection 271(d) of the Communications Act of 1934.
