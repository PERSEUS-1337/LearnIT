FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) California rapid population growth and the lack of \n        understanding about the environmental impacts of this growth \n        have caused a number of serious present and potential barriers \n        to future economic development of California.\n            (2) California has great environmental complexity and \n        diversity and a great variety of human interventions in its \n        ecosystem.\n            (3) Future environmental policies for California must be \n        informed by careful cost-benefit analysis that considers the \n        serious risks, and the benefits, of environmental policy.\n            (4) The establishment of a California Urban Environmental \n        Research and Education Center would promote environmentally \n        sound economic development in California and ensure that \n        continued sustainable economic development can occur.\n            (5) Due to the closing of many military facilities and \n        installations in California, such a Center can provide \n        important assistance to the process of converting defense \n        resources to non-defense uses.\n\nSEC. 2.
