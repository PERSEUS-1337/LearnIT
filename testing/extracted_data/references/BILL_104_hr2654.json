Nothing in this paragraph \n        prohibits the insurer from requiring the subject of abuse to \n        pay the full premium for the subject's coverage under the \n        health plan. The insurer may terminate group coverage after the \n        continuation coverage required by this paragraph has been in \n        force for 18 months if it offers conversion to an equivalent \n        individual plan. The continuation of health coverage required \n        by this paragraph shall be satisfied by any extension of \n        coverage under part 6 of subtitle B of title I or the Employee \n        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1161 et seq.) \n        or 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provided to a \n        subject of abuse and is not intended to be in addition to any \n        extension of coverage provided under part 6 of subtitle B of \n        title I or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \n        (29 U.S.C. 1161 et seq.) or 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code \n        of 1986.\n    (b) Use of Information.--\n            (1) In general.--No insurer may use, disclose, or transfer \n        information relating to an applicant's or insured's abuse \n        status or abuse-related medical condition or the applicant's or \n        insured's status as a family member, employer or associate, \n        person in a relationship with a subject of abuse for any \n        purpose unrelated to the direct provision of health care \n        services unless such use, disclosure, or transfer is required \n        by an order of an entity with authority to regulate insurance \n        or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or by abuse \n        reporting laws. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as \n        limiting or precluding a subject of abuse from obtaining the \n        subject's own medical records from an insurer.\n            (2) Authority of subject of abuse.--A subject of abuse, at \n        the absolute discretion of the subject of abuse, may provide \n        evidence of abuse to an insurer for the limited purpose of \n        facilitating treatment of an abuse-related condition or \n        demonstrating that a condition is abuse-related. Nothing in \n        this paragraph shall be construed as authorizing an insurer or \n        health carrier to disregard such provided evidence.\n\nSEC. 4. REASONS FOR ADVERSE ACTIONS.\n\n    An insurer that takes any adverse action relating to any plan or \npolicy of a subject of abuse, shall advise the subject of abuse \napplicant or insured of the specific reasons for the action in writing. \nReference to general underwriting practices or guidelines does not \nconstitute a specific reason.\n\nSEC. 5. LIFE INSURANCE.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a life insurer \nfrom declining to issue a life insurance policy if the applicant or \nprospective owner of the policy is or would be designated as a \nbeneficiary of the policy, and if--\n            (1) the applicant or prospective owner of the policy lacks \n        an insurable interest in the insured; or\n            (2) the applicant or prospective owner of the policy is \n        known, on the basis of police or court records, to have \n        committed an act of abuse.\n\nSEC. 6. SUBROGATION WITHOUT CONSENT PROHIBITED.\n\n    Except where the subject of abuse has already recovered damages, \nsubrogation of claims resulting from abuse is prohibited with the \ninformed consent of the subject of abuse.\n\nSEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Federal Trade Commission.--The Federal Trade Commission shall \nhave the power to examine and investigate any insurer to determine \nwhether such insurer has been or is engaged in any act or practice \nprohibited by this Act. If the Federal Trade Commission determines an \ninsurer has been or is engaged in any act or practice prohibited by \nthis Act, the Commission may take action against such insurer by the \nissuance of a cease and desist order as if the insurer was in violation \nof section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Such cease and desist \norder may include any individual relief warranted under the \ncircumstances, including temporary, preliminary, and permanent \ninjunctive and compensatory relief.\n    (b) Private Cause of Action.--An applicant or insured claiming to \nbe adversely affected by an act or practice of an insurer in violation \nof this Act may maintain an action against the insurer in a Federal or \nState court of original jurisdiction. Upon proof of such conduct by a \npreponderance of the evidence, the court may award appropriate relief, \nincluding temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief and \ncompensatory and punitive damages, as well as the costs of suit and \nreasonable fees for the aggrieved individual's attorneys and expert \nwitnesses. With respect to compensatory damages, the aggrieved \nindividual may elect, at any time prior to the rendering of final \njudgment, to recover in lieu of actual damages, an award of statutory \ndamages in the amount of $5,000 for each violation."
