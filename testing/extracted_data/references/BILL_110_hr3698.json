FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In confronting terrorism the United States must reach \n        out to other regions of the world to maintain, as well as \n        establish, strong relationships as recommended by the Final \n        Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n        United States (commonly referred to as the ``9/11 Commission \n        Report''), which stated that ``The United States should rebuild \n        the scholarship, exchange, and library programs that reach out \n        to young people and offer them knowledge and hope. Where such \n        assistance is provided, it should be identified as coming from \n        the citizens of the United States.''.\n            (2) International volunteering opportunities are effective \n        means of addressing critical human needs, building bridges \n        across cultures, and promoting mutual understanding.\n            (3) Current volunteer programs, such as the Peace Corps, \n        remain an important component of Federal efforts to promote \n        volunteer service, cross-cultural understanding, and the values \n        of the United States.\n            (4) The duration of volunteer service opportunities and \n        financial limitations are common barriers to qualified \n        individuals of all backgrounds and ages interested in \n        volunteering overseas, which would be significantly reduced by \n        a global service fellowship program.\n            (5) A global service fellowship program would provide \n        funding and programmatic flexibility for volunteers of all \n        backgrounds and ages.\n            (6) Eligible organizations willing to participate in the \n        fellowship program as sponsoring organizations would be in a \n        better position to recruit volunteers for their programs \n        overseas.\n\nSEC. 3.
