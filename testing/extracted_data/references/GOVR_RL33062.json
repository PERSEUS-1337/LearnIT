    "content": "Public diplomacy is the promotion of America's interests, culture, and policies by informingand influencing foreign populations. From 1977 to the 1990s, all functions of State's Bureau ofEducational and Cultural Affairs and the USIA's international information and broadcasting activitiesmerged to become the International Communication Agency (ICA). Subsequently, in 1982, Section303(b) of P.L. 97-241 renamed ICA to be the U.S. Information Agency (USIA). In 1994, theinternational broadcasting activities were consolidated by Title III, P.L. 103-236 and administeredby a new entity referred to as the Broadcasting Board of Governors. As of October 1, 1999, USIAwas abolished and its functions were merged back into the Department of State. Currently, public diplomacy primarily consists of three categories of activities: (1)international information programs, (2) educational and cultural exchange programs, and (3)international nonmilitary broadcasting. The Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy andPublic Affairs administers the Bureau for International Information Programs and the Bureau forEducational and Cultural Affairs, while the Broadcasting Board of Governors manages and overseesinternational broadcasting. Other public diplomacy efforts involve the White House, the U.S.Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD). After the abolishment of the United States Information Agency (USIA) in 1999 and theterrorist attacks two years later, the U.S. government expedited implementation of public diplomacyto help win its war on terrorism. Some observers noted as evidence that the Administration was newat conducting public diplomacy when immediately after 9/11 it referred to the U.S. response as\"Operation Enduring Crusade,\" a name that experts pointed out could be viewed by Muslims asinflammatory.\" (1)  Over the past four years, the Bush Administration has taken numerous actions to improve theeffectiveness of its public diplomacy. For example, in November 2001, two months after theterrorist attacks, the Bush Administration created the Coalition Information Center (CIC)headquartered in the Old Executive Office Building. The CIC, which was touted by theAdministration as public diplomacy, coordinated U.S. government agency press conferences andtalking points, dispersing them rapidly and around-the-clock worldwide. Soon thereafter, thePresident created, by Executive Order, the Office of Global Communications (OGC), which replacedthe CIC with a primary mission to \"coordinate strategic communications with globalaudiences.\" (2) Also,then-National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice established a Strategic Communication PolicyCoordinating Committee (PCC) in September 2002. The PCC mission was to coordinateinteragency activities, develop the White House message, and disseminate it abroad.  More recently, the President created the Muslim World Outreach Policy CoordinatingCommittee in July 2004 which replaced the Strategic Communications Policy CoordinatingCommittee. The State Department also established an Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources inthe Office of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Informally in 2002 and officially in 2003, the Pentagon created the Office of StrategicInfluence (OSI) to oversee military propaganda and other information related to the war on terrorism. The Secretary of Defense dissolved OSI after press coverage claimed the Office was to placedisinformation deliberately in foreign media. In October 2003, the Department of Defense issued Information Operations Roadmap which involves the direction that DOD wants to take in publicdiplomacy and other information operations. DOD has appointed its Under Secretary of Defense forPolicy as the Defense point person for public diplomacy and will be continuing to define DOD's rolein public diplomacy. USAID became more involved in public diplomacy after the 9/11 Commission reported toCongress that some of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid had very strong anti-Americansentiment among its population. Since 2004, USAID has acted to more prominently inform U.S.aid recipients that the aid they have received was a gift from American taxpayers. Also, byestablishing a State-USAID Policy Council and a Public Diplomacy Working Group, it hasestablished closer ties with the Department of State and embassies around the world to publicizeAmerica's humanitarian and development aid initiatives.  Since 1999, U.S. public diplomacy has been rigorously examined to determine whetherimproved methods, structure, and goals could help the United States win the war on terrorism. Thisreport reviews 29 articles and studies on public diplomacy that have been identified by theDepartment of State as being credible reports with valuable suggestions and compares therecommendations.  These 29 documents, listed in reverse chronological order from 2005 to 1999 in AppendixA , vary in scope, depth, and purpose. Some focus on public diplomacy and include numerous,specific recommendations; others are more general in nature and deal with public diplomacy in thecontext of broader foreign policy issues. Some reports represent the consensus of a group of authors;others state the views of a series of individuals. For the purposes of this review, each document hasbeen given an abbreviation, for example, \"PDC\" for the Public Diplomacy Council, to make it easierto identify. Appendix B provides each report's specific recommendations. Following in Table 1 is a matrix indicating the major recommendations of all 29 reports.(Note, however, that the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP1) report from 2003 did not have relevantrecommendations for this review.) The matrix lists 14 categories of recommendations that appearedmost frequently. A second matrix in Table 2 lists only those reports that include specificrecommendations concerning international broadcasting. A brief discussion of recommendationsimilarities and differences follows each matrix. Note that this discussion deals only with thecontent of the documents. An author or organization listed in the Appendix may have written onpublic diplomacy at an earlier or a later date, and the views expressed in a particular document maynot represent those of the organization that published the document.

Public Diplomacy From 1999 through 2005 numerous reports, articles, studies, and op-ed pieceshave been written touting the importance of public diplomacy as a foreign policy tooland focusing on how the United States government can improve its public diplomacyoperations to help win the war on terrorism. Among the many writings are the 29considered here. (See Appendix A for a reverse chronological list of the reportsincluded in this CRS review.) Several reports suggest that the Administration has not sufficiently definedor verbalized an overall strategy for the use of public diplomacy to both improve theU.S. image around the world, but also counter the threat of terrorism againstAmericans. The 9/11 Commission Report states that the United States shouldidentify what it stands for and communicate that message clearly. Of the ten reportsthat recommend defining an overall strategy, the Government Accountability Office(GAO) reports that the United States needs to do a better job of defining its publicdiplomacy message, and that while the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) doeshave a strategy for its broadcasting activities, the Department of State (DOS) does nothave an integrated strategy for its public diplomacy operations. GAO states that the\"absence of an interagency strategy complicates the task of conveying consistentmessages.\" Furthermore, GAO offers that the Administration needs to define publicdiplomacy success and determine how it can be measured.  The Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim Worldreport recommends that the White House establish strategic goals and oversee theimplementation of programs that meet those goals. The U.S. Advisory Commissionon Public Diplomacy study claims that the State Department lacks authority toimplement an overall strategy for the various agencies engaged in public diplomacyand recommends that the DOS Policy, Planning and Resources Office coordinate allpublic diplomacy efforts. The Heritage Foundation recommends that the U.S.government view public diplomacy as a long-term effort, saying that publicdiplomacy should be \"enshrined in a doctrine that emphasizes consistent efforts.\" Themore recent Council on Foreign Relations report recommends rethinking how theUnited States formulates, strategizes, and communicates its foreign policy and should\"move public diplomacy from the margins to the center of foreign policy making.\"The National War College report notes a \"lack of strategic planning,\" and the earlierCouncil on Foreign Relations study says there is an absence of an overall strategyand recommends the Administration develop a coherent strategic and coordinatingframework for public diplomacy activities. Ten of the studies discuss the White House taking a more proactive role inpromoting public diplomacy, coordinating public diplomacy activities throughout theexecutive branch agencies, and reorganizing or initiating public diplomacy taskforces or coordinating committees at the White House. For example, reports by theDefense Science Board Task Force and the Council on Foreign Relations urge thePresident to issue a directive to strengthen the importance of communication andpublic diplomacy and coordinate all activities through the White House. TheHeritage Foundation also recommends that inter-agency coordination of publicdiplomacy activities be carried out through the White House. The Advisory Groupon Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World report recommends thePresident appoint a cabinet-level Special Counselor to the President for PublicDiplomacy. This person would, in consultation with the President and otheragencies, establish strategic goals and messages, and oversee the implementation ofprograms that meet those stated goals, the report suggests. Similar ideas are offeredby the Public Diplomacy Council which suggests that a cabinet level InteragencyCommittee on Public Diplomacy should be established by Presidential Directive,cochaired by the Deputy National Security Advisor for Communication and theDirector of a new U.S. Agency for Public Diplomacy (USAPD). Several of the studies suggest that the existing public diplomacy structure atthe Department of State is not working. The Washington Post op-ed piece by Marks,Wick, Gelb, and Catto states that \"shutting down the USIA was a major mistake,\"a sentiment that has been expressed by others in recent years. (3) The op-edpiece goes on to say that public diplomacy is not very effective under DOS and \"there-creation of an effective instrument of public diplomacy has been urged by many.\" Other reports propose establishing an entirely new agency to have primaryresponsibility for U.S. public diplomacy activities and coordination with othergovernment entities. The Council on Foreign Relations recommends establishing aCorporation for Public Diplomacy to be modeled after the Corporation for PublicBroadcasting. The Public Diplomacy Council suggests establishing an agency, theU.S. Agency for Public Diplomacy (USAPD), within the Department of State and theNational Security process. The Defense Science Board reports that the Presidentshould establish a permanent strategic communications structure within the NationalSecurity Council (NSC). That report goes on to state that \"the President should workwith Congress to establish and fund a non-profit, non-partisan Center for StrategicCommunication to support the NSC, departments, and organizations represented ona newly-recommended Strategic Communication Committee.\" Since the 1999 elimination of the USIA, numerous experts and observershave critiqued how the Department of State has conducted public diplomacy. According to the GAO, public diplomacy activities at State are fragmented amongvarious organizational entities within the Department, with insufficient directionfrom the top. Many of the studies here agree that public diplomacy in theDepartment of State could be working better, but there are differing views as to howDOS should improve it.  The 2002 U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy report says thereshould be a review of the 1999 consolidation of USIA into State with the Secretaryof State making recommendations on new training, location, and reporting structureof public diplomacy personnel at the Department. The Defense Science Board's 2004report recommends redefining the role of the Under Secretary of State for PublicDiplomacy to be policy advisor and manager. Furthermore, it suggests raising thepublic diplomacy office Directors to the level of Deputy Assistant Secretary or SeniorAdvisor to the Assistant Secretary. The report urges DOS to strengthen the Bureauof International Information Programs (IIP) with an Assistant Secretary and modernize and diversify its products. The Heritage Foundation suggests restoring the independent reporting andbudget channels that public diplomacy lost during the USIA merger and recreatinga public diplomacy hierarchy within the Department of State as previously existedat USIA.  Another suggestion by author William Kiehl proposes creating a new publicdiplomacy organization within the State Department, including a new Bureau ofPublic Diplomacy Operations. Also, he writes, \"regional bureaus must include seniorpublic diplomacy officers at least at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level.\" The Hart/Rudman Commission recommends repealing laws that establish anUnder Secretary for Public Diplomacy and having some of those functions migrateto an Assistant Secretary level official reporting directly to the Secretary of State. Other functions could be folded into the Assistant Secretary for Economic andTransnational Affairs, according to the Commission. Overhauling the ForeignService system, including ending the oral exam's policy so that applicants could bebetter matched to particular cones, like public diplomacy, would be beneficial, theCommission asserts. Beyond reorganizing public diplomacy at State, several of the reports referto the need for a new \"culture\" at State: seeking to change the perception that publicdiplomacy personnel are second class citizens in the Department; recruiting andhiring practices that would encourage public diplomacy skills to be highly valued;and a \"much more open approach in which innovation trumps the caution,\" accordingto the National War College report.  Six of the studies refer to the need for redefining the role of the UnderSecretary of State for Public Diplomacy. Most call for strengthening the role, thechain of authority leading to the Under Secretary, and the authority to make decisionsregarding public diplomacy funding, policy, personnel, and direction. In contrast, theHart/Rudman Commission recommends repealing the laws establishing an UnderSecretary for Public Diplomacy and having some of those functions migrate to anAssistant Secretary-level officer reporting directly to the Secretary of State. Otherpublic diplomacy functions should become the responsibility of the AssistantSecretary for Economic and Transnational Affairs, the Commission said. Several reports speak of a need to increase embassy involvement in publicdiplomacy activities. Suggestions include expanding U.S. diplomats' personalcontacts in the host country, sending the message from the top tiers of theAdministration and the Department of State that public diplomacy is central to U.S.foreign policy, and requiring at least one tour in a public diplomacy assignment forForeign Service Officers to be promoted to Senior Foreign Service Officers or Chiefof Mission. Another suggestion involves embassies maintaining networks ofindividuals (such as former Peace Corps volunteers, exchange students, and retiredForeign Service Officers) who could be tapped to help portray America in the bestlight. Several studies suggest a lack of coordination of U.S. government publicdiplomacy activities by the White House and within the Department of State. TheU.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy notes that there have been attemptsto improve coordination, citing the January 2003 creation of the Office of GlobalCommunications within the White House, as well as the September 2002 formationof the Strategic Communication Policy Coordination Committee and the December2002 interagency Strategic Communications Fusion Team. Nevertheless,coordination is still inadequate, according to several of the reports. Recommendations on improving government coordination of public diplomacy entities and programs include  (1) the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy suggests assigning the StateDepartment's Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources with the responsibility foroverseeing the strategic planning of all public diplomacy programming andresources;  (2) the Heritage Foundation seeks better coordination through the White House,specifically through the Office of Global Communications;  (3) the Public Diplomacy Council recommends that a new U.S. Agency for PublicDiplomacy be responsible for coordinating all U.S. government public diplomacyefforts and establish an Interagency Committee on PD at the Cabinet level tocoordinate and direct the national PD strategy;  (4) the Council on Foreign Relations recommends that a coherent strategic andcoordinating framework for public diplomacy be developed, including a presidentialdirective on public diplomacy and a Public Diplomacy Coordinating Structure led bythe president's personal designee;  (5) the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World advisesa strengthening of the role of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy to coordinategovernment-wide public diplomacy activities, review country program plans withrespect to public diplomacy, allocate human and financial resources, and play a rolein performance evaluations. The Group asserts that strengthening the UnderSecretary's role is essential. About half of the reports state that public diplomacy resources are inadequateand call for increased monetary and human resources. The Council on ForeignRelations said that funding should be increased to \"significantly higher levels\" to bemore in line with public diplomacy's role as a vital component of U.S. foreign policyand national security. The Council put forth the idea of establishing a PublicDiplomacy Reserve Corps patterned after FEMA's disaster-relief model. The PublicDiplomacy Council specifically recommends a 300% increase in public diplomacy overseas staffing and a four-fold budget increase over five years. Some, such as theAdvisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World, state thatadditional professional staff dedicated only to Arab and Muslim issues would bevaluable. Coupled with the view since 9/11 that public diplomacy is an essential toolin U.S. foreign policy and national security is the belief that all personnel involvedwith conducting U.S. foreign policy should be trained about the importance of publicdiplomacy and given skills needed to fully utilize public diplomacy effectively. TheCouncil on Foreign Relations states that there is a deficit of trained professionalsregarding public diplomacy. GAO suggests expanding public diplomacy and foreignlanguage training of Foreign Service Officers; the Council on Foreign Relationsoffers the idea of establishing an independent public diplomacy training institute; and the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim Worldrecommends that all State Department personnel receive public diplomacy training. Taking that a step further, the Foreign Policy Association argues that \"public affairsdiplomacy officers should be encouraged to develop language fluency and countryand regional expertise and should not be rotated among regions like other FSOs[Foreign Service Officers].\" Most of the eight reports that speak about increased, more effective, andcreative uses of technology referred to use of the Internet. For example, the NationalWar College report states that there are \"deficiencies in information technologies andthe mindsets needed to integrate new technologies into the conduct of diplomacy....State Department needs to learn how to leverage the Internet's capabilities andpotential in the conduct of diplomacy.\" In addition, some reports promote increasedsatellite broadcasting and more creative use of all available informationtechnologies. Some studies make the observation that the private sector has manyadvantages in getting things done quickly, being highly effective, and efficient ininfluencing people. By incorporating the best practices of the private sector in U.S.government public diplomacy activities, it is believed that public diplomacy can become a more valuable foreign policy tool. RAND suggested that \"outsourcing\"public diplomacy would put some distance between a \"favorable message and anunfavorable messenger,\" and that identifying private sector talents could bemotivated through a competitive bidding process. Another idea comes from thePublic Diplomacy Council to create a public-private partnership \"Foundation for theGlobal Future\" to provide permanent off-budget funding for international exchangesconducted by civilian and military federal agencies. The U.S. Advisory Commissionon Public Diplomacy agrees with the Council on Foreign Relations about creating anindependent Corporation for Public Diplomacy. Additionally, the Commissionwould encourage overseas posts to explore local public-private partnerships, findways for visitor exchanges to take advantage of private sector generosity, anddevelop Internet and media programming that would utilize public/privatepartnerships. The Advisory Commission also proposes that private sectorcommunication consultants could become more involved in public diplomacy effortswith advertising, as well as entertainment programs, and that the academiccommunity could offer public diplomacy majors at American colleges anduniversities. GAO adds that the U.S. government could collaborate with the privatesector to develop optimal methods for measuring effectiveness of public diplomacyefforts.  Improved and increased communication between the United States andforeign, particularly Arab and Muslim, populations was cited by a few of the studies. The Defense Science Board's 2004 report asserts that \"nothing shapes U.S. policiesand global perceptions of U.S. foreign and national security objectives morepowerfully than the President's statements and actions, and those of senior officials.\" The Board suggests that the President communicate directly with overseas audiences.  The 9/11 Commission Report recommends that the United States shouldidentify what it stands for and communicate that message clearly. The 9/11Commission observed that many foreign populations receive large amounts of aidfrom U.S. citizens and never know from where it came.  The Council on Foreign Relations proposes a more customized, \"two-way\"dialogue, as contrasted to conventional one-way, \"push-down\" mass communication,including an \"engagement\" approach that involves listening, dialogue, and debate thatincreases the amount and the effectiveness of public opinion research. Furthermore,communication should foster increasingly meaningful relationships between U.S.government, foreign publics, and foreign journalists. The Council says the U.S.government should: support voices of moderation, especially among the young;identify and develop indigenous talent; and craft messages highlighting culturaloverlaps between American values and those of the rest of the world.  The RAND study encourages finding different ways of promoting two-waycommunication, such as call-in talk shows, live interaction among different elementsof an audience, and broadcasting debates, rather than offering monologues. TheAdvisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World proposesestablishing an Arab and Muslim Countries Public Communications Unit under thedirection of the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy to work closely with theOffice of Global Communications and coordinate U.S. government media outreachto Arab and Muslim populations and promote a 'rapid response' team to react andcorrect inaccuracies and distortions in foreign media. More than half of the 29 reports recommend expanding U.S. exchangeprograms and/or U.S. libraries overseas, making it the most common proposal amongthis group of reports. Some ideas for exchanges include expanding the U.S. Speakerand Specialist Program, expanding shorter duration exchange programs, creating American studies programs in local universities in Arab and Muslim populations,creating a public-private partnership, \"Foundation for the Global Future,\" to providepermanent off-budget funding for international exchanges conducted by civilian andmilitary federal agencies, significantly broadening Middle East/U.S. exchangeprograms, and expanding exchanges to government officials and businessprofessionals. Several studies echoed recommendations to expand Americanoverseas libraries as well as the American Corners Program. (4) In addition,the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World proposesimplementing a new American Knowledge Library to translate the best Americanbooks and make them available to local libraries and universities. A few of the studies recommend greater and continuous oversight of publicdiplomacy activities. One suggestion was for Congress to provide legislativeauthority for a quadrennial review of public diplomacy. Another would create a newcongressional committee structure with sustained oversight of all U.S. government public diplomacy programs and activities.  Table 2. Key Recommendations for International Broadcasting  a. PDC1 : Public Diplomacy Council 2005; ADV1 : U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy 2004; GAO1 : Government Accountability Office2004; NSFR : National Strategy Forum Review; PDC3 : Public Diplomacy Council 2004; DJE2 : Djerejian, Edward, October 2003; HER1 :Heritage Foundation, May 2003; HER2 : Heritage Foundation, April 2003; USIP2 : U.S. Institute of Peace 2002; CFR2 : Council on ForeignRelations 2002; PBS : Public Broadcasting Service b. Broadcasting Board of Governors  Of the 29 reports and articles, 11 offer recommendations specifically for U.S.government international broadcasting. Recommendations range from havingstrategic objectives to reorganizing the broadcasting entities to increasing resourcesand using more technologies to focusing on combating jamming. (See Table 2.) GAO, the Public Diplomacy Council (PDC), and the PBS News Hourbroadcast suggest the need for the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to betterdefine its overall objectives and strategy of obtaining the objectives. The 2002 PBSbroadcast states that there is no grand strategy or coordinated approach of U.S.broadcasting with other public diplomacy activities. GAO's 2004 report states thatwhile the BBG does have a strategic plan and has made progress in some measuringof its progress, the BBG has not defined a plan to adequately measure audience sizeor its programming credibility overseas. The PDC's January 2005 report urges the\"Administration and Congress to take a hard look at how international broadcastingis managed to serve broad U.S. public diplomacy goals and the American taxpayerand integrate broadcasting more closely with other public diplomacy tools.\" ThePDC believes that international broadcasting should be more closely integrated withother elements of strategic communication. Although the U.S. government international broadcasting structure wasreorganized in 1994, some reports recommend reorganizing U.S. internationalbroadcasting again. The U.S. Institute of Peace states that, \"the current array of USgovernment broadcasting services is duplicative, expensive, and evencounterproductive.\" The Heritage Foundation's May 2003 report asserts that internationalbroadcasting has \"lapsed into a jumble of duplicative efforts, led by a part time Boardof Governors.\" Reorganizing broadcasting would make it more streamlined andmore efficient, the report claims. Furthermore, according to Heritage, revitalizing theVoice of America's resources and program content is in order as VOA has beenneglected while Middle East programing has \"proliferated in a confusing array.\"  The Council on Foreign Relations (July 30, 2002) \"supports an independentand well-qualified broadcasting board with a full-time, top-caliber Chief ExecutiveOfficer who would report to the current BBG and be empowered to direct andsupervise all U.S. nonmilitary international broadcasting activities. Furthermore, theDepartment of State and the BBG should strengthen the Secretary of State's role inproviding information and guidance on foreign policy to the BBG by clarifying andspecifying the Secretary's role in making decisions on broadcast languages and otherforeign policy matters.\" The Advisory Group for the Arab and Muslim World proposes that U.S.government media should reach out to Arab and Muslim populations and promotea 'rapid response' team to react and correct inaccuracies and distortions in foreignmedia. The Advisory Group for the Arab and Muslim World states that about halfof the fund for public diplomacy goes for international broadcasting. The Groupbelieves that U.S. government international broadcasting should be brought under thestrategic direction of their proposed new Special Counselor to the President, saying\"[broadcasting] must be part of the public diplomacy process, not marching to itsown drummer with its own goals and strategy, sources of funding and board.\" Five reports provide various proposals regarding additional broadcasting toArab and Muslim populations. As previously mentioned, the Heritage Foundationargues that the various Middle East surrogate broadcasting entities such as RadioSawa and Al Hurra TV have distracted the BBG from properly maintaining VOAresources and programming. The Advisory Group for the Arab and Muslim Worldrecommends a thorough independent review of the Middle East Television Network,saying that there is a high level of skepticism in the Middle East region aboutstate-owned television of any sort. The Group suggests that paring up with privatesector programming might be more effective. The U.S. Advisory Commission onPublic Diplomacy recommends expanding communication with Arab press bycreating a network of 24-hour message dissemination and monitoring centers. ThePublic Diplomacy Forum (February 2004) held a panel discussion on Middle Eastbroadcasting. One panelist referred to Radio and Al Hurra TV as being state-run, andtherefore, less successful with Middle East audiences. The panelist said that, \"theArab public is interested in American programming, but they are not necessarilyinterested in programming that is under tight U.S. government direction.\" Anotherpanelist said that \"there is no market waiting for Al Hurra's message.\" The thirdpanelist strongly disagreed and said that \"the United States should have started RadioSawa and Al Hurra a long time ago.\"  Other reports generally support ongoing Middle East broadcasting or thinkmore resources and expanded programming to Muslim and Arab populations shouldbe forthcoming. As with public diplomacy, most reports that addressed resources urged agreater long-term monetary commitment for international broadcasting. Reachinglarger audiences and improving the ability to measure impact are two primary needsfor additional broadcast funding. International broadcasting is one area of foreign policy that can make use ofnew technologies to become more effective. The Advisory Commission on PublicDiplomacy encourages the BBG to look for better software to improve broadcasting'sreach to foreign audiences over the Internet. The Commission suggests theeducational programs teaching the English language or American culture might beuseful. Also, the Commission recommends that satellite television programs can befurther developed to increase local language programming available via satellite TV. The Public Diplomacy Council recommends more innovative broadcasting, Internetprograms for youth, and interactive radio programming.  The Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy notes that there are someareas of the world such as North Korea, China and Cuba where the United States hasdifficulty reaching audiences because of local government jamming. TheCommission notes that technologies such as the Internet and direct broadcast satellitehave made it more difficult, but not impossible, for governments to block Americanprogramming from their citizens. The Commission urges the BBG to continue todevelop new methods to combat jamming. (WP) Leonard H. Marks, Charles Z. Wick, Bruce Gelb and Henry E.

Marks, Charles Z. Wick, Bruce Gelb and Henry E. Catto. \"America Needs a Voice Abroad,\" Washington Post, February 26, 2005.  This editorial by former USIA directors is a general call to rebuild U.S. publicdiplomacy. While it does not make specific recommendations, it does call for theUnited States to explain its policies directly and openly; argues for the importanceof public affairs officers and USIA libraries; states that shutting down USIA wasmajor mistake; and supports the Public Diplomacy Council's recommendation tocreate a U.S. Agency for Public Diplomacy (see below). PDC1 -- Public Diplomacy Council. Call for Action on Public Diplomacy. January2005. Recommendations: Establish U.S. Agency for PublicDiplomacy; Increase public diplomacy staffing overseas by 300% andbudgets for international broadcasting and exchange programs by 400% over fiveyears; Provide long-term resources necessary for global internationalbroadcasting capability; Establish an Interagency Committee on Public Diplomacy atthe Cabinet level; and Create a public-private partnership \"Foundation for the GlobalFuture\" to provide permanent off-budget funding for internationalexchanges. PDC2 -- Public Diplomacy Council. \"Transformation Not Restoration.\" Statement of Dissent to Call for Action on Public Diplomacy . January 2005.  This statement of dissent refutes each of the five recommendations made ina Call for Action on Public Diplomacy (see above), arguing that the report draws tooheavily on the past. The dissent emphasizes that understanding what is credible inthe context of other societies is the foundation upon which effective publicdiplomacy is constructed; that the reference point for U.S. public diplomacy must bethe hopes, aspirations, and fears of foreign citizens; and that the United States' firstpriority must be observing and listening.  ADV1 -- Report of the US Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, 2004 Reportof the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy , September 28,2004.

Exchange programs Allocate the resources necessary to develop a comprehensiveexchange alumni database; Encourage the resourcefulness of posts in offering exchangeprograms by requiring the submission of competitive proposals for suchprograms. Centers, corners, virtual consulates, and libraries Encourage each American Corner with Internet access toprovide a virtual consulate Website as a start-up page on allworkstations; Fund American centers/libraries wherever security constraintspermit their existence, in order to continue benefitting from the great publicdiplomacy value they provide; Encourage Congress to give the Secretary of State the authorityto create American presence posts, and thereby expand this concept, by notifying theHouse International Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee. USAID and public diplomacy Create, for multiple areas of the globe, director of publicdiplomacy positions in the Bureau of Legislative and Public Affairs, as has been donefor the Middle East; Continue to enhance efforts to publicize the substantial amountof financial aid that the American people contribute abroad; Continue to coordinate with USAID to better publicize thenumerous contributions America makes to foreign societies.

Broadcasting: Satellite Programs Develop satellite television technologies further and expand onrecent successes in making native language programming available via satellitetelevision to missions of viewers in other countries. Internet Encourage the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) toactively look for ways to use emerging software developments to expand itsbroadcasting reach over the Internet. Hard-to-reach areas Continue the BBG development of new transmission methodsto combat jamming. DBS1 -- Department of Defense, Report of the Defense Science Board Task Forceon Strategic Communication, September 2004. The President should issue a directive to strengthen,understand, and communicate with global audiences; coordinate all components ofstrategic communication including public diplomacy, public affairs, internationalbroadcasting, and military information operations; and provide a foundation for newlegislation for planning, coordination, conduct and funding of strategiccommunications. The President should establish a permanent strategiccommunication structure within the National Security Council (NSC) and work withCongress to create legislation and funding. The President should work with Congress on legislation toestablish and fund a non-profit and non-partisan [501(c) (3) hybrid organization suchas Rand or the National Endowment for Democracy] Center for StrategicCommunication to support the NSC and departments and organizations representedon its Strategic Communication Committee. The Department of State should providea core funding grant for the Center. The President should redefine the role of Under Secretary ofState for public diplomacy and public affairs to be both policy advisor and managerfor public diplomacy. Responsibilities should include approving public diplomacyassignments, setting program direction and evaluation, reviewing performance ratingsof the public diplomacy office director and embassy public affairs officers. Allforeign policy initiatives and directives should have a public diplomacy componentapproved by the Under Secretary. Personnel and funding resources should be tripledand placed under the control of the Under Secretary.  State Department public diplomacy office directors should beraised to level of Deputy Assistant Secretary or Senior Advisor to the AssistantSecretary. Officers promoted to Chief of Mission or Senior Foreign Service shouldhave at least one tour in a public diplomacy assignment in the Department or in aninteragency assignment related to public diplomacy. The Bureau of IIP should bedirected by an Assistant Secretary. DOD's Under Secretary for Policy should act as the DOD focalpoint for strategic communication and serve as the DOD's principal on NSC'sStrategic Communication Coordinating Committee.  DOD's Under Secretary for Policy and the Joint Chiefs of Staffshould ensure that all military plans and operations have appropriate strategiccommunication components, ensure collaboration with DOS and with theater securitycooperation plans. DOD should triple resources -- personnel and funding -- available to combatant commanders for DOD support to public diplomacy andreallocate information operations funding within U.S. STRATCOM (U.S. StrategicCommand) for expanded support for strategic communicationprograms. GAO1 -- U.S. Government Accountability Office. U.S. Public Diplomacy, StateDepartment and Broadcasting Board of Governors Expand Post-9/11 Efforts butChallenges Remain. August 23, 2004. This report discusses some findings of post-9/11 public diplomacy efforts. The report includes criticisms, including some by public affairs officers, ofinsufficient time spend on public diplomacy, insufficient public affairs resources; theamount of time devoted to public diplomacy training is inadequate; and often theForeign Service Officers lack foreign language skills. This report did not list specificrecommendations, but the following were implied in the text of the report: Implement an overall public diplomacystrategy; Improve interagency communication and coordinationefforts; Define success and how it should bemeasured; Collect polling data and establish reportingrequirements; The Department of State public diplomacy operation isfragmented among various entities within State and needs betterorganization; The U.S. Government must define itsmessage; BBG's strategic plan does not, but should, include a single goalor related program objective to gage progress; BBG's plan needs measurable program objectives to support itsstrategic goals; U.S. public diplomacy resources need to be expanded to areasof the world thought to breed terrorist activities. 911 -- National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. The 9/11Commission Report , July 22, 2004. Expand funding for public diplomacy activities, such as information programs, broadcasting, exchanges, scholarships, libraries, and U.S.aid; Clearly identify that U.S. assistance comes from the citizens ofthe United States; The U.S. should identify what it stands for and communicatethat message clearly; The U.S. government should join other nations in generouslysupporting a new International Youth Opportunity Fund to improve education andprovide textbooks that do not teach hate, offering a choice of schools other thanmadrassas; Establish a forum for engaging both Western and Arab/Muslimrepresentatives to discuss each culture's needs and perspectives. This would helpcreate long-term relationships and understanding amongcultures. NSFR -- Walter R. Roberts and Barry Fulton. \"Rebuilding Public Diplomacy.\"National Strategy Forum Review. Spring 2004. Recommendations: Substantially increase public diplomacyresources; Conduct a careful assessment of America's public diplomacyreadiness;  New broadcast programs (e.g. Radio Sawa and Al Hurra) haveto be initiated and adequately funded; Better coordination with White House, other governmentagencies, and the private sector is needed. PDC3 -- Public Diplomacy Council. \"Engaging the Arab/Islamic World - Next Steps for U.S. Public Diplomacy.\" Summary of Public Diplomacy Forum. February 27,2004. This forum dealt specifically with American public diplomacy in the Arab/Islamicworld. Its recommendations and comments include: Public diplomacy must be more engaged in advising the policycommunity; Increase resources and trained personnel; Elites must lead in creating a civil discourse and in breakingdown stereotypes; Use the potential of Radio Sawa and Al HurraTV; Increase foreign language training and knowledge of cultureand history; Create a White House Counselor for Public Diplomacy at theCabinet level; The Djerejian Report (see DJE ) should beadopted; Arabs and Muslims need to study and understand the UnitedStates much more deeply; Break down stereotypes on both sides; reveal more of U.S.diversity and complexity; Improve personal contact by professionals, especially publicaffairs, political, and economic officers and ambassadors; Strengthen foreign press centers; Send American speakers abroad; Encourage more robust educational exchangeprograms. RAND -- Charles Wolf, Jr. And Brian Rosen. Public Diplomacy -- How to ThinkAbout and Improve it , 2004. Rand Observations: Public diplomacy should not come from government alone; The United States should seek creative talents in the privatesector, business, and academia which could be motivated through a competitivebidding process; It may be useful to find different modes of communicating bigpicture ideas of public diplomacy through debate and discussion, call-in shows, liveinteraction among different elements of the audience, rather than through the typicalmonologic conveyance of the message; Outsourcing public diplomacy may be helpful to put somedistance between a favorable message and an unfavorable messenger (i.e. the UnitedStates). FPA -- Jerrold Keilson. \"Public Diplomacy and U.S. Foreign Policy.\" G reatDecisions 2004 . Foreign Policy Association. This edition of the annual \"Great Decisions\" series offers mostly historicaland background information. While it refers to recommendations of other reports,it makes relatively few of its own. Among its recommendations and comments are: Educational exchange programs areimportant; The evidence on international broadcast programmingeffectiveness is mixed; The USIA realignment has reduced flexibility and independentaction; Foreign public opinion of the United States has declined evenas financial support for public diplomacy has increased in the last threeyears; Significant investment in number and quality of trained publicdiplomacy officers is needed; Public diplomacy officers need language proficiency andregional expertise and should not be rotated among regions like other foreign serviceofficers; The United States should create special libraries of key bookson America in accessible libraries, rather than in security-conscious embassylibraries; The United States should consolidate exchange, cultural, andinformation programs into one agency. Public diplomacy is now lost within overalloperation of the State Department; America should dramatically increase the number ofinternational visitors from the Muslim world; The possibility of policies being profoundly unpopular overseasshould be taken into account when developing the policy; modifications should beconsidered that might make them less so. KIE -- William Kiehl. \"Can Humpty Dumpty be Saved?\" American Diplomacy . November 13, 2003.  Among Kiehl's comments and recommendations: Public diplomacy must be proactive, more akin topsychological operations than to public relations; Regional bureaus must include senior public diplomacy officersat least at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level; Establish a new organization for public diplomacy that wouldbe a middle ground between the old USIA and the current weak structure [includesorganizational chart]; Amend Smith-Mundt to lift restriction on domesticdissemination of American international informationalmaterial.

NWC -- Information Age Diplomacy . National War College/NorthwesternUniversity Symposium. April 5-6, 2001. Symposium overview followed by statements by individual speakers. Symposium Overview: Change is needed in State Department culture, i.e. more openapproach in which innovation trumps caution; State Department change efforts have fallen short due to:inadequate financial and personnel resources, lack of training and strategic planning,and deficiencies in information technology and the mindsets to integrate newtechnologies into the conduct of diplomacy; Public diplomacy should be given higherpriority; The merger of USIA into the State Department hasn't beenaccompanied by a fundamental change in the culture ofdiplomacy. From individual speakers: Public diplomacy and information technology must be at thecenter of statecraft; Diplomats need to give much more attention to publicdiplomacy; The Jeffersonian concept of the State Department didn'tdistinguish between internal and external functions. This concept has relevancetoday; Unlike the Department of Defense, the State Departmentpersonnel system is antiquated and doesn't put proper emphasis ontraining; No government agency is in greater need of reform than theState Department. It must revamp culture, procedures, and infrastructure and givegreater attention to public outreach; The Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy needs to be at thetable on the first day of a crisis. Public diplomacy is substantive engagement overa long period of time with a broad range of people. CFR3 -- Council on Foreign Relations and Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies Task Force.
