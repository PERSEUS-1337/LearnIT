FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Commercial airports are critical to the economy and \n        economic competitiveness of the United States.\n            (2) Commercial airports and commercial aircraft are \n        essential elements of interstate commerce and the Supreme Court \n        has recognized the authority of Congress over all matters with \n        a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce.\n            (3) In 2007, commercial aviation contributed \n        $266,500,000,000, or 2 percent, to the gross domestic product \n        of the United States, employed, directly and indirectly, \n        10,881,000 people, and had a total economic impact of \n        $1,224,800,000,000.\n            (4) Commercial aviation is a vital channel of interstate \n        commerce and it is necessary that people and goods be able to \n        move through such a channel safely.\n            (5) Individuals and terrorist organizations use commercial \n        airports and commercial aircraft for premeditated, politically \n        motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets.\n            (6) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in which \n        terrorists used 4 commercial aircraft to cause the deaths of \n        2,976 people, had a severe adverse impact on airlines in the \n        United States, resulted in $40,000,000,000 in property and \n        casualty claims, resulted in 18,000 businesses being \n        dislocated, disrupted, or destroyed, and displaced nearly \n        130,000 employees.\n            (7) Firearms in airports would have an adverse impact on \n        the economy of the United States.\n            (8) Firearms are prohibited in the sterile area of \n        airports.\n            (9) Congress has the power, under clause 3 of section 8 of \n        article I of the Constitution of the United States (commonly \n        referred to as the ``Commerce Clause'') and other provisions of \n        the Constitution, to enact measures to ensure the safety and \n        economic well-being of commercial airports in the United \n        States.\n            (10) It is important for Congress to regulate the \n        possession of firearms in commercial airport facilities to \n        facilitate commercial aviation traffic safety, to protect the \n        safety of passengers and goods flying on commercial aircraft, \n        and to preserve the economic stability of the commercial \n        aviation industry.\n\nSEC. 3.
