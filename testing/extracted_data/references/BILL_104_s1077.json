FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) fossil fuels, the main energy source of the present, \n        have provided this country with tremendous supply but are \n        limited;\n            (2) additional research, development, and demonstration are \n        needed to encourage private sector investment in development of \n        new and better energy sources and enabling technologies;\n            (3) hydrogen holds tremendous promise as a fuel because it \n        can be extracted from water and can be burned much more cleanly \n        than conventional fuels;\n            (4) hydrogen production efficiency is a major technical \n        barrier to society's collectively benefiting from one of the \n        great energy carriers of the future;\n            (5) an aggressive, results-oriented, multiyear research \n        initiative on efficient hydrogen fuel production and use should \n        be maintained; and\n            (6) the current Federal effort to develop hydrogen as a \n        fuel is inadequate.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to direct the Secretary of Energy to conduct a \n        research, development, and demonstration program leading to the \n        production, storage, transport, and use of hydrogen for \n        industrial, residential, transportation, and utility \n        applications; and\n            (2) to provide advice from academia and the private sector \n        in the implementation of the Department of Energy's hydrogen \n        research, development, and demonstration program to ensure that \n        economic benefits of the program accrue to the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the \n        Department of Energy.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n\nSEC. 5.
