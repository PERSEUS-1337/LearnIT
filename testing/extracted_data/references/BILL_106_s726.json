FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police \n        Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through \n        the windshield of his police ear after he stopped a stolen \n        truck, and his life may have been saved if his police car had \n        been equipped with bullet resistant equipment;\n            (2) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n        in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n        enforcement officer in the United States had access to \n        additional bullet resistant equipment;\n            (3) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, 709 law \n        enforcement officers in the United States were feloniously \n        killed in the line of duty;\n            (4) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n        risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not wearing \n        bullet resistant equipment, such as an armor vest, is 14 times \n        higher than for officers wearing an armor vest;\n            (5) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, bullet-\n        resistant materials helped save the lives of more than 2,000 \n        law enforcement officers in the United States;\n            (6) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n        Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n        country has risen sharply despite a decrease in the national \n        crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n        crisis in Indian country''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of law \nenforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal law \nenforcement agencies provide officers with bullet resistant equipment \nand video cameras.\n\nSEC. 3.
