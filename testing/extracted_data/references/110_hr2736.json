FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Since AIDS cases were first reported more than 25 years \n        ago, approximately 1.7 million people in the United States have \n        been diagnosed with HIV and 500,000 of them have died.\n            (2) Racial minorities have been disproportionately affected \n        by this epidemic. Of the 1,200,000 United States HIV cases \n        reported, there are 500,000 African-Americans and 200,000 \n        Latinos living with the disease.\n            (3) It is estimated that 50 percent of all AIDS patients \n        are African Americans and 19 percent are Latinos. The African-\n        American community is 12 percent of the general United States \n        population, and Latinos are 14 percent of the population.\n            (4) Ten States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico account \n        for 71 percent of the Nation's AIDS cases.\n            (5) Within the top 10 States and territories with the \n        highest concentration of people living with HIV/AIDS, large \n        Latino and African-American populations reside in 7 of them: \n        New York, California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, and \n        Pennsylvania. African Americans comprise large percentages of \n        people living with this disease in Georgia, Maryland, and the \n        District of Columbia. Latinos comprise large percentages of \n        people living with HIV/AIDS in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and \n        Puerto Rico.\n            (6) Programs funded through title XXVI of the Public Health \n        Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-11 et seq.; as amended by the \n        ``Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006'') \n        are essential to people who are HIV/AIDS positive, particularly \n        those who are low income or from an ethnic or minority \n        community. Although recent changes to these programs address \n        the problem of reaching minority populations in this country, \n        more needs to be done as the epidemic continues to impact those \n        communities more severely.\n            (7) People who live with HIV/AIDS not only need assistance \n        to take care of their immediate physical condition, but also \n        require information and education about how to address other \n        consequences associated with the disease. A holistic approach \n        is necessary to address not just the immediate physical health \n        of an individual in the community, but also to educate on \n        preventing the spread of the disease in high-risk \n        neighborhoods.\n            (8) Capable non-profit entities are essential to providing \n        a comprehensive approach and reaching more individuals in their \n        local communities.\n            (9) There is an urgent need for providing funding to \n        entities that not only serve minority populations, but also \n        provide services through partnerships at the local level in \n        high-risk communities.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish and authorize \nfunding for a pilot grant program within the Minority AIDS Initiative \nthat will encourage qualified community health entities to cooperate \nwith each other to provide comprehensive HIV/AIDS services for racial \nand ethnic minorities in the local community where the entities are \nlocated.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIORITIZING HIV/AIDS SERVICES BY LOCAL ENTITIES TO MINORITIES.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Program.--Section 2693 of the Public Health \nService Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-101) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) by striking ``$135,100,000 for fiscal year \n                2008'' and inserting ``$185,100,000 for fiscal year \n                2008''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``$139,100,000 for fiscal year \n                2009'' and inserting ``$189,100,000 for fiscal year \n                2009''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Prioritizing HIV/AIDS Services by Local Entities to \nMinorities.--\n            ``(1) Reservation.--For carrying out this subsection, the \n        Secretary shall, of the amount appropriated under subsection \n        (a) for each of fiscal years 2008 and 2009, reserve not less \n        than $25,000,0000 and not more than $50,000,000.\n            ``(2) Grants.--In carrying out the purpose described in \n        subsection (a)--\n                    ``(A) the Secretary shall award grants to eligible \n                entities that are located in a community described in \n                paragraph (4)(C) (or are in partnership with an entity \n                that is located in a community described in paragraph \n                (4)(C)) to provide comprehensive HIV/AIDS services to \n                racial and ethnic minorities in such community;
