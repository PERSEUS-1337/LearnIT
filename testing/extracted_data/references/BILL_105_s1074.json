FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) an increasing number of children are raised in families \n        with only one parent present, usually the mother, and these \n        families are 5 times as likely to be poor as 2-parent families;\n            (2) the failure of noncustodial parents to pay their fair \n        share of child support is a major contributor to poverty among \n        single-parent families;\n            (3) in 1990, there was a $33,700,000,000 gap between the \n        amount of child support that was received and the amount that \n        could have been collected;\n            (4) in 1991, the aggregate child support income deficit was \n        $5,800,000,000;\n            (5) as of spring 1992, only 54 percent, or 6,200,000, of \n        custodial parents received awards of child support, and of the \n        6,200,000 custodial parents awarded child support, 5,300,000 \n        were supposed to receive child support payments in 1991;\n            (6) of the custodial parents described in paragraph (5), \n        approximately \\1/2\\ of the parents due child support received \n        full payment and the remaining \\1/2\\ were divided equally \n        between those receiving partial payment (24 percent) and those \n        receiving nothing (25 percent);\n            (7) as a result of the situation described in paragraphs \n        (5) and (6), increasing numbers of families are turning to the \n        child support program established under part D of title IV of \n        the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) for assistance, \n        accounting for an over 40 percent increase in the caseload \n        under that program during the 1991 to 1995 period;\n            (8) during the 1991 to 1995 period, the percentage of cases \n        under the title IV-D child support program in which a \n        collection was made declined from 19.3 percent to 18.9 percent;\n            (9) the Internal Revenue Service has improved its \n        performance in making collections in cases referred to it by \n        the title IV-D child support program, moving from successfully \n        intercepting Federal income tax refunds in 992,000 cases in \n        1992 to successfully intercepting Federal income tax refunds in \n        1,200,000 cases in 1996;\n            (10) in cases under the title IV-D child support program in \n        which a collection is made, approximately \\1/3\\ of such cases \n        are cases where some or all of the collection is a result of a \n        Federal tax refund intercept;\n            (11) in 1995, the average amount collected for families in \n        which the Internal Revenue Service made a collection through \n        the Federal tax refund intercept method was $827 for families \n        receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children and $847 for \n        other families; and\n            (12) State-by-State child support guidelines have resulted \n        in orders that vary significantly from State to State, \n        resulting in low awards and inequities for children.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) provide for the review of various State child support \n        guidelines to determine how custodial parents and children are \n        served by such guidelines;\n            (2) increase the economic security of children, improve the \n        enforcement of child support awards through a more centralized, \n        efficient system; and\n            (3) improve the enforcement of child support orders by \n        placing responsibility for enforcement in the Internal Revenue \n        Service.\n\n         TITLE I--NATIONAL CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES COMMISSION\n\nSEC. 101.
