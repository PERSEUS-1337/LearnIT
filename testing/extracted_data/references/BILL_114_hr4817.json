FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Birmingham Civil Rights District is an area of \n        downtown Birmingham, Alabama, where significant events in the \n        American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s took \n        place. Many sites in this area are listed on the National \n        Register of Historic Places, including the A.G. Gaston Motel, \n        Kelley Ingram Park, 16th Street Baptist Church, Bethel Baptist \n        Church, the 4th Avenue Historic District, and the Birmingham \n        Civil Rights Institute.\n            (2) In the 1960s, Birmingham was regarded as one of the \n        most segregated cities in the South. Parks, pools, playgrounds, \n        hotels, theaters, and elevators were segregated by race. \n        Discrimination extended to public housing and employment. \n        Despite some change in the early 1950s, segregation remained \n        firmly in place and violence was frequently used to maintain \n        the status quo.\n            (3) From 1945 to 1963, Birmingham witnessed 60 bombings of \n        African-American homes, businesses, and churches designed to \n        intimidate Civil Rights advocates. The violence earned the City \n        the nickname ``Bombingham''. In early 1963, Alabama Governor \n        George Wallace declared, ``Segregation Now! Segregation \n        tomorrow! Segregation Forever!''.\n            (4) In the spring of 1963, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth \n        requested that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference \n        (SCLC) make the City of Birmingham the epicenter for an \n        ambitious new Civil Rights campaign. ``Project C'' (C for \n        confrontation) was designed to eliminate segregation through \n        mass protests, marches, and sit-ins. The A.G. Gaston Motel \n        served as headquarters for Project C, and was home base for \n        much of the SCLC leadership including Dr. King.\n            (5) The A.G. Gaston Motel opened in 1954 and was regarded \n        as a ``historic monument to black entrepreneurship'' in a time \n        of racial segregation. The Motel was built and owned by Arthur \n        George Gaston (1892-1996), a prominent African-American \n        businessman, and is listed on the National Register of Historic \n        Places.\n            (6) The Project C campaign began on April 6, 1963, when \n        police arrested 45 protestors who marched from the A.G. Gaston \n        Motel to downtown Birmingham. One week later, during the Good \n        Friday march, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was arrested and \n        jailed by Birmingham police. While in prison, Dr. King wrote \n        his famous ``Letter from a Birmingham Jail''. He wrote the \n        letter as a response to the ``Call to Unity'' statement from \n        eight White Alabama clergymen who opposed segregation. They \n        believed that the battle for equality should be fought in the \n        courts, not by outsiders trying to stir up civil unrest. As a \n        response, Dr. King wrote ``I am in Birmingham because injustice \n        is here.''.\n            (7) Phase two of Project C began in May of 1963 with a \n        series of mass protests in which children played a leading \n        role. On May 2, 1963, over 900 children were arrested by \n        police, overwhelming the capacity of the City's jails. In \n        response, Birmingham Commissioner of Public Safety Bull Connor \n        ordered firefighters and police to prevent new waves of \n        marchers from leaving Kelly Ingram Park.\n            (8) On May 3, 1963, youth protestors in Kelly Ingram Park \n        were violently dispersed by police dogs and powerful water \n        cannons. Images of the brutal police response to peaceful \n        protestors spread across the country, shocking the conscience \n        of the Nation and the world.\n            (9) Fearing civil unrest and unrepairable damage to the \n        City's reputation, the Birmingham business community and local \n        leaders agreed to release the peaceful protestors, integrate \n        lunch counters, and begin to hire African-Americans. On May 10, \n        1963, the A.G. Gaston Motel served as the site to announce this \n        compromise between local White leaders and civil rights \n        advocates. The Motel was bombed later that day.\n            (10) Amid continued racial tensions, on September 15, 1963, \n        a bomb detonated at the 16th Street Baptist Church as children \n        were entering the basement on their way to worship. Addie Mae \n        Collins, Carole Robinson, and Cynthia Wesley, who were all 14, \n        and Denise McNair, 11, were tragically killed. The explosion \n        injured 22 others and left significant damage to the church. \n        Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., travelled to Birmingham to deliver \n        the eulogy for the four little girls. This act of domestic \n        terrorism shocked the conscience of the Nation and the world, \n        and became a galvanizing force for the passage of historic \n        Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n            (11) Located just south of 16th Street Baptist Church is \n        the 4th Avenue Historic District. The district was the center \n        for Black-owned businesses, which served Black customers during \n        the City's long period of enforced segregation. Specifically, \n        the district was the home of one of the most well-known \n        African-American owned radio stations in the state. Black radio \n        stations and disc jockeys played a critical role in mobilizing \n        support for the civil rights movement. DJs sent coded messages \n        as to the whereabouts of police, roadblock locations, and rally \n        information.\n            (12) Also located in Birmingham is Bethel Baptist Church. \n        Led by Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, this church served as the \n        headquarters for the Alabama Christian Movement for Human \n        Rights from 1956 to 1961. It was also a place of refuge for \n        displaced and injured members of the 1961 Freedom Ride, and was \n        the target of multiple bombings in the 1950s and 1960s. \n        Reverend Shuttlesworth's church, as well as many other \n        Birmingham Churches such as the New Pilgrim Baptist Church, \n        hosted mass meetings leading up to many of the civil rights \n        marches throughout the City. The students and faculty of Miles \n        College, a Historically Black College in the Birmingham area, \n        supplemented the efforts of the local churches. Miles College \n        was one of the few institutions of higher education open to \n        African-Americans in the area, and produced many community \n        leaders.\n            (13) In 1992, decades after the Civil Rights Movement, the \n        Birmingham Civil Rights Institute opened its doors. The \n        Institute stands at the center of the Birmingham Civil Rights \n        District, acting as a hub for children, students, adults, and \n        scholars who come to learn about the American Civil Rights \n        Movement. The 27,000-square-foot permanent gallery within the \n        Institute was designed to bring visitors back to the 1950s when \n        Birmingham was deeply segregated. The Institute serves more \n        than 140,000 individuals each year, and encourages new \n        generations to examine our country's civil rights history, as \n        well as issues such as equality and justice.\n            (14) The preservation, historic interpretation, and \n        management of the Birmingham Civil Rights National Historical \n        Park's important historical resources require the collaboration \n        of Federal and municipal entities, as well as community \n        organizations.\n\nSEC. 3.
