FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) a growing body of scientific knowledge demonstrates \n        that children may suffer disproportionately from environmental \n        health risks and safety risks;\n            (2) those risks arise because--\n                    (A) the neurological, immunological, digestive, and \n                other bodily systems of children are still developing;\n                    (B) children eat more food, drink more fluids, and \n                breathe more air in proportion to their body weight \n                than adults;\n                    (C) the size and weight of children may diminish \n                their protection from standard safety features; and\n                    (D) the behavior patterns of children may make \n                children more susceptible to accidents because children \n                are less able to protect themselves; and\n            (3) each Federal agency, to the extent permitted by law and \n        appropriate, and consistent with the mission of each Federal \n        agency, should--\n                    (A) place a high priority on the identification and \n                assessment of environmental health risks and safety \n                risks that may disproportionately affect children;\n                    (B) ensure that the policies, programs, activities, \n                and standards of the Federal agency address \n                disproportionate risks to children that result from \n                environmental health risks or safety risks; and\n                    (C) participate in the implementation of, and \n                comply with, this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
