FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there are 8 extant species of bear: Asian black bear, \n        brown bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, \n        giant panda, sun bear, and sloth bear;\n            (2) the Asian black bear populations have been decimated in \n        recent years by illegal trade to supply the growing demand for \n        medicines and cosmetics containing valuable bear viscera;\n            (3) without immediate action to end United States \n        involvement in the lucrative black market trade in bear \n        viscera, American bear populations may suffer the same \n        devastating losses as Asian bear populations;\n            (4) increasingly, undercover operations have discovered \n        that poachers are establishing extensive smuggling networks to \n        illegally commercialize American bears;\n            (5) because it is practically impossible to distinguish the \n        viscera of CITES Appendix I bears from the viscera of other \n        bear species, there is an urgent need to eliminate the trade in \n        the viscera of all bear species;\n            (6) as a party to CITES, a world leader in wildlife \n        conservation, and a large market for and supplier of bear \n        viscera and products, the United States shares responsibility \n        for supporting and implementing measures to stop the illegal \n        trade in CITES Appendix I Asian black bears and CITES Appendix \n        II American black bears;\n            (7) inconsistency in State prohibition of commercialization \n        of bear gall and inadequate Federal regulation of such \n        commercialization make law enforcement difficult; and\n            (8) individual States, which have the right to set, \n        maintain, and enforce quotas for the legal hunting of black \n        bears, will be assisted in their management efforts by the \n        enactment of a Federal law banning the import of, export of, \n        and interstate commerce in bear viscera.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term viability of the \nworld's 8 bear species and specifically to perpetuate healthy \npopulations of American bears.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States that effective long-term \nconservation of the world's bear species, including North American \nbears, depends in part on the prohibition of the lucrative trade in \nbear viscera.\n\nSEC. 5.
