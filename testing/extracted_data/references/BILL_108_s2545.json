GAO studies and reports on end-of-life planning issues.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Every year 2,500,000 people die in the United States. \n        Eighty percent of those people die in institutions such as \n        hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. Chronic \n        illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, account for 2 out \n        of every 3 deaths.\n            (2) In January 2004, a study published in the Journal of \n        the American Medical Association concluded that many people \n        dying in institutions have unmet medical, psychological, and \n        spiritual needs. Moreover, family members of decedents who \n        received care at home with hospice services were more likely to \n        report a favorable dying experience.\n            (3) In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its \n        decisions in Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, \n        reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to \n        refuse unwanted medical treatment. In those cases, the Court \n        stressed the use of advance directives as a means of \n        safeguarding that right should those adults become incapable of \n        deciding for themselves.\n            (4) A study published in 2002 estimated that the overall \n        prevalence of advance directives is between 15 and 20 percent \n        of the general population, despite the passage of the Patient \n        Self-Determination Act in 1990, which requires that health care \n        providers tell patients about advance directives.\n            (5) Competent adults should complete advance care plans \n        stipulating their health care decisions in the event that they \n        become unable to speak for themselves. Through the execution of \n        advance directives, including living wills and durable powers \n        of attorney for health care according to the laws of the State \n        in which they reside, individuals can protect their right to \n        express their wishes and have them respected.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to improve access to \ninformation about individuals' health care options and legal rights for \ncare near the end of life, to promote advance care planning and \ndecisionmaking so that individuals' wishes are known should they become \nunable to speak for themselves, to engage health care providers in \ndisseminating information about and assisting in the preparation of \nadvance directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \nattorney for health care, and for other purposes.\n\nSEC. 3.
