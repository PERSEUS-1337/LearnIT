FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) some agricultural diseases pose a direct threat to \n        human health;\n            (2) economic sabotage, in the form of agroterrorism, is \n        also a concern;\n            (3) the United States has an $80,000,000,000 livestock \n        industry;\n            (4) an outbreak of an agricultural disease, whether \n        naturally occurring or intentionally introduced, could--\n                    (A) have a profound impact on the infrastructure, \n                economy, and export markets of the United States; and\n                    (B) erode consumer confidence in the Federal \n                Government and the safety of the food supply of the \n                United States;\n            (5) as with human health and bioterrorism preparedness, \n        enhancing current monitoring and response mechanisms to deal \n        with a deliberate act of agricultural terrorism would \n        strengthen the ability of the United States to diagnose and \n        respond quickly to any animal health crisis;\n            (6)(A) activities to ensure the biosecurity of farms are an \n        important tool in preventing--\n                    (i) the intentional or accidental introduction of \n                an agricultural disease; and\n                    (ii) the spread of an introduced agricultural \n                disease into an outbreak; and\n            (B) most surveys of producers indicate discouraging and \n        dangerous trends in basic elements of farm security activities;\n            (7)(A) a national response plan, developed by the \n        Department of Agriculture and the Federal Emergency Management \n        Agency, would determine how interdependent agricultural health \n        and emergency management response functions will be coordinated \n        to ensure an orderly, immediate, and unified response to all \n        aspects of an outbreak of an agricultural disease;\n            (B) the Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with \n        State and industry partners, would implement the plan as \n        needed; and\n            (C) State and local partners would need assistance to \n        implement their shares of the plan;\n            (8) States and communities also require assistance to \n        prepare and plan for agricultural disasters;\n            (9)(A) rapid detection of an agricultural disease is \n        imperative in containing the spread of the agricultural \n        disease; and\n            (B) potential delays and difficulty in detection may \n        complicate decisions regarding appropriate control measures; \n        and\n            (10)(A) planning for a response to an outbreak of an \n        agricultural disease will vary from State to State, \n        reflecting--\n                    (i) the level of awareness;\n                    (ii) the perception of risk;\n                    (iii) competing time demands; and\n                    (iv) the availability of resources; and\n            (B) State response capability would be significantly \n        enhanced if State agricultural and emergency management \n        officials were to jointly develop a comprehensive agricultural \n        disease response plan.\n\nSEC. 3.
