In such case, the attorney \n                general of a State shall provide notice and a copy of \n                the complaint to the Commission at the same time as the \n                attorney general files the action.\n    (b) Intervention.--\n            (1) In general.--On receiving notice under subsection \n        (a)(2), the Commission shall have the right to intervene in the \n        action that is the subject of the notice.\n            (2) Effect of intervention.--If the Commission intervenes \n        in an action under subsection (a), it shall have the right--\n                    (A) to be heard with respect to any matter that \n                arises in that action; and\n                    (B) to file a petition for appeal.\n    (c) Construction.--For purposes of bringing any civil action under \nsubsection (a), nothing in this title shall\nbe construed to prevent an attorney general of a State from exercising \nthe powers conferred on the attorney general by the laws of that State \nto--\n            (1) conduct investigations;\n            (2) administer oaths or affirmations; or\n            (3) compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n        documentary and other evidence.\n    (d) Actions by the Commission.--In any case in which an action is \ninstituted by or on behalf of the Commission for a violation of section \n3, no State may, during the pendency of that action, institute an \naction under subsection (a) against any defendant named in the \ncomplaint in that action--\n    (e) Venue.--Any action brought under subsection (a) may be brought \nin the district court of the United States that meets applicable \nrequirements relating to venue under section 1391 of title 28, United \nStates Code.\n    (f) Service of Process.--In an action brought under subsection (a), \nprocess may be served in any district in which the defendant--\n            (1) is an inhabitant; or\n            (2) may be found.\n\nSEC. 6.
