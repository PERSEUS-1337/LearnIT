FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Methyl bromide is a broad spectrum pesticide which \n        protects plants and agricultural products from a wide range of \n        insects, rodents, viruses, fungi, weeds, and nematodes.\n            (2) American farmers depend on methyl bromide to grow, \n        store, ship, process, and trade over 100 different crops.\n            (3) The agricultural community has no safe, effective, \n        commercially available alternatives to methyl bromide. Some \n        nonchemical pest control alternatives have proven effective in \n        small scale tests but are largely untested, much less proven, \n        for commercial food production purposes. The Environmental \n        Protection Agency's Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic \n        Substances reports that few substitutes exist, all of which \n        pose potential human health and environmental risks.\n            (4) In 1992, the Montreal Protocol on Substances Depleting \n        the Ozone Layer was amended to include methyl bromide.\n            (5) According to the 1992 Science Assessment Report to the \n        Montreal Protocol, agricultural use of methyl bromide accounts \n        for less than 3 percent of the threat to the ozone layer, and a \n        similar report issued in 1994 notes that the Earth's ozone \n        layer will return to normal by the middle of the next century \n        even if methyl bromide remains available to farmers.\n            (6) In 1993, despite the importance of methyl bromide, the \n        lack of alternatives, and many scientific uncertainties, the \n        Environmental Protection Agency, citing the Montreal Protocol, \n        listed methyl bromide as an ozone depleting chemical under the \n        provisions of the Clean Air Act and ordered United States \n        production frozen at 1991 levels and an end to production by \n        January 1, 2001.\n            (7) Given current alternatives, analysis at the University \n        of Florida predicts a 43 percent decline in affected vegetable \n        acreage in Florida. A 1993 United States Department of \n        Agriculture study finds that the ban will cost as much as \n        $1,500,000,000 in Florida, Georgia, California, North Carolina, \n        and South Carolina, the 5 States where methyl bromide is most \n        utilized.\n\nSEC. 2. CONTROL OF METHYL BROMIDE.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n            (1) The term ``use as a pesticide'' includes farming and \n        post-harvest uses.\n            (2) The term ``pesticide'' has the same meaning as when \n        used in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide \n        Act.\n            (3) The term ``control'' means, with respect to any \n        substance, any ban, phase-out, or other restriction on the \n        production, importation, export, consumption, or use of the \n        substance.\n            (4) The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of \n        the Environmental Protection Agency.\n    (b) Restrictions on EPA Authority.--Except as provided in \nsubsection (c) or (d), the Administrator may not--\n            (1) control the production, importation, or export of the \n        substance methyl bromide pursuant to title VI of the Clean Air \n        Act (42 U.S.C. section 7671-7671q) for consumption or use as a \n        pesticide;\n            (2) control the consumption or use of methyl bromide as a \n        pesticide; or\n            (3) require the labelling of any agricultural product \n        treated with methyl bromide.\n    (c) Existence of Substitutes or Alternatives.--The Administrator \nmay take any action described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of \nsubsection (b), or any combination of such actions, if the Secretary of \nAgriculture has certified by rule that there exist viable, cost-\neffective substitutes or other alternatives to the consumption or use \nof methyl bromide as a pesticide for specified agricultural commodities \nand products. If the Secretary has made a certification under this \nparagraph, a control permitted pursuant to such certification shall \napply only with respect to those specified applications and to those \nspecified commodities and products for which the certification is made.\n    (d) Montreal Protocol.--The Administrator may take any action \ndescribed in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (b), or any \ncombination of such actions, if the United States is required by the \nMontreal Protocol to implement a control on the production, \nimportation, or export of methyl bromide for consumption or use as a \npesticide or a control on the consumption or use of methyl bromide as a \npesticide. The applicability, contents and timing of any such control--\n            (1) shall be no more stringent or restrictive than \n        specifically required by the Montreal Protocol,\n            (2) shall be equally required of all parties to the \n        Montreal Protocol; and\n            (3) shall include all exemptions, exceptions, and other \n        flexibility (including exemptions for production, importation, \n        export, and consumption, for both preshipment and quarantine \n        uses) allowed by the Montreal Protocol.\n    (e) Inconsistent EPA Actions.--All rules, standards and other \nregulatory actions promulgated, published, or otherwise issued by the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency before the date of \nenactment of this Act are repealed to the extent they impose a control \nwhich is not specifically required by the Montreal Protocol.\n    (f) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \naffect the provisions of 40 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 82.9, 82.10, 82.11, and \n82.12 (relating to Article 5 parties and transfers), or any other \nregulatory provisions granting exemptions, exceptions, or other \nflexibility not prohibited by the Montreal Protocol."
