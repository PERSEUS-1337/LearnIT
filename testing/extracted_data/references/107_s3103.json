    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Cellular Towers \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The placement, construction, and modification of \n        personal wireless services facilities (also known as wireless \n        facilities) near residential communities and facilities such as \n        schools can greatly reduce the value of residential properties, \n        destroy the views from properties, produce radio frequency \n        interference, raise concerns about potential long-term health \n        effects of such facilities, and reduce substantially the desire \n        to live in the areas of such facilities.\n            (2) States and local governments have traditionally \n        regulated development and should be able to exercise control \n        over the placement, construction, and modification of wireless \n        facilities through the use of zoning and other land use \n        regulations relating to the protection of the environment, \n        public health and safety, and the general welfare of the \n        community and the public.\n            (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes \n        policies to govern interstate and international communications \n        by television, radio, wire, satellite, and cable. The \n        Commission ensures the compliance of such activities with a \n        variety of Federal laws, including the National Environmental \n        Policy Act of 1969 and the National Historic Preservation Act, \n        in its decision-making on such activities.\n            (4) Under section 332(c)(7)(A) of the Communications Act of \n        1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(A)), the Commission defers to State \n        and local authorities that regulate the placement, \n        construction, and modification of wireless facilities through \n        the use of zoning and other land use regulations.\n            (5) Alternative technologies for the placement, \n        construction, and modification of wireless facilities may meet \n        the needs of a wireless services provider in a less intrusive \n        manner than the technologies proposed by the wireless services \n        provider, including the use of small towers that do not require \n        blinking aircraft safety lights, break skylines, or protrude \n        above tree canopies.\n            (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the \n        requirements of the Commission with respect to the application \n        of State and local ordinances to the placement, construction \n        and modification of wireless facilities (for example WT Docket \n        No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62, RM-8577, and FCC 97-303, 62 FR \n        47960) be modified so as--\n                    (A) to permit State and local governments to \n                exercise their zoning and other land use authorities to \n                regulate the placement, construction, and modification \n                of such facilities; and\n                    (B) to place the burden of proof in civil actions, \n                and in actions before the Commission and State and \n                local authorities relating to the placement, \n                construction, and modification of such facilities, on \n                the person that seeks to place, construct, or modify \n                such facilities.\n            (7) PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber Optic, and satellite \n        telecommunications systems, including Low-Earth Orbit \n        satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide so-\n        called ``911'' emergency telephone service throughout much of \n        the United States without unduly intruding into or effecting \n        the environment, public health and safety, and the general \n        welfare of the community and the public.\n            (8) The Federal Aviation Administration must rely upon \n        State and local governments to regulate the placement, \n        construction, and modification of telecommunications facilities \n        near airports or high-volume air traffic areas such as \n        corridors of airspace or commonly used flyways. The proposed \n        rules of the Commission to preempt State and local zoning and \n        other land-use regulations for the siting of such facilities \n        will have a serious negative impact on aviation safety, airport \n        capacity and investment, the efficient use of navigable \n        airspace, public health and safety, and the general welfare of \n        the community and the public.\n            (9) The telecommunications industry and its experts should \n        be expected to have access to the best and most recent \n        technical information and should therefore be held to the \n        highest standards in terms of their representations, \n        assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local \n        authority regarding the placement, construction, and \n        modification of personal wireless services facilities under \n        section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n        332(c)(7)).\n            (2) To permit State and local governments--\n                    (A) to regulate the placement, construction, or \n                modification of personal wireless services facilities \n                with respect to their impacts on land use, including \n                radio frequency interference and radio frequency \n                radiation, in order to protect the environment, public \n                health and safety, and the general welfare of the \n                community and the public;\n                    (B) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n                modification of personal wireless services facilities \n                so that they will not interfere with the safe and \nefficient use of public airspace or otherwise compromise or endanger \nthe public health and safety and the general welfare of the community \nand the public; and\n                    (C) to hold accountable applicants for permits for \n                the placement, construction, or modification of \n                personal wireless services facilities, and providers of \n                services using such facilities, for the truthfulness \n                and accuracy of representations and statements placed \n                in the record of hearings for permits, licenses, or \n                approvals for such facilities.\n\nSEC. 3. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND \n              MODIFICATION OF PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICES FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Limitations on State and Local Regulation of Facilities.--\nSubparagraph (B) of section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 \n(47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking clause (iv);\n            (2) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and\n            (3) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--\n                    (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``may, \n                within 30 days'' and all that follows through the end \n                of the sentence and inserting ``may commence an action \n                in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such action \n                shall be commenced within 30 days after such action or \n                failure to act unless the State concerned has \n                established a different period for the commencement of \n                such action.''; and\n                    (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting \n                the following: ``In any such action in which a person \n                seeking to place, construct, or modify a personal \n                wireless services facility is a party, such person \n                shall bear the burden of proof, regardless of who \n                commences such action.''.\n    (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Relief From State and \nLocal Regulation of Facilities.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw, the Federal Communications Commission shall not adopt as a final \nrule or otherwise directly or indirectly implement any portion of the \nproposed rule set forth in ``Procedures for Reviewing Requests for \nRelief From State and Local Regulation Pursuant to Section \n332(c)(7)(B)(v) of the Communications Act of 1934'', WT Docket No. 97-\n192, released August 25, 1997.\n    (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and Modification of \nFacilities.--Such section 332(c)(7) is further amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n        and\n            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n        subparagraph (C):\n                    ``(C) Additional limitations.--\n                            ``(i) Authority to require least intrusive \n                        facilities.--\n                                    ``(I) In general.--A State or local \n                                government may deny an application to \n                                place, construct, or modify personal \n                                wireless services facilities on the \n                                basis that alternative technologies, \n                                delivery systems, or structures are \n                                capable of delivering a personal \n                                wireless services signal comparable to \n                                that proposed to be delivered by such \n                                facilities in a manner that is less \n                                intrusive to the community concerned \n                                than such facilities.\n                                    ``(II) Considerations.--In \n                                determining under subclause (I) the \n                                intrusiveness of technologies, delivery \n                                systems, or structures for personal \n                                wireless services facilities, a State \n                                or local government may consider the \n                                aesthetics of such technologies, \n                                systems, or structures, the \n                                environmental impact of such \n                                technologies, systems, or structures, \n                                and the radio frequency interference or \n                                radiation emitted by such technologies, \n                                systems, or structures.\n                                    ``(III) Burden of proof.--In any \n                                hearing for purposes of the exercise of \n                                the authority in subclause (I), the \n                                burden shall be on the applicant.\n                            ``(ii) Radio interference.--A State or \n                        local government may regulate the location, \n                        height, or modification of personal wireless \n                        services facilities in order to address the \n                        effects of radio frequency interference caused \n                        by such facilities on local communities and the \n                        public.\n                            ``(iii) Authority to require studies and \n                        documentation.--No provision of this Act may be \n                        interpreted to prohibit a State or local \n                        government from--\n                                    ``(I) requiring a person seeking \n                                authority to place, construct, or \n                                modify personal wireless services \n                                facilities to produce--\n                                            ``(aa) environmental, \n                                        biological, and health studies, \n                                        engineering reports, or other \n                                        documentation of the compliance \n                                        of such facilities with radio \n                                        frequency exposure limits, \n                                        radio frequency interference \n                                        impacts, and compliance with \n                                        applicable laws, rules, and \n                                        regulations governing the \n                                        effects of such facilities on \n                                        the environment, public health \n                                        and safety, and the general \n                                        welfare of the community and \n                                        the public;
