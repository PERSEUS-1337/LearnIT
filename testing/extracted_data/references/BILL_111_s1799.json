SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness and Accountability in \nReceiving Overdraft Coverage Act of 2009'' or the ``FAIR Overdraft \nCoverage Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    Section 102 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Fairness and Accountability in Overdraft Coverage.--\n            ``(1) Findings.--The Congress also finds that--\n                    ``(A) overdraft coverage is a form of short-term \n                credit that depository institutions provide for \n                consumer transaction accounts. Historically, depository \n                institutions covered overdrafts for a fee on an ad hoc \n                basis;\n                    ``(B) with the growth in specially designed \n                software programs and in consumer use of debit cards, \n                overdraft coverage for a fee has become more prevalent;\n                    ``(C) most depository institutions do not notify \n                consumers when adding this feature to their transaction \n                accounts, and some do not permit consumers to eliminate \n                this feature from such accounts;\n                    ``(D) most depository institutions collect a high \n                flat fee, including for small dollar transactions, each \n                time the institution covers an overdraft, in some cases \n                impose multiple overdraft coverage fees within a single \n                day, and many charge additional fees for each day \n                during which the account remains overdrawn; and\n                    ``(E) such abusive and misleading practices in \n                connection with overdraft coverage fees have deprived \n                consumers of meaningful choices about their accounts \n                and placed significant financial burdens on low- and \n                moderate-income consumers.\n            ``(2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to protect \n        consumers by limiting abusive and misleading overdraft coverage \n        fees and practices, and by providing meaningful disclosures and \n        consumer choice in connection with overdraft coverage fees.''.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Additional Definitions.--Section 103 of the Truth in Lending \nAct (15 U.S.C. 1602) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(cc) Definitions Relating to Overdraft Coverage.--\n            ``(1) Check.--The term `check' has the same meaning as in \n        section 3(6) of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (12 \n        U.S.C. 5001 et seq.), other than a travelers check.\n            ``(2) Depository institution.--The term `depository \n        institution' has the same meaning as in clauses (i) through \n        (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 \n        U.S.C. 461(b)(1)(A)).\n            ``(3) Nonsufficient fund fee.--The term `nonsufficient fund \n        fee' means a fee or charge assessed in connection with an \n        overdraft for which a depository institution declines payment.\n            ``(4) Overdraft.--The term `overdraft' means the amount of \n        a withdrawal by check or other debit from a transaction account \n        in which there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the \n        account to cover such check or debit.\n            ``(5) Overdraft coverage.--The term `overdraft coverage' \n        means the payment of a check presented or other debit posted \n        against a transaction account by the depository institution in \n        which such account is held, even though there are insufficient \n        or unavailable funds in the account to cover such checks or \n        other debits.\n            ``(6) Overdraft coverage fee.--The term `overdraft coverage \n        fee' means any fee or charge assessed in connection with \n        overdraft coverage, or in connection with any negative account \n        balance that results from overdraft coverage, excluding fees or \n        charges relating to overdraft lines of credit or transfers from \n        an account linked to another transaction account or line of \n        credit. Such fee shall be considered a `finance charge' for \n        purposes of section 106(a), but shall not be included in the \n        calculation of the rate of interest for purposes of section \n        107(5)(A)(vi) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. \n        1757(5)(A)(vi)).\n            ``(7) Overdraft coverage program.--The term `overdraft \n        coverage program' means a service under which a depository \n        institution assesses an overdraft coverage fee for overdraft \n        coverage.\n            ``(8) Transaction account.--The term `transaction account' \n        has the same meaning as in section 19(b)(1)(C) of the Federal \n        Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)(C)).''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 107(5)(A)(vi) of the Federal \nCredit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1757(5)(A)(vi)) is amended by inserting ``, \nother than an overdraft coverage fee, as defined in section 103(cc) of \nthe Truth in Lending Act (12 U.S.C. 1602(cc))'' after ``inclusive of \nall finance charges''.\n\nSEC. 4.
