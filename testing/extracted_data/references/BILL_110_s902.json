FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 700,000 children have had a parent deployed \n        overseas as a member of the Armed Forces since September 11, \n        2001, and more than such 2,700 children have had a parent \n        killed in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n            (2) Forty-one percent of the members of the National Guard \n        and Reserve who have been deployed overseas report mental \n        health symptoms within three to six months of returning home \n        from deployment, compared with 32 percent of the members of the \n        regular military who have been so deployed. Fifteen percent of \n        the members of the National Guard and Reserve have been \n        identified as at risk for post traumatic stress disorder \n        (PTSD), compared with 9 percent of the members of the regular \n        military. Research suggests that increased stress in the family \n        can trigger symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder.\n            (3) Military families face significant challenges \n        throughout the deployment cycle of members of the Armed Forces. \n        Families of members of the National Guard and Reserve are \n        particularly vulnerable because of their distance from military \n        bases and their lack of access to the services upon which \n        military families typically draw. In addition, many families of \n        members of the National Guard and Reserve are currently \n        experiencing multiple extended deployments, and do not have the \n        necessary support available to them.\n            (4) Uncertainty and separation can create high levels of \n        stress for parents, spouses, and children. Stress can put \n        children at greater risk for behavioral problems, academic \n        difficulties, anxiety, and depression. Family separations many \n        times result in marital problems, financial difficulties, and \n        stress on family relationships.\n            (5) Research suggests that military families who receive \n        community and social support while members of the National \n        Guard and Reserve are undergoing deployment have the most \n        positive outcomes. Supporting families and children affected by \n        deployment can ease transitional stress, help members of the \n        National Guard and Reserve and their families cope during and \n        after deployment, prevent mental health problems, and assist in \n        a smooth transition of members of the National Guard and \n        Reserve back to civilian life.\n\nSEC. 3.
