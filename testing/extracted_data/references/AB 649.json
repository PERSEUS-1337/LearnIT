Thermometers, thermocouples, or other monitoring devices identified in the facility operating plan shall be checked for calibration annually. Records of the calibration checks shall be maintained as part of the facility\u2019s files and records for a period of two years or for the period specified in the regulations.\n(C) Heat-sensitive tape, or another method acceptable to the enforcement agency, shall be used on each biohazard bag or sharps container that is processed onsite to indicate that the waste went through heat treatment. If the biohazard bags or sharps containers are placed in a large liner bag within the autoclave for treatment, heat-sensitive tape or another method acceptable to the enforcement agency only needs to be placed on the liner bag and not on every hazardous waste bag or sharps container being treated.\n(D) The biological indicator Geobacillus stearothermophilus, or other indicator of adequate sterilization as approved by the department, shall be placed at the center of a load processed under standard operating conditions at least monthly to confirm the attainment of adequate sterilization conditions.\n(E) Records of the procedures specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D) shall be maintained for a period of not less than two years.\n(3) (A) Other alternative medical waste treatment methods which are both of the following:\n(i) Approved by the department.\n(ii) Result in the destruction of pathogenic micro-organisms.\n(B) Any alternative medical waste treatment method proposed to the department shall be evaluated by the department and either approved or rejected pursuant to the criteria specified in this subdivision.\n(C) Any alternative medical waste treatment solely designed to treat pharmaceutical waste, including a pharmaceutical incinerator, shall be evaluated and approved by the department with regard to the necessary treatment of pharmaceuticals. By June 1, 2017, the department shall complete the first evaluation\nand approval\nof these alternative medical waste treatments, including a pharmaceutical incinerator.\nIn evaluating any alternative medical waste treatment, the department shall consult with the State Water Resources Control Board, the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the State Air Resources Board, and local air quality management districts to ensure compliance with all other applicable environmental quality laws prior to approval of the alternative medical waste treatment.\n(b) Fluid blood or fluid blood products may be discharged to a public sewage system without treatment if its discharge is consistent with waste discharge requirements placed on the public sewage system by the California regional water quality control board with jurisdiction.\n(c) (1) A medical waste that is a biohazardous laboratory waste, as defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 117690, may be treated by a chemical disinfection if the waste is liquid or semiliquid and the chemical disinfection method is recognized by the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the American Biological Safety Association, and if the use of chemical disinfection as a treatment method is identified in the site\u2019s medical waste management plan.\n(2) If the waste is not treated by chemical disinfection, in accordance with paragraph (1), the waste shall be treated by one of the methods specified in subdivision (a).\n(3) Following treatment by chemical disinfection, the medical waste may be discharged to the public sewage system if the discharge is consistent with waste discharge requirements placed on the public sewage system by the California regional water control board, and the discharge is in compliance with the requirements imposed by the owner or operator of the public sewage system. If the chemical disinfection of the medical waste causes the waste to become a hazardous waste, the waste shall be managed in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section 25100) of Division 20.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 118217 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n118217.\nA law enforcement agency that operates a prescription drug takeback program may utilize up to four times per year a pharmaceutical incinerator that is evaluated and approved by the department pursuant to Section\n118215.\n118215 and that complies with all other applicable federal and state laws and local ordinances."
