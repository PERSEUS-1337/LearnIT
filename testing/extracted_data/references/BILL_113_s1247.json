FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) An estimated 13,500 children and adolescents under age \n        20 are diagnosed with cancer each year.\n            (2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer \n        survived more than 5 years, but by 2011, cure rates have \n        increased to 78 percent for children and adolescents under age \n        20.\n            (3) As of June 2013, there are more than 360,000 childhood \n        cancer survivors living in the United States.\n            (4) As many as \\2/3\\ of childhood cancer survivors are \n        likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, \n        with as many as \\1/4\\ experiencing a late effect that is \n        serious or life-threatening. The most common late effects of \n        childhood cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, \n        cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects and \n        secondary malignancies.\n            (5) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as \n        treatments evolve, which means that the monitoring and \n        treatment of cancer survivors may need to be modified on a \n        routine basis.\n            (6) The Institute of Medicine, in its report on cancer \n        survivorship entitled ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship: \n        Improving Care and Quality of Life'', states that an organized \n        system of care and a method of care for pediatric cancer \n        survivors is needed.\n\nSEC. 3.
