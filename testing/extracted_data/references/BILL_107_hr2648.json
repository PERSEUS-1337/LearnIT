SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    ``(a) Short Title.--This chapter may be cited as the `Recruit and \nReward Future Math and Science Teachers of America Act of 2001'.\n    ``(b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) United States high school students rate 16th and \n        19th, respectively, in science and math out of 21 countries.\n            ``(2) Of United States high school students who take math \n        courses, 22 percent are taught by teachers who did not prepare \n        in that field.\n            ``(3) Of United States high school students who take \n        biology courses, 24 percent are taught by teachers who did not \n        prepare in that field.\n            ``(4) Of United States high school students who take \n        chemistry courses, 30 percent are taught by teachers who did \n        not prepare in that field.\n            ``(5) Of United States high school students who take \n        physics courses, 56 percent are taught by teachers who did not \n        prepare in that field.\n            ``(6) Teachers' knowledge and skills powerfully influence \n        student learning.\n            ``(7) More than 2,000,000 teachers will need to be hired \n        over the next decade.\n            ``(8) The ability of the United States to place highly \n        qualified math and science teachers specializing in their field \n        of instruction will depend on proactive policies that increase \n        funding for teacher training, recruitment, and induction.\n\n``SEC. 407B. PURPOSE; APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZED.\n\n    ``(a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this chapter to make grants \navailable, through a pilot program, to eligible institutions described \nin section 407C, to enable such institutions to provide 500 scholarship \nawards to outstanding students enrolled in an accredited teacher \ntraining graduate program who are committed to pursuing careers \nteaching math and science at an urban or rural secondary level \nclassroom.\n    ``(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this chapter $5,000,000 in each of the fiscal \nyears 2002, 2003, and 2004.\n\n``SEC. 407C.
