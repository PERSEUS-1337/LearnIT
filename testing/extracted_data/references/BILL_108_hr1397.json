FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The intent of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n        Act of 1974 to protect the pension and welfare benefits of \n        workers is frustrated by the practice of mislabeling or \n        relabeling employees to improperly exclude them from employee \n        benefit plans. Employees are wrongly denied benefits when they \n        are misclassified or reclassified as temporary employees, part-\n        time employees, leased employees, agency employees, staffing \n        firm employees, and independent contractors. If their true \n        employment status were recognized, these misclassified and \n        reclassified employees would be eligible to participate in \n        employee pension and welfare benefit plans because such plans \n        are offered to other employees performing the same or \n        substantially the same work and working for the same employer.\n            (2) Mislabeled employees are often paid through staffing, \n        temporary, employee leasing, or other similar firms to give the \n        appearance that the employees do not work for their employer. \n        Employment contracts and reports to government agencies also \n        are used to give the erroneous impression that mislabeled \n        employees work for staffing, temporary, employee leasing, or \n        other similar firms, when the facts of the work arrangement do \n        not meet the common law standard for determining the employment \n        relationship. Employees are also mislabeled as contractors and \n        paid from non-payroll accounts to give the appearance that they \n        are not employees of their employer. These practices violate \n        the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n            (3) Employers are amending their employee benefit plans to \n        add provisions that exclude mislabeled employees from \n        participation in the plan even in the event that such employees \n        are determined to be common law employees and otherwise \n        eligible to participate in the plan. These plan provisions \n        violate the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n            (4) As a condition of employment or continued service, \n        employees are often required to sign documents that purport to \n        waive their right to participate in employee benefit plans. \n        Such documents inaccurately claim to limit the authority of the \n        courts and applicable Federal agencies to correct the \n        mislabeling and relabeling of employees and to enforce the \n        terms of plans providing for their participation. This practice \n        violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n            (5) As a condition of continued employment or service, \n        employees are often required to sign documents that purport to \n        waive their right to bring a lawsuit under the Employee \n        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Such documents \n        inaccurately claim to limit the ability of the courts and \n        applicable Federal agencies to obtain any payments or benefits \n        in the event that the waiver is found not to be knowing and \n        voluntary. This practice violates the Employee Retirement \n        Income Security Act of 1974.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to clarify applicable \nprovisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to \nensure that employees are not improperly excluded from participation in \nemployee benefit plans as a result of mislabeling or reclassifying \ntheir employment status.\n\nSEC. 3. ADDITIONAL STANDARDS RELATING TO MINIMUM PARTICIPATION \n              REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Required Inclusion of Service.--Section 202(a)(3) of the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1052(a)(3)) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n    ``(E) For purposes of this section, in determining years of service \nand hours of service--\n            ``(i) service shall include all service for the employer as \n        an employee under the common law, irrespective of whether the \n        individual--\n                    ``(I) is paid through a staffing firm, temporary \n                help firm, payroll agency, employment agency, or other \n                such similar arrangement,\n                    ``(II) is paid directly by the employer under an \n                arrangement purporting to characterize an employee \n                under the common law as other than an employee, or\n                    ``(III) is paid from an account not designated as a \n                payroll account, and\n            ``(ii) in any case in which an employer, plan sponsor, or \n        fiduciary (including any administrator, officer, trustee, or \n        custodian) changes the job classification of any person from \n        employee to leased employee, agency employee, staffing firm \n        employee, independent contractor, or any similar category, in \n        determining years of service and hours of service, service \n        shall include all service for the employer that the person \n        performs subsequent to such reclassification.''.\n    (b) Exclusion Precluded When Related to Certain Purported \nCategorizations.--Section 202 of such Act (29 U.S.C. 1052) is amended \nfurther by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a pension plan shall be treated \nas failing to meet the requirements of this section if the plan \nexcludes from participation any person who performs the same work (or \nsubstantially the same work) for the employer as other employees who \ngenerally are not excluded from participation in the plan, irrespective \nof the placement of such person in any category of workers (such as \ntemporary employees, part-time employees, leased employees, agency \nemployees, staffing firm employees, independent contractors, or any \nsimilar category) which may be specified under the plan as ineligible \nfor participation.\n    ``(2) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed to preclude the \nexclusion from participation in a pension plan of individuals who in \nfact do not meet a minimum service period or minimum age which is \nrequired under the terms of the plan and which is otherwise in \nconformity with the requirements of this section.''.\n\nSEC. 4. OBJECTIVE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IN PLAN INSTRUMENTS.\n\n    Section 402 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \n(29 U.S.C. 1102) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubsection:\n    ``(d)(1) The written instrument pursuant to which an employee \nbenefit plan is maintained shall set forth eligibility criteria which--\n            ``(A) include and exclude employees on a uniform basis;\n            ``(B) are based on reasonable job classifications other \n        than the mere labeling of a job position as something other \n        than an employee; and\n            ``(C) are based on objective criteria stated in the \n        instrument itself for the inclusion or exclusion (other than \n        the mere listing of an employee as included or excluded).\n    ``(2) No employee benefit plan may permit an employer or plan \nsponsor to exclude any person from participation irrespective of the \nplacement of such employee in any category of workers (such as \ntemporary employees, leased employees, agency employees, staffing firm \nemployees, contractors, or any similar category), if the employee--\n            ``(A) is an employee of the employer under the common law;\n            ``(B) performs the same work (or substantially the same \n        work) for the employer as other employees who generally are not \n        excluded from participation in the plan; and\n            ``(C) meets a minimum service period or minimum age which \n        is required under the terms of the plan.\n    ``(3) In any case in which the employer of an individual who is a \nparticipant in an employee benefit plan, the plan sponsor of such plan, \nor a fiduciary of such plan requires such individual to convert to the \nstatus of a temporary employee, leased employee, agency employee, \nstaffing firm employee, contractor, or any similar category as a \ncondition of continuing in the service of the employer, such individual \nshall not cease to be treated under such plan or this title as a \nparticipant in such plan by reason of such conversion.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
