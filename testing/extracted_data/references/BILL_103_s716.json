FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n        (1) More than 95 percent of Federal printing involving \n    documents or publications is performed using lithographic inks.\n        (2) Various types of oil, including petroleum and vegetable \n    oil, are used in lithographic ink.\n        (3) Increasing the amount of vegetable oil used in a \n    lithographic ink would--\n            (A) help reduce the Nation's use of nonrenewable energy \n        resources;\n            (B) result in the use of products that are less damaging to \n        the environment;\n            (C) result in a reduction of volatile organic compound \n        emissions; and\n            (D) increase the use of renewable agricultural products.\n        (4) The technology exists to use vegetable oil in lithographic \n    ink and, in some applications, to use lithographic ink that uses no \n    petroleum distillates in the liquid portion of the ink.\n        (5) Some lithographic inks have contained vegetable oils for \n    many years; other lithographic inks have more recently begun to use \n    vegetable oil.\n        (6) According to the Government Printing Office, using \n    vegetable oil-based ink appears to add little if any additional \n    cost to Government printing.\n        (7) Use of vegetable oil-based ink in Federal Government \n    printing should further develop--\n            (A) the commercial viability of vegetable oil-based ink, \n        which could result in demand, for domestic use alone, for \n        2,500,000,000 pounds of vegetable crops or 500,000,000 pounds \n        of vegetable oil; and\n            (B) a product that could help the United States retain or \n        enlarge its share of the world market for vegetable oil-ink.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require that all \nlithographic printing using ink containing oil that is performed or \nprocured by a Federal agency shall use ink containing the maximum \namounts of vegetable oil and materials derived from other renewable \nresources that--\n        (1) are technologically feasible, and\n        (2) result in printing costs that are competitive with printing \n    using petroleum-based inks.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL PRINTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Notwithstanding any other law, and except as \nprovided in subsection (b), a Federal agency may not perform or procure \nlithographic printing that uses ink containing oil if the ink contains \nless than the following percentage of vegetable oil:\n        (1) In the case of news ink, 40 percent.\n        (2) In the case of sheet-fed ink, 20 percent.\n        (3) In the case of forms ink, 20 percent.\n        (4) In the case of heat-set ink, 10 percent.\n    (b) Exceptions.--\n        (1) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to lithographic \n    printing performed or procured by a Federal agency, if--\n            (A) the head of the agency determines, after consultation \n        with the Public Printer and within the 3-year period ending on \n        the date of the commencement of the printing or the date of \n        that procurement, respectively, that vegetable oil-based ink is \n        not suitable to meet specific, identified requirements of the \n        agency related to the printing; or\n            (B) the Public Printer determines--\n                (i) within the 3-month period ending on the date of the \n            commencement of the printing, in the case of printing of \n            materials that are printed at intervals of less than 6 \n            months, or\n                (ii) before the date of the commencement of the \n            printing, in the case of printing of materials that are \n            printed at intervals of 6 months or more;\n        that the cost of performing the printing using vegetable oil-\n        based ink is significantly greater than the cost of performing \n        the printing using other available ink.\n        (2) Notice to congress.--Not later than 30 days after making a \n    determination under paragraph (1)(A), the head of a Federal agency \n    shall report the determination to the Committee on Government \n    Operations and the Committee on House Administration of the House \n    of Representatives, and the Committee on Rules of the Senate.\n    (c) Federal Agency Defined.--In this Act, the term ``Federal \nagency'' means--\n        (1) an executive department, military department, Government \n    corporation, Government-controlled corporation, or other \n    establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including \n    the Executive Office of the President), or any independent \n    regulatory agency; and\n        (2) an establishment or component of the legislative or \n    judicial branch of the Government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
