FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) From 1961 to 1971, approximately 19,000,000 gallons of \n        15 different herbicides were sprayed over the southern region \n        of Vietnam. The agents included 13,000,000 gallons of Agent \n        Orange, 4,500,000 gallons of Agent White, 1,000,000 gallons of \n        Agent Blue, 420,000 gallons of Agent Purple, and relatively \n        smaller quantities of the other herbicides. Many of the \n        herbicides, including Agents Orange, Purple, Green, Pink, \n        Dinoxol, and Trinoxol contained the toxic contaminant dioxin \n        (TCDD). One, Agent Blue, contained high levels of arsenic. The \n        aforementioned 15 herbicides, including the contaminant dioxin, \n        are usually collectively referred to as Agent Orange.\n            (2) Studies show that between 2,100,000 and 4,800,000 \n        Vietnamese and tens of thousands of Americans were exposed to \n        Agent Orange during the spraying. Many other Vietnamese were or \n        continue to be exposed to Agent Orange through contact with the \n        environment and food that was contaminated or as offspring of \n        those exposed who now suffer from illnesses and disabilities.\n            (3) Today, there are still dozens of environmental hot \n        spots that continue to contaminate the food, soil, sediment, \n        livestock, and wildlife with Agent Orange.\n            (4) Agent Orange exposure continues to negatively affect \n        the lives of men and women in Vietnam and in the United States. \n        The lives of many victims, including Vietnamese, United States \n        veterans and their offspring, and Vietnamese-Americans, are cut \n        short and others live with disease, disabilities, and pain, \n        often untreated or unrecognized.\n            (5) The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes certain \n        illnesses and diseases, including AL amyloidosis, chronic B-\n        cell leukemia, chloracne, diabetes mellitus type 2, Hodgkin's \n        disease, ischemic heart disease, multiple myeloma, non-\n        Hodgkin's lymphoma, Parkinson's disease, acute and sub-acute \n        peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate \n        cancer, respiratory cancers, and soft-tissue sarcomas as \n        associated with the spraying and use of Agent Orange by the \n        United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam era.\n            (6) No similar consideration has been given to affected \n        Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans.\n            (7) The Department of Veterans Affairs provides \n        compensation for many severe birth defects among the children \n        of American women veterans who served in Vietnam. The list of \n        birth defects covered includes but is not limited to: \n        achondroplasia, cleft lip, cleft palate, congenital heart \n        disease, congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), esophageal \n        and intestinal atresia, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, hip \n        dysplasia, Hirschsprung's disease (congenital megacolon), \n        hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis, hypospadias, \n        imperforate anus, neural tube defects, Poland syndrome, pyloric \n        stenosis, syndactyly (fused digits), tracheoesophageal fistula, \n        undescended testes, and Williams syndrome. Affected children of \n        these women veterans receive medical care and other benefits.\n            (8) The only birth defect recognized for the children of \n        male American veterans is spina bifida (but not occulta), \n        resulting in most affected children receiving no benefits.\n            (9) No assistance has been given to the children of male or \n        female Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans connected with their \n        exposure, or their parent's or grandparent's exposure.\n            (10) The Institute of Medicine for the past several years \n        has noted that ``it is considerably more plausible than \n        previously believed that exposure to the herbicides sprayed in \n        Vietnam might have caused paternally mediated transgenerational \n        effects . . . attributable to the TCCD contaminant in Agent \n        Orange.'' In recent years, scientific studies have identified \n        likely epigenetic links between exposure to toxins and birth \n        defects and developmental disorders in subsequent generations. \n        Some of the children and grandchildren of exposed persons \n        (Americans, Vietnamese, and Vietnamese-Americans) who were in \n        southern Vietnam during the Vietnam era likely suffer from \n        disorders, birth defects, and illnesses related to Agent \n        Orange.\n            (11) Dating back to 2007, the United States has engaged in \n        environmental remediation of contamination at the Da Nang and \n        Bien Hoa airports, and provided funds for public health and \n        disabilities activities for individuals residing in some \n        affected areas.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to address and \nremediate the ongoing problems and concerns that arose or will arise \nfrom the use of the Agent Orange during the Vietnam era.\n\nSEC. 3.
