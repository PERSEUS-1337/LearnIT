    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Headwaters Forest Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n            (1) Redwoods are a significant national symbol and a \n        defining symbol of the State of California.\n            (2) Old growth redwood trees are a unique and irreplaceable \n        natural resource.\n            (3) Most of the Nation's old growth forests have been cut. \n        Less than 5 percent of the original 2,000,000 acre Coast \n        redwoods remain standing. The groves that are left are crucial \n        to maintain habitat needed for survival of old-growth dependent \n        species. The Headwaters Forest, for example, is home to one of \n        California's three largest population of marbled murrelets, \n        rare sea birds that nest only in coastal old growth trees; the \n        Northern Spotted Owl; and native salmon stocks that spawn in \n        the Forest's creeks.\n            (4) The remaining unprotected stands of old growth forests \n        and old growth redwoods are under immediate threat of being \n        harvested without regard to their ecological importance and \n        without following Federal timber harvest guidelines.\n            (5) Significant amounts of old growth redwoods in the \n        proposed National Forest additions are being cut at a pace that \n        is based on paying high interest rates on poor quality bonds \n        and not at a pace that is based on sound forest management \n        practices.\n            (6) The continued fragmentation and loss of irreplaceable \n        ecosystems creates an urgent need to develop creative solutions \n        to achieve the long-term benefits of permanent protection and \n        preservation.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the sound \nmanagement and protection of old growth Redwood forest areas in \nHumboldt County, California, and to preserve and enhance habitat for \nthe marbled murrelet, Northern Spotted owl, native salmon stocks, and \nother old growth forest dependent species, by adding certain lands and \nwaters to the Six Rivers National Forest and by including a portion of \nsuch lands in the national wilderness preservation system.\n    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The terms ``Six Rivers National Forest Addition'' and \n        ``Headwaters Forest'' mean the area authorized for land \n        acquisition activities under section 3, as depicted on the map \n        described in section 3(b)(1).\n            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture.\n\nSEC. 3. ADDITION TO SIX RIVERS NATIONAL FOREST.\n\n    (a) Modification of Boundaries.--Effective upon the consummation of \na land acquisition conducted as provided in subsection (b), the \nSecretary of Agriculture shall modify the exterior boundaries of the \nSix Rivers National Forest in the State of California to include the \nacquired lands.\n    (b) Acquisition of Land.--\n            (1) Area for acquisition activities.--The Secretary may \n        acquire lands and interests in land within the boundaries of an \n        area comprising approximately 44,000 acres, as generally \n        depicted on the map entitled ``Six Rivers National Forest \n        Addition proposed'' and dated June 1993, for inclusion in the \n        Six Rivers National Forest under subsection (a). The map shall \n        be on file and available for public inspection in the offices \n        of the Forest Supervisor, Six Rivers National Forest, and in \n        the offices of the Chief of the Forest Service, Department of \n        Agriculture.\n            (2) Manner of conducting acquisition.--Lands and interests \n        in lands within the Six Rivers National Forest Addition may be \n        acquired by the Secretary only by donation, by purchase with \n        donated or appropriated funds, or by exchange.\n            (3) Special rule for federal transfers.--For purposes of \n        making an exchange under paragraph (2), excess or surplus lands \n        under the jurisdiction of any other department, agency, or \n        instrumentality of the United States may be transferred, \n        subject to the advance approval of the transfer by law, to the \n        administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary if the Secretary \n        identifies the lands as suitable for use in making an exchange. \n        To facilitate the approval of a transfer of lands under this \n        paragraph, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on \n        Agriculture and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House \n        of Representatives and to the Committee on Agriculture, \n        Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate proposed legislation in \n        connection with the proposed transfer. The transfer of lands \n        under this paragraph shall be made without compensation to the \n        transferring department, agency, or instrumentality.\n            (4) Acquisition of certain lands outside addition.--When a \n        tract of land proposed to be acquired is only partly within the \n        Six Rivers National Forest Addition, the Secretary may acquire \n        all or any portion of the land outside of the Six Rivers \n        National Forest Addition to minimize the payment of severance \n        costs. Land acquired outside of the boundaries may be exchanged \n        by the Secretary for non-Federal lands within the boundaries. \n        Land acquired outside of the boundaries of the Six Rivers \n        National Forest Addition under this paragraph and not used for \n        exchange shall be reported to the Administrator of the General \n        Services Administration for disposal under the Federal Property \n        and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 471 et \n        seq.).\n            (5) Special rule for state or local government lands.--\n        Lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the Six \n        Rivers National Forest Addition that are owned by the State of \n        California or any political subdivision thereof, may be \n        acquired only by donation or exchange.\n            (6) Acceptance and use of funds.--The Secretary may accept \n        from the State of California funds to cover the cost of \n        acquiring lands within the Six Rivers National Forest Addition. \n        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may \n        retain and expend such funds for purposes of such acquisition. \n        Such funds shall be available for such purpose without further \n        appropriation and without fiscal year limitation.\n    (c) Land Acquisition Plan.--The Secretary shall develop and \nimplement, within 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, \na land acquisition plan that contains specific provisions addressing \nhow and when lands will be acquired under subsection (b). The plan \nshall give priority first to the acquisition of lands within the Six \nRivers National Forest Addition proposed for inclusion in the National \nWilderness Preservation System. The plan shall include an analysis of \nthe possibilities for acquisition through means other than the \nexpenditure of funds, including the use of excess and surplus Federal \nproperties. The Secretary shall identify and list these properties. The \nSecretary shall submit copies of the plan to the Committee on Natural \nResources, the Committee on Agriculture, and the Committee on \nAppropriations of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations; Limitation.--There are \nauthorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry \nout this Act; except that the total amount obligated or expended to \nacquire lands or interests in lands in the Six Rivers Forest Addition \nshall not exceed $200,000,000.\n    (e) Termination of Acquisition Authority.--Notwithstanding any \nother provision of this section, the Secretary may not acquire lands \nunder the authority of this section after the end of the 10-year period \nbeginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (f) Consent of Owner Required for Acquisition.--Lands and interests \nin lands within the Six Rivers National Forest Addition may not be \nacquired by the Secretary for purposes of this Act without the consent \nof the owner of the lands. The Secretary may not acquire lands or \ninterests in lands within the Six Rivers National Forest Addition by \ncondemnation.\n\nSEC. 4. WILDERNESS AREAS.\n\n    (a) Designation.--In furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness \nAct (16 U.S.C. 1131-1136), lands in the State of California acquired \nunder section 3 of this Act which are within the areas generally \ndepicted on the map referred to in section 3 as the ``Headwaters Forest \nWilderness (Proposed)'' shall be designated as wilderness and therefore \nas a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, \neffective upon acquisition under section 3. Such lands shall be known \nas the Headwaters Forest Wilderness.\n    (b) Map and Description.--As soon as practicable after the \ninclusion of any lands in the Headwaters Forest Wilderness, the \nSecretary shall file a map and a legal description of the area so \nincluded with the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of \nRepresentatives and with the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nof the Senate. The Secretary may correct clerical and typographical \nerrors in such legal description and such map. Each such map and legal \ndescription shall be on file and available for public inspection in the \noffices of the Forest Supervisor, Six Rivers National Forest, and in \nthe offices of the Chief of the Forest Service, Department of \nAgriculture.\n    (c) Buffer Zones Not Intended.--The Congress does not intend that \ndesignation of any area as wilderness under this section lead to the \ncreation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around the wilderness \narea. The fact that nonwilderness activities or uses can be seen or \nheard from areas within a wilderness shall not, of itself, preclude \nsuch activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness area.\n    (d) State Authority Over Fish and Wildlife.--As provided in section \n4(d)(8) of the Wilderness Act, nothing in this Act shall be construed \nas affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of the State of \nCalifornia with respect to wildlife and fish in any areas designated by \nthis Act as wilderness.\n\nSEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    (a) Management Plan.--Within 1 year after acquiring all or part of \nthe lands identified to be acquired in section 3, the Secretary shall \ndevelop a comprehensive management plan for the acquired lands \ndetailing measures for the preservation of the existing old growth \nredwood ecosystems. The management plan shall include each of the \nfollowing with respect to the lands so acquired:\n            (1) Prohibition of the sale of timber from lands within the \n        old growth redwood groves as depicted generally on the map \n        referred to in section 3(b)(1). Timber sales in other areas \n        within the Six Rivers National Forest Addition shall be allowed \n        consistent with the purposes of this Act and other applicable \n        Federal laws and regulations.\n            (2) Measures to restore lands affected by previous timber \n        harvests to mitigate watershed degradation and impairment of \n        habitat for the marbled murrelet, northern spotted owl, native \n        salmon stocks, and other old-growth forest dependent species.\nThe management plan shall be reviewed and revised each time the land \nand resource management plan for the Six Rivers National Forest is \nrevised or more frequently as necessary to meet the purposes of this \nAct.\n    (b) Applicable Laws and Policies.--(1) The Secretary, acting \nthrough the Chief of the Forest Service, shall administer the lands \nacquired under section 3(b) in accordance with the Management Plan, \nthis Act, and with the other laws, rules, and regulations applicable to \nsuch national forest. In addition, subject to valid existing rights, \nany lands acquired and designated as wilderness under section 4(a) \nshall also be administered in accordance with the provisions of the \nWilderness Act governing areas designated by that Act as wilderness, \nexcept that any reference in such provisions to the effective date of \nthe Wilderness Act (or any similar reference) shall be deemed to be a \nreference to the date of acquisition of such lands under section 3 of \nthis Act.\n    (2) To the maximum extent practicable, all work to implement the \nmanagement plan's Restoration Measures shall be performed by unemployed \nforest and timber workers, unemployed commercial fishermen, or other \nunemployed persons whose livelihood depends on fishery and timber \nresources.\n    (3) In order to facilitate management, the Secretary, acting \nthrough the Chief of the Forest Service may enter into agreements with \nthe State of California for the management of lands owned by the State \nor purchased with State assistance.\n\nSEC. 6.
