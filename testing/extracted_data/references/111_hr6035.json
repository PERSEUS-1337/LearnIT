    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Oil Displacement Act of \n2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the strategic interests of the United States would be \n        served by a reduction in the Nation's dependence upon imported \n        oil to produce transportation fuels and other products vital to \n        both the domestic economy and national security;\n            (2) this goal would be served by the development of a \n        viable, commercially competitive synthetic fuels industry \n        reliant upon domestic coals and other plentiful, nontraditional \n        carbonaceous feedstocks; and\n            (3) temporary financial incentives are required to foster \n        private investment in the technology, design, construction, and \n        operation of strategic facilities capable of producing \n        synthetic fuels or synthetic gas on a commercial scale.\n\nSEC. 3.
