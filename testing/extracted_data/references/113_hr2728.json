SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Protecting States' Rights to \nPromote American Energy Security Act''.\n\nSEC. 102. STATE AUTHORITY FOR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING REGULATION.\n\n    The Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) is amended by \nredesignating section 44 as section 45, and by inserting after section \n43 the following:\n\n``SEC. 44. STATE AUTHORITY FOR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING REGULATION.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Department of the Interior shall not enforce \nany Federal regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding \nhydraulic fracturing, or any component of that process, relating to \noil, gas, or geothermal production activities on or under any land in \nany State that has regulations, guidance, or permit requirements for \nthat activity.\n    ``(b) State Authority.--The Department of the Interior shall \nrecognize and defer to State regulations, permitting, and guidance, for \nall activities related to hydraulic fracturing, or any component of \nthat process, relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities \non Federal land.\n    ``(c) Transparency of State Regulations.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Each State shall submit to the Bureau of \n        Land Management a copy of its regulations that apply to \n        hydraulic fracturing operations on Federal land.\n            ``(2) Availability.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n        make available to the public State regulations submitted under \n        this subsection.\n    ``(d) Transparency of State Disclosure Requirements.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Each State shall submit to the Bureau of \n        Land Management a copy of any regulations of the State that \n        require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing \n        operations on Federal land.\n            ``(2) Availability.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n        make available to the public State regulations submitted under \n        this subsection.\n    ``(e) Hydraulic Fracturing Defined.--In this section the term \n`hydraulic fracturing' means the process by which fracturing fluids (or \na fracturing fluid system) are pumped into an underground geologic \nformation at a calculated, predetermined rate and pressure to generate \nfractures or cracks in the target formation and thereby increase the \npermeability of the rock near the wellbore and improve production of \nnatural gas or oil.''.\n\nSEC. 103. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STUDY.\n\n    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall \nconduct a study examining the economic benefits of domestic shale oil \nand gas production resulting from the process of hydraulic fracturing. \nThis study will include identification of--\n            (1) State and Federal revenue generated as a result of \n        shale gas production;\n            (2) jobs created both directly and indirectly as a result \n        of shale oil and gas production; and\n            (3) an estimate of potential energy prices without domestic \n        shale oil and gas production.\n    (b) Report.--The Comptroller General shall submit a report on the \nfindings of such study to the Committee on Natural Resources of the \nHouse of Representatives within 30 days after completion of the study.\n\nSEC. 104.
