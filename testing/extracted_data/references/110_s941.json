    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Health Centers Investment \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An estimated 35,000,000 Americans have no regular \n        source of health care, and lack access to the most basic health \n        services.\n            (2) Access to health care is especially difficult for those \n        Americans who live in medically underserved rural communities \n        or inner city neighborhoods, who lack public or private health \n        insurance coverage and the ability to pay directly for care, or \n        who are members of other vulnerable groups, including \n        individuals who are homeless or are migrant farm workers.\n            (3) The consequences of poor access to health care is \n        evidenced in elevated infant and childhood mortality rates, \n        dangerously low childhood immunization rates, overutilization \n        of hospital emergency rooms or other inappropriate providers of \n        primary care services, and hospitalization rates for \n        preventable conditions that are significantly higher than the \n        national average.\n            (4) Community health centers, which serve more than \n        16,000,000 needy Americans in more than 5,000 communities \n        across the country, provide an effective and proven model for \n        extending access to all medically underserved Americans.\n            (5) Numerous independent studies confirm that these health \n        centers have compiled a remarkable record of achievement in \n        providing care of superior quality, with exceptional cost-\n        effectiveness and efficiency, saving billions of dollars for \n        both taxpayers and private payers.\n            (6) Over the past 5 years, with strong bipartisan support \n        from the Congress and encouragement by the Executive Branch, \n        nearly 900 underserved communities were funded to establish or \n        expand a health center, offering care to almost 5,000,000 more \n        needy individuals. Yet during that same period, another 800 \n        communities were approved for a health center but were not \n        funded, because not enough funding was available for them, and \n        there are thousands more underserved communities across America \n        that need a health center but do not have one today.\n            (7) Furthermore, the existing, currently funded health \n        centers have experienced reduced Federal grant support over the \n        past 2 years, jeopardizing their ability to be sustained and \n        meet the needs of the growing number of uninsured in their \n        service areas. Growing new health centers without supporting \n        existing ones is a failed policy that will ultimately weaken \n        this valuable resource for the most disadvantaged Americans.\n            (8) Critical to the growth of new and existing health \n        centers is having a sufficient supply of primary care health \n        professionals to staff them. Currently, health centers rely on \n        the National Health Service Corps for over 20 percent of their \n        physician workforce. Yet, fewer than half of all Corps \n        placements are made to health centers, even though they are one \n        of the strongest cords in the health care safety net.\n            (9) According to published research, health centers in the \n        last year experienced a 15 percent physician vacancy rate and a \n        19 percent dentist vacancy rate nationally. In rural areas, \n        vacancy rates were higher, 19 percent for physicians and 27 \n        percent for dentists.\n            (10) Adequate reimbursement for the services that health \n        centers provide is another pressing need if health centers are \n        to fulfill their mission. While health centers provide care to \n        more than 1,000,000 medically underserved Medicare \n        beneficiaries, their Medicare payments are subject to an \n        arbitrary payment cap that is now 15 years old and adversely \n        affects more than three-quarters of all health centers, causing \n        annual revenue losses in excess of $50,000,000 nationally.\n\nSEC. 3.
