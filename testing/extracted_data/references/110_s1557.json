    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 28,000,000 children in the United States have \n        parents who work outside the home and 14,300,000 children in \n        the United States are unsupervised after the school day ends.\n            (2) 6,500,000 children are in after school programs but an \n        additional 15,300,000 would participate if such a program were \n        available.\n            (3) After school programs inspire learning. In academic \n        year 2003-2004, 45 percent of all 21st Century Community \n        Learning Centers program participants had improved their \n        reading grades, and 41 percent improved their mathematics \n        grades.\n            (4) In academic year 2003-2004 teachers reported that a \n        majority of students who participated in 21st Century Community \n        Learning Centers programs demonstrated improved student \n        behavior, particularly in the areas of academic performance, \n        homework completion, and class participation.\n            (5) A growing body of research also suggests that children \n        who participate in after school programs attend school more \n        regularly, are more likely to stay in school, and are better \n        prepared for college and careers.\n            (6) Benefits of after school programs extend beyond the \n        classroom. Communities with after school programs have reported \n        reduced vandalism and juvenile crime.\n            (7) After school programs help working families. One study \n        estimates that decreased worker productivity due to stress and \n        absenteeism caused by issues related to after school care \n        arrangements costs employers $496 to $1,984 per employee, per \n        year, depending on the annual salary of the employee. The total \n        cost to the business industry is estimated to be between \n        $50,000,000,000 and $300,000,000,000 annually in lost job \n        productivity.\n            (8) While students in the United States are falling behind \n        in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), \n        more than 90 percent of after school programs funded by 21st \n        Century Community Learning Centers offer STEM activities, \n        providing more time for children and youth to gain skills and \n        build interest in the STEM fields. Evaluations of after school \n        programs offering STEM activities to students have found \n        increases in the reading, writing, and science skills \n        proficiency of these students. Children who participate in such \n        programs show more interest in science careers, and are more \n        likely to have engaged in science activities just for fun.\n            (9) Data from 73 after school studies indicate that after \n        school programs employing evidence-based approaches to \n        improving students' personal and social skills were \n        consistently successful in producing multiple benefits for \n        students, including improvements in students' personal, social, \n        and academic skills, as well as students' self-esteem.\n            (10) Teens who do not participate in after school programs \n        are nearly 3 times more likely to skip classes than teens who \n        do participate. The teens who do not participate are also 3 \n        times more likely to use marijuana or other drugs, and are more \n        likely to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and engage in sexual \n        activity. In general, self care and boredom can increase the \n        likelihood that a young person will experiment with drugs and \n        alcohol by as much as 50 percent.\n            (11) A 2006 study predicts that by the year 2010 more than \n        46 percent of school-age children in the Americas will be \n        overweight and 1 in 7 such children will be obese. A study of \n        after school program participants in 3 elementary schools found \n        that after school participants were significantly less likely \n        to be obese at the 3-year follow-up physical exam and were more \n        likely to have increased acceptance among their peers. After \n        school programs provide children and youth with opportunities \n        to engage in sports and other fitness activities.\n            (12) After school programs have been identified as \n        effective venues for improving nutrition, nutrition education, \n        and physical activity at a time when just 20 percent of youth \n        in grades 9 through 12 consume the recommended daily servings \n        of fruits and vegetables.\n            (13) After school programs also provide children and youth \n        with opportunities for service learning, a teaching and \n        learning approach that integrates student-designed service \n        projects that address community needs with academic studies. \n        With structured time to reflect on their service experience, \n        these projects can strengthen student engagement, enhance \n        students' academic achievement, lower school drop out and \n        suspension rates, and help develop important workforce skills \n        that employers are looking for, including leadership skills, \n        critical thinking, teamwork, and oral and written \n        communication.\n\nSEC. 3.
