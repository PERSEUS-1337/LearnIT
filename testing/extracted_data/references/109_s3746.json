    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Ag Science Center Act of \n2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the State of California (referred to in this Act as the \n        ``State'') is a preeminent producer of more than 350 different \n        agricultural commodities, including--\n                    (A) more than 90 percent of all of the tomatoes and \n                grapes produced in the United States;\n                    (B) all of the commercial almonds, dates, figs, \n                olives, cling peaches, prunes, and raisins produced in \n                the United States; and\n                    (C) 1 out of every 5 glasses of milk consumed in \n                the United States;\n            (2) California is the leading State in terms of \n        agricultural exports, annually shipping more than \n        $7,000,000,000 worth of agricultural commodities around the \n        world;\n            (3) the direct and indirect economic impact of the total \n        investment by the 78,500 farms in the State is staggering;\n            (4) if the State is going to keep the agricultural industry \n        of the State strong and vibrant, the State must focus on the \n        needs of agricultural producers who are valuable contributors \n        to the economic, social, and cultural life of the State and the \n        United States.\n            (5) since 1945, agricultural land has been rapidly \n        disappearing across the State, with soil erosion, urbanization, \n        the growth of deserts, and salinization all contributing to the \n        loss of productive farmland in the State;\n            (6) if the trends described in paragraph (5) continue, the \n        State will be unable--\n                    (A) to supply food for the population of the State, \n                let alone the United States; or\n                    (B) to export food to the rest of the world;\n            (7) as people in the United States grow more and more \n        detached from the great agrarian history of the United States, \n        fewer people in the United States understand the fundamental \n        importance of agriculture to the society of the United States;\n            (8) educating young people in the United States about \n        agriculture and the importance of agriculture to the United \n        States is an investment that would pay off in future benefits;\n            (9) greater public understanding and appreciation of the \n        importance of agriculture to the State, the United States, and \n        the world is needed to secure a positive future in which the \n        United States can rely on healthy food that is produced \n        domestically;\n            (10) citizens of all ages, especially youth, must play a \n        meaningful, hands-on role in determining the future of \n        agriculture in the State;\n            (11) as planners, conservationists, and other interested \n        persons throughout the State organize to help protect \n        agricultural resources, the proposed National Ag Science Center \n        (referred to in this Act as the ``Center'') in Stanislaus \n        County, California, is preparing--\n                    (A) to educate and alert future generations about \n                the need to preserve agricultural land; and\n                    (B) to foster an understanding of the importance of \n                agriculture;\n            (12) the mission of the National Ag Science Center would be \n        to--\n                    (A) provide exciting and fun agricultural learning \n                opportunities and resources in order for young people \n                to learn how a vibrant agricultural economy is \n                necessary for a vibrant society; and\n                    (B) ensure a bright future for all aspects of the \n                agriculture industry;\n            (13) the Center would prepare young people in the United \n        States for career and leadership opportunities in agriculture;\n            (14) according to findings of the Center for Public Policy \n        Studies at California State University, Stanislaus, the Center \n        would--\n                    (A) create or support up to 359 new local jobs;\n                    (B) create or support up to $57,500,000 in economic \n                activity and $15,200,000 in labor income through \n                construction of the new facility;\n                    (C) generate as much as $8,500,000 in total annual \n                economic activity; and\n                    (D) result in as much as $3,400,000 in total annual \n                labor income;\n            (15) on September 14, 2005, the Yosemite Community College \n        District Board, in Stanislaus County, California, voted \n        unanimously to approve the dedication of a 3.5-acre site on the \n        West Campus of Modesto Community College for the Center; and\n            (16) establishment of the Center is in the national \n        interest, because the proposed Center would enable future \n        generations to help ensure a healthy and profitable place for \n        agriculture in the economy of the State and the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
