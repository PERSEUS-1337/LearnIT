AUTOMATION OF MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE CONTRACTING.\n\n    (a) Development and Implementation of System.--In order to provide \nfor the economic and efficient procurement of automatic data processing \nequipment and other commercial items the Administrator of General \nServices shall establish a program for the development and \nimplementation of a system to provide Governmentwide, on-line computer \naccess to information on products and services that are available for \nordering through multiple award schedules.\n    (b) Required Capabilities.--The system required by subsection (a) \nshall be established as an element of the Federal acquisition computer \nnetwork (FACNET) architecture and shall, at a minimum--\n            (1) provide basic information on the prices, features, and \n        performance of all products and services available for ordering \n        through the multiple award schedules;\n            (2) provide for updating that information to reflect \n        changes in prices, features, and performance as soon as \n        information on the changes becomes available;\n            (3) enable users to make on-line computer comparisons of \n        the prices, features, and performance of similar products and \n        services offered by various vendors;\n            (4) enable users to place, and vendors to receive, on-line \n        computer orders for products and services available for \n        ordering through the multiple award schedules (up to the \n        maximum order limitation of the applicable schedule contract);\n            (5) enable ordering agencies to make payments to \n        contractors by bank card, electronic funds transfer, or other \n        automated methods in cases in which it is practicable and in \n        the interest of the Federal Government to do so; and\n            (6) archive data relating to each order placed against \n        multiple award schedule contracts using such system, including, \n        at a minimum, data on--\n                    (A) the agency or office placing the order;\n                    (B) the vendor receiving the order;\n                    (C) the products or services ordered; and\n                    (D) the total price of the order.\n    (c) Implementation.--\n            (1) Deadline for implementation.--The system required by \n        subsection (a) shall be implemented not later than January 1, \n        1998.
