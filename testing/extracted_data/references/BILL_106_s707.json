FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is no Federal program to support family \n        caregivers;\n            (2) most older individuals and persons with mental \n        retardation and related developmental disabilities (as defined \n        in section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and \n        Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6000) (referred to in this \n        section as ``developmental disabilities'')) prefer to receive \n        care in their homes, rather than in institutions;\n            (3)(A) more than 22,000,000 family caregivers actively care \n        for aging or ailing older individuals in the United States;\n            (B) fewer than 2,000,000 older individuals receive care \n        through nursing homes in the United States; and\n            (C) therefore, a large portion of the care provided for the \n        Nation's older individuals is provided by family caregivers;\n            (4)(A) there are an estimated 3,170,000 persons with mental \n        retardation and related developmental disabilities in the \n        United States;\n            (B) 1,890,000 of individuals with mental retardation and \n        related developmental disabilities live with family caregivers;\n            (C) 479,862 of individuals with mental retardation and \n        related developmental disabilities who are living at home \n        receive care from caregivers who are 60 years old or older; and\n            (D) like services for the elderly population, a large \n        portion of supports and care for persons with mental \n        retardation and related developmental disabilities is provided \n        by family caregivers;\n            (5) nearly 75 percent of family caregivers are women, many \n        of whom have other major responsibilities, such as young \n        children or jobs;\n            (6) the loss in productivity of businesses due to necessary \n        absences of caregiving employees ranges from $11,000,000,000 to \n        $29,000,000,000 a year;\n            (7) family caregivers offer support that is worth billions \n        of dollars;\n            (8) without the efforts of family caregivers, many \n        additional older individuals, and persons with mental \n        retardation and related developmental disabilities, would \n        receive care services in a hospital, State facility, \n        intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, or \n        nursing home, or would receive, although less costly, home and \n        community-based waiver services under section 1915(c) of the \n        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396n(c)), such a result being \n        far more expensive for taxpayers than assisting family \n        caregivers since--\n                    (A) the Federal medicare and medicaid programs pay \n                for a large portion of expenses associated with such \n                institutional care; and\n                    (B) such institutional care is more expensive than \n                family caregiving;\n            (9) caregivers, on average, spend $2,000 per year for food, \n        medication, and other expenses related to caregiving;\n            (10)(A) caregiving is physically demanding and emotionally \n        draining to provide, with as many as 30 percent of caregivers \n        reporting physical or mental health problems due to caregiving; \n        and\n            (B) caregivers need resources that will support and help \n        ease the overwhelming burden that the caregivers are expected \n        to shoulder on a daily basis; and\n            (11) with millions of baby boomers set to retire in the \n        near future, it is crucial to begin preparing today for what \n        will be dramatically increased long-term care needs of older \n        individuals.\n\nSEC. 2.
