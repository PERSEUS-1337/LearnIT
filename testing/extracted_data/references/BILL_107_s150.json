FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internet has been the single greatest contributor \n        to the unprecedented economic expansion experienced by the \n        United States over the last 8 years.\n            (2) Increasing the speed that Americans can access the \n        Internet is necessary to ensure the continued expansion.\n            (3) Today, most residential Internet users, especially \n        those located in low income areas, are extremely limited in the \n        type of information they can send and receive over the Internet \n        because their means of access is limited to ``narrowband'' \n        communications media, typically conventional phone lines at a \n        maximum speed of 56,000 bits per second.\n            (4) Similarly, small businesses in low income areas are \n        also deprived of full information access because of their \n        dependence on narrowband facilities.\n            (5) By contrast, many residential users located in higher \n        income urban and suburban areas and urban business users can \n        access the Internet from a variety of carriers at speeds in \n        excess of 1,500,000 bits per second, giving them a choice among \n        carriers and high-speed access to a wide array of audio and \n        data applications.\n            (6) The result is a growing disparity in the speed of \n        access to the Internet and the opportunities it creates between \n        subscribers located in low income areas and subscribers located \n        in higher income urban and suburban areas.\n            (7) The disparity in current broadband access to the \n        Internet is proving detrimental to the on-going economic \n        expansion.\n            (8) It is, therefore, appropriate for Congress to take \n        action to narrow the current disparity in the level of \n        broadband access to the Internet.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to accelerate deployment \nof broadband access to the Internet for users located in certain low \nincome areas.\n\nSEC. 3.

   potential subscriber populations within the underserved areas \n        which the equipment is capable of serving, and\n            ``(2) the denominator of which is the total potential \n
