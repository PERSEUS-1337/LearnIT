FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Rare diseases and disorders are those which affect \n        small patient populations, defined as fewer than 200,000 \n        individuals in the United States. Taken together, 25,000,000 \n        Americans suffer from one of the 6,000 rare diseases and \n        disorders.\n            (2) Because prescription drug manufacturers could not make \n        a profit from marketing drugs for such small patient \n        populations, very little ``rare disease'' research was \n        conducted prior to 1983. Only 10 orphan drugs existed at that \n        time.\n            (3) The Orphan Drug Act, signed into law in 1983, created \n        financial incentives for the research, development, production \n        and distribution of such orphan drugs.\n            (4) Since 1983, more than 240 new orphan drugs have been \n        developed, approved, and marketed in the United States and more \n        than 800 additional drugs are in the research pipeline.\n            (5) The tremendous success of the Orphan Drug Act cannot be \n        taken for granted because--\n                    (A) patient access to the more expensive orphan \n                drugs is a continuing problem; and\n                    (B) there is a need to stimulate more research for \n                the millions of Americans and thousands of rare \n                diseases for which there are not yet effective \n                therapies.\n            (6) When Congress adopted the medicare hospital outpatient \n        prospective payment system (HOPPS) in 1999, it defined orphan \n        drugs based on the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&C) Act \n        and placed such orphan drugs in a category that provided \n        sufficient reimbursement to assure continuing access for rare \n        disease patients.\n            (7) Despite expressions of concern from Congress, the HOPPS \n        regulation for 2003 does not continue this policy and, instead, \n        uses a definition of orphan drugs that is not supported by the \n        history of the Orphan Drug Act and forces most orphan drugs \n        into categories in which they are reimbursed at levels \n        significantly below hospital acquisition costs.\n            (8) Unless medicare provides adequate reimbursement for \n        orphan drugs, hospitals are much less likely to have them \n        available for beneficiaries with rare diseases, such as \n        cervical dystonia, alpha-1 antitripsin deficiency, rare \n        cancers, porphyria, sickle cell anemia, Tourette syndrome, \n        cystic fibrosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou \n        Gehrig's disease).\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assure that medicare \nbeneficiaries with rare diseases have continued access to orphan drugs \nin the hospital outpatient setting and that the FFD&C Act definition of \nrare diseases is used by the medicare program.\n\nSEC. 3. PAYMENT FOR ORPHAN DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS UNDER THE PROSPECTIVE \n              PAYMENT SYSTEM FOR HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT \n              SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Payment for Orphan Drugs and Biologicals.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1833(t)(1)(B) of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(t)(1)(B)) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking the period at the end of clause \n                (iv) and inserting a semi-colon;
