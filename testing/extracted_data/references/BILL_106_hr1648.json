FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to a 1996 study conducted by the American \n        School & University, $10.42 billion was spent to address the \n        Nation's education infrastructure needs in 1995, with the \n        average total cost of a new high school at $15.4 million.\n            (2) According to a 1995 report to Congress by the General \n        Accounting Office, an estimated $112 billion in school repair, \n        modernization, expansion, and construction is needed.\n            (3) Approximately 14 million American students attend \n        schools which report the need for extensive repair or \n        replacement of one or more buildings.\n            (4) Academic research has proven a direct correlation \n        between the condition of school facilities and student \n        achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers found that \n        students assigned to schools in poor conditions can be expected \n        to fall 10.9 percentage points behind those in buildings in \n        excellent condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a \n        20 percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n        from a poor facility to a new facility.\n            (5) The Director of Education and Employment Issues at the \n        Government Accounting Office testified that nearly 52 percent \n        of schools, affecting 21.3 million students, reported \n        insufficient technology elements for 6 or more areas.\n            (6) Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n        difficulties securing financing for school facility \n        improvement.\n            (7) The challenges facing our Nation's public elementary \n        and secondary schools and libraries require the concerted \n        efforts of all levels of government and all sectors of the \n        community.\n            (8) The United States's competitive position within the \n        world economy is vulnerable if America's future workforce \n        continues to be educated in schools and libraries not equipped \n        for the 21st century.\n            (9) The deplorable state of collections in America's public \n        school libraries has increased the demands on public libraries. \n        In many instances, public libraries substitute for school \n        libraries creating a higher demand for material and physical \n        space to house literature and educational computer equipment.\n            (10) Research shows that 50 percent of a child's \n        intellectual development takes place before age 4. Our nation's \n        public and school libraries play a critical role in a child's \n        early development because they provide a wealth of books and \n        other resources that can give every child a head start on life \n        and learning.\n\nSEC. 3. STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) Cooperative agreements.--Subject to the provisions of \n        this section, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n        with the Secretary of Education, may enter into cooperative \n        agreements with States for the establishment of State \n        infrastructure banks and multistate infrastructure banks for \n        making loans to local educational agencies for building or \n        repairing elementary or secondary schools which provide free \n        public education (as such terms are defined in section 14101 of \n        the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        8801)) and to public libraries for building or repairing \n        library facilities.\n            (2) Interstate compacts.--Congress grants consent to 2 or \n        more of the States, entering into a cooperative agreement under \n        paragraph (1) with the Secretary of the Treasury for the \n        establishment of a multistate infrastructure bank, to enter \n        into an interstate compact establishing such bank in accordance \n        with this section.\n    (b) Funding.--The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Education, shall make grants to State infrastructure \nbanks and multistate infrastructure banks in a State in a cooperative \nagreement under subsection (a)(1) to provide initial capital for loans \nprovided under this section to local educational agencies and public \nlibraries. Each bank shall apply repayments of principal and interest \non loans to the making of additional loans. The Secretary shall take \nfinal action on an application for a grant under this subsection within \n90 days of the date of the submittal of such application.\n    (c) Infrastructure Bank Requirements.--In order to establish an \ninfrastructure bank under this section, each State establishing the \nbank shall--\n            (1) contribute, at a minimum, in each account of the bank \n        from non-Federal sources an amount equal to 25 percent of the \n        amount of each capitalization grant made to the State and \n        contributed to the bank under subsection (b);\n            (2) identify an operating entity of the State as recipient \n        of the grant if the entity has the capacity to manage loan \n        funds and issue debt instruments of the State for purposes of \n        leveraging the funds;\n            (3) allow such funds to be used as reserve for debt issued \n        by the State so long as proceeds are deposited in the fund for \n        loan purposes;\n            (4) ensure that investment income generated by funds \n        contributed to an account of the bank will be--\n                    (A) credited to the account;\n                    (B) available for use in providing loans to \n                projects eligible for assistance from the account;

and\n            (8) require the bank to make an annual report to the \n        Secretary on its status and make such other reports as the \n        Secretary may require by guidelines.\n    (d) Forms of Assistance From Infrastructure Banks.--\n            (1) In general.--An infrastructure bank established under \n        this section may make loans to a local educational agency or a \n        public library in an amount equal to all or part of the cost of \n        carrying out a project eligible for assistance under this \n        section.\n            (2) Applications for loans.--An application to an \n        infrastructure bank by a local educational agency or a public \n        library for a loan shall include--\n                    (A) in the case of a renovation project, a \n                description of each architectural, civil, structural, \n                mechanical, or electrical deficiency to be corrected \n                with funds under a loan and the priorities to be \n                applied;\n                    (B) a description of the criteria used by the \n                applicant to determine the type of corrective action \n                necessary for the renovation of a facility;\n                    (C) a description of improvements to be made and a \n                cost estimate for the improvements;\n                    (D) a description of how work undertaken with the \n                loan will promote energy conservation;
