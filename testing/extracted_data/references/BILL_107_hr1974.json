FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) undue reliance upon the purchase of power from the spot \n        market has resulted in a dysfunctional energy market reflected \n        in high spot market prices;\n            (2) the State of California should encourage further use of \n        long-term and bilateral contracts and reduce reliance on the \n        spot market; and\n            (3) it is not in the interest of the residents of the State \n        of California for the State to create and operate a statewide \n        power authority.\n\nSEC. 3.

MARKET MONITORING AND MITIGATION PLAN.\n\n    (a) Expansion to WSCC Region.--The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission shall issue such orders as may be necessary to apply to all \npublic utility sales of electric energy in interstate commerce in the \nwestern energy market the market monitoring and mitigation plan for the \nCalifornia market (as adopted by order issued on April 26, 2001 (95 \nFERC 61,115)), that is based not on inflexible price caps, but on the \nuse of competitive bids to replicate competitive pricing.\n    (b) Scope of Plan.--\n            (1) In general.--The orders issued as provided in \n        subsection (a) shall also modify the market monitoring and \n        mitigation plan to remove the limitations in such plan \n        regarding emergencies in California when reserves are 7.5 \n        percent or less so that such plan will apply to all sales by \n        public utilities in interstate commerce in the spot market at \n        all times, including sales by re-marketers.\n            (2) Certain states excluded.--The market mitigation plan \n        referred to in this section shall not apply to sales of \n        electric energy at wholesale for delivery in a State that, \n        after the enactment of this Act--\n                    (A) prohibits the State public utility commission \n                from approving the passing through to retail consumers \n                of the costs of electric power; or\n                    (B) imposes a price limit on the sale of electric \n                energy at retail that precludes a public utility (or \n                any entity that is authorized to purchase electricity \n                on behalf of a public utility or a State) from making a \n                payment when due to any entity within the western \n                energy market from which the public utility purchases \n                electric energy for resale at retail within the western \n                energy market.\n    (c) Department of Energy Authority.--The Secretary of Energy shall \nhave the authority to terminate the market mitigation plan referred to \nin this section at any time that the Secretary determines that such \nplan is resulting in decreased supply or increased demand for electric \nenergy in the States covered by the Western States Coordinating \nCouncil.\n    (d) Application to Nonjurisdictional Utilities.--It is the intent \nof Congress that each wholesale electric utility that is not a public \nutility subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall voluntarily \ncomply with the market monitoring and mitigation plan referred to in \nsubsection (a), as modified by the Commission under this section.\n    (e) Sunset.--The requirements of this section shall cease to apply \nas of September 30, 2002.\n\nSEC. 5.
