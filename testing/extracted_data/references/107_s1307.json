    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``China Free Enterprise Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress find that--\n            (1) an increased number of privatized enterprises and \n        start-up private enterprises in the People's Republic of China \n        will serve the interests and quality of life of the people of \n        the People's Republic of China, given the greater economic \n        growth potential of market-oriented development;\n            (2) a limitation on access to United States capital markets \n        by Chinese state-owned enterprises will indicate a United \n        States preference for economic transactions with and investment \n        in privatized enterprises, rather than state-owned enterprises, \n        and therefore establish an incentive for the Government of the \n        People's Republic of China to accelerate privatization efforts;\n            (3) resources given to state-owned enterprises effectively \n        empower the repressive apparatus of an autocratic government in \n        the People's Republic of China to perpetuate human and labor \n        rights abuses, the subjugation of Tibet, the despoiling of the \n        environment, and suppression of religious freedoms;\n            (4) investments made available to state-owned enterprises \n        affiliated with the complex of military and technology \n        industries in the People's Republic of China would be \n        particularly inimical to United States interests, given China's \n        military buildup directed against the United States, Chinese \n        military policies in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, and \n        arms proliferation efforts destabilizing to the democracies of \n        the Asia-Pacific region and the already volatile Persian Gulf \n        region;\n            (5) state-owned enterprises of the People's Republic of \n        China which have raised funds in the United States capital \n        markets have failed to engage in adequate disclosure to United \n        States investors concerning where these enterprises (as well as \n        their subsidiaries, parent companies, or other affiliates) are \n        doing business in the world, and with whom;\n            (6) the state-owned Petrochina energy enterprise in the \n        People's Republic of China has offered its securities in the \n        United States without disclosing that investors' funds would be \n        directly or indirectly subsidizing operations in Sudan on the \n        part of its parent company, China National Petroleum Company, \n        effectively underwriting the systematic religious persecution \n        and heinous human rights abuses of the Government of Sudan;\n            (7) a second state-owned enterprise of the People's \n        Republic of China, China Petroleum and Chemical Company or \n        ``Sinopec'', has offered securities in the United States \n        without disclosing its recent, and possibly ongoing, investment \n        activity in Sudan or its negotiations to conclude contracts in \n        Iran's energy sector, in violation of the Iran-Libya Sanctions \n        Act of 1993;\n            (8) a limitation on access to United States capital markets \n        by Chinese state-owned enterprises will not have a deleterious \n        effect on United States businesses, consumers, or workers as \n        trade sanctions may have;\n            (9) a limitation on access to United States capital markets \n        by Chinese state-owned enterprises will do no appreciable harm \n        to United States investors or the free flow of capital into and \n        out of the United States;\n            (10) a limitation on access to United States capital \n        markets by Chinese state-owned enterprises will do no \n        appreciable harm to the people of the People's Republic of \n        China, whose welfare and individual liberties it should be the \n        United States policy to enhance; and\n            (11) a limitation on access to United States capital \n        markets by Chinese state-owned enterprises does not violate the \n        terms of permanent normal trade relations status granted by the \n        United States to the People's Republic of China, nor the \n        General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\nSEC. 3. BAN ON SECURITIES MARKET ACCESS.\n\n    Notwithstanding any provision of the securities laws or any other \nprovision of law, no security issued by, or other interest or \nparticipation in, a state-owned enterprise may be--\n            (1) listed, or authorized for listing, on the New York \n        Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or listed, or \n        authorized for listing, on the National Market System of the \n        Nasdaq Stock Market (or any successor to such entities); or\n            (2) otherwise listed, or authorized for listing, on a \n        national securities exchange (or tier or segment thereof) or by \n        a registered securities association.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act--\n            (1) the term ``registered securities association'' means a \n        securities association registered under section 15A of the \n        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3);\n            (2) the terms ``securities laws'' and ``security'' have the \n        same meanings as in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act \n        of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)); and\n            (3) the term ``state-owned enterprise'' means any entity, \n        not less than 50 percent of the assets of which are owned by \n        any agency or instrumentality of the Government of the People's \n        Republic of China (including any agency or instrumentality \n        thereof), either directly or through a subsidiary, parent \n        company, or other affiliate, including those located in Hong \n        Kong or elsewhere."
