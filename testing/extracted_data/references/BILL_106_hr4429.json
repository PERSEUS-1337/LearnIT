FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Commercial transactions on the Internet, whether retail \n        business-to-customer or business-to-business, are commonly \n        called electronic commerce.\n            (2) In the United States, business-to-business transactions \n        between small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such \n        businesses and their suppliers is rapidly growing, as many of \n        these businesses begin to use Internet connections for supply-\n        chain management, after-sales support, and payments.\n            (3) Small and medium-sized manufacturers and other such \n        businesses play a critical role in the United States economy.\n            (4) Electronic commerce can help small and medium-sized \n        manufacturers and other such businesses develop new products \n        and markets, interact more quickly and efficiently with \n        suppliers and customers, and improve productivity by increasing \n        efficiency and reducing transaction costs and paperwork. Small \n        and medium-sized manufacturers and other such businesses who \n        fully exploit the potential of electronic commerce activities \n        can use it to interact with customers, suppliers, and the \n        public, and for external support functions such as personnel \n        services and employee training.\n            (5) The National Institute of Standards and Technology's \n        Manufacturing Extension Partnership program has a successful \n        record of assisting small and medium-sized manufacturers and \n        other such businesses. In addition, the Manufacturing Extension \n        Partnership program, working with the Small Business \n        Administration, successfully assisted United States small \n        enterprises in remediating their Y2K computer problems.\n            (6) A critical element of electronic commerce is the \n        ability of different electronic commerce systems to exchange \n        information. The continued growth of electronic commerce will \n        be enhanced by the development of private voluntary \n        interoperability standards and testbeds to ensure the \n        compatibility of different systems.\n\nSEC. 102.
