FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Congress is pleased that the institutions of the \n        World Bank Group have adopted environmental assessment and \n        information access procedures. These policy changes have \n        generated increased concern for the environmental impact of \n        projects, and have created a greater environmental awareness at \n        such institutions. However, problems continue to arise in the \n        use by World Bank decision makers of information generated by \n        environmental assessments and the adequacy of their content. \n        Furthermore, while environmental information and compliance \n        with environmental and social policies has improved \n        substantially, there are inconsistencies and gaps in how the \n        World Bank implements their policies and procedures.\n            (2) Current environmental safeguards in the taxpayer-\n        supported international financial institutions are inadequate. \n        The World Bank does not prepare a full environmental assessment \n        for a significant portion of its activities. Even in those \n        cases where an environmental assessment is made, the assessment \n        is often not made available in a full or timely manner to the \n        United States Executive Director of the institution. The World \n        Bank's internal evaluation department found that the \n        environmental assessments have little to no impact on the \n        project design and project decisions. Internal reviews have \n        further determined that more than a third of all World Bank \n        projects either do not adhere to the environmental policies or \n        fail to meet environmental performance goals.\n            (3) Under current law, United States taxpayers are forced \n        to contribute funds even for projects that are opposed by the \n        United States Executive Director of the institution from which \n        funding for the project has been requested. For example, United \n        States taxpayers will contribute $27,200,000 for a loan that \n        will be used for a project that will result in resettlement \n        that will harm Tibetan and Mongolian indigenous peoples, and \n        despoil the environment of the region, notwithstanding that the \n        United States voted against providing a loan for the project.\n            (4) Projects of the World Bank Group resettle large numbers \n        of people. A world Bank study concluded that 543,000 people had \n        been relocated from 1986 through 1993. Almost 3,000,000 more \n        people are or will be resettled under the current active \n        portfolio, according to the World Bank. The Bank's inspection \n        panel has found an imbalance in execution of investment \n        components of Bank-financed projects and resettlement \n        components of the same projects, in large part due to the \n        common practice of leaving resettlement and environmental \n        measures to counterpart financing.\n            (5) United States funding should be made contingent on \n        evidence that the institutions will not make any loan or \n        provide any financial assistance that will have a significant \n        adverse environmental impact, including involuntary \n        resettlement and the destruction of forests or other natural \n        ecosystems.\n            (6) For several years, the Congress has made it a priority \n        to seek a broader policy framework for environmental and social \n        protection at the World Bank Group. The World Bank Group sets \n        the standards, which other international financial institutions \n        follow. In fact, the Congress has made environmental issues a \n        condition for United States contributions to the international \n        financial institutions. The World Bank repeatedly exhibits a \n        failure to comply with these environmental and social policies. \n        Furthermore, in 1999, 63 percent of the lending by the World \n        Bank is for macroeconomic adjustment programs that do not have \n        to follow environmental or social policies.\n            (7) The World Bank's board of directors and management have \n        consistently undermined the effectiveness of its only \n        accountability mechanism, the independent inspection panel, by \n        interfering with the ability of the panel to carry out \n        investigations of Bank policy violations in response to \n        legitimate citizen claims. The inspection panel was created in \n        response to calls by the Congress for more, not less, \n        accountability at the Bank.\n            (8) The United States and other donor governments agreed in \n        the replenishment negotiations for IDA 12 that the World Bank \n        Group should make more information publicly available and \n        improve overall transparency.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the World Bank Group has not made significant progress \n        in complying with environmental policies or mandates;\n            (2) the World Bank Group should seek full compliance with \n        its environmental and social policies and policies on \n        information disclosure;\n            (3) the World Bank Group should apply its environmental and \n        social policies to all lending and financial instruments; and\n            (4) the World Bank should not interfere with the authority \n        or the independence of its inspection panel, and that panel \n        should have the mandate to cover all institutions in the World \n        Bank Group.\n\nSEC. 3.
