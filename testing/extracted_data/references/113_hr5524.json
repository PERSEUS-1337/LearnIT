    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Contraception for Women \nServicemembers and Dependents Act of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Women are serving in the Armed Forces at increasing \n        rates, playing a critical role in the national security of the \n        United States. More than 350,000 women serve on active duty in \n        the Armed Forces or in the Selected Reserve.\n            (2) Nearly 10,000,000 members of the Armed Forces \n        (including members of the National Guard and Reserves), \n        military retirees, their families, their survivors, and certain \n        former spouses, including nearly 5,000,000 female \n        beneficiaries, are eligible for health care through the \n        Department of Defense.\n            (3) Contraception is critical for women's health and is \n        highly effective at reducing unintended pregnancy. The Centers \n        for Disease Control and Prevention describe contraception as \n        one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the \n        twentieth century.\n            (4) Contraception has played a direct role in the greater \n        participation of women in education and employment. Increased \n        wages and increased control over reproductive decisions provide \n        women with educational and professional opportunities that have \n        increased gender equality over the decades since contraception \n        was introduced.\n            (5) Studies have shown that when cost barriers to the full \n        range of methods of contraception are eliminated, and women \n        receive comprehensive counseling on the various methods of \n        contraception (including highly effective Long-Acting \n        Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs)), rates of unintended \n        pregnancy decline dramatically.\n            (6) Research has also shown that investments in effective \n        contraception save public and private dollars.\n            (7) The 2011 recommendations of the Institute of Medicine \n        on women's preventive health services include recommendations \n        that health insurance plans cover all methods of contraception \n        approved by the Food and Drug Administration, sterilization \n        procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women \n        with reproductive capacity without any cost-sharing \n        requirements.\n            (8) The recommendations described in paragraph (7) are \n        reflected in provisions of the Patient Protection and \n        Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), and thus group and \n        individual health insurance plans must provide such coverage. \n        The recommendations have also been adopted by the Office of \n        Personnel Management, and thus all health insurance plans that \n        are part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program must \n        provide such coverage.\n            (9) Under the TRICARE program, servicewomen on active duty \n        have full coverage of all prescription drugs, including \n        contraception, without cost-sharing requirements. However, \n        servicewomen not on active duty, and female dependents of \n        members of the Armed Forces, who receive health care through \n        the TRICARE program do not have similar coverage of all \n        prescription methods of contraception approved by the Food and \n        Drug Administration without cost-sharing.\n            (10) Studies indicate that servicewomen need comprehensive \n        counseling for pregnancy prevention, particularly in their \n        predeployment preparations, and the lack thereof is \n        contributing to unintended pregnancies among servicewomen.\n            (11) An analysis by Ibis Reproductive Health of the 2008 \n        Survey of Health Related Behaviors among Active Duty Military \n        Personnel found a high unintended pregnancy rate among \n        servicewomen. Adjusting for the difference between age \n        distribution in the Armed Forces and the general population, \n        the rate of unintended pregnancy among servicewomen is higher \n        than for the general population.\n            (12) With the integrated use of electronic medical records \n        throughout the Department of Defense, the technological \n        infrastructure exists to develop clinical decision support \n        tools. These tools, which are incorporated into the electronic \n        medical record, allow for a point-of-care feedback loop that \n        can be used to enhance patient decisionmaking, case and patient \n        management, and care coordination. Benefits of clinical \n        decision support tools include increased quality of care and \n        enhanced health outcomes, improved efficiency, and provider and \n        patient satisfaction.\n            (13) The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the \n        Services (DACOWITS) has recommended that all the Armed Forces, \n        to the extent that they have not already, implement initiatives \n        that inform servicemembers of the importance of family \n        planning, educate them on methods of contraception, and make \n        various methods of contraception available, based on the \n        finding that family planning can increase the overall readiness \n        and quality of life of all members of the military.\n            (14) Health care, including family planning for survivors \n        of sexual assault in the Armed Forces is a critical issue. \n        Servicewomen on active duty report rates of unwanted sexual \n        contact at approximately 16 times those of the comparable \n        general population of women in the United States. Through \n        regulations, the Department of Defense already supports a \n        policy of ensuring that servicewomen who are sexually assaulted \n        have access to emergency contraception.\n\nSEC. 3.

ACCESS TO BROAD RANGE OF METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION APPROVED BY \n              THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n              FORCES AND MILITARY DEPENDENTS AT MILITARY TREATMENT \n              FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Commencing not later than 180 days after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure \nthat every military treatment facility has a sufficient stock of a \nbroad range of methods of contraception approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and the Office of Population Affairs of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, to be able to dispense at any time any such \nmethod of contraception to any women members of the Armed Forces and \nfemale covered beneficiaries who receive care through such facility.\n    (b) Covered Beneficiary Defined.--In this section, the term \n``covered beneficiary'' has the meaning given that term in section \n1072(5) of title 10, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 5.
