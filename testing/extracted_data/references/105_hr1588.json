PROHIBITION OF PAYMENT OF ARREARAGES TO UNITED NATIONS.\n\n    Until a certification by the President of reforms in the United \nNations under section 3 is transmitted to the Congress and the \ncertification is approved by the Congress through enactment of a joint \nresolution in accordance with section 4, and notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, funds appropriated or otherwise made available for \nany fiscal year under ``Contributions to International Organizations'', \n``Contributions for International Peacekeeping'', or any other account \nshall not be available for the payment of any assessed contribution of \nthe United States for prior years to the United Nations.\n\nSEC. 3. CERTIFICATION BY THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED NATIONS REFORMS.\n\n    The certification referred to in section 2 is a certification (with \nsupporting documentation) by the President to the Congress that the \nUnited Nations has implemented all of the following reforms:\n            (1) Assessed payment reformulation.--\n                    (A) The assessed payment of the United States to \n                the United Nations for each year has been lowered to 20 \n                percent of the budget of the United Nations, or\n                    (B) The United Nations has reformulated each member \n                state's assessed level to reflect each state's share of \n                the total world gross national product.\n            (2) Code of conduct.--The United Nations has implemented a \n        code of conduct for all employees of the United Nations. The \n        code of conduct shall specify that no United Nations official, \n        including the Secretary General, shall be permitted to engage \n        in business activities outside the United Nations, or provide \n        any relative with access to United Nations procurement \n        contracts, or take bribes, directly or indirectly, from \n        individuals or corporations doing business with the United \n        Nations or from United Nations member states or their \n        representatives.\n            (3) Inspector general of the united nations.--The Office of \n        Inspector General of the United Nations has been strengthened \n        as follows:\n                    (A) The United Nations has a truly independent \n                office of inspector general to conduct and supervise \n                objective audits, inspections, and investigations \n                relating to programs and operations of the United \n                Nations. The office shall be financed under a separate \n                line item in the budget of the United Nations and shall \n                function independently of the Secretary General.\n                    (B) The United Nations has an inspector general who \n                is selected and elected by the General Assembly for a \n                term of 3 years and whose appointment was made \n                principally on the basis of the appointee's integrity \n                and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, \n                financial analysis, law, management analysis, public \n                administration, or investigation. The inspector general \n                may be removed only for cause by the Secretary General \n                with the approval of the General Assembly.\n                    (C) The inspector general is authorized to--\n                            (i) make investigations and reports \n                        relating to the administration of the programs \n                        and operations of the United Nations;\n                            (ii) have access to all relevant records, \n                        documents, and other available materials \n                        relating to those programs and operations; and\n                            (iii) have direct and prompt access to any \n                        official of the United Nations.\n                    (D) The United Nations has fully implemented, and \n                made available to all member states, procedures \n                designed to protect the identity of, and prevent \n                reprisals against, any employee of the United Nations \n                making a complaint or disclosing information to, or \n                cooperating in any investigation or inspection by, the \n                inspector general.\n                    (E) The United Nations has fully implemented \n                procedures designed to ensure compliance with \n                recommendations of the inspector general.\n                    (F) The United Nations has required the inspector \n                general to issue an annual report and has ensured that \n                the annual report and all other relevant reports of the \n                inspector general are made available to the member \n                governments of the United Nations General Assembly \n                without modification.\n                    (G) The United Nations is committed to providing \n                sufficient budgetary resources to ensure the effective \n                operation of the office of the inspector general.\n            (4) Employee protection.--The existing United Nations \n        grievance system has been thoroughly reformed to permit United \n        Nations employees to hire outside counsel for taking their \n        grievances up the United Nations grievance ladder to the top \n        United Nations grievance appeals level. It should also be made \n        amply clear for civil lawyers and judges in each member state \n        that United Nations officials' immunity from civil process \n        applies only to actions performed in the strict fulfillment of \n        United Nations official duties and never to abuses in violation \n        of an extensive United Nations code of conduct, United Nations \n        employees having the right and option in such cases any time to \n        exit the United Nations grievance process and sue in a civil \n        court.\n            (5) Procurement reforms.--\n                    (A) The United Nations has implemented a system \n                requiring at least 30 days prior notification for the \n                submission of all qualified bid proposals on all United \n                Nations procurement opportunities of more than $100,000 \n                and a public announcement of the award of any contract \n                of more than $100,000 (except in justified and \n                documented emergencies).\n                    (B) To the extent practicable, notifications and \n                announcements under subparagraph (A) are made in the \n                Commerce Business Daily.\n                    (C) The procurement regulations of the United \n                Nations prohibit punitive actions such as the \n                suspension of contract eligibility for contractors who \n                challenge contract awards or complain about delayed \n                payments.\n            (6) Whistleblower protection.--The United Nations has \n        implemented whistleblower protection for employees of the \n        United Nations that--\n                    (A) protects employees who allege or report \n                instances of fraud or mismanagement, and\n                    (B) the independent Office of the Inspector General \n                has reviewed the policies and regulations under \n                subparagraph (A) and determined, in writing, that they \n                offer adequate safeguards against retaliation for such \n                employees, and that the United Nations employee \n                grievance system outlined in paragraph (4)(C)(ii) has \n                been reformed and the reforms implemented.\n            (7) No growth budget.--The United Nations has adopted a \n        calendar year 2000-2001 biennial budget that requires no \n        nominal growth, in dollars, in expenditures.\n            (8) Downsizing.--The United Nations has continued to \n        downsize the number of authorized employment positions, \n        including a reduction of not less than 10 percent in the number \n        of full-time permanent authorized employment positions from \nthe number of such positions authorized on January 1, 1997. Acceptable \ndownsizing may not include early detachment from United Nations service \nwith full pay until retirement age is reached, nor may it include the \nhiring of consultants to replace employees detached early with full pay \nor those replaced by temporary employees on short-term contracts.\n            (9) Salaries.--The United Nations has imposed a freeze on \n        salaries of employees of the United Nations which allows only \n        for annual increases not greater than any annual increase in \n        the United States consumer price index.\n            (10) Representation on advisory committee on administrative \n        and budget questions.--The 8 member states which are the \n        highest contributors to the budget of the United Nations shall \n        be permanent members of the Advisory Committee on \n        Administrative and Budget Questions.\n            (11) Access to documents.--Require access by any member \n        state of the United Nations Budget Committee (also known as the \n        Fifth Committee) to any document concerning any United Nations \n        program that involves expenditures.\n            (12) Annual reauthorization of peace-keeping missions.--The \n        United Nations requires an annual review and reauthorization of \n        any peacekeeping missions by the United Nations Security \n        Council.\n            (13) Reimbursement for united states department of defense \n        peacekeeping expenditures.--The United Nations has reimbursed \n        the United States Department of Defense for voluntary \n        contributions to United Nations peacekeeping missions and the \n        United Nations and the United States have entered into an \n        agreement that calls for United Nations reimbursement for any \n        future voluntary contributions by the United States Department \n        of Defense, whether they be financial, logistical, or material.\n            (14) United states arrearages.--The United Nations and the \n        United States have mutually determined an amount that will \n        satisfy any and all arrearages of the United States in assessed \n        contributions for prior years.\n            (15) Nominations to security council.--All member states of \n        the United Nations belong to a regional group that allows each \n        member state to be nominated to the Security Council.\n            (16) United nations taxes.--The United Nations has \n        abandoned any effort to establish an international tax or any \n        other international fee or assessment imposed by the United \n        Nations (other than the assessed contributions of member states \n        of the United Nations and associated organs).\n            (17) Noninterference with religious belief, culture, or \n        tradition.--Neither the United Nations nor any affiliated \n        agency or entity is engaged in any program or activity that \n        threatens to interfere with the religion, moral values, \n        culture, or traditions of any person or group, except insofar \n        as is strictly necessary for the protection of fundamental and \n        internationally recognized human rights.\n\nSEC. 4.
