The balance of cross-Strait military forces and \n        capabilities continues to shift in the mainland's favor.''. The \n        report also states the PLA has deployed between 1,000 and 1,200 \n        short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) to units opposite Taiwan.\n            (8) The United States has sought diplomatically to preserve \n        Taiwan's international space, and has sought to secure Taiwan's \n        meaningful participation in such international organizations as \n        the World Health Organization (WHO).\n            (9) The total value of trade between the United States and \n        Taiwan in 2011 was approximately 67,200,000,000, and Taiwan \n        ranked as the 10th largest trading partner of the United \n        States.\n            (10) Given that the Taiwan Relations Act states that it is \n        the policy of the United States to ``preserve and promote \n        extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other \n        relations between the people of the United States and the \n        people on Taiwan,'' it is in the economic interests of the \n        United States and the national security interests of Taiwan for \n        our two peoples to further strengthen their trade and \n        investment ties.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission \nto review and report to Congress on the implementation of the Taiwan \nRelations Act and on United States policy in regard to Taiwan since \n2000.\n\nSEC. 2.
