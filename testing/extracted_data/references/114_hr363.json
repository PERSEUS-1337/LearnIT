FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) During the winter of Valley Forge, from 1777-1778, the \n        Continental Army had difficulty recruiting the necessary quotas \n        of men set by the Congress.\n            (2) At the same time, the State of Rhode Island was ordered \n        to supply two battalions while faced with the occupation of the \n        City of Newport by the British.\n            (3) In January 1778, at the urging of Brigadier General \n        James Varnum, General George Washington wrote to Governor \n        Nicholas Cooke of the State of Rhode Island requesting \n        assistance recruiting men for the Continental Line.\n            (4) On February 14, 1778, the Rhode Island General Assembly \n        voted to allow the enlistment of ``every able-bodied negro, \n        mulatto, or Indian man slave''.\n            (5) In addition, the Rhode Island General Assembly provided \n        that any enlisted slave ``upon his passing muster before \n        Colonel Christopher Greene, be immediately discharged from the \n        service of his master or mistress, and be absolutely free as \n        though he had never been incumbered and be incumbered with any \n        kind of servitude or slavery.''.\n            (6) As a result, between February 1778 and June 1778, \n        Colonel Christopher Greene, Lt. Colonel Jeremiah Olney and \n        Major Samuel Ward recruited almost 200 men of African and \n        Native American descent who formed the core of the First Rhode \n        Island Regiment.\n            (7) The First Rhode Island Regiment became among the first \n        units in American History in which men of every race and \n        ethnicity were recruited to serve.\n            (8) On August 28, 1778, at the Battle of Rhode Island, \n        following an attempted siege of British-occupied Newport along \n        with the newly allied French fleet, the First Rhode Island \n        Regiment acted heroically in holding back Hessian forces and \n        causing them to retreat.\n            (9) During the Battle of Rhode Island, the First Rhode \n        Island Regiment's losses included three killed, nine wounded \n        and eleven missing soldiers.\n            (10) For an additional 5 years, the First Rhode Island \n        Regiment fought bravely to win American independence including \n        at Fort Oswego, Saratoga, and Yorktown.\n            (11) On June 13, 1783, at Saratoga, the First Rhode Island \n        Regiment was demobilized.\n            (12) Their commander, Colonel Jeremiah Olney, praised the \n        Regiment for ``faithfully preserving in the best of causes, in \n        every stage of service, with unexampled fortitude and patience \n        through all the danger and toils of a long and severe war''.\n            (13) Afterwards, some veterans of the First Rhode Island \n        Regiment had to consistently resist efforts at re-enslavement \n        and fought for back wages from the Rhode Island General \n        Assembly.\n            (14) According to the Rhode Island State Archives, the \n        First Rhode Island Regiment included at least the following \n        soldiers: Babcock, Priamus (Primus); Bent, Prince; Bours, Cato; \n        Brown, Priamus (Primus); Burk, Africa; Burroughs, John; \n        Carpenter, Cudgo; Champlin, Dick; Champlin, Jack; Champlin, \n        July; Champlin, Newport; Champlin, Sharper; Champlin, York; \n        Clark, James; Coddington, Jack; Fones, Jack; Gardner, Cuff; \n        Gardner, Hercules; Gardner, Minkl; Gardner, Preamus (Primus); \n        Gardner, Rutter; Gray, Ebenezer; Green, Cuff; Greene, Cato; \n        Greene, Jack; Greene, Pero; Greene, William; Hammond, Prince; \n        Harriss, Cesar; Hazard, Backus; Hazard, Jabin; Hazard, Jacob; \n        Hazard, Peter; Hazard, Peter; Lefavour, Thom; Mason, Warsen; \n        Mawney, Cyrus; Minturn, Jack; Mowrey, Pero; Nichols, Thomas; \n        Perry, Ganset; Phillips, Philow; Pierce, Titus; Potter, David; \n        Randall, Prince; Rhodes, Bristol; Rhodes, Priamus; Rhodes, \n        Richard; Rhodes, Samuel; Richmond, Ebenezer; Robinson, Mingo; \n        Rodman, Isaac; Rodman, Mingo; Rodman, Prince; Rose, Cesar; \n        Saltonstall, Brittain; Saunders, Sampson; Sheldon, Cesar; \n        Slave; Slave; Smith, Juba; Sweeling, Query; Talbot, Sigby; \n        Tanner, Quam; Tillinghast, Cuff; Updike, Cesar; Updike, Moses; \n        Vaughan, Prince; Vernon, Cato; Watson, Fortune; Wells, Cesar; \n        Wickes, Nat; and Willbour, Boston.\n\nSEC. 3.
