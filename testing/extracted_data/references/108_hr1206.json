FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1948, the average United States family with children \n        paid only 3 percent of its income in Federal taxes;\n            (2) in 1996, the average United States family with children \n        paid almost 24 percent of its income in Federal taxes;\n            (3) United Nations officials have made numerous and \n        repeated proposals to provide financing for the United Nations \n        outside the scrutiny of Member States of the United Nations, \n        including borrowing from international financial institutions, \n        assuming control of bonds issued by Member States, and imposing \n        taxes on an extensive range of transactions, goods, and \n        services;\n            (4) the 1994 ``Human Development Report'' of the United \n        Nations Development Program stated that ``[i]t is appropriate \n        that the proceeds of an international tax be devoted to \n        international purposes and be placed at the disposal of \n        international institutions.'';\n            (5) on January 14, 1996, United Nations Secretary General \n        Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated that an international tax would \n        mean that ``[he would] not be under the daily financial will of \n        the Member States.'';\n            (6) American taxpayers have paid approximately \n        $30,000,000,000 to the United Nations since 1945;\n            (7) the United Nations and its organizations are replete \n        with mismanagement, waste, corruption, and inefficiency which \n        cost American taxpayers millions of dollars each year;\n            (8) the power to tax is an attribute of sovereignty;\n            (9) the United Nations does not have the attributes of \n        sovereignty and is not a sovereign power;\n            (10) the United Nations has no legal authority to impose \n        taxes on United States citizens;\n            (11) the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n        Development is seeking to hinder tax competition between \n        nations;\n            (12) the United States has a relatively low tax burden \n        compared to other developed nations and any effort to hinder \n        tax competition will undermine the competitive advantage of the \n        United States;\n            (13) the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n        Development is pursuing tax harmonization policies that would \n        enable foreign governments to tax income earned in the United \n        States;\n            (14) the power to determine the tax treatment of income \n        inside national borders is an attribute of sovereignty; and\n            (15) the United States finances approximately one-fourth of \n        the budget of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n        Development.\n\nSEC. 3.
