FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Nation's fire losses are estimated at 5,000 deaths \n        and 29,000 injuries annually, producing an economic loss \n        conservatively estimated at $10,000,000,000 a year plus more \n        than $1,000,000,000 a year in health care costs;\n            (2) sustained and targeted fire safety education at the \n        State and local levels, particularly in identifiable high-risk \n        populations, produces dramatic results in preventing fires, \n        fire deaths, and dollar loss from fire;\n            (3) in recent years, the Nation's fire departments have \n        seen their fire safety education budgets cut dramatically and, \n        in many cases, eliminated;\n            (4) there is a need to expand the availability of State and \n        local fire prevention programs and supporting resources and \n        materials to help State agencies and local fire departments in \n        carrying out effective public education;\n            (5) fire departments in other countries with fewer fire \n        deaths per capita than the United States spend an average of 4-\n        10 percent of their budgets on fire prevention, versus less \n        than 3 percent for United States departments; and\n            (6) only by accurately collecting and analyzing data on \n        fire deaths, injuries and dollar loss can the Nation's fire \n        departments pinpoint the populations and regions where they \n        most need to direct their educational efforts, thus leading to \n        a more efficient and effective use of resources.\n\nSEC. 3.
