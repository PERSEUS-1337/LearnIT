    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Gulf Security and Iran Sanctions \nEnforcement Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of \n        Iran--combined with its development of unconventional weapons \n        and ballistic missiles and support for international \n        terrorism--represent a serious threat to the security of the \n        United States and United States allies in Europe, the Middle \n        East, and around the world.\n            (2) Executive Order 12959, issued on May 8, 1995, banned \n        all new investment in Iran by United States individuals and \n        companies.\n            (3) On August 5, 1996, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of \n        1996 (later re-titled the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996) was \n        enacted in order, among other purposes, to encourage foreign \n        persons to withdraw from the Iranian market.\n            (4) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 (June \n        9, 2010) notes, ``the potential connection between Iran's \n        revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of \n        Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities,'' and \n        further notes that ``chemical process equipment and materials \n        required for the petrochemical industry have much in common \n        with those required for certain sensitive nuclear fuel cycle \n        activities''.\n            (5) Through its sanctions regime, the United States \n        Government seeks to prevent the Iranian Government and \n        engineers and scientists employed by state-owned Iranian energy \n        companies or companies affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary \n        Guard Corps from gaining access to key domain expertise, \n        technology and equipment that could aid the development of \n        Iran's energy sector and also assist Iran in certain \n        proliferation activities.\n            (6) The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and \n        Divestment Act of 2010, which was signed into law on July 1, \n        2010, included sanctions against goods, services, and \n        technology to modernize Iran's oil and natural gas sector.\n            (7) The threat of sanctions has constrained the supply of \n        capital, technology, and services to the Iranian petroleum \n        sector, and several companies have withdrawn their business \n        from Iran.\n            (8) The Government of Iran is pursuing partnerships outside \n        Iran with foreign energy-related companies, including joint \n        ventures, investments, and partnerships.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States should continue to support diplomatic \n        efforts in the International Atomic Energy Agency and the \n        United Nations Security Council to end the Government of Iran's \n        illicit nuclear activities;\n            (2) international diplomatic efforts to address the \n        Government of Iran's illicit nuclear efforts and support for \n        international terrorism are more likely to be effective if \n        strong additional sanctions are imposed on the Government of \n        Iran;\n            (3) the concerns of the United States regarding the \n        Government of Iran are strictly the result of the actions of \n        the Government of Iran;\n            (4) Iranian partnerships outside Iran with foreign energy-\n        related companies, including joint ventures, investments and \n        partnerships, could give the Iranian Government and engineers \n        and scientists employed by state-owned Iranian energy companies \n        or companies affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps \n        access to key domain expertise, technology and equipment that \n        could aid the development of Iran's energy sector and also \n        assist Iran in certain proliferation activities;\n            (5) joint ventures with Iranian state-owned energy \n        companies serve to interfere with international attempts to \n        build a consensus for action regarding the Government of Iran's \n        ongoing refusal to comply with its international obligations \n        regarding its nuclear program; and\n            (6) in order for sanctions to be effective and enabling a \n        diplomatic solution, the Government of Iran should be prevented \n        from disregarding their international obligations by \n        prohibiting foreign companies from receiving Iranian capital, \n        technology, and expertise, and by blocking foreign energy-\n        related companies from entering into joint ventures, \n        investments, and partnerships for energy and energy-related \n        projects outside of Iran.\n\nSEC. 4. RESTRICTION ON PARTICIPATION IN OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING.\n\n    (a) Certification Requirement.--The Secretary of the Interior \nshall--\n            (1) include in each lease issued after the date of \n        enactment of this Act that authorizes drilling for oil and gas \n        on the Outer Continental Shelf a provision that requires that--\n                    (A) the person that is the lessee to certify \n                annually to the Secretary that the person does not \n                engage in any activity for which sanctions may be \n                imposed under section 5 of the Iran Sanctions Act of \n                1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note); and\n                    (B) authorizes the Secretary to cancel the lease if \n                the person fails to make such a certification or makes \n                such a certification that is false; and\n            (2) upon determination by the Secretary, in consultation \n        with the Secretary of the Treasury, that the person has failed \n        to make a certification required under such provision or made \n        such a certification that is false, shall cancel the lease.\n    (b) Disclosure Requirement.--The Secretary of the Interior shall--\n            (1) include in each lease issued after the date of \n        enactment of this Act that authorizes drilling for oil and gas \n        on the Outer Continental Shelf a provision that--\n                    (A) requires the person that is the lessee to \n                disclose to the Secretary any participation by the \n                person in any energy-related joint venture, investment, \n                or partnership located outside Iran that involves--\n                            (i) any person whose property and interests \n                        in property are blocked pursuant to Executive \n                        Order 13224 (66 Fed.
