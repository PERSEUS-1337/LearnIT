FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1970, the Secretary of the Interior designated the \n        Pullman Historic District as a National Historic Landmark \n        District in 1970 because of--\n                    (A) the significance of the District to the labor \n                history, social history, architecture, and urban \n                planning of the United States; and\n                    (B) the pivotal role of events in the District in \n                creating the first national Labor Day holiday in the \n                world;\n            (2) between 1880 and 1884 George M. Pullman, owner of the \n        Pullman Palace Car Company, built the Pullman community, which \n        was envisioned by Pullman as an industrial town that would \n        provide employees with--\n                    (A) a model community; and\n                    (B) suitable living conditions;\n            (3) the town developed by George M. Pullman, which \n        consisted of over 1,000 buildings and homes, was awarded ``The \n        World's Most Perfect Town'' at the International Hygienic and \n        Pharmaceutical Exposition in 1896;\n            (4) the Pullman factory site is a true symbol of the \n        historic struggle in the United States to achieve fair labor \n        practices for the working class, with the original factory \n        serving as the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in \n        the United States;\n            (5) in the midst of economic depression in 1894, to protest \n        unsafe conditions and reductions in pay, Pullman factory \n        workers initiated a strike that--\n                    (A) when taken up as a cause by the American \n                Railway Union, crippled the entire rail industry;\n                    (B) continued even in the face of a Federal \n                injunction and a showdown between laborers and Federal \n                troops that turned violent and deadly; and\n                    (C) set a national example for the ability of \n                working people in the United States to change the \n                existing system in favor of more just practices for \n                protecting workers rights and safety;\n            (6) following the deaths of a number of workers at the \n        hands of the United States military and United States Marshals \n        during the 1894 strike, Congress unanimously voted to approve \n        rush legislation that created a national Labor Day holiday, \n        which was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland 6 days \n        after the end of the strike;\n            (7) the Pullman Palace Car Company also played an important \n        role in African-American and early civil rights history through \n        the legacy of the Pullman porters, many of whom were ex-slaves \n        were employed in a heavily discriminatory environment \n        immediately following the Civil War;\n            (8) the Pullman porters, who served diligently between the \n        1870s and the 1960s, have been commended for--\n                    (A) the level of service and attention to detail of \n                the Pullman porters; and\n                    (B) the contributions of the Pullman porters to the \n                development of the African-American middle class;\n            (9) the information, ideas, and commerce the Pullman \n        porters carried across the country while traveling on trains \n        helped to bring education and wealth to African-American \n        communities throughout the United States;\n            (10) the positive role of the Pullman porters in the \n        historical image of the first-class service that was made \n        available on Pullman cars is unmistakable;\n            (11) the Pullman community was the seminal home to the \n        Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which--\n                    (A) was the first African-American labor union with \n                a collective bargaining agreement;\n                    (B) was founded by civil rights pioneer A. Philip \n                Randolph in 1925;\n                    (C) fought against discrimination and in support of \n                just labor practices; and\n                    (D) helped lay the groundwork for what became the \n                great Civil Rights Movement of the 20th Century;\n            (12) the Pullman community is--\n                    (A) a paramount illustration of the work of \n                architect Solon Spencer Beman;\n                    (B) a well-preserved example of 19th Century \n                community planning, architecture, and landscape design; \n                and\n                    (C) comprised of a number of historic structures, \n                including the Administration Clock Tower Building, \n                Hotel Florence, Greenstone Church, Market Square, and \n                hundreds of units of rowhouses built for Pullman \n                workers;\n            (13) the preservation of the Pullman site has been \n        threatened by--\n                    (A) plans for demolition in 1960; and\n                    (B) a fire in 1998, which damaged the iconic clock \n                tower and the rear erecting shops;\n            (14) the diligent efforts of community organizations, \n        foundations, nonprofits, residents, the State, and units of \n        local government in the restoration and preservation of the \n        District after the 1998 fire were vital to the protection of \n        the Pullman site;\n            (15) due to the historic and architectural significance of \n        the District, the District is designated as--\n                    (A) a registered National Historic Landmark \n                District;\n                    (B) an Illinois State Landmark; and\n                    (C) a City of Chicago Landmark District; and\n            (16) the preservation, enhancement, economic, and tourism \n        potential and management of the important historic and \n        architectural resources of the Park requires cooperation and \n        partnerships from among local property owners, the Federal \n        Government, the State, units of local government, the private \n        and nonprofit sectors, and the more than 100 civic \n        organizations who have expressed support for community \n        preservation through the establishment of the Pullman National \n        Historical Park.\n\nSEC. 3.
