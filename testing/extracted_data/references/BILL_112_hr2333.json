FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) hand-held personal wireless devices are not only \n        instrumentalities and channels of interstate commerce, but \n        products of interstate commerce;\n            (2) for those reasons, regulation of the use of hand-held \n        mobile telephones and personal wireless devices is covered by \n        the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce as \n        enumerated in article I, section 8 of the Constitution;\n            (3) additionally, the Supreme Court held in South Dakota v. \n        Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (June 23, 1987), that Congress may condition \n        Federal highway funding on State compliance with certain \n        conditions;\n            (4) according to a National Highway Traffic Safety \n        Administration (NHTSA) driver distraction may be grouped into \n        manual, visual, and cognitive distractions;\n            (5) according to Cisco Systems Inc., North American mobile \n        broadband traffic will grow fifty times between 2009-2014;\n            (6) and according to CTIA, the main factors driving the \n        rise in the use of mobile traffic include the increasing \n        availability and capabilities of smartphones, and new form \n        factors (such as tablets), for consumers;\n            (7) as of the date of enactment of this Act, only 8 States \n        and the District of Columbia ban mobile device use for all \n        drivers;\n            (8) the Secretary of Transportation, Ray LaHood, has \n        recognized the significance of increased driver distraction as \n        a result of wireless devices by launching an aggressive \n        educational campaign, issuing Department regulations, and \n        consecutive ``Distracted Driving Summits'' with affected \n        industries;\n            (9) it is necessary, therefore, for Congress to act to \n        protect the safety of all people in the United States on \n        highways, roads, and railways in the United States; and\n            (10) Federal legislation to address the problem of \n        distracted driving is necessary to ensure that national minimum \n        standards of protection exist uniformly.\n\nSEC. 3.
