FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Corporations make significant political contributions \n        and expenditures that directly or indirectly influence the \n        election of candidates and support or oppose political causes. \n        Decisions to use corporate funds for political contributions \n        and expenditures are usually made by corporate boards and \n        executives, rather than shareholders.\n            (2) Corporations, acting through their boards and \n        executives, are obligated to conduct business for the best \n        interests of their owners, the shareholders. Corporate boards \n        and executives that use corporation funds to support and oppose \n        political candidates, parties, and causes in opposition to the \n        interests of their shareholders are not acting for the best \n        interests of the corporation.\n            (3) Historically, shareholders have not had a way to know, \n        or to influence, the political activities of corporations they \n        own. Shareholders and the public have a right to know how \n        corporations are spending their funds to make political \n        contributions or expenditures benefitting candidates, political \n        parties, and political causes.\n            (4) Corporations should be accountable to their \n        shareholders prior to making political contributions or \n        expenditures affecting local, State or Federal governance and \n        public policy. Requiring the express approval of a \n        corporation's shareholders prior to making political \n        contributions or expenditures will establish necessary \n        accountability.\n\nSEC. 3. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITY.\n\n    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended by adding after \nsection 14 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 14A. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF CERTAIN POLITICAL EXPENDITURES.\n\n    ``(a) Affirmative Authorization.--No issuer may make any \nexpenditure for political activities in excess of $10,000 in any fiscal \nyear without first obtaining the written affirmative authorization for \nsuch expenditure by a majority of all shareholders.\n    ``(b) Nature of Decisions.--A decision to make a contribution or \nexpenditure for political activities in excess of $10,000 shall not be \nconsidered a routine matter of the corporation under rules and \nguidelines established by any national securities exchange or by the \nCommission.\n    ``(c) Fiduciary Duty; Liability.--A violation of subsection (a) \nshall be considered a breach of a fiduciary duty of the officers and \ndirectors who authorized such an expenditure. The officers and \ndirectors who authorize such an expenditure without first obtaining \nsuch authorization of shareholders shall be jointly and severally \nliable in any action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction to \nany shareholder or class of shareholders for the amount of such \nexpenditure.\n    ``(d) Exemption for Certain Media.--The provisions of this section \nshall not apply to an issuer whose sole business is the publication or \nbroadcasting of news, commentary, literature, music, entertainment, \nartistic expression, scientific, historical or academic works, or other \nforms of information. The Commission shall issue such guidance as it \ndetermines necessary or appropriate regarding the extent of the \nexemption provided by this subsection.\n    ``(e) Definitions.--As used in this section the following \ndefinitions apply:\n            ``(1) Affirmative authorization.--The term `affirmative \n        authorization' means the full, free, and written consent of a \n        shareholder, obtained without intimidation or fear of reprisal, \n        and shall not include votes made by a broker or any other \n        representative.\n            ``(2) Issue advocacy campaign.--The term `issue advocacy \n        campaign' means any expenditure for any communication to the \n        general public intended to encourage the public to contact a \n        State or Federal Government official regarding pending \n        legislation, public policy or government rule or regulation, \n        but does not include contributions or expenditures for \n        registered lobbyists employed by the corporation to lobby State \n        or Federal Government officials directly.\n            ``(3) Majority of all shareholders.--The term `majority of \n        all shareholders' means number of shareholders that combined \n        own more than 50 percent of all outstanding shares. \n        Shareholders not casting votes shall not count toward such a \n        majority.\n            ``(4) Expenditure for political activities.--\n                    ``(A) The term `expenditure for political \n                activities' means--\n                            ``(i) expenditures in support of, or \n                        opposition to, any Federal, State, or local \n                        candidate;\n                            ``(ii) contributions to or expenditures in \n                        support of any political party, committee, \n                        electioneering communication, voter \n                        registration campaign, ballot measure campaign, \n                        or an issue advocacy campaign; and\n                            ``(iii) dues or other payments to trade \n                        associations or other tax exempt organizations \n                        that are, or could reasonably be anticipated to \n                        be, used for the purposes described in \n                        subparagraphs (A) and (B).\n                    ``(B) Such term shall not include--\n                            ``(i) direct lobbying efforts through \n                        registered lobbyists employed or hired by the \n                        corporation;\n                            ``(ii) communications by a corporation to \n                        its stockholders and executive or \n                        administrative personnel and their families;\n                            ``(iii) nonpartisan registration and get-\n                        out-the-vote campaigns by a corporation aimed \n                        at its stockholders and executive or \n                        administrative personnel and their families; or\n                            ``(iv) the establishment, administration \n                        and solicitation of contributions to a separate \n                        segregated fund to be utilized for political \n                        purposes by a corporation.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
