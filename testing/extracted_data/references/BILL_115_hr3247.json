FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has important economic, security, and \n        national defense interests in the Arctic region.\n            (2) The United States Government has issued several key \n        reports and strategies on the Arctic region over the last four \n        years, including--\n                    (A) the Department of Defense Report to Congress on \n                Strategy to Protect United States National Security \n                Interests in the Arctic Region (December 2016);\n                    (B) the 2015 Year In Review: Progress Report on the \n                Implementation of the National Strategy for the Arctic \n                Region (March 2016);\n                    (C) the Implementation Plan for the National \n                Strategy for the Arctic Region (January 30, 2014); and\n                    (D) the National Strategy for the Arctic Region \n                (May 2013), which set forth the United States \n                Government's strategic priorities for the Arctic \n                region.\n            (3) According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the \n        Arctic region is warming at double the rate of the rest of the \n        world, opening new routes for ships and development of natural \n        resources throughout the Arctic region.\n            (4) The rapidly warming Arctic region threatens fisheries \n        and wildlife habitat, existing infrastructure and communities \n        throughout Alaska, including increased vulnerability to coastal \n        erosion. Alaska native communities are particularly vulnerable \n        to the changing climate.\n            (5) Given these developments, the United States needs to \n        bolster its infrastructure and assets in the Arctic region to \n        safeguard its strategic interests, defend its national borders, \n        protect the environment, and maintain its scientific and \n        technological leadership.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the President should continue to convene the Arctic \n        Executive Steering Committee established on January 21, 2015, \n        pursuant to Executive Order 13689 (80 Fed. Reg. 6425; relating \n        to enhancing coordination of national efforts in the Arctic); \n        and\n            (2) the United States should ratify the United Nations \n        Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to allow the United \n        States to secure its claim to offshore resources present along \n        the Arctic's extended continental shelf.\n\nSEC. 4.
