FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) This Act is authorized by the United States \n        Constitution under clause 1 of section 8 of article I, relating \n        to the power of the Congress to tax and spend.\n            (2) Should an amendment to the United States Constitution \n        be adopted and ratified by the States setting a lower \n        limitation on outlays than provided in this Act, it is \n        appropriate for Congress to consider legislation immediately \n        modifying maximum outlay amounts in this Act.\n            (3) Total Federal outlays have averaged 20.6 percent of \n        gross domestic product over the past 40 years.\n            (4) Total Federal outlays in fiscal year 2010 were 23.8 \n        percent of gross domestic product.\n            (5) Total Federal outlays in fiscal year 2020 are projected \n        to be 25.9 percent of gross domestic product according to the \n        Congressional Budget Office's Alternative Fiscal Scenario.\n            (6) It is appropriate and necessary to put total Federal \n        outlays under a limitation, as a percent of gross domestic \n        product, such that a downward glide path ultimately brings \n        spending in line with historical norms.\n\nSEC. 3. OUTLAYS EXCEEDING THE GDP OUTLAY LIMIT.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 250(c)(4) of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended by striking paragraph \n(4), redesignating the succeeding paragraphs accordingly, and adding \nthe following paragraphs:\n            ``(19) The term `GDP', for any fiscal year, means the gross \n        domestic product during such fiscal year consistent with \n        Department of Commerce definitions.\n            ``(20)(A) The term `emergency requirement' means any \n        provision that provides new budget authority and resulting \n        outlays for a situation that poses a threat to life, property, \n        or national security and is--\n                    ``(i) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not \n                building up over time;\n                    ``(ii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need \n                requiring immediate action;\n                    ``(iii) unforeseen, unpredictable, and \n                unanticipated; and\n                    ``(iv) not permanent, temporary in nature.\n            ``(B) An emergency that is part of an aggregate level of \n        anticipated emergencies, particularly when normally estimated \n        in advance, is not unforeseen.\n            ``(21) The term `target fiscal year' means the fiscal year \n        in which a GDP outlay limit is in effect under section 253A.''.\n    (b) Caps.--The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n1985 is amended by inserting after section 253 the following:\n\n``SEC. 253A.
