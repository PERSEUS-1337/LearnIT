FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Guam was captured by Japan on December 10, 1941, three \n        days after the attack on Pearl Harbor and remained in the hands \n        of the Japanese until June 1944. Those prisoners who remained \n        on Guam suffered atrocities at the hands of the Japanese or \n        were transported on ``Hell Ships'' to Japanese POW camps.\n            (2) In January 1942 the Japanese took approximately 1,600 \n        prisoners on Wake Island. Approximately 450 military and 1,150 \n        civilians were then transported to POW camps in China and \n        Japan.\n            (3) On April 9, 1942, Major General Edward King surrendered \n        the soldiers from the United States and the Philippines into \n        enemy hands.\n            (4) Over the next week, the soldiers from the United States \n        and the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 \n        miles without any food, water, or medical care in what came to \n        be known as the Bataan Death March.\n            (5) On May 6, 1942, Corregidor fell after a weeklong siege \n        and its defenders were surrendered.\n            (6) On May 10, 1942, American forces under the command of \n        Major General William F. Sharp surrendered after fighting the \n        Japanese from April 29, 1942, to May 9, 1942, on the island of \n        Mindanao in the southernmost portion of the Philippine \n        Archipelago. It was on this date, May 10, 1942, that General \n        Wainwright, as Supreme Allied Commander, surrendered all Allied \n        Forces in the Philippine Archipelago.\n            (7) During this forced march, thousands of soldiers died, \n        either from starvation, lack of medical care, sheer exhaustion, \n        or abuse by their captors.\n            (8) Within the first 40 days at Camp O'Donnell, 1,600 more \n        prisoners from the United States died.\n            (9) The conditions at the camp were substandard, leading to \n        increased disease and malnutrition among the prisoners.\n            (10) In May 1942 the Japanese began transferring POWs by \n        sea. Prisoners were crammed into cargo holds with little air, \n        food or water for journeys that would last for weeks on what \n        were to be known as the ``Hell Ships''. Many died due to \n        asphyxia, starvation, or dysentery. Some prisoners became \n        delirious and unresponsive in an environment of heat, humidity \n        and lack of oxygen, food, and water. More than 3,300 prisoners \n        died at sea while being transported by these ships.\n            (11) On June 6, 1942, the prisoners from the United States \n        were transferred to Cabanatuan, north of Camp O'Donnell.\n            (12) The campus of the University of Santo Tomas was \n        converted to the Santo Tomas Internment Camp by the Japanese \n        during their occupation of the Philippines. Santo Tomas became \n        the initial internment camp for both the army and navy nurses, \n        with the army and navy nurses remaining there until their \n        liberation.\n            (13) The prisoners who remained in the camps suffered from \n        continued mistreatment, malnutrition, lack of medical care, and \n        horrific conditions.\n            (14) The prisoners who remained in these camps were \n        liberated in 1945.\n            (15) Over the subsequent decades, these prisoners formed \n        support groups, were honored in local and State memorials, and \n        told their story to all people of the United States.\n            (16) The people of the United States are forever indebted \n        to these men and women for--\n                    (A) the courage they demonstrated during the first \n                4 months of World War II in fighting against enemy \n                soldiers; and\n                    (B) the perseverance they demonstrated during years \n                of capture, imprisonment, and atrocious conditions, \n                while maintaining dignity, honor, patriotism, and \n                loyalty.\n\nSEC. 2.
