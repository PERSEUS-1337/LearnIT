FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, and \n        thunderstorms can cause significant loss of life, injury, \n        destruction of property, and economic and social disruption. \n        All States and regions are vulnerable to these hazards.\n            (2) The United States currently sustains several billion \n        dollars in economic damages each year due to these windstorms. \n        In recent decades, rapid development and population growth in \n        high-risk areas has greatly increased overall vulnerability to \n        windstorms.\n            (3) Improved windstorm impact reduction measures have the \n        potential to reduce these losses through--\n                    (A) cost-effective and affordable design and \n                construction methods and practices;\n                    (B) effective mitigation programs at the local, \n                State, and national level;\n                    (C) improved data collection and analysis and \n                impact prediction methodologies;\n                    (D) engineering research on improving new \n                structures and retrofitting existing ones to better \n                withstand windstorms, atmospheric-related research to \n                better understand the behavior and impact of windstorms \n                on the built environment, and subsequent application of \n                those research results; and\n                    (E) public education and outreach.\n            (4) There is an appropriate role for the Federal Government \n        in supporting windstorm impact reduction. An effective Federal \n        program in windstorm impact reduction will require interagency \n        coordination, and input from individuals, academia, the private \n        sector, and other interested non-Federal entities.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Director'' means the Director of the Office \n        of Science and Technology Policy.\n            (2) The term ``State'' means each of the States of the \n        United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of \n        Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American \n        Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and \n        any other territory or possession of the United States.\n            (3) The term ``windstorm'' means any storm with a damaging \n        or destructive wind component, such as a hurricane, tropical \n        storm, tornado, or thunderstorm.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL WINDSTORM IMPACT REDUCTION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established the National Windstorm \nImpact Reduction Program (in this Act referred to as the ``Program'').\n    (b) Objective.--The objective of the Program is the achievement of \nmajor measurable reductions in losses of life and property from \nwindstorms. The objective is to be achieved through a coordinated \nFederal effort, in cooperation with other levels of government, \nacademia, and the private sector, aimed at improving the understanding \nof windstorms and their impacts and developing and encouraging \nimplementation of cost-effective mitigation measures to reduce those \nimpacts.\n    (c) Interagency Working Group.--Not later than 90 days after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the Director shall establish an \nInteragency Working Group consisting of representatives of the National \nScience Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, and other Federal agencies as \nappropriate. The Director shall designate an agency to serve as Chair \nof the Working Group and be responsible for the planning, management, \nand coordination of the Program, including budget coordination. \nSpecific agency roles and responsibilities under the Program shall be \ndefined in the implementation plan required under subsection (e). \nGeneral agency responsibilities shall include the following:\n            (1) The National Institute of Standards and Technology \n        shall support research and development to improve building \n        codes and standards and practices for design and construction \n        of buildings, structures, and lifelines.\n            (2) The National Science Foundation shall support research \n        in engineering and the atmospheric sciences to improve the \n        understanding of the behavior of windstorms and their impact on \n        buildings, structures, and lifelines.\n            (3) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n        shall support atmospheric sciences research to improve the \n        understanding of the behavior of windstorms and their impact on \n        buildings, structures, and lifelines.\n            (4) The Federal Emergency Management Agency shall support \n        the development of risk assessment tools and effective \n        mitigation techniques, windstorm-related data collection and \n        analysis, public outreach, information dissemination, and \n        implementation of mitigation measures consistent with the \n        Agency's all-hazards approach.\n    (d) Program Components.--\n            (1) In general.--The Program shall consist of three primary \n        mitigation components: improved understanding of windstorms, \n        windstorm impact assessment, and windstorm impact reduction. \n        The components shall be implemented through activities such as \n        data collection and analysis, risk assessment, outreach, \n        technology transfer, and research and development.

Each such \nreport shall include any recommendations for legislative and other \naction the Interagency Working Group considers necessary and \nappropriate. In developing the biennial report, the Interagency Working \nGroup shall consider the recommendations of the Advisory Committee \nestablished under section 5.\n\nSEC. 5. NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON WINDSTORM IMPACT REDUCTION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Director shall establish a National \nAdvisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction, consisting of not \nless than 11 and not more than 15 non-Federal members representing a \nbroad cross section of interests such as the research, technology \ntransfer, design and construction, and financial communities; materials \nand systems suppliers; State, county, and local governments; the \ninsurance industry; and other representatives as designated by the \nDirector.\n    (b) Assessment.--The Advisory Committee shall assess--\n            (1) trends and developments in the science and engineering \n        of windstorm impact reduction;\n            (2) the effectiveness of the Program in carrying out the \n        activities under section 4(d);\n            (3) the need to revise the Program; and\n            (4) the management, coordination, implementation, and \n        activities of the Program.\n    (c) Biennial Report.--At least once every two years, the Advisory \nCommittee shall report to Congress and the Interagency Working Group on \nthe assessment carried out under subsection (b).\n    (d) Sunset Exemption.--Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee \nAct shall not apply to the Advisory Committee established under this \nsection.\n\nSEC. 6.
