    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Women in Trauma Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Researchers have concluded that women may experience \n        significant adverse mental health consequences relating to \n        trauma exposure, often the result of sexual or domestic \n        violence.\n            (2) The majority of women suffering from both substance \n        abuse and mental health problems have been victims of rape, \n        incest, or physical or emotional abuse and hundreds of \n        thousands of these same women are also severely beaten by their \n        husbands or a significant male intimate. Surveys have indicated \n        that approximately 1,500,000 children are physically abused \n        each year and 700,000 are victims of sexual abuse.\n            (3) Women with serious mental illnesses are over-\n        represented in samples that experienced trauma, including \n        physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Between 50 and 70 \n        percent of women hospitalized for psychiatric disorders have a \n        history of trauma.\n            (4) Even for people whose mental health problems are caused \n        by other factors, a history of early physical or sexual abuse \n        leads to the earlier onset of their illness, a more severe \n        course of illness, and a greater likelihood of suicide and \n        other poor outcomes.\n            (5) Trauma exposure is generally prevalent in people who \n        suffer from mental health and substance abuse problems, and can \n        worsen the course and overall impact of these illnesses.\n            (6) In a recent study, 97 percent of homeless women with \n        mental illness were found to have experienced severe physical \n        or sexual abuse and 87 percent experienced this abuse both as \n        children and as adults.\n            (7) Of women in prisons and jails, 80 to 100 percent have \n        been victims of physical and sexual abuse.\n            (8) The prevalence of violence- and trauma-related problems \n        among women with mental health and substance abuse problems is \n        not adequately addressed by most treatment practices.\n            (9) There is an urgent need to provide services that \n        directly address the issue of trauma for women suffering from \n        mental health and substance abuse problems.\n            (10) To improve mental health and substance abuse services \n        for women, further research to expand the development and \n        implementation of trauma-sensitive services is needed as well \n        as additional services to improve access to comprehensive \n        therapeutic interventions and to the support needed to overcome \n        barriers to recovery.\n\nSEC. 3.
