    "content": "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act ( P.L. 116-136 ) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provides over $2 trillion in relief to individuals; businesses; state, local, and federal agencies; and industry sectors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government-led effort to limit its public health impact. Given the scope of the relief provided, the variety of new and existing programs that are to provide this aid, and the number of individuals and entities receiving aid, the administration of the CARES Act is likely to be a complicated and significant undertaking by executive branch agencies and non-federal partners. These complexities may be made even greater by both pressure to provide relief as swiftly as possible and unique logistical challenges posed by the ongoing public health emergency. All of those factors make Congress's oversight role during the COVID-19 pandemic especially important and may make it more difficult for Congress to conduct timely oversight. Congress included a variety of oversight mechanisms in the CARES Act. In addition to requiring executive branch officers to submit reports on a variety of topics, provide notice before taking specified actions, and testify before certain committees, the CARES Act provides additional resources to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and to Offices of Inspectors General (OIGs) that may have additional audit and investigative activity due to the CARES Act. In addition, the CARES Act creates three new oversight entities: a Congressional Oversight Commission, a Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR), and the Pandemic Recovery Accountability Committee (PRAC, a group of inspectors general). Each of those entities is empowered to provide oversight of significant aspects of the CARES Act.  This report is a reference guide for congressional clients interested in understanding the congressional oversight tools built into the CARES Act. Oversight provisions are broadly organized into sections related to the nature of the oversight mechanism. Within each of these sections, agencies and entities are listed in alphabetical order. To the extent practicable, sections include citations to the CARES Act and to any other relevant laws and regulations. This report identifies selected provisions in the CARES Act that may facilitate Congress's ability to provide oversight of its implementation. Congress's authority to oversee the executive branch extends beyond these explicit requirements and includes many additional tools and requirements. The fact that many provisions of the CARES Act do not have explicit reporting requirements or other more formal oversight mechanisms does not prevent Congress from engaging in oversight activities related to those programs by seeking information from the executive branch, engaging with stakeholders, holding hearings, and using legislation to direct activities with specificity. Requirements on agencies and entities are usually described in this report generally, with minimal discussion of detailed content requirements. The same is true for descriptions of new and altered programs. To the extent practicable, the text and footnotes of the report provide citations to the appropriate provisions of both the CARES Act and existing law to facilitate a more detailed review.  The report captures those oversight tools that pertain to inspectors general (who already have obligations to report to Congress in the Inspector General Act of 1978 ) and provisions that explicitly provide for congressional involvement. For instance, the CARES Act requires certain agencies to make information publicly available but does not explicitly direct that this information be submitted to Congress or its committees. Such provisions are not identified in this report but may nevertheless be referred to in practice as congressional reporting requirements. Provisions included in the CARES Act may trigger reporting of information under other statutes. Interactions between the CARES Act and current law are not covered in this report. The CARES Act contains a number of oversight provisions. These include:  the creation of a congressionally appointed oversight commission established in the legislative branch; provisions related to inspectors general, including the establishment of SIGPR, the PRAC within the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), and supplemental appropriations and additional duties provided for inspectors general across multiple agencies; additional funding and responsibilities provided to GAO; and requirements for agencies and entities and their leadership to provide reports to, consult with, provide notice to, and testify before Congress and its committees regarding a range of subjects. Each aforementioned category is discussed in greater detail below. Section 4020 establishes a legislative branch entity called the Congressional Oversight Commission to conduct oversight of the Department of the Treasury and Federal Reserve Board's economic relief activities under Title IV, Subtitle A (Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020) of the CARES Act. The commission is similar in structure to the Congressional Oversight Panel created to participate in the oversight of the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008.  The commission is composed of five members selected by the majority and minority leadership of the House and the Senate. The commission is empowered to request staff to be detailed from agencies and departments, hire experts and consultants, conduct hearings, and obtain information from agencies to support its oversight activities. The commission is required to report to Congress on the relevant activities of Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board, the impact of the programs on the financial well-being of the nation, whether required disclosures in the CARES Act provides market transparency, and the effectiveness of the Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020 in minimizing costs and maximizing benefits for taxpayers.  The first report of the commission is due within 30 days of Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board's first exercise of authority under the act. Additional reports are then due every 30 days thereafter. The commission terminates on September 30, 2025. Section 4018 establishes a Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery within the Treasury. The SIGPR is nominated by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and may be removed from office according to Section 3(b) of the Inspector General Act of 1978. The SIGPR is tasked with conducting audits and investigations of the activities of the Treasury pursuant to the CARES Act, including the collection of detailed information regarding loans provided by Treasury. The SIGPR is empowered to hire staff and enter into contracts and has broadly the same authority and status as inspectors general under the Inspector General Act of 1978. The SIGPR is required to report to the \"appropriate committees of Congress\" within 60 days of Senate confirmation, and quarterly thereafter, on the activities of the office over the preceding three months, including detailed information on Treasury loan programs. The SIGPR terminates five years after the enactment of the CARES Act (i.e., March 27, 2025). Section 4027 appropriates a total of $500 billion to Treasury. Of that amount, Section 4018 directs that $25 million shall be made available to the SIGPR as no-year funds (i.e., funds that are available until expended). Section 15010 establishes the PRAC within the CIGIE. The PRAC is directed to \"promote transparency and conduct and support oversight\" of the government's coronavirus response in order to \"prevent and detect fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement\" and \"mitigate major risks that cut across program and agency boundaries.\" In addition, the PRAC is tasked with conducting oversight and audits of the coronavirus response as well as coordinating and supporting related oversight by inspectors general across the federal government.  The PRAC is composed of the inspectors general of identified agencies as well as any other inspectors general for agencies involved at the coronavirus response as designated by the chairperson of the council. The CIGIE chairperson designates the PRAC chairperson. In addition, the PRAC is required to appoint an executive director selected in consultation with the majority and minority leadership of the House and the Senate. The PRAC has the same authority to conduct audits and investigations as inspectors general under the Inspector General Act of 1978. The PRAC is required to provide management alerts to the President and Congress on \"management, risk, and funding\" issues that may require immediate attention. The PRAC is also required to report to the President and Congress biannually with a summary of PRAC activity and, to the extent practicable, a quantification of the impact of tax expenditures in the CARES Act. Finally the PRAC is required to provide other reports and periodic updates to Congress as it considers appropriate. In addition, the PRAC is directed to establish and maintain a \"user-friendly, public-facing website to foster greater accountability and transparency in the use of covered funds.\" The PRAC is required to post specified information, including agencies' use of funds provided in the act.  The PRAC terminates on September 30, 2025. Section 15003 appropriates $80 million in no-year funds to support the activities of the PRAC. The PRAC's organization and duties have similarities to those of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board that was established as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to conduct oversight of the use of funds in that act. The CARES Act appropriates $148 million for established inspector general offices in addition to the $25 million for the SIGPR and $80 million for the PRAC discussed above. In total, therefore, the CARES Act provides $253 million to the inspector general community to oversee the federal government's coronavirus response.

Title XIII of Division B, under the heading \"Departmental Management,\" appropriates $15 million to respond to COVID-19 generally and to support enforcement of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act ( P.L. 116-127 ). Of that appropriation, $1 million in no-year funds are to be transferred to the DOL OIG.  Title XII of Division B, under the heading \"Office of Inspector General,\" provides $5 million in no-year funds to the Department of Transportation OIG.

The appropriation may be used only to conduct oversight and recoupment activities related to the Coronavirus Relief Fund established by Title V of the CARES Act. Section 5001 also requires the Treasury OIG to oversee the Coronavirus Relief Fund established by the section, which provides funding to state, local, and tribal governments. If the Treasury OIG determines that a state, tribal government, or unit of local government fails to comply with the requirements for the program, the section provides for the recoupment of the funds.
