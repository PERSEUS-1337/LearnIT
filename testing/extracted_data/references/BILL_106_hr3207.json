FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Superfund Innovative Treatment and Evaluation \n        (SITE) program carried out under the authority of section \n        311(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n        Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 has helped private \n        sector developers to market innovative Superfund clean-up \n        treatment technologies for more than 10 years.\n            (2) Technologies demonstrated and evaluated through the \n        SITE program have been successfully deployed at many Superfund \n        and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act sites, resulting in \n        significant cost savings and faster remediation of those sites.\n            (3) The Environmental Protection Agency's Science Advisory \n        Board has found that SITE program accomplishments have been \n        ``impressive'' and that ``the need for improved technology to \n        prevent, reduce, or remediate environmental contamination \n        remains a national priority''.\n            (4) The University Hazardous Substance Research Centers \n        authorized under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n        Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 have played an \n        important role in conducting basic research, developing \n        innovative clean-up technologies, and providing invaluable \n        technical assistance to communities.\n            (5) The SITE program and related hazardous substance \n        research program should be reauthorized with an emphasis on \n        meeting the emerging technical and scientific challenges \n        presented by the use of remediated sites (including \n        brownfields), developing technologies to address remediation at \n        remaining sites with complex contamination characteristics, and \n        transferring technology and technical capabilities to a wider \n        variety of remediation needs.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) Section 111(n) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9611(n)) is \namended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1) by striking ``1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, \n        1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994'' and inserting ``2000, 2001, 2002, \n        2003, and 2004'';\n            (2) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:\n            ``(2) Section 311(a).--For each of the fiscal years 2000, \n        2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, not more than $35,000,000 of the \n        amounts available in the Fund may be used for the purposes of \n        section 311(a). Not more than 10 percent of such amounts may be \n        used for training under section 311(a) in any fiscal year.''; \n        and\n            (3) in paragraph (3) by striking ``1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, \n        1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994'' and inserting ``2000, 2001, 2002, \n        2003, and 2004''.\n    (b) Section 311(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9660(a)) is amended \nby striking paragraph (6).\n    (c) Section 311(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9660(b) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (4) by striking ``Each such project'' and \n        inserting ``The Administrator may enter into agreements with \n        persons, public entities (including the Department of Defense, \n        the Department of Energy, and other Federal agencies), and \n        nonprofit private entities, to arrange for the use of other \n        sites appropriate for carrying out hazardous substances \n        research, testing, evaluation, development, and demonstration \n        projects.
