FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) cancer is a progressive, degenerative, and often \n        painful disease that afflicts one out of every four persons in \n        the United States and is the second leading cause of death;\n            (2) in the progression of terminal cancer, a significant \n        number of patients experience levels of intense and intractable \n        pain that cannot be effectively treated by presently available \n        medication;\n            (3) the effect of such pain often leads to a severe \n        deterioration in the quality of life of the patient and \n        heartbreak for the family of the patient;\n            (4) the therapeutic use of parenteral diacetylmorphine is \n        not permitted in the United States but extensive clinical \n        research has demonstrated that the drug is a potent, highly \n        soluble painkilling drug when properly formulated and \n        administered under the supervision of a physician;\n            (5) it is in the public interest to make parenteral \n        diacetylmorphine available to patients through controlled \n        channels as a drug for the relief of intractable pain due to \n        terminal cancer;\n            (6) diacetylmorphine is successfully used in Great Britain \n        and other countries for relief of pain due to cancer;\n            (7) the availability of parenteral diacetylmorphine for the \n        limited purposes of controlling intractable pain due to \n        terminal cancer will not adversely affect the abuse of illicit \n        drugs or increase the incidence of pharmacy thefts;\n            (8) the availability of parenteral diacetylmorphine will \n        enhance the ability of physicians to effectively treat and \n        control intractable pain due to terminal cancer; and\n            (9) it is appropriate for the Federal Government to \n        establish a temporary program to permit the use of \n        pharmaceutical dosage forms of parenteral diacetylmorphine for \n        the control of intractable pain due to terminal cancer.\n\nSEC. 3.
