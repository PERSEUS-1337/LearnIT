FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory to the \n        Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n            (2) Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy \n        Agency (IAEA).\n            (3) Iran has agreed to safeguards to ensure compliance with \n        its non-proliferation commitments under the NPT.\n            (4) The IAEA has reported numerous concerns with the \n        implementation of such safeguards to ensure Iran's compliance \n        with its non-proliferation commitments.\n            (5) International inspections in 2003 and 2004 of Iran's \n        nuclear program revealed significant undeclared activities with \n        potential application for the development of nuclear weapons.\n            (6) According to the IAEA, Iran has not declared the full \n        scope of its nuclear program and has not allowed full and \n        unrestricted access to all its nuclear sites.\n            (7) In June 2006, Iran refused to consider economic \n        incentives offered by the five permanent members of the United \n        Nations Security Council (UNSC) and Germany in exchange for a \n        permanent halt to Iran's uranium enrichment program.\n            (8) On July 31, 2006, the UNSC adopted Resolution 1696, \n        setting a deadline of August 31, 2006, for Iran's full, \n        unconditional, and immediate compliance with its obligations \n        under the NPT.\n            (9) Iran is in violation of UNSC Resolution 1696.\n            (10) On March 23, 2007, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \n        Navy seized 15 British marines and sailors on the same day the \n        UNSC considered a new resolution to sanction the Government of \n        Iran for its continued defiance of the UNSC and the IAEA.\n            (11) On March 24, 2007, the UNSC adopted Resolution 1747, \n        imposing further economic sanctions on Iran for its non-\n        compliance with previous UNSC resolutions.\n            (12) Iran is in violation of UNSC Resolution 1747.\n            (13) On May 14, 2007, IAEA Director General Mohammed El-\n        Baradei announced that Iran had overcome its technical \n        difficulties and now possesses the knowledge to enrich uranium \n        to weapons-grade level.\n            (14) On May 20, 2007, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy \n        Organization announced the Iranian nuclear program was moving \n        ahead as scheduled towards its previously stated goal of 50,000 \n        centrifuges running at its Natanz facility.\n            (15) On May 23, 2007, the IAEA reported that Iran not only \n        ignored the UNSC's deadline to stop enriching uranium but \n        markedly expanded its enrichment program.\n            (16) More than 40 percent of Iranian gasoline comes from \n        imports.\n            (17) The Government of Iran is set to impose a daily \n        gasoline ration of three liters for private cars and 15 to 20 \n        liters for taxis.\n            (18) If the supply of gasoline to Iran is restricted, the \n        impact on Iran's economy would be considerable.\n            (19) Diplomatic means present the most effective way to \n        defuse the crisis regarding the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nSEC. 3.
