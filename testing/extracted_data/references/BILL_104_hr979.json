FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In section 1412 of the Department of Defense \n        Authorization Act, 1986 (Public Law 99-145; 50 U.S.C. 1521), \n        Congress required the Secretary of Defense to carry out the \n        destruction of the United States stockpile of lethal chemical \n        agents and munitions. In subsection (c)(1)(A) of that section, \n        Congress required that the Secretary, in carrying out the \n        stockpile elimination, provide for maximum protection for the \n        environment, the general public, and the personnel involved in \n        the destruction of lethal chemical agents and munitions.\n            (2) In order to carry out the statutory requirement to \n        provide maximum protection for the general public while \n        carrying out the destruction of the chemical munitions \n        stockpile, the Secretary of the Army, as executive agent for \n        the chemical munitions stockpile destruction program, \n        established the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness \n        Program (CSEPP) to enhance the capabilities of local \n        communities to respond to an emergency arising from a chemical \n        munitions stockpile site. In furtherance of that emergency \n        preparedness program, the Secretary entered into an agreement \n        with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide Federal \n        emergency response funds and assistance to State and local \n        emergency management agencies for the purpose of that program.\n            (3) The Comptroller General of the United States, in a \n        report to Congress in February 1994 entitled ``Chemical Weapons \n        Stockpile: Army's Emergency Preparedness Program Has Been Slow \n        To Achieve Results'' (GAO NSIAD-94-91), reported the following:\n                    (A) Although the Army has worked for five years and \n                spent about $200,000,000, communities near chemical \n                weapons storage sites are not yet prepared to respond \n                to a chemical emergency.\n                    (B) The Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness \n                Program has experienced delays in acquiring and \n                installing essential equipment, such as warning sirens \n                and automated systems.\n                    (C) Although planning documents for the Chemical \n                Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program identify \n                requirements for installation of warning sirens to \n                alert surrounding communities, for tone alert radios to \n                provide instructions on what protective actions to \n                take, for computer automation to help local officials \n                plan for evacuations, and for sheltering-in-place for \n                persons who, because of their proximity to the chemical \n                weapons storage site, would not have time to evacuate, \n                the communities involved do not yet have the equipment \n                needed to perform these tasks.\n                    (D) Weaknesses in program management have \n                contributed to program delays.\n                    (E) Officials in many of the States and counties \n                visited by investigators of the General Accounting \n                Office for purposes of the Comptroller General's report \n                said that, because of the lack of guidance and \n                standards, they are unable to complete their emergency \n                response plans.\n                    (F) Delays in acquiring and installing warning \n                sirens and tone alert radios have occurred for several \n                reasons, including disputes between some counties and \n                the State or the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n                over the numbers and placement of the sirens.\n                    (G) Although the Federal Emergency Management \n                Agency has administered nearly 70 percent of funds \n                allocated for the Chemical Stockpile Emergency \n                Preparedness Program--$130,000,000 out of a total of \n                $200,000,000--it could not accurately account for how \n                those funds were spent.\n    (b) Conclusion.--In light of the findings in subsection (a), \nCongress is greatly concerned that the funds being provided for the \nChemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program are not being \nallocated to provide the maximum protection for the general public as \nrequired by section 1512(c)(1)(A) of Public Law 99-145.\n\nSEC. 2. REPORT ON EXPENDITURES.\n\n    (a) Report Requirement.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Army shall submit to \nthe Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives and \nthe Committee on Armed Services of the Senate a report on expenditures \nfor the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program since 1986.\n    (b) Accounting Requirement.--The report shall contain a detailed \naccounting of all expenditures related to the Chemical Stockpile \nEmergency Preparedness Program, shown by expenditures for \nadministration, personnel (including those on the State and local \nlevel), travel, contract work, communications, automation, alert and \nnotification devices, and emergency operations centers.\n    (c) Justification.--The report shall include a justification for \nall of the monies expended for the Chemical Stockpile Emergency \nPreparedness Program administration, as well as a detailed plan for \nreducing administrative costs under that program in order to allow more \nmoney to pass to the communities near chemical stockpile sites in \npursuance of the statutory requirement that the Secretary of Defense, \nin carrying out the chemical munitions stockpile destruction program, \nprovide for maximum protection for the general public.\n\nSEC. 3. PLACEMENT OF ADDITIONAL WARNING SIRENS.\n\n    In order to expedite accomplishment of the statutory requirement \nthat the Secretary of Defense, in carrying out the chemical munitions \nstockpile destruction program, provide maximum protection to the \ngeneral public, the Secretary of the Army shall approve immediate \nplacement of a minimum of three additional outdoor sirens in every \ncounty in the United States that is situated within a designated \nImmediate Response Zone (IRZ) and Protective Action Zone (PAZ) covered \nby the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program. Those sirens \nshall be placed within each such county at the discretion of the \ndirector of the county Emergency Management Agency. Funds for the \nsirens shall be provided from funds available for the Chemical \nStockpile Emergency Preparedness Program."
