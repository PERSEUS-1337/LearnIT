PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to encourage States, institutions of \nhigher education, elementary schools, and secondary schools to \nparticipate in programs that--\n            (1) upgrade the status and stature of math and science \n        teaching as a profession by encouraging institutions of higher \n        education to assume greater responsibility for improving math \n        and science teacher education through the establishment of a \n        comprehensive, integrated system of recruiting and advising \n        such teachers;\n            (2) focus on education of math and science teachers as a \n        career-long process that should continuously stimulate \n        teachers' intellectual growth and upgrade teachers' knowledge \n        and skills;\n            (3) bring together elementary school and secondary school \n        math and science teachers with scientists, mathematicians, and \n        engineers to increase teacher content knowledge and improve \n        teaching skills through the use of more sophisticated \n        laboratory space and equipment, computing facilities, \n        libraries, and other resources that colleges and universities \n        are more able to provide; and\n            (4) develop more rigorous mathematics and science curricula \n        that are aligned and intended to prepare students for \n        postsecondary study in mathematics and science.\n\nSEC. 3.
