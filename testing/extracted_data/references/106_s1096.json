FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The central and lower Mississippi Valley region \n        contained the highest population levels and the most complex \n        Native American societies north of Mexico before the arrival of \n        European peoples in the 16th century.\n            (2) In addition, the Mississippi Valley has also hosted \n        Spanish, French, English, and ultimately American societies at \n        different times in the last 450 years.\n            (3) Blytheville, Arkansas, is centrally located in the \n        Mississippi Valley region.\n            (4) Former Eaker Air Force Base, which is located outside \n        of Blytheville, Arkansas, in the central Mississippi Valley \n        region, is the site of 14 archaeological sites associated with \n        Native Americans.\n            (5) Because of its value in illustrating and interpreting \n        the heritage of the United States, the largest of these \n        archaeological sites, was recognized by the National Park \n        Service as a National Historic Landmark in 1996.\n            (6) Another archaeological site outside of Blytheville, \n        Arkansas, the Chickasawba Mound, was placed on the National \n        Register of Historic Places in 1984 because of its historic and \n        archaeological resources.\n            (7) These previous actions by the Department of the \n        Interior recognize that these archaeological sites are likely \n        to benefit, educate, and inspire present and future generations \n        of Americans, but no unified heritage park for the central \n        Mississippi Valley region exists within the National Park \n        Service.\n            (8) Blytheville, Arkansas, also possesses many other \n        regionally and nationally significant natural, seismic, \n        cultural, and recreational resources associated with the \n        heritage of the central Mississippi Valley region.\n            (9) The sites and resources associated with the heritage of \n        the central Mississippi Valley region require recognition \n        through the establishment of a national historical park for the \n        central Mississippi Valley region as a unit of the National \n        Park System.\n            (10) As a result of the closing of Eaker Air Force Base in \n        Blytheville, Arkansas, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and \n        Realignment Act of 1990, Federal land and facilities are \n        readily available for the establishment of a national \n        historical park for the central Mississippi Valley region to \n        protect the archaeological sites located on the former military \n        installation, as well as to preserve, maintain, and interpret \n        the natural, seismic, cultural, and recreational heritage of \n        the central Mississippi Valley region for the benefit, \n        education, and inspiration of present and future generations of \n        Americans.\n\nSEC. 3.
