    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional \nForeign Travel Reform Act of 2010''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 56-year-old Mutual Security Act governs the current \n        procedures and reporting requirements associated with the \n        expending of foreign currencies for foreign travel by members \n        of Congress and their staffs.\n            (2) A recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) \n        memorandum finds that ``there are no requirements regarding the \n        disclosure of international travel by Members of Congress or \n        their staffs that contain records of all international travel \n        that might be taken.''.\n            (3) This memorandum also finds that--\n                    (A) the current travel disclosure requirements \n                ``may be of limited utility'' when trying to assess the \n                amount Congress spends on foreign travel;\n                    (B) some foreign travel disclosures ``. . . \n                identify annual expenditures for an entity, rather than \n                quarterly,'' as is required by the law;\n                    (C) some disclosures contain ``. . . typographical \n                and mathematics errors'';\n                    (D) the current disclosure requirements for \n                Congressional foreign travel ``. . . might raise \n                questions about the accuracy of reported destinations, \n                participants or expenditures''; and\n                    (E) the current reporting requirements for \n                Congressional foreign travel ``. . . may reduce the \n                suitability and reliability'' of the following data: \n                ``number of trips taken, number of congressional \n                travelers, destinations and the number of times a \n                destination was visited, purposes of travel, benefits \n                of travel and the extent of expenditures for \n                congressional travel.''.\n            (4) In April 2010 Roll Call reported that these travel ``. \n        . . accommodations are made by the State Department and billed \n        back to a government account that automatically refills itself \n        and has no spending limit attached.''.\n            (5) In March 2010 the Wall Street Journal reported that \n        while congressional rules require any unused per diem received \n        for congressional travel must be paid back, this rule is rarely \n        followed.\n            (6) The ``Questions and Answers'' section of the Official \n        Foreign Travel Guide for the U.S. Congress advises Members of \n        Congress that they ``. . . may keep any `excess' funds'' from a \n        per diem allowance.\n            (7) The CRS memorandum finds that from the only public \n        available records on Congressional foreign travel, the House of \n        Representatives went from spending $1,557,162 on foreign travel \n        in 1994 to $9,303,709 in 2009, and that the amount the House \n        has spent on travel has nearly doubled since 2006. Furthermore, \n        these amounts do not take into account the use of military \n        aircraft.\n            (8) In June 2010 Roll Call reported that ``Members of \n        Congress routinely fail to report millions of dollars' worth of \n        costs . . . on foreign trips'', and that the ``total spent on \n        foreign travel has skyrocketed in the past decade.''\n\nSEC. 2. REQUIRING CONGRESS TO OBTAIN AND PAY FOR LOCAL CURRENCIES USED \n              TO PROVIDE PER DIEMS TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF CONGRESS \n              ON OFFICIAL FOREIGN TRAVEL.\n\n    (a) Obtaining and Paying for Local Currency Per Diems for Members \nand Employees on Official Foreign Travel.--\n            (1) In general.--The House of Representatives and Senate \n        may obtain local currencies of foreign nations for the purpose \n        of providing a per diem allowance to a Member, officer, or \n        employee of the House of Representatives or Senate who is on \n        official foreign travel, if the individual obtains an \n        authorization under paragraph (2) to receive such an allowance.\n            (2) Authorization described.--An individual wishing to \n        receive a per diem allowance under paragraph (1) shall obtain \n        an authorization--\n                    (A) from the Speaker of the House of \n                Representatives, in the case of a Member, officer, or \n                employee of the House;\n                    (B) from the chairman of a standing or select \n                committee of the House of Representatives, in the case \n                of a member or employee of that committee;\n                    (C) from the President of the Senate, the President \n                pro tempore of the Senate, the majority leader of the \n                Senate, or the minority leader of the Senate, in the \n                case of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate;\n                    (D) from the chairman of a standing, select, or \n                special committee of the Senate, in the case of a \n                member or employee of that committee or of an employee \n                of a member of that committee; and\n                    (E) from the chairman of a joint committee of the \n                Congress, in the case of a member or employee of that \n                committee.\n            (3) Limit on amount.--The amount of local currency provided \n        for the use of an individual under this subsection may not \n        exceed--\n                    (A) the equivalent of $75 per day per person; or\n                    (B) the maximum per diem allowance established \n                under the authority of subchapter I of chapter 57 of \n                title 5, United States Code, for employees of the \n                United States Government while traveling in a foreign \n                country,\n        whichever is greater, exclusive of the actual cost of \n        transportation.\n            (4) Repayment of unused amounts.--Any individual to whom \n        the House of Representatives or the Senate provides a per diem \n        under this subsection shall return to the House of \n        Representatives or the Senate (as the case may be) any per diem \n        provided to the Member or employee which remains unexpended as \n        of the conclusion of the travel.
