FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, each year drug and alcohol related abuse kills more \n        than 120,000 Americans.\n            (2) In 1999, an estimated 14,800,000 Americans were current \n        illicit drug users.\n            (3) States across the country are faced with increasing \n        demands for drug treatment programs.\n            (4) In addition, methamphetamine abuse continues to be on \n        the rise. Methamphetamine abuse accounts for 5.1 percent of all \n        treatment admissions, which was the fourth highest percentage \n        after cocaine, heroin, and marijuana.\n            (5) Current statistics show that methamphetamine use is \n        increasing rapidly especially among the nation's youth.\n            (6) There are 2,700,000 substance abusers in America in \n        need of treatment.\n            (7) This number exceeds the 2,137,100 persons receiving \n        treatment.\n            (8) Recent reports indicate that every additional dollar \n        invested in substance abuse treatment saves taxpayers $7.46 in \n        societal costs.\n            (9) In California, the average cost to taxpayers per \n        inmate, per year, is $23,406 versus $4,300 for a full treatment \n        program.\n            (10) Drugs and alcohol cost taxpayers nearly \n        $276,000,000,000 annually in preventable health care costs, \n        extra law enforcement, auto crashes, crime and lost \n        productivity versus $3,100,000,000 appropriated for substance \n        abuse-related activities in fiscal year 2000.\n            (11) Nationwide, 59 percent of police chiefs believe that \n        drug offenders should be treated rather than incarcerated.\n            (12) Current treatment on demand programs such as those in \n        San Francisco and Baltimore focus on the specific drug abuse \n        needs of the local community and should be encouraged.\n            (13) Many States have developed programs designed to treat \n        non-violent drug offenders and this should be encouraged.\n            (14) Drug treatment prevention programs must be increased \n        in order to effectively address the needs of those actively \n        seeking treatment before they commit a crime.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) assist individuals who voluntarily seek the services of \n        drug abuse treatment programs by providing them with treatment \n        on demand;\n            (2) provide assistance to help eliminate the backlog of \n        individuals on waiting lists to obtain drug treatment for their \n        addictions;\n            (3) enhance public safety by reducing drug-related crimes \n        and preserving jails and prison cells for serious and violent \n        criminal offenders; and\n            (4) assist States in the implementation of alternative drug \n        treatment programs that divert non-violent drug offenders to \n        treatment programs that are more suited for the rehabilitation \n        of drug offenders.\n\nSEC. 4.
