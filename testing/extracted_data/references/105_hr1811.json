    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Columbia River Habitat Protection \nand Recreational Access Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The 51-mile stretch of the Columbia River, known as the \n        ``Hanford Reach'', provides 80 percent of the fall Chinook \n        salmon in the river system, critical habitat for wildlife, a \n        high-quality waterfowl sanctuary, as well as numerous scenic, \n        historic, and recreational opportunities for the public.\n            (2) In 1996 Congress, through Public Law 104-333, \n        prohibited damming, dredging, channeling, or other such \n        activities along the Hanford Reach in order to help preserve \n        and protect the unique environmental benefits of the region.\n            (3) The lands surrounding the Hanford Reach area of the \n        Columbia River, Washington, should be properly managed in order \n        to protect plant, fish, wildlife, cultural, recreational, and \n        scenic resources, while preserving access to these lands.\n            (4) Recognizing the unique and pristine values of the area, \n        local citizens in cooperation with Federal and State \n        authorities have developed a comprehensive protection plan \n        which has enhanced salmon habitat along the Hanford Reach. This \n        plan, known as the Vernita Bar Agreement, has preserved the \n        free flowing, riparian character of the Hanford Reach, and \n        serves as a blueprint for further successful management along \n        the Columbia River.\n            (5) Although dozens of local, State, and Federal \n        environmental protection and management laws and regulations \n        exist for the Hanford Reach, management efforts can be better \n        integrated and can lead to more efficient use of public \n        resources and improved habitat and recreation management.\n            (6) Several of the areas adjacent to the Hanford Reach of \n        the Columbia River, including lands known as the Wahluke Slope, \n        currently owned by the United States, have been extensively \n        studied and reviewed through environmental impact statements \n        and have been declared environmentally sound and certified \n        suitable for conveyance.\n            (7) Inasmuch as Federal financial resources are \n        constrained, joint partnerships among Federal, State, and local \n        entities can provide long-term habitat and wildlife management, \n        maintain recreational opportunities, and develop a responsible \n        and environmentally sound local land use plan for the region.\n            (8) The people and the governments of Benton, Franklin, \n        Grant, and Adams Counties desire to enter into such a \n        partnership with the State of Washington and the United States \n        to ensure the continued protection of plant, fish, wildlife, \n        cultural, recreational, and scenic resources on the lands \n        surrounding the Hanford Reach.\n            (9) Such a cooperative partnership will provide a forum for \n        public input from the entire region and ensure the long-term \n        protection of the river as wild, scenic, and accessible.\n            (10) Congress recommends the formation of a commission, of \n        which a majority of the members of such a commission represent \n        the local entities, to ensure that the above goals are achieved \n        and to maintain maximum involvement by the citizens of Benton, \n        Franklin, Grant, and Adams Counties.\n\nSEC. 3.
