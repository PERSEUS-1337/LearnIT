FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The right of citizens of the United States to vote is a \n        fundamental right.\n            (2) It is the responsibility of the Federal, State, and \n        local governments to ensure that voter registration laws and \n        procedures enhance the participation of eligible citizens as \n        voters.\n            (3) Young adults often fail to participate in the first \n        election for which they are eligible to vote.\n            (4) Young adults are consistently the age group with the \n        lowest voter turnout. According to the Bureau of the Census, in \n        the 2000 general election only 45.4% of 18 to 24 year olds were \n        registered to vote and only 32.3% voted. The statistics for the \n        1998 general election were even more dismal, as 39.2% of such \n        individuals were registered and a mere 16.6% actually went to \n        the polls.\n            (5) One of the reasons for the failure of young adults to \n        vote is that most States require registration prior to the \n        election itself, so that it is too late to establish voter \n        eligibility on Election Day.\n            (6) The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 established \n        that the simultaneous application for voter registration with \n        the application for a motor vehicle driver's license provides \n        the government with an effective mechanism for increasing \n        access to voter registration.\n            (7) While many States allow individuals to get their \n        license before they meet the age requirement for voter \n        registration, few States allow registration at that time if the \n        potential voter has not yet reached the minimum voting age.\n            (8) In order to remove this barrier, increase the \n        effectiveness of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, \n        and ensure that the maximum number of young adults is given the \n        opportunity to register to vote, a procedure should be \n        established to allow young adults who do not yet meet the \n        voting age requirement to nevertheless register to vote at the \n        time they apply for their driver's licenses.\n            (9) Hawaii, Connecticut, Iowa, Florida, Maine, Missouri, \n        and Texas have already implemented successful pre-registration \n        programs which allow individuals to register to vote prior to \n        meeting all of the eligibility requirements for registration.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to increase the effectiveness of the National Voter \n        Registration Act of 1993;\n            (2) to expand the categories of individuals who are given \n        the opportunity to register to vote under the National Voter \n        Registration Act of 1993 to include young adults who do not yet \n        meet the minimum age requirement to vote; and\n            (3) to encourage civic engagement by young adults.\n\nSEC. 3.
