    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Birth Defects \nPrevention Act of 1993''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Birth defects are the leading cause of infant \n        mortality, directly responsible for one out of every five \n        infant deaths.\n            (2) Thousands of the 250,000 infants born with a birth \n        defect annually face a lifetime of chronic disability and \n        illness.\n            (3) Birth defects threaten the lives of infants of all \n        racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, some conditions pose \n        excess risks for certain populations. For example, compared to \n        all infants born in the United States, Hispanic-American \n        infants are more likely to be born with anencephaly spina \n        bifida and other neural tube defects and African-American \n        infants are more likely to be born with sickle-cell anemia.\n            (4) Birth defects can be caused by exposure to \n        environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during \n        pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Prevention efforts are slowed \n        by lack of information about the number and causes of birth \n        defects. Outbreaks of birth defects may go undetected because \n        surveillance and research efforts are underdeveloped and poorly \n        coordinated.\n\nSEC. 2. BIRTH DEFECTS PREVENTION AND RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 317A the following new \nsection:\n\n            ``birth defects prevention and research programs\n\n    ``Sec. 317B.
