Such announcements shall precede expected issuance dates \nby at least 1 year.\n    ``(h) Monitoring.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall monitor the \nownership and trading activity of indexed and nonindexed obligations \nissued under section 3102 or 3103 having the same maturity dates for \npurposes of assuring liquidity and pricing reliability with respect to \nindexed obligations.\n    ``(i) Reports.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this section, and not later than the close of each 2-year \nperiod thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to the \nCongress a report on the program established under this section. No \nreport shall be required under this subsection for any period after the \n10th year after the date of the enactment of this section.''.\n    (b) Procedure.--Subsection (a) of section 3121 of such title 31 is \namended by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (6), by \nredesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph (8), and by inserting after \nparagraph (6) the following new paragraph:\n            ``(7) whether the obligation is to be issued as an indexed \n        obligation; and''.\n    (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for subchapter I of \nchapter 31 of title 31 of such Code is amended by adding at the end \nthereof the following new item:\n\n``3114. Indexed obligations.''.\n    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \napply to fiscal years beginning after the date of the enactment of this \nAct.\n    (e) Taxation.--It is the intent of the Congress that--\n            (1) except for changes to minimize any Federal income tax \n        incentives or disincentives to acquiring indexed obligations as \n        compared to nonindexed obligations, Federal income tax changes \n        which affect nonindexed obligations should apply to the fullest \n        extent feasible to indexed obligations, and\n            (2) there should be symmetrical treatment applied to \n        increases and decreases in the indexed face amount of an \n        indexed obligation such that, for example, if increases in the \n        indexed face amount of an obligation are includible in gross \n        income as ordinary income, decreases in the indexed face amount \n        of an obligation should be allowable as a deduction as an \n        ordinary loss."
