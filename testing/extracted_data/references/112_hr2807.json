SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Lending to \nEntrepreneurs for Growth in Underserved Populations Act of 2011'' or \nthe ``Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Families and small businesses in under-served areas \n        have for generations been unable to access affordable credit.\n            (2) The financial crisis of 2008 only served to exacerbate \n        efforts by entrepreneurs to access capital for the purpose of \n        creating jobs and improving economic outcomes in the community.\n            (3) Small business investments revitalize communities by \n        creating jobs but also contributing to the local tax base, \n        which helps finance investments in schools, hospitals, \n        infrastructure, and public safety.\n            (4) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \n        is well placed to make careful, targeted investments in \n        community development financial institutions for the purposes \n        of improving economic outcomes for underserved families across \n        America.\n            (5) Providing the Community Development Financial \n        Institutions Fund with a robust capital infusion will make \n        efficient use of taxpayer dollars, by leveraging Federal \n        investment for the purpose of small business lending.\n\nSEC. 3. TRANSFER OF FUNDS FROM SMALL BUSINESS LENDING FUND TO THE CDFI \n              FUND.\n\n    (a) Unobligated Funds.--On the date of the expiration of the \ninvestment authority described under section 4109(a) of the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act of 2010, the Secretary shall transfer all unobligated \nfunds in the Small Business Lending Fund to the Community Development \nFinancial Institutions Fund.\n    (b) Proceeds.--Section 4103(b)(3) of the Small Business Jobs Act of \n2010 is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(3) Proceeds transferred to cdfi fund.--All funds \n        received by the Secretary in connection with purchases made \n        pursuant to paragraph (1), including principal, interest \n        payments, dividend payments, and proceeds from the sale of any \n        financial instrument, shall be transferred to the Community \n        Development Financial Institutions Fund.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
