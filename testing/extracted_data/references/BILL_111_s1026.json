FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the defense of freedom, members of the United States \n        Armed Forces are routinely deployed to overseas theaters of \n        combat, assigned to overseas locations, and assigned to ocean-\n        going vessels far from home.\n            (2) As the United States continues to fight the Global War \n        on Terror, the substantial need for overseas service by members \n        of the Armed Forces will continue, as we live in what senior \n        Army leaders have referred to as an ``era of persistent \n        conflict''.\n            (3) The right to vote is one of the most basic and \n        fundamental rights enjoyed by Americans, and one which the \n        members of the Armed Forces bravely defend both at home in the \n        United States and overseas.\n            (4) The decisions of elected officials of the United States \n        Government directly impact the members of the Armed Forces who \n        are often called to deploy or otherwise serve overseas as a \n        result of decisions made by such elected officials.\n            (5) The ability of the members of the Armed Forces to vote \n        while serving overseas has been hampered by numerous factors, \n        including inadequate processes for ensuring their timely \n        receipt of absentee ballots, delivery methods that are \n        typically slow and antiquated, and a myriad of absentee voting \n        procedures that are often confusing and vary among the several \n        States.\n            (6) The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting \n        Act, which requires the States to allow absentee voting for \n        members of the Armed Forces and other specified groups of \n        United States citizens, was intended to protect the voting \n        rights of members of the Armed Forces.\n            (7) The current system of absentee voting for overseas \n        members of the Armed Forces could be greatly improved by \n        decreasing delays in the process, and certain steps by the \n        Department of Defense, including utilization of express mail \n        services for the delivery of completed absentee ballots, would \n        address the major sources of delay.\n\nSEC. 3. PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTION AND DELIVERY OF MARKED ABSENTEE \n              BALLOTS OF ABSENT OVERSEAS UNIFORMED SERVICES VOTERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ff et seq.) is amended by inserting after \nsection 103 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 103A.
