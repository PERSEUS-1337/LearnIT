FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Each year, many of the most talented law school \n        graduates in the United States begin their legal careers as \n        judicial law clerks.\n            (2) The judicial clerkship program has given the judiciary \n        access to a pool of exceptional young lawyers at a relatively \n        low cost.\n            (3) These same lawyers then go on to become leaders of \n        their profession, where they serve a critical role in helping \n        to educate the public about the judiciary and the judicial \n        process.\n            (4) The White House, the administrative agencies of the \n        executive branch, the Administrative Office of the United \n        States Courts, the Federal Judicial Center, and the United \n        States Sentencing Commission all operate analogous programs for \n        talented young professionals at the outset of their careers.\n            (5) Congress is without a similar program.\n            (6) At a time when our Nation faces considerable \n        challenges, Congress and the public would benefit immeasurably \n        from a program, modeled after the judicial clerkship program, \n        that engages the brightest young lawyers in the Nation in the \n        legislative process.\n            (7) Accordingly, the Congress herein creates the Daniel \n        Webster Congressional Clerkship Program, named after one of the \n        most admired and distinguished lawyer-legislators ever to serve \n        in Congress, to improve the business of Congress and increase \n        the understanding of its work by the public.\n\nSEC. 3.
