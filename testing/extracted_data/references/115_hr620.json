To the extent practical, the \nFederal Judicial Center should provide a public comment period on any \nsuch proposal. The goal of the model program shall be to promote access \nquickly and efficiently without the need for costly litigation. The \nmodel program should include an expedited method for determining the \nrelevant facts related to such barriers to access and steps taken \nbefore the commencement of litigation to resolve any issues related to \naccess.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives February 15, 2018.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L.
