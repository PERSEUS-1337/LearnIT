The \nlist shall be compiled on the basis of the information contained in the \nmost recent annual report of the Secretary of State submitted to the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign \nRelations of the Senate under section 116(d) of the Foreign Assistance \nAct of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151n(d)).\n    (b) Prohibition on Transferring Persons.--Any person who is \nimprisoned, detained, or held for transfer to another country by, or is \notherwise in the custody or control of, a department, agency, or \nofficial of the United States Government, or any contractor of any such \ndepartment or agency, may not, regardless of the nationality or \nlocation of that person, be rendered, returned, or otherwise \ntransferred--\n            (1) to a country included on the most recent list submitted \n        under subsection (a), for the purpose of detention, \n        interrogation, trial, or otherwise; or\n            (2) to any other country if there are substantial grounds \n        to believe that the person will be transferred to a country \n        included in the most recent list submitted under subsection \n        (a).\n    (c) Process.--A person may not, regardless of the nationality or \nlocation of the person, be rendered, returned, or otherwise transferred \nby a department, agency, or official of the United States Government, \nor any contractor of any such department or agency, to any country not \notherwise described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b), unless \nthe person has been given an opportunity to challenge the rendering, \nreturn, or transfer in a court in the United States of competent \njurisdiction, on the grounds that the person would, upon such \nrendering, return, or transfer, be in danger of being subjected to \ntorture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.\n    (d) Waivers.--\n            (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State may waive the \n        prohibition contained in subsection (b) with respect to the \n        government of a country if the Secretary certifies to the \n        appropriate congressional committees that--\n                    (A) that government has ended the acts of torture \n                or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment that were the \n                basis for the inclusion of that country on the list; \n                and\n                    (B) there is in place a mechanism that assures the \n                United States in a verifiable manner that a person \n                rendered, returned, or otherwise transferred will not \n                be tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman, or \n                degrading treatment in that country, including, at a \n                minimum, immediate, unfettered, and continuing access, \n                from the point of return, to each such person by an \n                independent humanitarian organization.\n            (2) Assurances insufficient.--Written or verbal assurances \n        made to the United States by the government of a country that \n        persons rendered, returned, or otherwise transferred to the \n        country will not be tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman, or \n        degrading treatment, are not sufficient to meet the \n        requirements of paragraph (1)(B).\n    (e) Treaty-Based Extradition Exemption.--\n            (1) Exemption.--The prohibition contained in subsection (b) \n        shall not be construed to apply to the legal extradition of a \n        person under a bilateral or multilateral extradition treaty if, \n        prior to such extradition, that person has recourse to a court \n        in the United States of competent jurisdiction to challenge the \n        extradition on the basis that there are substantial grounds for \n        believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected \n        to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in the \n        country requesting such extradition.\n            (2) Assurances insufficient.--Written or verbal assurances \n        made to the United States by the government of a country that \n        persons rendered, returned, or otherwise transferred to the \n        country will not be tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman, or \n        degrading treatment, are not a sufficient basis for believing \n        that the person would not be in subjected to torture or cruel, \n        inhuman, or degrading treatment in the country requesting such \n        extradition pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 3.
