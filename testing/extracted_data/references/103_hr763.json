    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) free trade agreements improve the income and prosperity \n        of the citizens of participating countries because open markets \n        increase competition, eliminate inefficiencies, and result in \n        lower costs to manufacturers and consumers;\n            (2) continued economic growth, and the resulting economic \n        and political stability, within the countries of the Pacific \n        Rim is of vital strategic and economic interest to the United \n        States;\n            (3) bilateral disputes between the United States and \n        Pacific Rim countries could be more effectively resolved in the \n        context of mutually agreed-upon disciplines and dispute \n        settlement mechanisms rather than issue-by-issue confrontations \n        under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 or other trade \n        remedy laws; and\n            (4) free trade agreements between the United States and \n        Pacific Rim countries, whose economies are becoming \n        increasingly interdependent, will provide a foundation for \n        enhanced cooperation and will ensure mutually beneficial \n        economic and political relations.\n\nSEC. 2. PRENEGOTIATION CONSULTATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS.\n\n    (a) Preliminary Consultations.--Within 60 days after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, the President shall initiate preliminary \nconsultations with the government of each eligible Pacific Rim country \nto determine the feasibility and desirability of negotiating the \nelimination of tariffs and nontariff barriers (including barriers to \ninvestment, trade in services, and protection of intellectual property \nrights) in the context of a bilateral free trade agreement. If the \npreliminary consultations indicate that the establishment of a free \ntrade area between the United States and the eligible country is \nfeasible and desirable, the President shall request a meeting at the \nministerial level with the government of that country to consider the \nconditions under which formal negotiations regarding a free trade \nagreement could be commenced.\n    (b) Ministerial Meeting Recommendations.--At each ministerial \nmeeting convened pursuant to subsection (a), the President shall \nrecommend the establishment of a council comprised of appropriate \npublic and private sector officials from the respective countries. The \nfunctions of the council are--\n            (1) to review and analyze the aspects of the existing \n        bilateral relationship as they relate to the negotiation of a \n        free trade agreement, including--\n                    (A) trade and investment practices and impediments,\n                    (B) differences in customs laws and procedures,\n                    (C) the harmonization of trade statistics and other \n                economic data, and\n                    (D) the status of bilateral disputes and exchange \n                of information on disputed practices; and\n            (2) within one year after establishment, to issue a report \n        on the overall bilateral relationship and the prospects for a \n        successful negotiation of a free trade agreement that addresses \n        the possible benefits and adverse effects of concluding a free \n        trade agreement and examines which dispute settlement \n        mechanisms would be appropriate to effectively resolve \n        bilateral trade problems.\n    (c) Considerations.--Before entering into formal negotiations under \nsection 1102 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 with \nan eligible Pacific Rim country, the President shall consider whether \nthat country--\n            (1) is a member of, or applicant to, the General Agreement \n        on Tariffs and Trade;\n            (2) has pursued substantive trade liberalization and \n        undertaken structural economic reforms in order to achieve an \n        economy governed by market forces and international trade \n        disciplines;\n            (3) is an active participant in the Uruguay Round of \n        multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the GATT, \n        has demonstrated a commitment to the success of these \n        negotiations, and has pursued goals and objectives consistent \n        with those of the United States; and\n            (4) is a country whose bilateral relationship with the \n        United States will be enhanced by eliminating substantially all \n        tariff and nontariff barriers and structural impediments and \n        will benefit from improved dispute settlement mechanisms.\n    (d) Extension of ``Fast Track'' Procedures With Respect to \nAgreements Entered Into With Eligible Pacific Rim Countries.--\n            (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1102(c)(1) of \n        the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 relating to \n        the expiration of the authority contained in such section on \n        June 1, 1993, the President may enter into bilateral trade \n        agreements with eligible Pacific Rim countries under such \n        section.\n            (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1103(b)(1)(A) \n        of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 relating \n        to the expiration of the authority contained in such section on \n        June 1, 1991, and subject to section 1103(c) of such Act, the \n        provisions of section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 shall apply \n        to any agreement entered into with an eligible Pacific Rim \n        country.\n    (e) Waiver of Negotiation Request by Eligible Pacific Rim \nCountries.--Section 1102(c)(3)(B) of the Omnibus Trade and \nCompetitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2902(c)(3)(B)) does not apply to \ntrade agreements referred to in subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 3. ADDITIONAL NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.\n\n    In addition to the negotiating objectives set forth in section 1101 \nof the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the President \nshall seek to achieve, in negotiations with an eligible Pacific Rim \ncountry to establish a free trade area, substantial progress in--\n            (1) improving the bilateral relationship between the United \n        States and that country by promoting mutual economic benefits \n        through trade expansion, greater economic efficiency, enhanced \n        competition, and common rules governing trade practices;\n            (2) removing, to the greatest extent possible, formal and \n        informal barriers to trade between the parties, particularly in \n        agricultural products and manufactured components in an effort \n        to reduce government subsidies and injurious dumping practices;\n            (3) providing effective mechanisms for the development of \n        rules in nontraditional areas such as services, trade-related \n        investment, and the protection of intellectual property rights;\n            (4) encouraging United States firms to take greater \n        advantage of opportunities in Pacific Rim country markets and \n        to better understand how to compete effectively in those \n        markets; and\n            (5) improving market access in the respective countries as \n        a means of stabilizing the bilateral balance of trade.\n\nSEC. 4. ELIGIBLE PACIFIC RIM COUNTRIES.\n\n    As used in this Act, the term ``eligible Pacific Rim country'' \nmeans Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, \nBrunei, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, or Hong \nKong."
