FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1)(A) Tuberculosis is a great health and economic burden \n        to impoverished nations and a health and security threat to the \n        United States and other industrialized countries.\n            (B) Tuberculosis is one of the greatest infectious causes \n        of death of adults worldwide, killing nearly 2,000,000 people \n        per year--one person every 15 seconds.\n            (2) An estimated 8,000,000 individuals develop active \n        tuberculosis each year.\n            (3) Today, tuberculosis is the leading killer of women of \n        reproductive age and of people who are HIV-positive.\n            (4) Tuberculosis is spreading as a result of inadequate \n        treatment and is a disease that knows no national borders.\n            (5) With over 50 percent of tuberculosis cases in the \n        United States attributable to foreign-born individuals and with \n        the increase in international travel, commerce, and migration, \n        elimination of tuberculosis in the United States depends on \n        efforts to control the disease in developing countries.\n            (6) The threat that tuberculosis poses for Americans \n        derives from the global spread of tuberculosis and the \n        emergence and spread of strains of multi-drug resistant \n        tuberculosis (MDR-TB).\n            (7) Up to 50,000,000 individuals may be infected with \n        multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.\n            (8) In the United States, tuberculosis treatment, normally \n        about $2,000 per patient, increases to as much as $1,000,000 \n        per patient to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and \n        treatment may not even be successful.\n            (9) Without access to treatment, multi-drug resistant \n        tuberculosis is a virtual death sentence.\n            (10) There is a highly effective and inexpensive treatment \n        for standard tuberculosis. Recommended by the World Health \n        Organization (WHO) as the best curative method for \n        tuberculosis, this strategy, known as DOTS (Directly Observed \n        Treatment Short-course), includes low-cost effective diagnosis, \n        treatment, monitoring, and record keeping, as well as a \n        reliable drug supply. A centerpiece of DOTS is observing \n        patients to ensure that they take their medication and complete \n        treatment.\n            (11) DOTS is one of the most cost-effective health \n        interventions available today. A full course of DOTS drugs \n        costs as little as $10 in low-income countries.\n            (12) Proper DOTS treatment is imperative to prevent the \n        development of dangerous multi-drug resistant tuberculosis that \n        arises through improper or incomplete tuberculosis treatment.\n            (13) Building upon the DOTS strategy, DOTS-Plus is a \n        comprehensive tuberculosis management strategy that works as a \n        supplement to the standard DOTS strategy to address areas where \n        there is high prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.\n            (14) The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n        Malaria is an important new global partnership established to \n        combat these 3 infectious diseases that together kill 6,000,000 \n        people a year. Expansion of effective tuberculosis treatment \n        programs constitutes a major component of Global Fund \n        investment, along with integrated efforts to address HIV and \n        tuberculosis in areas of high prevalence.\n            (15) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \n        is actively involved with global tuberculosis control efforts \n        since the global tuberculosis epidemic directly impacts \n        tuberculosis in the United States, and because Congress has \n        strongly urged the CDC each year to increase its involvement \n        with international tuberculosis control efforts.\n            (16) The CDC is assisting countries with a high burden of \n        tuberculosis--\n                    (A) to implement the World Health Organization-\n                recommended control strategies, DOTS and DOTS-Plus;\n                    (B) to identify and treat persons with multi-drug \n                resistant tuberculosis; and\n                    (C) to conduct research to identify new \n                diagnostics, treatments, and interventions to control \n                tuberculosis.\n\nSEC. 3. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE FOR TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND \n              CONTROL.\n\n    (a) Amendment to Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.--Chapter 1 of part \nI of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is \namended by inserting after section 104 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 104A.
