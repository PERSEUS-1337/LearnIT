FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Section 1213 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n        for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105-85; 111 Stat. 1934) \n        requires the Secretary of Commerce to conduct post-shipment \n        verification of each digital computer with a composite \n        theoretical performance of more than 2,000 millions of \n        theoretical operations per second (MTOPS) that is exported from \n        the United States on or after November 18, 1997, to countries \n        specified in section 1213(b) of that Act.\n            (2) Section 1213(b) of that Act identified the countries \n        covered by the post-shipment verification requirement as those \n        countries listed as ``Computer Tier 3'' eligible countries in \n        section 740.7 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \n        as in effect on June 10, 1997. Computer Tier 3 countries are \n        countries that have been identified as countries of concern for \n        national security or proliferation reasons such as Russia, the \n        People's Republic of China, India, Pakistan, and Israel.\n            (3) Section 1213 of that Act also requires the Secretary of \n        Commerce to submit an annual report to congressional committees \n        on the results of post-shipment verifications required by that \n        section during the preceding year.\n            (4) The Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n        Representatives received the first of these reports on January \n        7, 1999. The report identified 390 high-performance computers \n        as having been exported to Computer Tier 3 countries during the \n        period beginning on November 18, 1997, and ending on November \n        17, 1998.\n            (5) The report also identified 286 supercomputer exports \n        covered by the post-shipment verification requirement for which \n        a post-shipment verification was not conducted.\n            (6) The report stated that 190 of the instances where a \n        post-shipment verification was not conducted involved exports \n        to the People's Republic of China. The Secretary of Commerce \n        reported that the People's Republic of China did not allow \n        post-shipment verifications to be conducted.\n            (7) Because post-shipment verifications were not conducted \n        in a number of instances, the United States Government does not \n        know if the computers in question are being used for benign \n        commercial purposes, or for purposes that benefit military or \n        proliferation promoting projects.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL \n              YEAR 1998.\n\n    (a) Annual Report.--Section 1213 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105-85; 111 Stat. \n1934) is amended by striking subsection (c) and inserting the \nfollowing:\n    ``(c) Annual Report.--The Secretary of Commerce shall submit, on \nJanuary 1 of each year, a report to the congressional committees \nspecified in section 1215 on the results of post-shipment verifications \nconducted under this section covering exports carried out during the \npreceding fiscal year. Each such report shall include a list of all the \nitems subject to the post-shipment verifications that were so exported \nand, with respect to each such export, the following:\n            ``(1) The destination country.\n            ``(2) The date of export.\n            ``(3) The intended end use and intended end user.\n            ``(4) The results of the post-shipment verification.''.\n    (b) Moratorium on Exports.--Section 1213 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105-85; 111 Stat. \n1934) is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(e) Moratorium on Export of Supercomputers Until Post-Shipment \nVerifications Have Been Conducted.--\n            ``(1) For exports prior to october 1, 1998.--Until all post \n        shipment verifications required by subsection (a) have been \n        conducted for exports carried out during the period beginning \n        on November 18, 1997, and ending on September 30, 1998, no \n        digital computers with a composite theoretical performance of \n        more than 2,000 MTOPS may be exported or reexported to a \n        country specified in subsection (f).\n            ``(2) For subsequent exports.--Until all post shipment \n        verifications required by subsection (a) have been conducted \n        for exports carried out during the period addressed in each \n        report required by subsection (c), no digital computers with a \n        composite theoretical performance of more than 2,000 MTOPS may \n        be exported or reexported to a country specified in subsection \n        (f).\n    ``(f) Countries Covered by Moratorium.--For the purposes of \nsubsection (e), a country specified in this subsection is a country \nthat has been the recipient of the export of any computer described in \nsubsection (a) for which the post-shipment verification required by \nsubsection (a) has not been conducted.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
