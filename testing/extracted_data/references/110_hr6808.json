FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Violence in the United States may be fueled by \n        interrelated factors such as the media, psychological stress, \n        the role of the school system, gun regulations, and economic \n        characteristics.\n            (2) According to the Department of Justice, there were as \n        many as 1,823,400 serious violent crimes and 419,640 firearm-\n        related incidents in 2005.\n            (3) Teens and young adults experience the highest rates of \n        violent crime.\n            (4) In 2005, approximately 28 percent of public and private \n        school students ages 12-18 reported that they had been bullied \n        at school within the previous 6 months.\n            (5) According to the Department of Justice, the \n        incarceration rate has continuously increased since the 1980s, \n        and prisoners convicted of a violent offense make up over half \n        of the national prison population.\n            (6) According to the Department of Justice, the Federal \n        Government spent $35,400,000,000 on criminal justice in 2005, \n        while local governments spent $103,700,000,000.\n            (7) According to several studies from the American Journal \n        of Economics and Sociology, economic frustration motivates \n        criminal behaviors and inhibits communal deterrence capacities.\n            (8) According to the Department of Labor, the number of \n        unemployed persons has increased from 7,000,000 in June 2007 to \n        8,500,000 in June 2008. Unemployed workers are more likely to \n        be teenagers, young adults, and African Americans.\n            (9) According to a study from the American Academy of \n        Pediatrics (AAP), prolonged exposure to violence in the media \n        can increase acceptance of violence as an appropriate means of \n        solving problems, can glamorize weapons as sources of personal \n        power, and can contribute to aggressive behavior.\n\nSEC. 3.
