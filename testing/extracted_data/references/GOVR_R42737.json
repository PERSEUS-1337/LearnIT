It provides the total dollar values of U.S. arms agreements with its top five purchasers in five specific regions of the world for the periods 2004-2007, 2008-2011, and for 2011. It also reports the total dollar values of U.S. arms deliveries to its top five purchasers in five specific regions for those same years. In addition, the report provides a listing of the total dollar values of U.S. arms agreements with and deliveries to its top 10 purchasers for the periods 2004-2007, 2008-2011, and for 2011. The data are official, unclassified, United States Defense Department figures compiled by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), unless otherwise indicated. The data have been restructured for this report by DSCA from a fiscal year format to a calendar year format. Thus a year in this report covers the period from January 1 to December 31, and not the fiscal year period from October 1 to September 30. The following regional tables ( Tables 1-5 ) provide the total dollar values of all U.S. defense articles and defense services sold to the top five purchasers in each region indicated for the calendar year(s) noted. These values represent the total value of all government-to-government agreements actually concluded between the United States and the foreign purchaser under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program during the calendar year(s) indicated. In Table 6 , the total dollar values of all U.S. defense articles and defense services sold to the top 10 purchasers worldwide are provided for the calendar year period noted. All totals are expressed as current U.S. dollars.  The following regional tables ( Tables 7-11 ) provide the total dollar values of all U.S. defense articles and defense services delivered to the top five purchasers in each region indicated for the calendar year(s) noted for all deliveries under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. These values represent the total value of all government-to-government deliveries actually concluded between the United States and the foreign purchaser under the FMS program during the calendar year(s) indicated. Commercial licensed deliveries totals are excluded, due to concerns regarding the accuracy of existing data. In Table 12 , the total dollar values of all U.S. defense articles and defense services actually delivered to the top 10 purchasers worldwide is provided. The delivery totals are for FMS deliveries concluded for the calendar year(s) noted."
