FINDINGS.\n    The Congress hereby finds as follows:\n        (1) The United States Marshals, the first Federal law \n    enforcement officers in America, were established under section 27 \n    of the Act of Congress entitled ``Chapter XX.--An Act to Establish \n    the Judicial Courts of the United States'' and enacted on September \n    24, 1789 (commonly referred to as the ``Judiciary Act of September \n    24, 1789''), during the 1st Session of the 1st Congress, and signed \n    into law by the 1st President of the United States, George \n    Washington.\n        (2) George Washington had carefully considered the appointments \n    to the Judicial Branch long before the enactment of the Judiciary \n    Act of September 24, 1789, and nominated the first 11 United States \n    Marshals on September 24, and the remaining two Marshals on \n    September 25, 1789. The Senate confirmed all 13 on September 26, \n    1789, 2 days after the Judiciary Act was signed into law.\n        (3) In 1969, by order of the Department of Justice, the United \n    States Marshals Service was created, and achieved Bureau status in \n    1974. The United States Marshals Service has had major significance \n    in the history of the United States, and has directly contributed \n    to the safety and preservation of this Nation, by serving as an \n    instrument of civil authority used by all 3 branches of the United \n    States Government.\n        (4) One of the original 13 United States Marshals, Robert \n    Forsyth of Georgia, a 40-year-old veteran of the Revolutionary War, \n    was the first civilian official of the United States Government, \n    and the first of many United States Marshals and deputies, to be \n    killed in the line of duty when he was shot on January 11, 1794, \n    while trying to serve civil process.\n        (5) The United States Marshals Service Commemorative Coin will \n    be the first commemorative coin to honor the United States Marshals \n    Service.\n        (6) The United States should pay tribute to the Nation's oldest \n    Federal law enforcement agency, the United States Marshals Service, \n    by minting and issuing commemorative coins, as provided in this \n    Act.\n        (7) A commemorative coin will bring national and international \n    attention to the lasting legacy of this Nation's oldest Federal law \n    enforcement agency.\n        (8) The proceeds from a surcharge on the sale of such \n    commemorative coins will assist the financing of national museums \n    and charitable organizations.\nSEC. 3.
