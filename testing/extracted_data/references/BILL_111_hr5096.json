FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Department of Education statistics reveal a lack of \n        diversity among public schoolteachers. During the school year \n        of 2007 through 2008, an estimated 83.1 percent of public \n        schoolteachers were Caucasian, while 7.1 percent were Latino, 7 \n        percent were African-American, and 1.2 percent were Asian. Of \n        all public schoolteachers, 24.1 percent were male and 75.9 \n        percent were female.\n            (2) Some experts believe the lack of diversity can leave \n        students in underrepresented groups without role models to whom \n        they can relate, which may lead to poorer performance in the \n        classroom. Statistics show that students in some \n        underrepresented groups have lower standardized test scores and \n        lower graduation rates.\n            (3) Teacher demographics should better reflect those of the \n        population as a whole, ensuring that students have role models \n        from diverse backgrounds and racial and ethnic groups and of \n        different genders.\n\nSEC. 3. RECRUITMENT, TRAINING, AND RETENTION OF TEACHERS FROM \n              UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new part:\n\n    ``PART E--RECRUITMENT, TRAINING, AND RETENTION OF TEACHERS FROM \n                        UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS\n\n``SEC. 2501.
