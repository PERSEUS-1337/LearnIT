FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in \n        1818 and given the name Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey \n        after his mother Harriet Bailey, Frederick Douglass has been \n        called the father of the civil rights movement.\n            (2) Douglass rose through determination, brilliance, and \n        eloquence to shape the American Nation. He was an abolitionist, \n        human rights and women's rights activist, orator, author, \n        journalist, publisher, and social reformer.\n            (3) Taught basic reading skills by his mistress until she \n        was forced to stop, Douglass continued to teach himself to read \n        and write and taught other slaves to read despite risks \n        including death.\n            (4) During the course of his remarkable life Frederick \n        Douglass escaped from slavery, became internationally renowned \n        for his eloquence in the cause of liberty, and went on to serve \n        the national government in several official capacities.\n            (5) Forced to leave the country to avoid arrest as an \n        escaped slave, he returned to become a staunch advocate of the \n        Union cause and helped recruit African-American troops for the \n        Union Army, including two of his sons, Charles and Lewis \n        Douglass. His personal relationship with Abraham Lincoln helped \n        persuade the President to make emancipation a cause of the \n        Civil War.\n            (6) With the abolition of slavery at the close of the Civil \n        War, Douglass then turned his attention to the full integration \n        of African-Americans into the political and economic life of \n        the United States. Committed to freedom, Douglass dedicated his \n        life to achieving justice for all Americans, in particular \n        African-Americans, women, and minority groups. He envisioned \n        America as an inclusive Nation strengthened by diversity and \n        free of discrimination.\n            (7) Douglass served as an advisor to Presidents. Abraham \n        Lincoln referred to him as the most meritorious man of the \n        nineteenth century. Douglass was appointed to several offices. \n        He served as the United States Marshal of the District of \n        Columbia under Rutherford B. Hayes' administration; President \n        James Garfield appointed Douglass the District of Columbia \n        Recorder of Deeds. In 1889, President Benjamin Harrison \n        appointed Frederick Douglass to be the United States minister \n        to Haiti. He was also appointed by President Grant to serve as \n        Assistant Secretary of the Commission of Inquiry to Santo \n        Domingo.\n            (8) Douglass lived in the District of Columbia for 23 of \n        his 57 years as a free man, and in recognition of his \n        leadership and continuous fight for justice and freedom, his \n        home, Cedar Hill, was established as a National Historic Site \n        in Anacostia, in Southeast Washington, DC.\n            (9) Frederick Douglass was deeply committed to obtaining \n        equal congressional voting and self-government rights for \n        District of Columbia residents and his statue in the United \n        States Capitol is a gift from the almost 650,000 American \n        citizens of the District of Columbia.\n            (10) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of \n        Frederick Douglass, for Douglass dedicated his own life to \n        ensuring freedom and equality for future generations of \n        Americans. This Nation should ensure that his tireless \n        struggle, transformative words, and inclusive vision of \n        humanity continue to inspire and sustain us.\n            (11) The year 2018 marks the bicentennial anniversary of \n        the birth of Frederick Douglass, and a commission should be \n        established to study and recommend to Congress activities that \n        are fitting and proper to celebrate that anniversary in a \n        manner that appropriately honors Frederick Douglass.\n\nSEC. 3.
