FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are roughly 150 million wireless subscribers in \n        the United States, up from approximately 15 million subscribers \n        just a decade ago.\n            (2) Wireless phone service has proven valuable to millions \n        of Americans because of its mobility, and the fact that \n        government policies have expanded opportunities for new \n        carriers to enter the market, offering more choices and ever \n        lower prices for consumers.\n            (3) In addition to the benefits of competition and \n        mobility, subscribers also benefit from the fact that wireless \n        phone numbers have not been publicly available.\n            (4) Up until now, the privacy of wireless subscribers has \n        been safeguarded and thus vastly diminished the likelihood of \n        subscribers receiving unwanted or annoying phone call \n        interruptions on their wireless phones.\n            (5) Moreover, because their wireless contact information, \n        such as their phone number, have never been publicly available \n        in any published directory or from any directory assistance \n        service, subscribers have come to expect that if their phone \n        rings it's likely to be a call from someone to whom they have \n        personally given their number.\n            (6) The wireless industry is poised to begin implementing a \n        directory assistance service so that callers can reach wireless \n        subscribers, including subscribers who have not given such \n        callers their wireless phone number.\n            (7) While some wireless subscribers may find such directory \n        assistance service useful, current subscribers deserve the \n        right to choose whether they want to participate in such a \n        directory.\n            (8) Because wireless users are typically charged for \n        incoming calls, consumers must be afforded the ability to \n        maintain the maximum amount of control over how many calls they \n        may expect to receive and, in particular, control over the \n        disclosure of their wireless phone number.\n            (9) Current wireless subscribers who elect to participate, \n        or new wireless subscribers who decline to be listed, in any \n        new wireless directory assistance service directory, including \n        those subscribers who also elect not to receive forwarded calls \n        from any wireless directory assistance service, should not be \n        charged for exercising such rights.\n            (10) The marketplace has not yet adequately explained an \n        effective plan to protect consumer privacy rights.\n            (11) Congress previously acted to protect the wireless \n        location information of subscribers by enacting prohibitions on \n        the disclosure of such sensitive in formation without the \n        express prior authorization of the subscriber.\n            (12) The public interest would be served by similarly \n        enacting effective and industry-wide privacy protections for \n        consumers with respect to wireless directory assistance \n        service.\n\nSEC. 3. CONSUMER CONTROL OF WIRELESS PHONE NUMBERS.\n\n    Section 332(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n            ``(9) Wireless consumer privacy protection.--\n                    ``(A) Current subscribers.--A provider of \n                commercial mobile services, or any direct or indirect \n                affiliate or agent of such a provider, may not include \n                the wireless telephone number information of any \n                current subscriber in any wireless directory assistance \n                service database unless--\n                            ``(i) the mobile service provider provides \n                        a conspicuous, separate notice to the \n                        subscriber informing the subscriber of the \n                        right not to be listed in any wireless \n                        directory assistance service;
