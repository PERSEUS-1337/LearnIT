    "title": "AB 1823",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) According to the 2016 report of the Public Policy Institute of California entitled California\u2019s Future: Health Care, significant health disparities exist among socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and regional groups in California. African Americans and persons with a high school education or less have significantly lower life expectancies than other groups of people, and individuals in some regions of the state or in particular communities face other significant health obstacles.\n(b) The ability to translate medical findings from research to practice relies largely on having robust patient participation and a diverse participation pool. A low participation rate or a homogenous participant group prevents segments of the population from benefiting from advances achieved through clinical research and creates uncertainties over the applicability of research findings. Diverse patient participation in a clinical trial depends, in part, on whether a participant can afford ancillary costs like transportation, child care, or lodging during the course of his or her participation. A national study in 2015 found that patient households making less than $50,000 annually were almost 30 percent less likely to participate in clinical trials. This disparity threatens one of the most basic ethical underpinnings of clinical research, the requirement that the benefits of research be made available equitably among all eligible individuals.\n(c) California is home to the following 10 National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers that perform cancer clinical trials research:\n(1) University of California, Irvine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n(2) City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n(3) University of California, Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n(4) Salk Institute Cancer Center.\n(5) Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute.\n(6) Stanford Cancer Institute.\n(7) University of California, Davis, Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n(8) University of California, San Diego, Moores Cancer Center.\n(9) University of California, San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n(10) University of Southern California, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n(d) Cancer is the cause of almost one in four deaths in California. It is the second leading cause of death for Californians and the primary cause of death among Californian Asian/Pacific Islanders. A Californian will be diagnosed with cancer approximately every four minutes, and every 10 minutes a Californian will die of cancer. African American Californians in particular face disproportionally higher rates of cancer incidence and mortality compared to other races and ethnicities.\n(e) Addressing barriers faced by medically underserved and underrepresented individuals in cancer and other clinical trials and improving access to survivorship resources and services through partnerships with hospitals, regional and community cancer centers, and nonprofit organizations are some of the strategies recommended by the California Dialogue on Cancer, established in 2002 by California\u2019s Comprehensive Cancer Control Program to reduce the burden of cancer in California.\n(f) According to the National Cancer Institute Cancer Clinical Trials Resource Guide, some of the barriers preventing individuals with cancer or at high risk of developing cancer from participating in clinical trials are direct and indirect financial and personal costs, including travel and child care expenses.\n(g) It is the finding of the Legislature that some corporations, individuals, public and private foundations, health care providers, and other stakeholders are hesitant to contribute to, or accept funds from, programs that are organized to alleviate financial burdens faced by patients who wish to participate in clinical trials and their caregivers, due to concerns that federal regulators would view the payments made from those funds as prohibited inducements for patients to receive the health care services provided during clinical trials.\n(h) It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would establish a program to authorize business, industry, public and private foundations, individuals, and other stakeholders to donate to the program described in this act, as well as to other nonprofit corporations and public charities that specialize in the enrollment, retention, and increased participation of patients in cancer clinical trials.\n(i) It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would establish a program to better enable donors willing to assist clinical research participants that have documented low levels of access to health services or participation in clinical trials, face financial barriers to participation in clinical trials, or have been identified as priorities for health services, to participate in clinical trials by supporting ancillary costs to boost participation rates among the research participant populations, ensure these trials are widely accessible, improve the development of therapies, and enhance innovation. It is the intent of the Legislature that this program eliminate barriers to the participation of all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status, in clinical trials.\nSEC. 2.\nPart 7 (commencing with Section 101990) is added to Division 101 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:\nPART 7.
