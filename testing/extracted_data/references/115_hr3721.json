FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has played a leading role in \n        developing global human rights standards since the inception of \n        the country.\n            (2) The first 10 amendments to the Constitution are among \n        the guiding principles that helped develop the Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights.\n            (3) First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the United States \n        delegation and the United Nations in drafting the Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights.\n            (4) December 10, 2016, marked the 68th anniversary of the \n        adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n            (5) The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the \n        International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \n        and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in \n        1966.\n            (6) The United Kingdom implemented the Slave Trade Act of \n        1807, setting a global precedent towards the eventual \n        abolishment of slavery in the Americas that the United States \n        eventually followed.\n            (7) The world celebrated the 210th anniversary of the \n        abolition of the transatlantic slave trade on May 1, 2017.\n            (8) On January 1, 2017, the United States recognized the \n        154th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.\n            (9) The United States has continuously enacted legislation \n        and ratified amendments to the Constitution to improve the \n        protections of the rights of all persons in the United States, \n        including--\n                    (A) the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, \n                ratified in 1865;\n                    (B) the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (14 Stat. 27);\n                    (C) the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, \n                ratified in 1868;\n                    (D) the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, \n                ratified in 1920;\n                    (E) the Social Security Act of 1935 (42 U.S.C. 301 \n                et seq.);\n                    (F) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n                201 et seq.);\n                    (G) the Housing Act of 1949 (63 Stat. 413);\n                    (H) the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (Public Law 88-38; 77 \n                Stat. 56);\n                    (I) the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-\n                352; 78 Stat. 241);\n                    (J) the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-\n                110; 79 Stat. 437);\n                    (K) the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n                1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.);\n                    (L) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n                1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.);\n                    (M) the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of \n                1987 (42 U.S.C. 11301 et seq.);\n                    (N) the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 \n                (Public Law 100-259; 102 Stat. 28);\n                    (O) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 \n                U.S.C. 12101 et seq.);\n                    (P) the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-\n                166; 105 Stat. 1071);\n                    (Q) the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott \n                King, Cesar E.

Garcia Voting Rights Act \n                Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 (Public Law \n                109-246; 120 Stat. 577); and\n                    (R) the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate \n                Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-84; 123 \n                Stat. 2835).\n            (10) Labor, human, and civil rights standards and \n        protections require constant review and attention.\n            (11) The Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations \n        set forth a 15-year plan to combat poverty, hunger, disease, \n        illiteracy, environmental degradation, and discrimination.\n            (12) The 43rd General Assembly of the Organization of \n        American States adopted the Inter-American Convention against \n        Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance \n        on June 5, 2013.\n            (13) The Global Slavery Index estimates that as many as \n        45,800,000 people around the world were in some form of modern \n        slavery in 2016.\n            (14) The United States supported the adoption of the \n        Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the United Nations \n        General Assembly and has ratified significant international \n        human rights treaties, including the International Convention \n        on the Elimination of Racism and Discrimination (November 20, \n        1994), the International Convention on the Prevention and \n        Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (February 23, 1989), the \n        International Convention against Torture and other Cruel, \n        Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (November 20, \n        1994), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n        Rights (September 8, 1992).\n            (15) The United States has ratified two of the eight \n        fundamental conventions outlined by the International Labor \n        Organization, including the Convention (ILO 105) concerning the \n        abolition of forced labor (September 25, 1992) and the \n        Convention (ILO 182) concerning the prohibition and immediate \n        action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor \n        (December 2, 2000).\n            (16) The United States has also ratified the Optional \n        Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the \n        Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography \n        (January 23, 2003) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention \n        on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in \n        Armed Conflicts (January 23, 2003).\n            (17) The United States signed the Convention on the Rights \n        of Persons with Disabilities on July 30, 2009.\n            (18) The United States is expected to be a regional and \n        global leader in the international civil and human rights \n        movement, including by fighting discrimination, xenophobia, \n        human, labor, and civil rights abuses as a part of both \n        domestic and foreign policy.\n            (19) Throughout United States history, Congress has \n        addressed, debated, and advanced the protection of human rights \n        through legislation relating to taxes and international trade.\n            (20) On May 10, 2007, President George W. Bush negotiated \n        an agreement with the leadership of the 110th Congress, which \n        intended to strengthen labor, environmental, intellectual \n        property, access to medicines, health, investment, government \n        procurement, and port security standards in United States trade \n        agreements.\n            (21) This bipartisan deal, referred to as the ``May 10th \n        Agreement'', made significant progress in recognizing that \n        human, labor, and civil rights must be an integral component of \n        United States trade policy.\n            (22) United States trade policy cannot be static in a \n        changing global economy, and it is critical that United States \n        trade policy proactively advance domestic and global efforts to \n        improve human, civil, and labor rights and conditions.\n            (23) The trade negotiating objectives of the United States \n        should also address current, emerging, and future attempts to \n        undermine or fail to enhance the living, labor, civil, and \n        human rights standards of the United States or its trading \n        partners.\n\nSEC. 3.
