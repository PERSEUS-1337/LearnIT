FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Of the total United States waste-stream of 145 million \n        metric tons per year, paper and related products compose 64 \n        million metric tons, or 40 percent of the total.\n            (2) Ninety percent of old newspaper waste in the United \n        States is not recycled and ends up in the waste-stream.\n            (3) State and local newspaper recycling programs have \n        helped create a growing surplus of old newspaper waste and have \n        helped to bring about a collapse of the market for recycled \n        newsprint.\n            (4) The current glut of old newspaper waste has caused the \n        market for old newspaper waste to decline from a price of $30 \n        per ton to a cost or loss of $10 per ton.\n            (5) The price of new newsprint does not reflect the \n        increasing cost to communities of disposal and landfilling of \n        old newspaper waste. Such cost currently is between $20 and $60 \n        per ton, on average.\n            (6) The cost of recycling old newspaper waste is \n        substantially less than the cost of disposal.\n            (7) The demand for old newspaper waste needs to be \n        increased to provide both an outlet for the rapidly increasing \n        glut of old newspaper waste and stable markets for recyclers to \n        invest in de-inking facilities.\n            (8) A minimum recycling requirement can be used to create a \n        market which accurately reflects the societal costs of old \n        newspaper waste.\n            (9) The creation of an efficient market for recycled \n        newsprint requires that the cost of disposal be included in the \n        cost of unrecycled products.\n            (10) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency requires additional statutory authority to increase \n        recycling of old newspaper waste and to stimulate demand.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS TO RECYCLE NEWSPRINT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 \nU.S.C. 6941 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 4011. NEWSPRINT RECYCLING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    ``(a) General Requirement.--(1) Beginning not later than 18 months \nafter the date of the enactment of the Newsprint Recycling Incentives \nAct, a producer or importer of newsprint each year shall recycle, using \na method described in paragraph (2), an amount of newsprint equal to at \nleast that amount of newsprint determined by--\n            ``(A) multiplying the newsprint produced or imported that \n        year by such person, by\n            ``(B) the recycling percentage established by the \n        Administrator under subsection (b).\n    ``(2) A producer or importer of newsprint may comply with this \nsubsection--\n            ``(A) by recycling, through de-inking, newsprint for \n        purposes of producing recycled newsprint;\n            ``(B) by purchasing recycled newsprint for purposes of \n        combining with shipments of virgin newsprint; or\n            ``(C) by purchasing recycling credits under the recycling \n        credit system established pursuant to subsection (c).\n    ``(b) Recycling Percentage.--The Administrator each year shall \nestablish a recycling percentage for use under subsection (a). The \npercentage applicable during the first year that the requirement \nestablished by subsection (a) is in effect shall be not less than 20 \npercent. For each of the ten years thereafter, the recycling percentage \nshall be an additional 2 percentage points higher than the percentage \nof the previous year.\n    ``(c) Credit System for Recycling Newsprint.--(1) Not later than 18 \nmonths after the date of the enactment of the Newsprint Recycling \nIncentives Act, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations to \nestablish a system under which (A) producers or importers of recycled \nnewsprint may create credits for used newsprint recycling, and (B) \nproducers or importers of newsprint (virgin or recycled) may purchase \nsuch recycling credits from such recyclers, for purposes of complying \nwith subsection (a). The regulations shall include a mechanism or \nmechanisms (including an auction) for any allocation of credits that \nmay be necessary. No person may create such credits, and no producer or \nimporter of newsprint may purchase such credits, except in accordance \nwith this subsection and the regulations promulgated under this \nsubsection.\n    ``(2) At a minimum, the regulations under subsection (c) shall \ninclude the following requirements:\n            ``(A) The producer or importer of recycled newsprint shall \n        maintain records of the receipt of old newsprint and other \n        paper products for de-inking and subsequent recycling. Such \n        records shall be maintained for at least 2 years.\n            ``(B) The producer of recycled newsprint shall notify the \n        Environmental Protection Agency of the producer's capacity to \n        recycle old newsprint. Such notification shall state the \n        overall newsprint capacity and that portion dedicated to de-\n        inking and recycling.\n            ``(C) The importer of recycled newsprint shall notify the \n        United States Customs Service of the amount of newsprint being \n        imported by the importer. Such notice shall be accompanied by a \n        certification verifying the accuracy of the notice. The \n        certification shall be made by the official responsible for \n        negotiating trade agreements of the country from which the \n        importer is shipping newsprint to the United States.\n            ``(D) Producers or importers of newsprint shall maintain \n        records of sales of virgin and recycled newsprint, including \n        quantities and prices of recycled newsprint and sales or other \n        disposition of such recycling credits as may be used to \n        demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section. \n        Such records shall be maintained for at least 2 years.\n            ``(E) Producers and importers of newsprint shall report to \n        the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n        annually and on an interim quarterly basis--\n                    ``(i) the amount of recycled content newsprint \n                produced or imported each year;\n                    ``(ii) the number of credits purchased or otherwise \n                acquired from other producers or importers; and\n                    ``(iii) the number of credits sold or otherwise \n                distributed to other producers or importers.\n    ``(3) The Administrator may include such other requirements in the \nregulations under paragraph (1) with respect to qualifications for \nrecyclers, importers, and producers; methods for auditing compliance \nwith the system; and enforcement of the system; as the Administrator \nconsiders necessary or appropriate for administering the recycling \ncredit system established under this subsection.\n    ``(4) For purposes of this section, the term `recycling credit' \nmeans a legal record of a recycling activity undertaken in accordance \nwith this subsection that represents an amount of newsprint recycled \nthrough de-inking for purposes of complying with this section.\n    ``(d) Reports.--(1) Not later than 6 years after the date of the \nenactment of the Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act, the Administrator \nshall submit to Congress an interim report on the implementation of \nthis section. The report shall include, at a minimum--\n            ``(A) a discussion of the effects of the requirements of \n        this section on the newsprint and newspaper industry and on the \n        environment; and\n            ``(B) an evaluation of the level of the recycling \n        percentage under subsection (b) and recommendations on whether, \n        and at what rate, the percentage should be increased in future \n        years above the percentage applicable under subsection (b).\n    ``(2) Not later than 10 years after such date, the Administrator \nshall submit to Congress a final report on the implementation of this \nsection. The report shall include an updated version of the discussion \nand evaluation required in the interim report, as well as such other \nfindings and recommendations with respect to the implementation of this \nsection as the Administrator considers appropriate.\n    ``(e) Applicability.--This section applies to any person who \nproduces or imports more than 10 tons of newsprint a year.\n    ``(f) Regulations.--The Administrator shall promulgate regulations \nto implement this section not later than 18 months after the date of \nthe enactment of the Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act.
