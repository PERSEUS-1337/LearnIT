FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Prior to 1994 the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the \n        Poultry Products Inspection Act required that imported meat and \n        poultry be subject to the same safety standards as domestically \n        produced meat and poultry.\n            (2) Article 4 of the World Trade Organization's Agreement \n        on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures \n        (``SPS Agreement'')--which was negotiated as part of the \n        Uruguay Round of Trade Agreements--requires that a country \n        permit imports of food if the country determines that the \n        foreign inspection system provides a level of safety equivalent \n        to the country's domestic standards.\n            (3) Congress, when it ratified the SPS Agreement in 1994, \n        amended the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry \n        Products Inspection Act to provide that foreign meat and \n        poultry may be imported into this country if the Secretary of \n        Agriculture determines that the foreign inspection system \n        provides a level of protection equivalent to that achieved \n        under United States requirements.\n            (4) The Secretary of Agriculture then determined that those \n        countries which had been permitted to export meat and poultry \n        to the United States prior to 1994 had an equivalent inspection \n        system because prior to 1994 their inspection system was the \n        same as that used in the United States.\n            (5) In July 1996 the United States Department of \n        Agriculture issued its final regulations for a new system of \n        meat and poultry inspection called the Hazard Analysis and \n        Critical Control Point (``HACCP'') program. This new program \n        was designed to improve the safety of meat and poultry and for \n        domestic plants was implemented in phases: on January 27, 1997, \n        all domestic meat and poultry slaughter and process plants had \n        to have in place standard operating procedures for sanitation, \n        and the slaughter plants had to begin testing for generic E. \n        coli; beginning January 26, 1998, domestic meat and poultry \n        plants employing at least 500 persons had to establish the \n        entire HACCP system and meet performance standards for \n        salmonella, with government inspectors taking samples and those \n        samples being analyzed for salmonella in government \n        laboratories, beginning January 25, 1999, small domestic plants \n        had to implement the rest of the HACCP system.\n            (6) In the summer of 1996 the Department of Agriculture \n        asked foreign governments to supply sufficient information so \n        that it could determine whether their inspection system is \n        equivalent to the new HACCP requirements.\n            (7) In 1999 the Department of Agriculture is continuing to \n        allow imports of meat and poultry from 32 countries even though \n        it has admitted it does not yet have enough information from \n        any of these foreign countries to determine whether its \n        inspection system is actually equivalent to the new HACCP \n        salmonella testing requirements that large domestic plants have \n        had to comply with since January 26, 1998, and small plants \n        have had to comply with since January 25, 1999.\n            (8) The Department of Agriculture publishes a quarterly \n        report, which it puts on its website, which lists all the \n        domestic plants that are not in compliance with the HACCP \n        program; however, the Department of Agriculture does not \n        publicly reveal any foreign firm that it believes is not in \n        compliance even though the Department of Agriculture officials \n        conduct audits of foreign meat and poultry plants.\n            (9) At the United States border the Department of \n        Agriculture takes a ``random'' sample of about 20 percent of \n        all foreign meat and poultry, and its public quarterly report \n        shows the amount of imported meat and poultry refused entry at \n        the United States border by the Department's inspectors. The \n        public report does not, however, give the rejection rate by \n        country of origin.\n            (10) United States consumers have a right to be informed \n        about the safety of imported meat and poultry from specific \n        countries.\n\nSEC. 3. END OF GRACE PERIOD FOR IMPORTED MEAT AND POULTRY.\n\n    (a) Federal Meat Inspection Act.--Section 20 of the Federal Meat \nInspection Act (21 U.S.C. 620) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(i)(1) The Secretary shall ban all imports of carcasses of meat \nor meat products from any country for which the Secretary has not yet \ndetermined, based on information supplied by the exporting country, \nthat the foreign inspection system actually provides at least the same \nlevel of sanitary or phytosanitary protection achieved under United \nStates requirements with regard to all inspection, building \nconstruction standards, and all other provisions of this Act and \nregulations issued under this Act (including the requirement that \nsalmonella samples be taken by government officials and analyzed in \ngovernment laboratories). This ban shall take effect within 6 months of \npassage of this Act for those standards and regulations in effect on \nthe date of passage of this Act and within 1 year for those standards \nand regulations issued after passage of this Act.\n    ``(2) The Secretary may extend once for a period not to exceed 1 \nyear the date upon which the ban in paragraph (1) shall take effect if \nthe Secretary determines that this extension poses no risk to the \nhealth of the public. The Secretary shall transmit to Congress and \npublish in the Federal Register at least 60 days prior to the \nSecretary's final decision all reasons for the Secretary's proposed \ndecision to extend the date. The Secretary shall not make a final \ndecision on this extension without taking into account the comments \nreceived.''.\n    (b) Poultry Products Inspection Act.--Section 17 of the Poultry \nProducts Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 466) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n    ``(e)(1) The Secretary shall ban all imports of poultry or parts or \nproducts of poultry from any country for which the Secretary has not \nyet determined, based on information supplied by the exporting country, \nthat the foreign inspection system actually provides at least the same \nlevel of sanitary or phytosanitary protection achieved under United \nStates requirements with regard to all inspection, building \nconstruction standards, and all other provisions of this Act and \nregulations issued under this Act (including the requirement that \nsalmonella samples be taken by government officials and inspected in \ngovernment laboratories). This ban shall take effect within 6 months of \npassage of this Act for those standards and regulations in effect on \nthe date of passage of this Act and within 1 year for those standards \nand regulations issued after passage of this Act.\n    ``(2) The Secretary may extend once for a period not to exceed 1 \nyear the date upon which the ban in paragraph (1) shall take effect if \nthe Secretary determines that this extension poses no risk to the \nhealth of the public. The Secretary shall transmit to Congress and \npublish in the Federal Register at least 60 days prior to the \nSecretary's final decision all reasons for the Secretary's proposed \ndecision to extend the date. The Secretary shall not make a final \ndecision on this extension without taking into account the comments \nreceived.''.\n\nSEC. 4. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DECISIONS ON EQUIVALENCY.\n\n    In any determination by the Secretary of Agriculture--whether or \nnot it is promulgated as a rule--under either section 20 of the Federal \nMeat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 620) or section 17 of the Poultry \nProducts Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 466) on whether an inspection system \nof any foreign country actually provides at least the same level of \nsanitary or phytosanitary protection achieved under United States \nrequirements with regard to all inspection, building construction \nstandards, and regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture, the \nSecretary shall, at least 90 days before the Secretary's final \ndetermination--\n            (1) publish a notice in the Federal Register that \n        identifies the basis for that proposed determination; and\n            (2) make available for public inspection the entire \n        justification provided by the foreign government to the \n        Secretary (translated into English if not originally in \n        English), along with the scientific analysis of that \n        information that was conducted by the Secretary.\nThe Secretary shall provide opportunity for the public to comment on \nthe proposed determination and shall not issue a final determination \nwithout taking into account the comments received.\n\nSEC. 5. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ON SAFETY OF IMPORTED MEAT AND \n              POULTRY.\n\n    Every 3 months the Secretary of Agriculture shall publish in the \nFederal Register--\n            (1) the name and location of any plant exporting meat or \n        poultry to the United States that the Secretary believes is not \n        in complete compliance with a foreign inspection system that \n        the Secretary has determined provides a level of sanitary or \n        phytosanitary protection at least equal to that provided in the \n        United States; and\n            (2) the rejection rate by country of origin of foreign meat \n        and poultry inspected by the Secretary at the United States \n        border."
