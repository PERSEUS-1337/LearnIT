FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Bonner Plan, as reflected in the terms of this Act, \n        is an appropriate response to the need to improve procedures to \n        preclude unauthorized employment of aliens and prevent the \n        entry of terrorists into the United States.\n            (2) The economic disparity between the United States and \n        other countries is a prime factor in the desire of foreign \n        nationals to enter the United States illegally.\n            (3) Federal law prohibits the employment of such illegal \n        immigrants in the United States.\n            (4) Nonetheless, illegal immigrants routinely find \n        employment within the United States.\n            (5) Such employment of illegal immigrants undermines our \n        system of lawful immigration and has a negative impact on job \n        opportunities for American workers.\n            (6) Employers in the United States currently have \n        difficulty establishing the veracity of the identity documents \n        of prospective employees in order to verify their work \n        eligibility.\n            (7) Pilot programs undertaken by the Federal Government \n        demonstrate that a nationwide employment verification system is \n        feasible.\n            (8) Social Security cards are routinely required to be \n        presented to employers by new employees.\n            (9) Social Security cards remain vulnerable to \n        counterfeiting and fraud.\n            (10) Social Security cards with improved defenses against \n        fraudulent use would serve as the best vehicle by which to \n        determine employment eligibility.\n            (11) The Social Security card should not become a national \n        identification card.\n\nSEC. 3.
