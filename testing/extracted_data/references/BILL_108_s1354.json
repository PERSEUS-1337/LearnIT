FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) Cape Fox Corporation (Cape Fox) is an Alaska Native \n        Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n        Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) for the \n        Native Village of Saxman.\n            (2) As with other ANCSA village corporations in Southeast \n        Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under \n        section 16 of ANCSA.\n            (3) Except for Cape Fox, all other Southeast Alaska ANCSA \n        village corporations were restricted from selecting within two \n        miles of a home rule city.\n            (4) To protect the watersheds in the vicinity of Ketchikan, \n        Cape Fox was restricted from selecting lands within six miles \n        from the boundary of the home rule City of Ketchikan under \n        section 22(1) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. 1621(1)).\n            (5) The six mile restriction damaged Cape Fox by precluding \n        the corporation from selecting valuable timber lands, \n        industrial sites, and other commercial property, not only in \n        its core township but in surrounding lands far removed from \n        Ketchikan and its watershed.\n            (6) As a result of the 6 mile restriction, only the remote \n        mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core township, which \n        is nonproductive and of no known economic value, was available \n        for selection by the corporation. Selection of this parcel was, \n        however, mandated by section 16(b) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. \n        1615(b)).\n            (7) Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the \n        fact that the Annette Island Indian Reservation is within its \n        selection area, and those lands were unavailable for ANCSA \n        selection. Cape Fox is the only ANCSA village corporation \n        affected by this restriction.\n            (8) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n        land under ANCSA requires adjustment of Sealaska Corporation's \n        (Sealaska) selections and conveyances to avoid creation of \n        additional split estate between National Forest System surface \n        lands and Sealaska subsurface lands.\n            (9) Sealaska is the Alaska native regional corporation for \n        Southeast Alaska, organized under the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).\n            (10) There is an additional need to resolve existing areas \n        of Sealaska/Tongass split estate, in which Sealaska holds title \n        or conveyance rights to several thousand acres of subsurface \n        lands that encumber management of Tongass National Forest \n        surface lands.\n            (11) The Tongass National Forest lands identified in this \n        Act for selection by and conveyance to Cape Fox and Sealaska, \n        subject to valid existing rights, provide a means to resolve \n        some of the Cape Fox and Sealaska ANCSA land entitlement issues \n        without significantly affecting Tongass National Forest \n        resources, uses or values.\n            (12) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n        land under ANCSA through the provisions of this Act, and the \n        related adjustment of Sealaska's selections and conveyances \n        hereunder, are in accordance with the purposes of ANCSA and \n        otherwise in the public interest.\n\nSEC. 3. WAIVER OF CORE TOWNSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN LANDS.\n\n    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16(b) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. \n1615(b)), Cape Fox shall not be required to select or receive \nconveyance of approximately 160 acres of Federal unconveyed lands \nwithin Section 1, T. 75 S., R. 91 E., C.R.M.\n\nSEC. 4. SELECTION OUTSIDE EXTERIOR SELECTION BOUNDARY.\n\n    (a) Selection and Conveyance of Surface Estate.--In addition to \nlands made available for selection under ANCSA, within 24 months after \nthe date of enactment of this Act, Cape Fox may select, and, upon \nreceiving written notice of such selection, the Secretary of the \nInterior shall convey approximately 99 acres of the surface estate of \nTongass National Forest lands outside Cape Fox's current exterior \nselection boundary, specifically that parcel described as follows:\n            (1) T. 73 S., R. 90 E., C.R.M.\n            (2) Section 33: SW portion of SE\\1/4\\: 38 acres.\n            (3) Section 33: NW portion of SE\\1/4\\: 13 acres.\n            (4) Section 33: SE\\1/4\\ of SE\\1/4\\: 40 acres.\n            (5) Section 33: SE\\1/4\\ of SW\\1/4\\: 8 acres.\n    (b) Conveyance of Subsurface Estate.--Upon conveyance to Cape Fox \nof the surface estate to the lands identified in subsection (a), the \nSecretary of the Interior shall convey to Sealaska the subsurface \nestate to the lands.\n    (c) Timing.--The Secretary of the Interior shall complete the \ninterim conveyances to Cape Fox and Sealaska under this section within \n180 days after the Secretary of the Interior receives notice of the \nCape Fox selection under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5.
