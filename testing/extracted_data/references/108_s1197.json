    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Assurance of Radiologic \nExcellence Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 300,000,000 medical imaging examinations and \n        radiation therapy treatments are administered annually in the \n        United States.\n            (2) Seven out of every 10 Americans undergo a medical \n        imaging examination or radiation therapy treatment every year \n        in the United States.\n            (3) The administration of medical imaging examinations and \n        radiation therapy treatments and the effect on individuals of \n        such procedures have a substantial and direct effect upon \n        public health and safety and upon interstate commerce.\n            (4) It is in the interest of public health and safety to \n        minimize unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to radiation due \n        to the performance of medical imaging and radiation therapy \n        procedures by personnel lacking appropriate education and \n        credentials.\n            (5) It is in the interest of public health and safety to \n        have a continuing supply of adequately educated persons and \n        appropriate accreditation and certification programs \n        administered by State governments.\n            (6) Persons who perform or plan medical imaging or \n        radiation therapy, including those employed at Federal \n        facilities or reimbursed by Federal health programs, should be \n        required to demonstrate competence by reason of education, \n        training, and experience.\n            (7) The protection of public health and safety from \n        unnecessary or inappropriate medical imaging and radiation \n        therapy procedures and the assurance of efficacious procedures \n        are the responsibilities of both the State and the Federal \n        Governments.\n            (8) Facilities that conduct medical imaging or radiation \n        therapy engage in and affect interstate commerce. Patients \n        travel regularly across State lines to receive medical imaging \n        services or radiation therapy. Facilities that conduct medical \n        imaging or radiation therapy engage technicians, physicians, \n        and other staff in an interstate market, and purchase medical \n        and other supplies in an interstate market.\n            (9) In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient \n        Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) \n        which established minimum Federal standards for the \n        accreditation of education programs for persons who perform or \n        plan medical imaging examinations and radiation therapy \n        treatments and for the certification of such persons. The Act \n        also provided the States with a model State law for the \n        licensing of such persons.\n            (10) Twenty-two years after the enactment of the Consumer-\n        Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981--\n                    (A) 13 States do not require licensure of any kind \n                for persons who perform or plan medical imaging \n                examinations and radiation therapy treatments;\n                    (B) 37 States license, regulate, or register \n                radiographers;\n                    (C) 28 States license radiation therapists;\n                    (D) 22 States license nuclear medicine \n                technologists;\n                    (E) 8 States license or require board certification \n                of medical physicists; and\n                    (F) no States regulate or license medical \n                dosimetrists.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure the accreditation of education programs for, \n        and the licensure or certification of, persons who perform, \n        plan, evaluate, or verify patient dose for medical imaging \n        examinations and radiation therapy treatments; and\n            (2) to ensure the safety and accuracy of medical imaging \n        examinations and radiation therapy treatments.\n\nSEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY.\n\n    Part F of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n           ``Subpart 4--Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy\n\n``SEC. 355.
