FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) the number of privately held handguns has more than \n        doubled--from 33,000,000 in 1973 to more than 70,000,000 \n        today--in the past two decades alone, and the number of \n        handguns in circulation continues to increase by 2,000,000 \n        handguns each year;\n            (2) handguns play a major role, disproportionate to their \n        number in comparison with rifles and shotguns, in violent \n        crime, intentional and accidental death, and intentional and \n        accidental injury;\n            (3) while the number of homicides committed with long guns \n        has remained relatively stable, the number of handgun homicides \n        has set new records every year since 1987, matching pace with \n        the skyrocketing national homicide rate;\n            (4) the number of handgun-related incidents in elementary \n        and secondary schools has increased sharply, with significant \n        numbers of schoolchildren in rural and urban areas reporting \n        easy access to and frequent carrying to school of handguns; and \n        the presence of handguns in school not only provokes worry \n        among parents and children but also causes much needed school \n        funds to be diverted for purchase of security equipment;\n            (5) handgun violence places considerable strain on the \n        national health care system and is a major contributor to its \n        escalating costs, with at least $4,000,000,000 being spent \n        annually on emergency care, hospitalization, follow-up care, \n        rehabilitation, and medication;\n            (6) handguns kept in the home are of less value than is \n        commonly thought in defending against intruders, and they are \n        far more likely to increase significantly the danger of a \n        handgun fatality or injury to the inhabitants (including \n        children) than to enhance their personal safety;\n            (7) violent crime and injury committed with handguns \n        constitute a burden upon and interfere with interstate and \n        foreign commerce, and threaten the domestic tranquility of the \n        Nation; and\n            (8) current Federal firearms policy is wholly inadequate to \n        counteract the social, economic, and financial costs exacted by \n        handguns to our society.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT OF TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n    Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by--\n                    (A) redesignating the text of the chapter as \n                subchapter A;\n                    (B) inserting after the chapter heading the \n                following:\n\n``Subchapter\n``A.
