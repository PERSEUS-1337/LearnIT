FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) fire and land management policies have contributed to \n        the increasing severity and intensity of wildfires over the \n        past few decades;\n            (2) a large proportion of Federal forest land is in a \n        condition of serious degradation because of trees that are--\n                    (A) diseased; or\n                    (B) dying because of--\n                            (i) insect infestation;\n                            (ii) invasive plant species; or\n                            (iii) other natural disasters (including \n                        blowdowns and wildfires);\n            (3) the drought conditions of 2002 are exacerbating the \n        conditions on Federal forest land, making the Federal forest \n        land particularly susceptible to an increased threat of \n        wildfires;\n            (4) in addition to threatening Federal forest land, \n        wildfires threaten thousands of communities that are located on \n        the border or within the boundaries of the Federal forest land;\n            (5) the 2000 and 2002 fire seasons demonstrate the \n        devastation that is possible if emergency action is not taken \n        to reduce the increased threat of wildfire from diseased and \n        dying trees;\n            (6) the combination of drought and diseased and dying trees \n        creates even more dangerous conditions under which--\n                    (A) the severity of wildfires increases; and\n                    (B) wildfires pose a greater threat to public \n                health and safety; and\n            (7) it is critically important that the heads of Federal \n        agencies responsible for managing Federal forest land have the \n        authority to declare as emergency mitigation areas any Federal \n        forest land that has a dangerous buildup of dead or dying trees \n        because of disease, insect infestation, invasive plant species, \n        or other natural disasters, for the purposes of--\n                    (A) reducing the threat of wildfires; and\n                    (B) protecting Federal forest land and the \n                communities located near or adjacent to the Federal \n                forest land.\n\nSEC. 3.
