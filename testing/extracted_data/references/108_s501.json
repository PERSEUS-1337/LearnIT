GRANT PROGRAM FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Gifted and \nTalented Students Education Act of 2003''.\n    (b) Amendment.--Subpart 6 of part D of title V of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7253 et seq.) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n\n      ``Chapter B--Grant Program For Gifted and Talented Students\n\n``SEC. 5467. FINDINGS; ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM; AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) Gifted and talented students give evidence of high \n        performance capability in specific academic fields, or in areas \n        such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership \n        capacity, and require services or activities not ordinarily \n        provided by a school in order to fully develop such \n        capabilities. Gifted and talented students are from all \n        cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic \n        groups. Some such students have disabilities and for some, \n        English is not their first language. Many students from such \n        diverse backgrounds have been historically underrepresented in \n        gifted education programs.\n            ``(2) Elementary school students who are gifted and \n        talented have already mastered 35 to 50 percent of the material \n        covered in a school year in several subject areas before the \n        school year begins.\n            ``(3) Elementary school and secondary school teachers have \n        students in their classrooms with a wide variety of traits, \n        characteristics, and needs. Most teachers receive some training \n        to meet the needs of these students, such as students with \n        limited English proficiency, students with disabilities, and \n        students from diverse cultural and racial backgrounds. However, \n        most teachers do not receive training on meeting the needs of \n        students who are gifted and talented.\n            ``(4) While the families or communities of some gifted \n        students can provide private programs with appropriately \n        trained staff to supplement public educational offerings, most \n        high-ability students, especially those from inner cities, \n        rural communities, or low-income families, must rely on the \n        services and personnel provided by public schools. Therefore, \n        gifted education programs, provided by qualified professionals \n        in the public schools, are needed to provide equal educational \n        opportunities.\n            ``(5) Parents and families are essential partners to \n        schools in developing appropriate educational services for \n        gifted and talented students. They need access to information, \n        research, and support regarding the characteristics of gifted \n        children and their educational, and social and emotional needs, \n        as well as information on available strategies and resources \n        for education in State and local communities.\n            ``(6) There currently is no Federal requirement to identify \n        or serve the Nation's approximately 3,000,000 gifted and \n        talented students.\n            ``(7) While some States and local educational agencies \n        allocate resources to educate gifted and talented students, \n        others do not. Additionally, State laws, and State and local \n        funding, identification, and accountability mechanisms vary \n        widely, resulting in a vast disparity of services for this \n        special-needs population.\n            ``(8) To meet the future economic and national security \n        needs of the United States, it is important that more students \n        achieve to higher levels, and that highly capable students \n        receive an education that prepares them to perform the most \n        highly innovative and creative work that is necessary to secure \n        our Nation's position in the world.\n            ``(9) The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in \n        the United States on the Third International Mathematics and \n        Science Study (TIMSS) was among the lowest in the world. In \n        each of 5 physics content areas in the study and in each of 3 \n        mathematics content areas in the study, the performance of \n        physics and advanced mathematics students in the United States \n        was among the lowest of the participating countries.\n            ``(10) In 1990, fewer than 2 cents out of every $100 spent \n        on elementary and secondary education in the United States was \n        devoted to providing challenging programming for the Nation's \n        gifted and talented students.\n    ``(b) Program Authorized.--\n            ``(1) Competitive grants to states.--If the amount \n        appropriated under section 5468 for a fiscal year is greater \n        than $7,500,000 but less than $57,500,000, then the Secretary \n        may use such amount to award grants, on a competitive basis, to \n        State educational agencies to enable the State educational \n        agencies to award grants to local educational agencies under \n        section 5467C for developing or expanding gifted and talented \n        education programs, and providing direct educational services \n        and materials.\n            ``(2) Formula grants to states.--If the amount appropriated \n        under section 5468 for a fiscal year equals or exceeds \n        $57,500,000, then the Secretary may use such amount to award \n        grants to State educational agencies, from allotments under \n        section 5467B, to enable the State educational agencies to \n        award grants to local educational agencies under section 5467C \n        for developing or expanding gifted and talented education \n        programs, and providing direct educational services and \n        materials.\n    ``(c) Authorized Activities.--Grant funds provided under this \nchapter shall be used to carry out 1 or more of the following \nactivities:\n            ``(1) Any activity described in paragraph (2), (4), (6), or \n        (7) of section 5464(b).\n            ``(2) Providing direct educational services and materials \n        to gifted and talented students, which may include curriculum \n        compacting, modified or adapted curriculum, acceleration, \n        independent study, and dual enrollment.\n    ``(d) Limitations on Use of Funds.--\n            ``(1) Course work provided through emerging technologies.--\n        Grant funds provided under this chapter that are used for \n        activities described in section 5464(b)(7) may include \n        development of curriculum packages, compensation of distance-\n        learning educators, or other relevant activities, but grant \n        funds provided under this chapter may not be used for the \n        purchase or upgrading of technological hardware.\n            ``(2) State use of funds.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--A State educational agency \n                receiving a grant under this chapter may not use more \n                than 10 percent of the grant funds for--\n                            ``(i) dissemination of general program \n                        information;\n                            ``(ii) providing technical assistance under \n                        this chapter;\n                            ``(iii) monitoring and evaluation of \n                        programs and activities assisted under this \n                        chapter;\n                            ``(iv) providing support for parental \n                        education; or\n                            ``(v) creating a State gifted education \n                        advisory board.\n                    ``(B) Administrative costs.--A State educational \n                agency may use not more than 50 percent of the funds \n                made available to the State educational agency under \n                subparagraph (A) for administrative costs.\n\n``SEC. 5467A.
