FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 \n        children in the United States who were 14 years of age or \n        younger died from unintentional shootings, and in 1996 alone, \n        138 children were shot and killed unintentionally, which is an \n        average of 11 children every month, or 1 child every third day, \n        according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\n            (2) The United States leads the industrialized world in the \n        rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related \n        deaths. A 1997 study from the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention found that for unintentional firearms-related deaths \n        for children under the age of 15, the rate in the United States \n        was 9 times greater than in 25 other industrialized countries \n        combined.\n            (3) While the number of unintentional deaths from firearms \n        is an unacceptable toll on the children of the United States, \n        nearly 8 times that number are treated annually in hospital \n        emergency rooms in the United States for nonfatal unintentional \n        gunshot wounds, according to an article in the June 12, 1996, \n        issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n            (4) In the June 12, 1987, issue of the Journal of the \n        American Medical Association, a study of unintentional firearms \n        deaths among children in California found that unintentional \n        gunshot wounds most often involve handguns.\n            (5) A study in the December 1995 issue of the Archives of \n        Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine found that children as young \n        as 3 years old are strong enough to fire most commercially \n        available handguns. The study found that 25 percent of 3- to 4-\n        year-olds and 70 percent of 5- to 6-year-olds had sufficient \n        finger strength to fire 59 (or 92 percent) of the 64 commonly \n        available handguns examined in the study.\n            (6) Currently, firearms are the only products manufactured \n        in the United States that are not subject to minimum safety \n        standards.\n            (7) A 1997 public opinion poll conducted by the National \n        Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago in \n        conjunction with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and \n        Research found that 74 percent of the people of the United \n        States support safety regulation of the firearms industry.\n            (8) Firearms, their component parts, and safety locks \n        designed to prevent firearms from accidentally discharging, all \n        move in interstate commerce.\n            (9) Many currently available trigger locks and other \n        similar devices are inadequate to prevent the accidental \n        discharge of the firearms to which they are attached, or to \n        prevent children from gaining access to the firearms.\n\nSEC. 3. REGULATION OF HANDGUN DISCHARGE PROTECTION PRODUCTS.\n\n    (a) General Authority.--The Secretary of the Treasury (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Secretary'') shall prescribe such regulations \ngoverning the design, manufacture, and performance of, and commerce in, \nhandgun discharge protection products, as are necessary to reduce or \nprevent unreasonable risk of injury to children from the unintentional \ndischarge of handguns.\n    (b) Minimum Safety Standard.--The regulations required by \nsubsection (a) shall, at a minimum, set forth a minimum safety standard \nthat a handgun discharge protection product must meet in order to be \nmanufactured, sold, transferred, or delivered consistent with this Act. \nIn developing the standard, the Secretary shall give appropriate \nconsideration to handgun discharge protection products that are not \ndetachable, but are permanently installed and incorporated into the \ndesign of a handgun. The standard shall include provisions to ensure \nthat any handgun discharge protection product that meets the standard \nis of adequate quality and construction to prevent children from \noperating a handgun, and to ensure that such a product cannot be \nremoved from a handgun except through the use of a key, combination, or \nother method of access made possible by the manufacturer of the \nproduct.\n    (c) Use of Poison Packaging Prevention Standards Test Protocols.--\nIn developing the standard required by subsection (b), the Secretary \nshall consider using test protocols described in section 1700.20 of \ntitle 16, Code of Federal Regulations, (in effect as of January 1, \n1998), related to poison prevention packaging standards.\n    (d) Deadline for Issuance of Standard.--Within 12 months after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue in final \nform the standard required by subsection (b).\n    (e) Effective Date of Standard.--The standard issued under \nsubsection (b) shall take effect 6 months after the date of issuance.\n\nSEC. 4.
