DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) The United States commercial airline industry is \n        currently suffering severe financial distress.\n            (2) Sustained record losses and excessive debt burdens are \n        causing air carriers to cancel new aircraft options and orders \n        which, in turn, is threatening the economic viability of the \n        United States aerospace manufacturing industry.\n            (3) Many air carriers are increasingly unable to obtain \n        financing at reasonable interest rates for purchasing new \n        equipment.\n            (4) The inability of many air carriers to acquire new, \n        quieter, more fuel efficient Stage 3 aircraft may jeopardize \n        the planned phaseout of noisier Stage 2 aircraft.\n            (5) A Federal loan guarantee program should, therefore, be \n        established to support the financing of new aircraft, or new \n        aircraft components, in a way that assures the phasing out of \n        less fuel-efficient, noisier, and older aircraft at the same \n        time.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION TO GUARANTEE FINANCING OF NEW AIRCRAFT.\n\n    Title XI of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 App. U.S.C. 1501 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 1119. FINANCING OF NEW AIRCRAFT.\n\n    ``(a) Authorization of Loan Guarantee Program.--The Secretary is \nauthorized to guarantee loans for the financing of new aircraft, or new \naircraft components, for use by air carriers that meet the terms and \nconditions set forth in subsection (b) and that agree to pay (directly \nif the carrier is the loan guarantee recipient, or indirectly if \nanother person is loan guarantee recipient) subsidy fees assessed under \nsubsection (e). Subject to subsection (b), such guarantees may be made \nwith respect to--\n            ``(1) loans to an air carrier that will use such new \n        aircraft or such new aircraft components; or\n            ``(2) loans to a person purchasing such new aircraft, or \n        such new aircraft components, for lease to and use by an air \n        carrier.\n    ``(b) Terms and Conditions.--A loan guarantee under this section \nshall be subject to the following terms and conditions:\n            ``(1) The loan guarantee must lead to the delivery of new \n        aircraft, or new aircraft components, to an air carrier \n        certificated under part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal \n        Regulations, and such delivery shall occur no later than \n        December 31, 1999.\n            ``(2) The loan guarantee must be made for the purpose of \n        financing the acquisition of new aircraft, or new aircraft \n        components, that comply with Stage 3 noise standards.\n            ``(3) The loan guarantee shall only be available for the \n        purchase of new aircraft, or new aircraft components, from \n        companies that both--\n                    ``(A) publish independently audited financial \n                disclosure information and financial results;
