FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) excessive securities litigation is a serious burden on \n        the national economy, diverting limited capital resources to \n        less productive areas;\n            (2) meritless lawsuits filed under Federal securities laws \n        are making it harder for American companies to raise capital \n        and attract experienced members to serve on their boards;\n            (3) in the past 3 years, issuers of 1 out of every 12 \n        stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange have been sued for \n        securities fraud;\n            (4) in the securities fraud area, the civil justice system \n        is being transformed into a nonmerit-based, unjust system, in \n        which professional plaintiffs extract settlements from \n        entrepreneurs, regardless of the merits of the cases filed;\n            (5) such securities lawsuits impose additional costs on \n        publicly traded companies, often force them into bankruptcy, \n        and create job losses within the economy;\n            (6) such securities fraud lawsuits stifle the development \n        of future products by compelling investment bankers and \n        accounting firms, whose assistance is essential for accessing \n        capital markets, to resist working with new venture firms \n        because of the higher risk of litigation associated with them; \n        and\n            (7) reform in the securities fraud laws are needed to \n        ensure that the courts can properly hear and adjudicate \n        securities fraud cases.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIVATE CIVIL ACTION PROCEDURES.\n\n    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended by inserting after \nsection 20A (15 U.S.C. 78u-1) the following new section:\n\n                   ``private civil action procedures\n\n    ``Sec. 20B. (a) Requirement of Proportionate Liability.--\n            ``(1) Limitation on joint and several liability.--A \n        defendant who is found liable for damages in an implied private \n        action arising under a provision of this Act may be liable \n        jointly and severally only if the trier of fact specifically \n        determines that the defendant engaged in knowing securities \n        fraud, as defined in paragraph (3).\n            ``(2) Determination of liability.--If the trier of fact \n        does not find, pursuant to paragraph (1), that the defendant \n        engaged in knowing securities fraud, the defendant's liability \n        shall be determined as follows:\n                    ``(A) The trier of fact shall determine the \n                percentage of responsibility of the plaintiff, of each \n                of the defendants and of each of the other persons or \n                entities alleged by the parties to have caused or \n                contributed to the harm alleged by the plaintiff. In \n                determining the percentages of responsibility, the \n                trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the \n                conduct of each person and the nature and extent of the \n                causal relationship between that conduct and the damage \n                claimed by the plaintiff.\n                    ``(B) For each defendant, the trier of fact shall \n                then multiply the defendant's percentage of \n                responsibility by the total amount of damage suffered \n                by the plaintiff that was caused in whole or in part by \n                that defendant and shall enter a verdict or judgment \n                against the defendant in that amount. No defendant \n                whose liability is determined under this subsection \n                shall be jointly liable on any judgment entered against \n                any other party to the action.\n                    ``(C) Except where contractual relationship \n                permits, no defendant whose liability is determined \n                under this subsection shall have a right to recover \n                from another defendant any portion of the judgment \n                entered against him.\n            ``(3) Definition.--A defendant engages in `knowing \n        securities fraud' only if he (A) makes a material \n        representation with actual knowledge that the representation is \n        false or omits to make a statement with actual knowledge that, \n        as a result of the omission, one of his material \n        representations is false; and (B) knows that other persons are \n        likely to rely on that misrepresentation or omission. Reckless \n        conduct by the defendant shall not constitute `knowing \n        securities fraud'. The liability in damages, in any, of a \n        defendant who acts in a reckless manner shall be determined in \n        accordance with paragraph (3).\n            ``(4) Coverage of provision.--This subsection relates only \n        to the allocation of damages among defendants. Nothing herein \n        shall affect the standards for liability under any implied \n        private action arising under a provision of this Act.\n    ``(b) Awards of Attorney Fees.--\n            ``(1) Authority to award fees.--If the court in any implied \n        private action arising under this Act enters a final judgment \n        against a party litigant on the basis of a motion to dismiss, \n        motion for summary judgment, or a trial on the merits, the \n        court shall, upon motion by the prevailing party, award the \n        prevailing party reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by \n        that party unless the court determines that the position of the \n        losing party was substantially justified. If the court \n        determines that the position of the losing party was \n        substantially justified, it shall not award fees and other \n        expenses to the prevailing party. The determination whether the \n        position of the losing party was substantially justified shall \n        be made on the basis of the record which is made in the civil \n        action for which fees and other expenses are sought.\n            ``(2) Application for fees.--A party seeking an award of \n        fees and other expenses shall, within 30 days of a final, \n        nonappealable judgment in the action, submit to the court an \n        application for fees and other expenses that verifies that the \n        party is entitled to such an award under paragraph (1) and the \n        amount sought, including an itemized statement from any \n        attorney or expert witness representing or appearing on behalf \n        of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at \n        which fees and other expenses are computed.\n            ``(3) Allocation and size of award.--The court, in its \n        discretion, may--\n                    ``(A) determine whether the amount to be awarded \n                pursuant to this section shall be awarded against the \n                unsuccessful party, its attorney, or both; and\n                    ``(B) reduce the amount to be awarded pursuant to \n                this section, or deny an award, to the extent that the \n                prevailing party during the course of the proceedings \n                engaged in conduct that unduly and unreasonably \n                protracted the final resolution of the matter in \n                controversy.\n            ``(4) Awards in discovery proceedings.--In adjudicating any \n        motion for an order compelling discovery or any motion for a \n        protective order made in any implied private action arising \n        under this Act, the court shall award the prevailing party \n        reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by the party in \n        bringing or defending against the motion, including reasonable \n        attorney fees, unless the court finds that special \n        circumstances make an award unjust.\n            ``(5) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--\n                    ``(A) The term `fees and other expenses' includes \n                the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the \n                reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, \n                or project which is found by the court to be necessary \n                for the preparation of the party's case, and reasonable \n                attorney fees and expenses.
