FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Rising deficits in united states trade accounts.--One \n        of the purposes of the North American Free Trade Agreement \n        (NAFTA), as stated in the preamble, is to ``create an expanded \n        and secure market'' for goods and services. Instead, NAFTA has \n        resulted in a spiraling United States trade deficit with Mexico \n        and Canada that exceeded $76,000,000,000 in 2015, and more than \n        $1,800,000,000,000 since the agreement's inception. Rather than \n        continuous development and expansion as envisioned and growing \n        trade surpluses for the United States, NAFTA has resulted in \n        United States job losses and escalating trade deficits.\n            (2) Erosion of the united states manufacturing base.--One \n        of the purposes of NAFTA is to enhance the competitiveness of \n        firms in the global market. However, rather than increase the \n        ability of the manufacturing sector in the United States to \n        compete in the world market, NAFTA has facilitated and \n        accelerated the outsourcing of United States manufacturing \n        facilities and jobs to lower-wage Mexico. Conservatively, NAFTA \n        has led to nearly 1,000,000 American job losses. Conversely, \n        Mexico has become an export platform displacing United States \n        production. An unprecedented flood of imports of manufactured \n        and agricultural goods now enter the United States. Further, \n        Mexico has experienced an outsourcing of productivity to even \n        lower-wage China, as Chinese imports to Mexico have grown and \n        are imported into the United States.\n            (3) NAFTA should not be expanded.--Congress approved NAFTA \n        in order to achieve economic, social, and environmental \n        benefits for the people of the United States. Based on \n        currently available information, the goals and objectives of \n        NAFTA are not being achieved. Therefore, NAFTA should not be \n        expanded to include any other country.\n            (4) NAFTA to be renegotiated and benefits certified.--Based \n        on the experience with NAFTA since its implementation, it has \n        become evident that further negotiation is required to resolve \n        fundamental inadequacies within NAFTA with respect to trade \n        balances, currency differentials, health and environmental \n        conditions, agricultural provisions, systems of justice, and \n        illegal immigration. If NAFTA is to continue, Congress must \n        require certification of specific measures of economic, social, \n        legal, and environmental progress. Otherwise Congress has no \n        choice but to withdraw its approval of NAFTA.\n\nSEC. 3.
