FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 2011-2012 drought in East Africa, part of a \n        persistent weather trend in the region, was exacerbated by \n        stagnating agricultural development and unsustainable forms of \n        livelihood. Moreover, in Somalia, the hardest hit country in \n        the region, the terrorist group al-Shabaab obstructed the \n        delivery of humanitarian assistance and directly threatened aid \n        agencies. Thus, the famine was a foreseeable and, with \n        unimpeded delivery of aid, a preventable event.\n            (2) It is estimated that 4 million Somalis were affected by \n        the drought and famine in the region and several million remain \n        vulnerable to this day. According to the May 2013 report issued \n        by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the \n        Famine Early Warning System Network, the Somalia famine \n        resulted in 258,000 deaths between October 2010 and April 2012. \n        More than half of those deaths were children under the age of \n        five.\n            (3) Because of laws prohibiting activities that may \n        directly or indirectly support terrorist organizations, a \n        general or specific license issued by the Department of the \n        Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is needed to \n        enable United States humanitarian organizations to legally \n        provide assistance in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia \n        particularly with respect to activities that require \n        interactions or dealings with al-Shabaab.\n            (4) The United States Agency for International Development \n        (USAID) has an OFAC-specific license to operate in these \n        conditions in Somalia that covers the organizations that USAID \n        funds, but not organizations that operate with their own \n        funding or funding solely from non-United States Government \n        sources, and also not the non-United States Government funding \n        of organizations that operate with both United States \n        Government and non-United States Government funding, unless \n        USAID authorizes both types of funding to be covered under such \n        OFAC-specific license. Organizations that operate in al-\n        Shabaab-controlled areas without such a license can be subject \n        to prosecution for violating United States law, at least with \n        respect to activities or transactions that involve al-Shabaab, \n        even incidentally.\n            (5) Prior to OFAC issuing USAID its license, no licenses \n        for humanitarian assistance to the people of Somalia were \n        issued before the United Nations declared a famine in al-\n        Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia.\n            (6) In pursuit of eliminating aid in any form to terrorist \n        organizations, Executive orders have had the effect of undoing \n        protections for humanitarian operations in areas controlled by \n        such organizations previously contained in the International \n        Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.1701 et seq.) and \n        sections 2339A and 2339B of title 18, United States Code \n        (commonly known as the ``Material Support Statutes''). \n        Furthermore, the prohibitions contained in such Executive \n        orders and the Material Support Statutes discouraged and, in \n        some instances, prohibited donors from contributing to aid \n        efforts for all of Somalia. In some cases, the unintended \n        consequences included preventing humanitarian organizations \n        from establishing access to civilians and providing them with \n        life-saving aid, while empowering terrorist organizations that \n        became the sole conduit of aid.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that humanitarian organizations, acting \nin good faith and with the appropriate restrictions and controls in \nplace, should not be prevented, directly or indirectly by Executive \norders or counterterrorism laws, from accessing and providing aid to \ncivilian populations before or early on in humanitarian crises, such as \nin the famine in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia.\n\nSEC. 4.
