FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The earthquake and resulting tsunami of December 26, \n        2004, resulted in the deaths of over 230,000 people in \n        Southeast Asia.\n            (2) The geological fault line along which the December 26th \n        tsunami occurred is mirrored by a fault line that runs along \n        the whole of the west coast of the United States.\n            (3) Scientists predict that there is a 10 to 15 percent \n        chance of a major seismic event along this fault line, the \n        Cascadia Subduction Zone, occurring in the next 50 years.\n            (4) Such an event would probably include both a large-scale \n        earthquake and a tsunami, causing incredible damage to both \n        infrastructure and emergency response services.\n            (5) Numerous false alarms in the past year have \n        demonstrated that many coastal communities are not prepared if \n        such a geological event takes place.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE AND GOALS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of the Community Hazard Assessment and \nMitigation Program (CHAMP) is to award one-year grants directly to \nemergency management departments to build and maintain infrastructure \nto warn people of an approaching tsunami and to address post-tsunami \nneeds.\n    (b) Goals.--The primary goal of this Act is to provide assistance \nto meet the needs of emergency management departments regarding tsunami \nhazard preparedness, mitigation, and response. In part, the program \nseeks to support departments that lack the tools and resources \nnecessary to protect the health and safety of the public and emergency \nresponse personnel with respect to a tsunami and its aftermath. In \naddition, any improvement in warning systems for the coastal \ncommunities will improve all hazard capabilities.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Grant Authorization.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, \nacting through the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration, may provide grants in accordance with this Act to \ncertain areas to prepare for a tsunami.\n    (b) Priority.--The Director shall give priority to areas in which \nthe likelihood of a tsunami striking in the next 50 years is 10 percent \nor greater.\n    (c) Competitive Awards.--In addition to the priority given pursuant \nto subsection (b), the Director shall award a grant under this Act to \nemergency management departments on a competitive basis considering \nfinancial need, benefit to the community and a demonstrated ability to \ncooperate with other providers of emergency services.\n\nSEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS.\n\n    An emergency management department that receives a grant under this \nAct may use grant funds--\n            (1) to establish or improve warning systems, including the \n        purchase of--\n                    (A) sirens;\n                    (B) individual weather radios;\n                    (C) public safety agency communications gear; and\n                    (D) reverse 911 systems;\n            (2) to purchase public safety agency rescue equipment;\n            (3) to reinforce buildings and facilities in maintaining \n        continuity of critical services, including--\n                    (A) police stations;\n                    (B) fire stations;\n                    (C) emergency management facilities;\n                    (D) hospitals;\n                    (E) shelters; and\n                    (F) endangered sewer sanitation systems;\n            (4) post-tsunami shelters and supplies; and\n            (5) to develop outreach programs to educate both residents \n        and tourists of different types of tsunami (near shore and far \n        field) and how to react to each type.\n\nSEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS.\n\n    (a) Population of More Than 50,000.--To be eligible to receive a \ngrant under this Act, an emergency management department serving an \narea with a population over 50,000 shall provide, with non-Federal \nfunds, 20 percent of the total cost of a project established with a \ngrant provided under this Act.\n    (b) Population Between 20,001 and 50,000.--To be eligible to \nreceive a grant under this Act, an emergency management department \nserving an area with a population between 20,001 and 50,000 shall \nprovide, with non-Federal funds, 10 percent of the total cost of a \nproject established with a grant provided under this Act.\n    (c) Population Under 20,000.--To be eligible to receive a grant \nunder this Act, an emergency management department serving an area with \na population under 20,000 shall provide, with non-Federal funds, 5 \npercent of the total cost of a project established with a grant \nprovided under this Act.\n    (d) In-Kind Contributions.--In determining the non-Federal share of \nthe total costs of a project, the Secretary shall consider in-kind \ncontributions of an emergency management department, not to exceed 50 \npercent of the amount that the department contributes in non-Federal \nfunds.\n\nSEC. 7.
