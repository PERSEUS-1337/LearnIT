FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) President Nixon in 1972 issued Executive Order 11644 \n        establishing standards on snowmobile use on public lands, \n        including the requirements that snowmobile use in a national \n        park be permitted only when the National Park Service \n        determines that such use will not adversely affect the park's \n        natural, aesthetic, or scenic values, and that the National \n        Park Service monitor the impacts of any such use in a national \n        park to assure compliance with those standards.\n            (2) President Carter in 1977 issued Executive Order 11989 \n        establishing additional standards on snowmobile use on public \n        lands, including the requirements that the National Park \n        Service, whenever it determines that any such use is causing \n        considerable adverse effects on the natural resources of a \n        national park, immediately halt the use or otherwise take steps \n        to prevent those effects.\n            (3) In compliance with these Executive Orders, the National \n        Park Service in 1983 issued regulations (section 2.18 of title \n        36, Code of Federal Regulations) providing in part the \n        following: ``Snowmobiles are prohibited except where designated \n        and only when their use is consistent with the park's natural, \n        cultural, scenic and aesthetic values, safety considerations, \n        park management objectives, and will not disturb wildlife or \n        damage park resources.''.\n            (4) Pursuant to these general regulations, the National \n        Park Service has issued special regulations designating routes \n        on which snowmobiles may travel in 41 units of the National \n        Park System.\n            (5) A survey the National Park Service conducted in 1999-\n        2000 on snowmobile use in units of the National Park System \n        revealed that--\n                    (A) with respect to most of the units in which \n                snowmobile use occurs, the Service had never made a \n                determination that such use would be consistent with \n                the requirements of Executive Orders 11644 and 11989 \n                and its own general snowmobile regulations;\n                    (B) snowmobile use was occurring in two units for \n                which no routes had been designated for such use by \n                special regulations, and, in other units, snowmobile \n                use was occurring on routes which had not been \n                designated for that use by special regulations;\n                    (C) in most units in which snowmobile use occurs, \n                the Service had not conducted and was not conducting \n                the monitoring required by Executive Order 11644 of the \n                impacts of that snowmobile use; and\n                    (D) snowmobile use in many units was causing \n                impacts inconsistent with the standards of Executive \n                Orders 11644 and 11989 and the general snowmobile \n                regulations.\n            (6) In April 2000, to come into compliance with the \n        requirements of Executive Orders 11644 and 11989 and the \n        general snowmobile regulations, the National Park Service \n        announced that it--\n                    (A) had determined that, in most instances, \n                recreational use of snowmobiles is not an appropriate \n                use in units of the National Park System; and\n                    (B) was initiating a process to adopt new \n                requirements to limit snowmobile use in units of the \n                National Park System (other than units in the State of \n                Alaska and Voyageurs National Park) to short routes \n                providing access to adjacent public lands open to \n                recreational snowmobile use and to routes providing \n                necessary access to private property within or adjacent \n                to such units.\n            (7) In November 2000, based on a final environmental impact \n        statement on a winter use plan for Yellowstone National Park, \n        Grand Teton National Park, and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr., \n        Memorial Parkway and on other studies and information, the \n        National Park Service adopted a record of decision determining \n        that the snowmobile use occurring in those parks is causing \n        impacts that are inconsistent with--\n                    (A) Executive Orders 11644 and 11989 and the \n                general snowmobile regulations;\n                    (B) the requirements of the Clean Air Act (42 \n                U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); and\n                    (C) the requirement of the first section of the Act \n                of August 25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 1; commonly known as the \n                National Park Service Organic Act) that the Service \n                manage units of the National Park System ``in such \n                manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired \n                for the enjoyment of future generations''.\n            (8) In January 2001, to implement the record of decision \n        referred to in paragraph (7), the National Park Service adopted \n        final regulations amending part 7 of title 36, Code of Federal \n        Regulations, to phase out by the winter of 2003-2004 all \n        snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park and the John D. \n        Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway and most snowmobile use in \n        Grand Teton National Park, as published in the Federal Register \non January 22, 2001 (66 Fed. Reg. 7260).\n            (9) The new regulations referred to in paragraph (8) or \n        other regulations under consideration by the National Park \n        Service to restrict snowmobile use in units of the National \n        Park System do not apply to other Federal lands, where the \n        overwhelming majority of the snowmobile use occurring on \n        Federal lands takes place and will be able to continue to take \n        place.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS ON SNOWMOBILE USE IN THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) National park.--The term ``national park'' means a unit \n        of the National Park System.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service.\n    (b) General Prohibition.--The use of snowmobiles in a national park \nis prohibited except on a designated route described in subsection (c) \nand only when the Secretary determines that the use of snowmobiles is \nconsistent with the park's natural, cultural, scenic, and aesthetic \nvalues, safety considerations, and park management objectives, and will \nnot disturb wildlife or damage park resources.\n    (c) Designated Routes.--A designated route referred to in \nsubsection (b) is any snowmobile route designated by regulation issued \nby the Secretary after January 1, 2001 (including those routes \ndesignated with respect to Grand Teton National Park by paragraphs (10) \nand (12) of section 7.22(g) of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, \nas published in the Federal Register on January 22, 2001 (66 Fed. Reg. \n7260), subject to any subsequent amendment of such designations), but \nonly if the designated route--\n            (1) is authorized for use by motor vehicles or motorboats \n        during other seasons; and\n            (2) provides reasonable and direct public access by \n        snowmobile--\n                    (A) to public lands that are adjacent to or in the \n                immediate vicinity of the national park and are open to \n                public snowmobile use; or\n                    (B) to private property within, adjacent to, or in \n                the immediate vicinity of the national park by the \n                owners of the private property and their \n                representatives and invitees, when that snowmobile \n                access is the only practical means of winter access to \n                the private property.\n    (d) Monitoring.--Whenever snowmobile use is permitted in a national \npark, the Secretary shall ensure that the impacts of that use are \nmonitored to assure that it is consistent with the standards specified \nin subsection (b). If the Secretary determines that the use is not \nconsistent with those standards, the Secretary shall immediately \ncurtail or halt the use or take other steps as necessary to ensure \nconsistency with those standards.\n    (e) Exceptions.--\n            (1) Exception for certain parks.--Subsections (b), (c), and \n        (d) do not apply to any national park in Alaska and to \n        Voyageurs National Park.\n            (2) Exception to certain uses.--Subsections (b), (c), and \n        (d) do not apply to--\n                    (A) the use of snowmobiles by the National Park \n                Service and its contractors and agents, if the \n                Secretary determines that such use is essential for the \n                management of a national park; and\n                    (B) the use of snowmobiles in emergency situations, \n                as determined by the superintendent of the national \n                park.\n    (f) Effective Dates.--This Act takes effect beginning with the \nwinter of 2003-2004 with respect to Yellowstone National Park, Grand \nTeton National Park, and the John D.
