    "content": "On January 5, 2011, the House of Representatives adopted an amendment to House Rule XII adding a requirement to all measures introduced in the House of Representatives that are intended to become law. Specifically, Rule XII, clause 7(c) requires that, to be accepted for introduction by the House Clerk, all bills (H.R.) and joint resolutions (H.J.Res.) must provide a document stating \"as specifically as practicable the power or powers granted to Congress in the Constitution to enact the bill or joint resolution.\" The requirement is mandatory, and the House Clerk appears to have the authority to reject introduction of any bill and/or joint resolution that is not accompanied by such a statement. It should be noted, however, that the rule does not appear to vest the House Clerk with the responsibility or authority to evaluate the substantiality of the required statement. Further, based on the plain language of the rule, such a statement is not required for House Resolutions (H.Res.), proposed amendments to already introduced bills, or other types of measures that may be considered by the House. With respect to measures from the Senate that are intended to become law, such as Senate bills (S.) and Senate joint resolutions (S.J.Res.), the rule provides that, prior to their consideration by the House, \"the chair of a committee of jurisdiction may submit the statement \u2026 as though the chair were the sponsor of the Senate bill or joint resolution.\" As this requirement is by its plain language permissive, it appears as though consideration of Senate bills and joint resolutions will not be procedurally affected if a statement of constitutional authority is not provided. It is important to note that the rule does not require that the statement of constitutional authority be made part of the text of a proposed bill or joint resolution. Rather, it appears that these statements are to be provided to the House Clerk at the time of introduction as a separate document. Although the statements will not be part of the bill text, the rule does provide that the statements are to be signed by the sponsoring Member, printed in the Congressional Record , and are to be made publicly available in electronic form by the Clerk. While the rule appears to only apply to the introduction of bills and joint resolutions in the House, there is nothing in the rule's text to indicate that the constitutional authority statement cannot be updated or amended at other points in the legislative process. As bills work their way through committee and onto the floor, they are often amended and, as a result, sponsoring Members may feel that the basis for constitutional authority provided at introduction is no longer relevant or accurate. While the rule does not require that Members ensure that the statement of constitutional authority be updated to reflect changes to the bill, there appears to be nothing that prevents or prohibits a sponsoring Member from amending or updating the statement to respond to changes made during the due course of the legislative process. The rule appears to adopt a subjective standard for determining what specific constitutional authority exists to enact an introduced bill. In other words, the rule appears to leave each individual Member free to ascertain, by whatever means the Member deems appropriate, his/her own basis for constitutional authority. Should a Member choose to consider the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court through its majority opinions, that appears to be permissible under the rule. Equally permissible sources for Members to rely on could include their own personal interpretations of the text of the Constitution; documents produced at the Constitutional Convention, such as James Madison's Notes on the Constitutional Convention of 1787 ; sources published contemporaneously with the consideration and ratification of the Constitution by the states, such as the Federalist Papers , Anti-Federalist Papers , and the ratification debates of the state legislatures; commentaries on the Constitution, such as Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States or The Heritage Guide to the Constitution ; academic journal articles, constitutional law treatises, and other publications; the advice of congressional support agencies; the advice of outside groups or think tanks; submitted statements for similar proposed legislation; and any other source that the Member believes to be relevant and authoritative. The language \"as specifically as practicable\" suggests that the Members should cite a specific clause or provision of the Constitution as the basis for authority, but the rule does not appear to actually require such a citation. As discussed above, while the Clerk appears to have the ability to reject bills that are introduced without an accompanying statement of constitutional authority, no other enforcement mechanism or procedural action appears to be provided for by the rule. In other words, once the statement is properly included with the bill at introduction, the rule is satisfied and Members have no legal or procedural recourse against a statement, even if they believe the constitutional authority statement is incomplete, inaccurate, or improper. Thus, the fact that a Member may disagree with a statement of constitutional authority does not appear to provide the Member with a legal or procedural basis on which to prevent or delay consideration of a properly introduced bill or joint resolution. Conceptually and analytically, it seems critical to make a distinction between what the rule requires of Members and what it does not. Specifically, this requires understanding the difference between \"a statement of constitutional authority to act\" and \"an analysis of the constitutionality\" of a proposed bill or joint resolution. These are two separate and discrete questions that require different types of analysis and, most importantly, may produce different results. The House rule is asking the Member to identify the provision or clause of the Constitution that grants Congress the authority to enact the bill that is being introduced. Phrased another way, the question that the House rule is arguably asking of Members is, what part of the Constitution gives Congress the power to act in the manner being proposed. The rule does not appear to be asking whether the specifics of what the Member is proposing in the bill are consistent with the Constitution. That is a separate, often times much more complex inquiry. For example, legislation intending to prohibit the interstate sale and distribution of material related to animal cruelty or depictions of child pornography is arguably within Congress's authority to act under Article I, \u00a78, clause 3, commonly referred to as the Commerce Clause. Thus, to comply with the House rule, a statement accompanying the bill identifying the Commerce Clause as the basis for Congress's authority to act appears to fully satisfy the Member's obligation. Nothing in the statement required by the rule, however, speaks to whether the particular components of the legislation are in fact constitutionally permissible in light of provisions in the Constitution that may place limitations or disabilities on Congress's authority to act. Although Congress may have the requisite constitutional authority to regulate the interstate sale of material related to animal cruelty or child pornography, reaching that conclusion in no way requires the consideration of whether the First Amendment constrains or disables Congress's authority with respect to these materials. The consideration of constitutional limitations or disabilities on Congress's authority, such as the First, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments, appears to be outside the scope of the House rule. The House rule arguably only requires the Member to state the constitutional basis for authority to act, not whether the action is constitutionally permissible in light of other potentially disabling or limiting provisions. Another factor potentially complicating analysis under the rule is the likelihood that Congress may be able to rely on multiple constitutional provisions for authority to enact a proposed bill. The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is an example of such a statute. Had this rule been in effect when PPACA was introduced, the constitutional authority cited could arguably have been the Commerce Clause, Article I, \u00a78, clause 3, as PPACA attempts to regulate the national market for heath insurance and health care. PPACA, however, in addition to regulating interstate commerce, also contains language that can be authorized by other provisions of the Constitution. For instance, PPACA, in several sections, provides appropriated funds to agencies to carry out the requirements of the act. Appropriations are authorized by Article I, \u00a79, clause 7, not the Commerce Clause. Additionally, PPACA contains several sections that provide for \"fast track\" consideration of certain types of legislation by the Senate. Legislation governing the internal rules and procedures utilized by Congress is authorized by Article I, \u00a75, clause 2, not the Commerce Clause. Given the analytical and conceptual distinction between Congress's constitutional authority to act and an act's constitutionality, the possibility of conflicting results is clear. Again, PPACA can serve as an illustrative example. The fact that there is arguably a basis for constitutional authority to act under the Commerce Clause in no way impacts an analysis of whether the specific provisions within PPACA are legitimate exercises of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause. As a result, there has been litigation regarding PPACA's individual mandate, which, to date, has resulted in conflicting judicial decisions with respect to the mandate's constitutionality. Although there are thousands of bills introduced in the House of Representatives each Congress, they can be broadly categorized into selected groupings for purposes of discussing possible bases of constitutional authority. This section of the report will discuss four such broad categories of legislation: authorization legislation; appropriations legislation; legislation that places conditions on the availability of federal funds; and, finally, legislation that repeals existing laws and/or programs. This is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of types of legislation, but is provided to illustrate the analytical framework for determining proposed legislation's constitutional authority. As discussed above, nothing in this discussion considers or discusses the constitutionality of specific proposed legislation. Perhaps the most commonly used general category of legislation introduced during a Congress is authorization legislation. Generally, authorization bills will propose the establishment, or continuation (referred to as a reauthorization bill) for an agency or program, and will provide the necessary legal authority for that agency to operate and/or for the program to be carried out. As there is no specific clause in the Constitution that provides general authority for authorization bills, most will require an analysis based on the specific subject matter of the proposed bill. For example, a bill authorizing activities of the military or defense department programs would arguably be constitutionally authorized by Article I, \u00a78, clauses 12, 13, or 14, which grant Congress the power to regulate the Army, Navy, and Military respectively. Alternatively, a proposed bill authorizing or reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would arguably be constitutionally authorized by Article I, \u00a78, clause 3, the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause could serve as the basis for constitutional authority, as the regulation of aviation arguably has a direct impact on commerce between the states as well as between foreign nations. As discussed above, the only requirement imposed by the House rule is to provide a basis for constitutional authority; the rule does not require an assessment of a proposed bill's constitutionality. Thus, it would appear that many introduced bills that authorize general federal government activity and/or programs will be able to cite Article I, \u00a78, clause 3, the Commerce Clause, as the basis for constitutional authority. Funding the activities of the federal government is typically done through the enactment of annual appropriations bills. There are three main types of appropriations bills: (1) regular or general, of which there are typically 12 annual appropriations bills; (2) supplemental appropriations bills, which are used to address emergency funding and other unexpected contingencies; and (3) continuing appropriation resolutions or CRs, which provide stop-gap funding for agencies and programs that have not had their annual appropriations bills enacted by the end of the fiscal year. Article I, \u00a79, clause 7 specifically provides the constitutional authority for each of the various types of appropriations bills. As previously discussed, larger, more complex bills may include provisions that appropriate funds, even though the bill has other more general purposes. Thus, while individual provisions of a bill may be constitutionally authorized by the appropriations power, a Member may still consider it necessary to provide a statement of constitutional authority for those parts of the bill not covered by the Appropriations Clause. Often Members of Congress will introduce bills that are intended to provide incentives for the states to perform certain functions that the federal government is not authorized to perform directly. An example of such legislation is the requirement for there to be a minimum drinking age, which is not directly imposed by federal law, but rather has been adopted by the states so that they annually receive the full allotment of federal highway funds. States that opt not to maintain the minimum drinking age are required to have their allotment of highway funds reduced by 10% annually. Bills that are introduced that purport to take similar actions can arguably be constitutionally authorized by the \"general welfare\" language found in Article I, \u00a78, clause 1, commonly referred to as the Spending Clause. Again, as discussed above, this analysis does not address the question of whether the specific bill in question exceeds the scope of the Spending Clause, as articulated by the Supreme Court. That is a question of constitutionality, not of constitutional authority. It is expected that many Members may introduce legislation that proposes to repeal an existing law, eliminate a federal agency, and/or defund a specific program. As the Constitution contains no direct language addressing the power of repeal, determining the constitutional authority for such a proposal may prove elusive. One potential argument for the constitutional authority to repeal laws, agencies, or programs is that the authority to repeal is the same as the authority to create. If, for example, a Member wished to introduce a bill proposing the elimination of the Department of Education, he/she might choose to cite the Commerce or Spending Clauses discussed above, as they were arguably the source of constitutional authority for having created the Department of Education. While a Member may believe that the reason for introducing the bill is to restore the proper balance between the states and the national government pursuant to the Tenth Amendment, such a citation is arguably not consistent with the House rule. The Tenth Amendment is not an affirmative grant of authority to Congress; rather, it is a limitation or disability on Congress's authority to legislate. Hence, because the House rule requires \"a statement citing \u2026 the power or powers granted to Congress \u2026,\" not merely a statement of constitutional provisions, citations to the Tenth Amendment do not appear to satisfy the requirement of the House rule. Another closely related type of legislation is legislation intended to revoke a final agency regulation pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The CRA permits any Member to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval of any federal agency rule within 60 legislative days after Congress has received the rule. Because such resolutions must be presented to the President for his signature or veto, they are intended to become law. Therefore, resolutions pursuant to the CRA are subject to the rule in the House upon their introduction. The CRA provides a statutory basis for the introduction of the resolution, but the House rule requires a statement of constitutional, not statutory, authority. Arguably, the advantage to introducing a resolution under the CRA is that, if done properly, the resolution is eligible for certain expedited procedures, particularly when it comes to Senate consideration, that potentially make it easier to move through Congress. Thus, the constitutional authority for joint resolutions of disapproval is arguably Article I, \u00a75, clause 2, which provides Congress the authority to determine the rules of its proceedings. As noted above, it may be difficult to fully articulate the textual constitutional authorities which can serve as the basis for a proposed bill, as the various powers of the federal government may overlap, so that several constitutional authorities might individually suffice to authorize Congress's authority over a particular subject matter. Further, case law may have either expanded or limited the apparent reach of these authorizations. In addition, the \"Necessary and Proper Clause\" and other implied powers may also support the expansion of congressional authority beyond these explicit authorities in ways not easily discernible from the text. Outlined on the following pages is a list of general types of legislation and related provisions of the Constitution that might arguably provide the power to legislate on some aspects of an issue.
