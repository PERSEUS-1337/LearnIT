    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``More Books for Africa Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The World Bank and other donor organizations have \n        determined that next to a good teacher, a good school book is \n        the best and most cost-effective means of advancing education \n        in African schools.\n            (2) The World Bank and other organizations have determined \n        that there is a chronic shortage of text and library books in \n        schools and libraries across Africa, with students left without \n        books or forced to share books at a ratio of 10:1.\n            (3) The countries of Africa have the world's lowest \n        literacy rates, undermining development and weakening citizens' \n        power to effect socioeconomic and political change.\n            (4) Both the Millennium Development Goals and the Education \n        For All initiatives target increased literacy rates by 2015, \n        especially among women and girls, as a key development goal in \n        Africa and the developing world.\n            (5) Most African children who attend school have never \n        owned a book of their own. In many classrooms, 10-20 students \n        share one textbook.\n            (6) Every year of education has been shown to raise a \n        person's income potential by at least 10 percent.\n            (7) In sub-Saharan Africa, 43.5 percent of the total \n        population is under 14 years old.\n            (8) Books and labor to pack these books are currently being \n        donated by citizens across the United States to assist in \n        literacy efforts in Africa.\n            (9) 22,000 books can be shipped in one cargo container and \n        delivered to Africa for an average cost of $11,000.\n            (10) Not-for-profit organizations, through the use of \n        donated books and labor from United States citizens, as well as \n        cash donations, have been able to ship a donated book to Africa \n        for only 50 cents per book, resulting in tremendous cost-\n        efficiency in a time of budget challenges.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the availability of textbooks and library books is a \n        critical component of the massive investment by the United \n        States in primary, secondary, higher, and adult community \n        education; and\n            (2) the donation of textbooks and library books is a \n        powerful tool of public diplomacy and important to United \n        States national security.\n\nSEC. 4.
