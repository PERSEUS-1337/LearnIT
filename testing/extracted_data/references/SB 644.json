    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Persons with developmental disabilities have to struggle to find gainful employment. Statewide unemployment among people with developmental disabilities of working age is approximately 90 percent.\n(b) According to the Employment Development Department, the average annual earnings of employed persons with developmental disabilities is approximately five thousand five hundred dollars ($5,500).\n(c) Within the community of people with developmental disabilities, people diagnosed with autism are the fastest growing population, making up approximately 50 percent of the annual new caseload of regional centers in some areas of the state.\n(d) Seven years after exiting the K-12 school system, one in three adults with autism still does not have paid work experience or a college or technical education.\n(e) Nationally recognized employment internship training models like Project SEARCH have demonstrated that many people with developmental disabilities can be successfully employed in jobs that earn a living wage.\n(f) The key elements of successful programs like Project SEARCH are:\n(1) The opportunity for people with developmental disabilities to be exposed to real work through internships.\n(2) The opportunity for people with developmental disabilities to receive on-the-job customized training and support during internships.\n(3) The opportunity for employers, in an internship setting, to experience firsthand the quality of work of a person with a developmental disability.\n(g) The existing state hiring process for people with disabilities, known as the Limited Examination and Appointment Program, or LEAP, is not well suited to correctly assess the qualifications and abilities of many people with developmental disabilities because it relies on written testing as an assessment tool and is not performance based. As a result, very few people with developmental disabilities are represented in the state workforce.\n(h) The Governor and the Legislature must address the lack of access people with developmental disabilities have to employment opportunities with the State of California and take steps to become a \u201cmodel employer\u201d to demonstrate the potential of this untapped workforce.\n(i) In enacting this measure, the Legislature intends to create more access to state employment for people with developmental disabilities by allowing successful internship performance in a state agency, in lieu of a written test, to serve as meeting the minimum qualifications for consideration for hire into an entry-level position with the State of California. The Legislature further intends to grant flexibility to state agencies to hire persons with developmental disabilities who meet specific needs of those agencies into entry-level positions without requiring those persons to be able to perform the full range of tasks typically required by the entry-level job classification.\n(j) The Legislature intends that these model employer practices be targeted at people with developmental disabilities who are between 18 and 30 years of age and are deemed eligible by the Department of Rehabilitation to receive supported employment services. If this population is left without purposefully designed pathways to employment, these young adults will remain at a high risk of public dependency throughout the course of their lives.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 19240 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n19240.\n(a) The department, consistent with board rules, shall be responsible for the administration of the Limited Examination and Appointment Program. This program shall provide an alternative to the traditional civil service examination and appointment process to facilitate the hiring of persons with disabilities in the state civil service.\n(b) For purposes of this article, the following terms have the following meanings:\n(1) \u201cDevelopmental disability\u201d has the definition set forth in Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n(2) \u201cDisability\u201d has the definition set forth in Section 12926, as that section presently reads or as it subsequently may be amended.\n(3) \u201cLEAP\u201d means the Limited Examination and Appointment Program implemented and administered by the department pursuant to this chapter.\n(4) \u201cPerson with a developmental disability\u201d means a person who the State Department of Developmental Services deems eligible for services pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and who is a consumer of a regional center pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 4620) of the act.\n(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), if the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d used in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336) would result in broader protection of the civil rights of persons with a mental or physical disability, as defined in subdivision (b), then that broader protection shall be deemed incorporated by reference into, and shall prevail over conflicting provisions of, the definition in subdivision (b). The definition of \u201cdisability\u201d contained in subdivision (b) shall not be deemed to refer to or include conditions excluded from the federal definition of \u201cdisability\u201d pursuant to Section 511 of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.

The definition of \u201cdisability\u201d contained in subdivision (b) shall not be deemed to refer to or include conditions excluded from the federal definition of \u201cdisability\u201d pursuant to Section 511 of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.
