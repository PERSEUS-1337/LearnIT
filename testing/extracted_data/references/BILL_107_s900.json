FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there has been a sharp increase in the price of \n        gasoline, home heating oil, natural gas, and propane in the \n        United States;\n            (2) electricity prices are expected to continue to rise as \n        a result of high natural gas prices, and certain regions have \n        experienced price spikes in wholesale electricity costs;\n            (3) price spikes undermine the ability of low-income \n        families, the elderly, and small businesses (including \n        agricultural producers) to afford essential energy services;\n            (4) the Department of Energy has determined that the \n        economy would be likely to perform better with stable or \n        predictable energy prices;\n            (5) price spikes can be caused by many factors, including \n        insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery capacity \n        limits, insufficient infrastructure, possible over-regulation \n        or under-regulation, flawed deregulation, excessive \n        consumption, over-reliance on foreign supplies, insufficient \n        research and development of alternative energy sources, \n        opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and abuse of market \n        power;\n            (6) consumers and small businesses have few options other \n        than to pay higher energy costs when prices spike; and\n            (7) the impact of price spikes, and possible responses to \n        price spikes, on consumers and small businesses should be \n        examined.\n\nSEC. 3.
