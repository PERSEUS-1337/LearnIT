AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part D of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (20 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n\n``Subpart 3--Grants To Improve School-Based Early Intervention Services \n                for Children With Emotional Disturbances\n\n``SEC. 691. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) During 2002-2001 approximately 472,932 children \n        between the ages of 6 and 21 who were receiving special \n        education and related services were identified as having \n        emotional disturbances--a 21.8 percent increase from the number \n        of such children so identified during 1990-1991. These children \n        with emotional disturbances represent 7.7 percent of the total \n        number of children with disabilities and approximately 1 \n        percent of the general population of the United States.\n            ``(2) It is estimated that up to 19 percent of the total \n        number of students in elementary and secondary schools in the \n        United States exhibit symptoms of emotional disturbance or \n        symptoms of other mental health conditions, but only 1 percent \n        of such students are properly identified as such and receive \n        necessary services. These students fail more classes, miss more \n        days of school, have lower grades, are more frequently retained \n        at the same grade level for more than 1 school year, drop out \n        from school more frequently, and have lower graduation rates \n        than do other students with disabilities.\n            ``(3) At the Conference on Children's Mental Health in \n        September 2000, the Surgeon General stated that `[c]hildren and \n        families are suffering because of missed opportunities for \n        prevention and early identification [of children with emotional \n        disturbances], fragmented services, and low priorities for \n        resources'.\n            ``(4) Goal Number 3 of the Conference on Children's Mental \n        Health Report is to improve the assessment and recognition of \n        the mental health needs of children, including through the \n        following actions:\n                    ``(A) Encourage early identification of mental \n                health needs in existing preschool, childcare, \n                education, health, welfare, juvenile justice, and \n                substance abuse treatment systems.\n                    ``(B) Promote cost-effective, proactive systems of \n                behavior support at the school level. These systems of \n                behavior support should emphasize universal, primary \n                prevention methods that recognize the unique \ndifferences of all children and youth, but should include selective \nindividual student support for those students with more intense and \nlong-term needs.\n            ``(5) Improving outcomes for children with emotional \n        disturbances depends not only on improving the learning \n        opportunities of such children, but also on promoting effective \n        coordination among schools, families, and systems that provide \n        services for such children, such as the social services, \n        health, mental health, child welfare, and juvenile justice \n        systems. Positive results of such coordination include \n        increased retention in school, improved educational outcomes, \n        and the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development of \n        such children.\n            ``(6) Increased academic performance, improved attendance, \n        increased engagement in academic activities, and fewer \n        disruptions to the learning environment are a few of the many \n        positive outcomes documented when systems that provide services \n        for children with emotional disturbances include a continuum of \n        services such as prevention, early intervention at the first \n        indication of a mental health problem or behavioral difficulty \n        of a child, and treatment of severe and chronic mental health \n        problems.\n            ``(7) Surveys of school administrators indicate that \n        behavioral problems, lack of discipline, safety of students, \n        and violence in schools are among top concerns with respect to \n        public education today. Teachers spend inordinate amounts of \n        time and energy during the school day managing student \n        misbehavior and conflict--time and energy that could be spent \n        on teaching and learning.\n            ``(8) Effective early intervention strategies to reduce the \n        number of children who have, or who are at risk of developing, \n        emotional disturbances currently exist. As the National Academy \n        of Sciences concluded in its 2002 report ``Minority Students in \n        Special and Gifted Education'', early intervention for children \n        at risk of behavorial problems ``has been demonstrated to be \n        considerably greater than the effectiveness of later, \n        postfailure intervention''.\n    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subpart is to develop and \nimplement strategies to reduce the number of children who have, or who \nare at risk of developing, emotional disturbances that require the \nprovision of special education and related services under this Act.\n\n``SEC. 692. AUTHORIZATION.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary is authorized to make grants for a \nthree-year period to State educational agencies and local educational \nagencies to develop and implement effective strategies to reduce the \nnumber of children who have, or who are at risk of developing, \nemotional disturbances that require the provision of special education \nand related services under this Act.\n    ``(b) Priority.--In making grants under subsection (a), the \nSecretary shall give priority to State educational agencies and local \neducational agencies that agree to provide additional annual reports to \nthe Secretary in accordance with section 697 after completion of the \nterm of the grant.\n\n``SEC. 693.
