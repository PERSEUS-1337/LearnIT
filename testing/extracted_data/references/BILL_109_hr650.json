FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Vaccines represent one of the most significant public \n        health advances in history. They have saved millions of lives \n        and prevented millions of disabilities.\n            (2) Vaccines are now available for preventing once common \n        childhood diseases, such as polio, chicken pox, and measles, \n        and for preventing diseases responsible for high rates of \n        sickness and death among adults, including influenza, \n        pneumonia, and hepatitis.\n            (3) Vaccines reduce future medical costs and prevent the \n        need for more expensive drugs. Vaccines not only provide a \n        health benefit to the individual receiving the vaccine, they \n        benefit others in the community by reducing their chances of \n        exposure to a disease.\n            (4) The threat of litigation, coupled with the high cost of \n        manufacturing a vaccine, has forced many manufacturers to limit \n        or cease production of life-saving vaccines.\n            (5) In 1967, there were 26 companies in the United States \n        making these vital vaccines. A litigation crisis in the 1980's \n        drove many companies away from the vaccine business. Today, \n        there are only 4 companies that make the vast majority of \n        vaccines used in the United States, making the system fragile \n        and limiting access to vaccines.\n            (6) In October 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services announced a flu vaccine shortage in the United States. \n        The Secretary indicated that the souring of the vaccine \n        manufacturing marketplace was due, in part, to ``costly \n        liability lawsuits''.\n            (7) The Congress intervened in 1986 by creating a no-fault \n        compensation system called the National Vaccine Injury \n        Compensation Program, which was intended to lower the legal \n        risk to vaccine manufacturers, encourage a stable supply of \n        vaccine, and ensure that injured patients are rapidly and \n        appropriately compensated.\n            (8) Under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, \n        individuals who believe they have been injured by a vaccine may \n        file a claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims. If \n        found eligible, they can receive unlimited economic damages for \n        medical expenses, rehabilitation expenses, and lost earnings, \n        as well as pain and suffering damages subject to a $250,000 \n        cap. Over 1,800 claims have been paid totaling over \n        $1,500,000,000 for vaccine-related injuries and complications \n        under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, with \n        many awards amounting to more than $1,000,000 each, and some as \n        high as $7,500,000.\n            (9) Notwithstanding the intent of the National Vaccine \n        Injury Compensation Program, vaccine companies still face \n        significant and expensive litigation exposure, in part, \n        because--\n                    (A) the National Vaccine Injury Compensation \n                Program allows all individuals to ``opt out'' of this \n                system and pursue individual and class action lawsuits \n                in State and Federal courts;\n                    (B) trial attorneys continually seek to bypass the \n                the Program and elect to go to trial by alleging that a \n                particular vaccine is not covered under the Program, or \n                that the Program does not apply to certain \n                preservatives, components, or ingredients of any such \n                vaccine; and\n                    (C) the Program does not preclude an individual who \n                is otherwise ineligible to file a claim under the \n                Program (such as family members of injured individuals) \n                from pursuing civil litigation.\n            (10) To ensure that litigation involving federally approved \n        vaccines is based on valid scientific evidence and does not \n        undermine the Federal public health policy of creating and \n        developing life saving vaccines, it is imperative that any \n        litigation involving vaccines, and related preservatives, \n        ingredients, and components, that takes place outside of the \n        National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program shall take place \n        exclusively in the district courts of the United States, where \n        all procedures and expert testimony shall be subject to the \n        rules and requirements set forth by the United States Supreme \n        Court in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. \n        579, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (1993).\n            (11) To ensure that injured patients with legitimate claims \n        are more rapidly and fairly compensated by the National Vaccine \n        Injury Compensation Program in a less adversarial manner so as \n        to avoid the need for traditional civil litigation, it is \n        imperative that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and \n        the Attorney General of the United States, in consultation with \n        the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, jointly study \n        and submit a report to the Congress within one year regarding \n        their recommendations.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) establish reasonable legal reforms that will facilitate \n        the manufacture of vital, life-saving vaccines;\n            (2) establish certain legal rules and procedures to better \n        assure that litigation involving federally approved vaccines is \n        based on valid scientific evidence;\n            (3) discourage frivolous litigation; and\n            (4) ensure that injured patients are rapidly and fairly \n        compensated in the appropriate forum.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL COURT REMEDY.\n\n    Section 2122 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C 300aa-22) \nis amended by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:\n    ``(a) Federal Cause of Action.--\n            ``(1) In general.--There shall exist a Federal cause of \n        action for claims arising from a vaccine-related injury or \n        death associated with the administration of a vaccine after \n        October 1, 1988. The substantive law for decision in any such \n        action shall be derived from this section and, unless \n        inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law, from the law, \n        including choice of law principles, of the State in which such \n        vaccine was administered. Except for a proceeding for \n        compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation \n        Program, the cause of action established by this paragraph \n        shall constitute the exclusive cause of action or remedy for \n        any vaccine-related injury or death associated with the \n        administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, including \n        any related injury or loss sustained by any person (including \n        any relative or other third party).\n            ``(2) Jurisdiction.--Except for a proceeding in the United \n        States Court of Federal Claims pursuant to section 2112, the \n        district courts of the United States shall have original and \n        exclusive jurisdiction over all actions for damages arising \n        from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the \n        administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, including \n        any related injury or loss sustained by any person (including \n        any relative or other third party). If any civil action subject \n        to this section is brought or is pending in a State court, and \n        the action is not dismissed by the State court, the action may \n        be removed at any time before final judgment by any defendant \n        to the district court of the United States for the district and \n        division embracing the place where such action is pending. An \n        order remanding an action removed pursuant to this subsection \n        is an appealable order. Except as provided herein, the removal \n        of any such action shall proceed in accordance with sections \n        1446 through 1451 of title 28, United States Code.\n            ``(3) State actions.--All State causes of action for \n        damages arising from, or equitable relief relating to, a \n        vaccine-related injury or death associated with a vaccine \n        administered after October 1, 1988, including for any related \n        injury or loss sustained by any person (including any relative \n        or other third party) are hereby preempted.\n            ``(4) Vaccine defined.--For purposes of this section, the \n        term `vaccine' includes any preservative, ingredient, or \n        component of a vaccine.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SANCTIONS FOR FRIVOLOUS VACCINE LITIGATION; 3-STRIKES RULE FOR \n              SUSPENDING ATTORNEYS WHO COMMIT MULTIPLE RULE 11 \n              VIOLATIONS.\n\n    (a) Mandatory Suspension.--Whenever a district court of the United \nStates in connection with an action for damages arising from a vaccine-\nrelated injury or death associated with a vaccine administered after \nOctober 1, 1988 (in this section referred to as a ``vaccine suit''), \ndetermines that an attorney has violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, the court shall determine the number of times that \nthe attorney has violated that rule in connection with a vaccine suit \nin that district court during that attorney's career. If the court \ndetermines that the number is 3 or more, the district court of the \nUnited States--\n            (1) shall suspend that attorney from the practice of law in \n        that district court for 1 year; and\n            (2) may suspend that attorney from the practice of law in \n        that district court for any additional period that the court \n        considers appropriate.\n    (b) Appeal; Stay.--An attorney has the right to appeal a suspension \nunder subsection (a). While such an appeal is pending, the suspension \nshall be stayed.\n    (c) Reinstatement.--To be reinstated to the practice of law in a \ndistrict court of the United States after completion of a suspension \nunder subsection (a), the attorney must first petition the court for \nreinstatement under such procedures and conditions as the court may \nprescribe.\n\nSEC. 5. TRIAL PROCEDURE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 2123 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \nU.S.C. 300aa-23) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) by striking ``three'' and inserting ``four''; \n                and\n                    (B) by inserting ``, including any related injury \n                or loss sustained by any person (including any relative \n                or other third party),'' after ``the effective date of \n                this part'';\n            (2) by redesignating subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) as \n        subsections (c), (d), (e) and (f);\n            (3) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:\n    ``(b) Causation in Fact.--The first stage of such civil action \nshall be held to determine whether competent and reliable scientific \nevidence demonstrates that the plaintiff's alleged vaccine-related \ninjury or death was caused in fact by the vaccine.'';\n            (4) in subsection (c) (as so redesignated), by striking \n        ``The first'' and inserting ``If the trier of fact finds that \n        the alleged vaccine-related injury or death was caused in fact \n        by the vaccine, a second'';\n            (5) in subsection (d) (as so redesignated), by striking \n        ``second'' and inserting ``third''; and\n            (6) in subsection (e) (as so redesignated), by striking \n        ``third'' and inserting ``fourth''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subparagraph (A) of section 2122(b)(2) \nof the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300aa-22) is amended by \nstriking ``2123(d)(2)'' and inserting ``2123(e)(2)''.\n\nSEC. 6. TRANSITION RULES.\n\n    (a) Notice.--If on the date of the enactment of this Act, any State \nlaw claim for damages arising from, or equitable relief relating to, a \nvaccine-related injury or death associated with a vaccine administered \nafter October 1, 1988, including any related injury or loss sustained \nby any person (including any relative or other third party), is pending \nin any State or Federal court prior to the entry of final judgment, the \nplaintiff may, within 30 days of such date of enactment, file a notice \nwith the court in which the claim is pending electing to treat the \nState law claim as a Federal law claim arising under section 2122 of \nthe Public Health Service Act, as amended by section 3, and subject to \nthe amendments made by this Act.\n    (b) Failure to File Notice.--If no notice is filed for a claim \ndescribed in subsection (a) within the 30-day period described in such \nsubsection, and the claim is pending in State court, the claim shall be \ndismissed with prejudice.\n    (c) Notice Filed.--If a notice is filed for a claim described in \nsubsection (a) within such 30-day period described in such subsection, \nand the claim is pending in State court prior to the entry of final \njudgment, any plaintiff or defendant may remove the action to the \ndistrict court of the United States for the district and division \nembracing the place where such action is pending by filing a notice of \nremoval signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure and containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for \nremoval, together with a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders \nserved or previously filed in such action.

STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Congress intended the National Vaccine Injury \n        Compensation Program to be a flexible, no-fault, less \n        adversarial system to handle claims in a quick, easy, and \n        generous manner so as to avoid the need the for civil \n        litigation, and to avoid the rancor and substantial delays \n        often associated with traditional litigation.\n            (2) Although the National Vaccine Injury Compensation \n        Program maintains it has an excellent record of promptly and \n        appropriately compensating valid claims, recent reports of some \n        individuals seeking compensation under the Program allege that \n        some legitimate claims have taken 5 to 10 years to resolve, the \n        process has become more adversarial, the Program has made \n        claims harder to prove, and the process has drifted toward \n        full-blown litigation and away from Congress' intent as a \n        positive alternative to tort litigation.\n    (b) Study.--After considering the findings in subsection (a), and \nafter consulting with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General of \nthe United States shall, not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, jointly submit a report to the appropriate \ncommittees of the Congress concerning their recommendations to ensure \nthat injured patients with legitimate claims are rapidly and \nappropriately compensated in a less adversarial manner."
