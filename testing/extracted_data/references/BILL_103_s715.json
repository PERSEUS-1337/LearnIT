FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) increased parental involvement in the education of \n        their children appears to be the key to long-term gains for \n        youngsters;\n            (2) providing seed money is an appropriate role for the \n        Federal Government to play in education;\n            (3) children participating in the parents as teachers \n        program in Missouri are found to have increased cognitive or \n        intellectual skills, language ability, social skills and other \n        predictors of school success;\n            (4) most early childhood programs begin at age 3 or 4 when \n        remediation may already be necessary; and\n            (5) many children receive no health screening between birth \n        and the time they enter school, thus such children miss the \n        opportunity of having developmental delays detected early.\n\nSEC. 2.
