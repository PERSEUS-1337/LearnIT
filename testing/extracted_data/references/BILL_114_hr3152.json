FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 helped bring \n        electricity and telephone service to rural America, thus \n        removing major barriers to the development of our rural \n        economies.\n            (2) A lack of affordable broadband presents a similar \n        barrier to the development of our rural economy.\n            (3) According to the Federal Communications Commission, 53 \n        percent of rural Americans lack access to service delivering \n        broadband speeds of 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for \n        uploads.\n            (4) High-speed broadband access helps rural communities \n        compete and grow in our digital economy.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that necessary funds should be made \navailable to provide universal and affordable broadband access to the \nUnited States of America with a focus on underserved rural communities.\n\nSEC. 4.
