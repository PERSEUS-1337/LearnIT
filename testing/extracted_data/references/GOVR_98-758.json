Today, congressional pages include students who are juniors in high school and who may come from all areas of the United States and its territories. The page system is formally provided for in law, although the rationale for the page service or for using high school students is not. Since the earliest accounts of pages, it has been widely noted in debates and writings within Congress that pages provide needed messenger services: From the origin of the present government, in 1789, to the present time, they [messengers] have been under the orders and resolutions of the House, and experience has attested to the necessity of their services. The use of boys or pages, was introduced at a later period; but from the first session of Congress held at the city of Washington [1800], they have continued to be employed by the House, with the approbation of the House. Being a page provides a unique educational opportunity, affording young adults an opportunity to learn about Congress, the legislative process, and to develop workplace and leadership skills. Over the years, there has been concern about having young pages serve Congress. In the 1800s and early 1900s, some House pages were as young as 10 and Senate pages as young as 13. Later, they were as old as 18. At various times, congressional actions related to employing pages have addressed the lack of supervised housing as well as pages' ages, tenure, selection, education, and management. Far-reaching reforms in the page system were implemented in 1982 and 1983, following press reports of insufficient supervision, alleged sexual misconduct, and involvement in the trafficking of drugs on Capitol Hill. Most reports of misbehavior were later found to be unsubstantiated. As a consequence of the allegations, however, both the House and Senate for the first time provided supervised housing for their pages; established separate page schools and took over the education of the pages, which had been provided under contract by the District of Columbia school system; and developed more educational and recreational opportunities for their pages. In the 110 th Congress (2007-2008), at the request of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Leader John Boehner, the House inspector general (IG) conducted an inquiry into the supervision and operation of the House Page Residence Hall, and subsequently issued a confidential report recommending changes. In 2008, an independent study, conducted by consultants to the House, was conducted. In response to the findings of those efforts, the House implemented new policies to enhance the safety and supervision of the pages and oversight of the page program. These changes followed investigations of allegations related to the page program participants, including the exchange of inappropriate communications between a Member of the House and former pages, and of misbehavior by a few pages in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses. A follow up review of the page program was carried out in the summer of 2010 by the same independent consultants. According to House leaders, concerns raised in 2008, including costs and the need for the program, remained. In August 2011, Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced the termination of the House page program effective August 31. In a Dear Colleague Letter, the leaders cited both changes in technology obviating the need for most page services, and the program's costs as reasons to discontinue the program. In the 112 th Congress, (2011-2012), H.Res. 397 , entitled Reestablishing the House of Representatives Page Program, was introduced by Representative Dan Boren. The resolution would have created an advisory panel to make recommendations for the operation of a reestablished page program. The House page program would have been reestablished in the first school semester after the advisory panel submitted its recommendations to the Committee on House Administration. Membership of the nine-person advisory body would have been composed of three Members of the House from the majority party of the House, three Members of the House from the minority party, and three individuals who were not Members and who had served as House pages. The measure was referred to the Committee on House Administration, and no further action was taken. Pages serve principally as messengers. They carry documents between the House and Senate, Members' offices, committees, and the Library of Congress. They prepare the Senate chamber for each day's business by distributing the Congressional Record and other documents related to the day's agenda, assist in the cloakrooms and chambers; and when Congress is in session, they sit near the dais where they may be summoned by Members for assistance. In the House, pages also previously raised and lowered the flag on the roof of the Capitol. There are 30 Senate page positions, 16 for the majority party and 14 for the minority party. The office of the Sergeant at Arms supervises the Senate page program. The Senate page program consists of four quarters, two academic year sessions and two shorter summer sessions. It is administered by the Senate Sergeant at Arms, the Senate page program director, and the principal of the Senate page school. Senate pages are paid a stipend, and deductions are taken for taxes and residence hall fee, which includes a meal plan. Pages must pay their transportation costs to Washington, DC, but their uniforms are supplied. The uniforms consist of navy blue suits, white shirts, red and blue striped tie, dark socks, and black shoes. The Senate provides its pages education and supervised housing in the Daniel Webster Page Residence near the Hart Senate Office Building. The Senate Page School is located in the lower level of Webster Hall. Pages who serve during the academic year are educated in this school, which is also accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The junior-year curriculum is geared toward college preparation and emphasis is given to the unique learning opportunities available in Washington, DC. Early morning classes are held prior to the convening of the Senate. The House page program was administered by the Office of the Clerk, under the supervision of the House Page Board. The board, established in statute, is composed of two Members from each party, including the chair, as well as the Clerk and the Sergeant at Arms of the House, a former House page, and the parent of a House page. Participants in the House page program typically served for one academic semester during the school year, or during a summer session. House pages received a stipend for their services, and deductions were taken from their salaries for federal and state taxes, Social Security, and a residence hall fee, which included a meal plan. The pages were required to live in the supervised House Page Dormitory near the Capitol. They were responsible for the cost of their uniforms\u2014navy jackets, dark grey slacks or skirts, long sleeve white shirt, red and blue striped tie, and black shoes\u2014and transportation to and from Washington, DC. During the school year, pages were educated in the House Page School located in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress. The page school, which is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, offered a junior-year high-school curriculum, college preparatory courses, and extracurricular and weekend activities. Classes were usually held five days a week, commencing at 6:45 a.m., prior to the convening of the House. "
