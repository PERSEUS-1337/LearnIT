SHORT TITLE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer \nAutomobile Lease Advertising Act of 1998''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \nexpressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \nprovision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \nother provision of the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There has been a continuing trend toward leasing of \n        automobiles by consumers as an alternative to installment \n        credit sales, with automobile leases now constituting over one-\n        third of all new automobile transactions.\n            (2) Current automobile leasing practices do not provide \n        consumers with consistent or adequate information to permit \n        comparison shopping among lease offerings. Important \n        information about lease costs and terms are not available until \n        the consumer visits an automobile dealership, are typically \n        provided only as part of lease negotiations, and often are not \n        fully disclosed until the signing of the lease documents.\n            (3) Automobile lease advertisements tend to confuse and \n        mislead consumers by highlighting the most attractive terms of \n        leases, by minimizing or omitting additional costs, terms or \n        penalties, and by advertising monthly payment amounts based on \n        lease terms that are different from those customarily offered \n        to or selected by consumers.\n            (4) With leases accounting for a large and growing \n        percentage of all new automobile transactions, there is \n        increasing need for automobile manufacturers, automobile \n        dealers and other firms involved in leasing to provide more \n        relevant and easily understood information in advertising and \n        in writing at the auto dealership to permit consumers to \n        evaluate intelligently the attractiveness of leases offered by \n        an automobile dealership, to compare terms of leases offered \n        and advertised by competing dealerships, and to compare the \n        benefits of automobile leases with alternative purchase \n        transactions.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the amendments made by this Act is to \nsimplify and standardize automobile lease advertising in order to \nprovide consumers with more relevant and easily understood information \nregarding the terms and costs of lease offerings earlier in the leasing \nprocess to permit consumers to compare lease and purchase options and \nto comparison shop among competing lease opportunities.\n\nSEC. 3. APPLICABLE CONSUMER LEASES.\n\n    Section 181(1) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. \n1667(1)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``$25,000'' and inserting ``$50,000''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end of the following: ``The limit on \n        the contractual obligation which comes within such term shall \n        be adjusted annually based upon the change reported in the \n        Consumer Price Index by the Department of Labor in June of the \n        preceding year.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
