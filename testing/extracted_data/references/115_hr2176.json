FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has worked cooperatively with its \n        allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region for decades on \n        issues of mutual concern having regional and global strategic \n        and economic importance, including--\n                    (A) deterring and confronting external aggression \n                against allies and partners;\n                    (B) ensuring the free flow of energy and commerce, \n                and freedom of navigation in international waters;\n                    (C) dismantling terrorist networks that threaten \n                the safety of the region;\n                    (D) preventing the development, use, and \n                proliferation of weapons of mass destruction;\n                    (E) adapting to climate change and severe weather \n                events, including cooperation on humanitarian \n                assistance and disaster response; and\n                    (F) promoting respect for the international liberal \n                order based on commonly respected norms and values.\n            (2) The close security relationships between the United \n        States and its five treaty allies in the Asia-Pacific region--\n        Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand--as \n        well as the security relationships between the United States \n        and its non-alliance security partners in the region remain \n        vital to the United States national interest and a cornerstone \n        of regional stability.\n            (3) The United States opposes North Korea's illegal and \n        reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n            (4) Countering North Korea's destabilizing activities in \n        the region by diplomatic, economic, and defensive means is a \n        top national security issue for the United States as the threat \n        posed by North Korea endangers United States allies, threatens \n        to destabilize the Asia-Pacific region, and if unchecked, poses \n        a grave nuclear proliferation challenge to the world.\n\nSEC. 3.
