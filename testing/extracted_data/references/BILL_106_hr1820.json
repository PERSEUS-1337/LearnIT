FINDINGS.\n\n    ``The Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) There are 52,700,000 students in 88,223 elementary \n        and secondary schools across the United States. The current \n        Federal expenditure for education infrastructure is \n        $12,000,000. The Federal expenditure per enrolled student for \n        education infrastructure is 23 cents. An appropriation of \n        $22,000,000,000 would result in a Federal expenditure for \n        education infrastructure of $417 per student per fiscal year.\n            ``(2) The General Accounting Office in 1995 reported that \n        the Nation's elementary and secondary schools need \n        approximately $112,000,000,000 to repair or upgrade facilities. \n        Increased enrollments and continued building decay has raised \n        this need to an estimated $200,000,000,000. Local education \n        agencies, particularly those in central cities or those with \n        high minority populations, cannot obtain adequate financial \n        resources to complete necessary repairs or construction. These \n        local education agencies face an annual struggle to meet their \n        operating budgets.\n            ``(3) According to a 1991 survey conducted by the American \n        Association of School Administrators, 74 percent of all public \n        school buildings need to be replaced. Almost one-third of such \n        buildings were built prior to World War II.\n            ``(4) The majority of the schools in unsatisfactory \n        condition are concentrated in central cities and serve large \n        populations of poor or minority students.\n            ``(5) In the large cities of America, numerous schools \n        still have polluting coal burning furnaces. Decaying buildings \n        threaten the health, safety, and learning opportunities of \n        students. A growing body of research has linked student \n        achievement and behavior to the physical building conditions \n        and overcrowding. Asthma and other respiratory illnesses exist \n        in above average rates in areas of coal burning pollution.\n            ``(6) According to a study conducted by the General \n        Accounting Office in 1995, most schools are unprepared in \n        critical areas for the 21st century. Most schools do not fully \n        use modern technology and lack access to the information \n        superhighway. Schools in central cities and schools with \n        minority populations above 50 percent are more likely to fall \n        short of adequate technology elements and have a greater number \n        of unsatisfactory environmental conditions than other schools.\n            ``(7) School facilities such as libraries and science \n        laboratories are inadequate in old buildings and have outdated \n        equipment. Frequently, in overcrowded schools, these same \n        facilities are utilized as classrooms for an expanding school \n        population.\n            ``(8) Overcrowded classrooms have a dire impact on \n        learning. Students in overcrowded schools score lower on both \n        mathematics and reading exams than do students in schools with \n        adequate space. In addition, overcrowding in schools negatively \n        affects both classroom activities and instructional techniques. \n        Overcrowding also disrupts normal operating procedures, such as \n        lunch periods beginning as early as 10 a.m. and extending into \n        the afternoon; teachers being unable to use a single room for \n        an entire day; too few lockers for students, and jammed \n        hallways and restrooms which encourage disorder and rowdy \n        behavior.\n            ``(9) School modernization for information technology is an \n        absolute necessity for education for a coming \n        CyberCivilization. The General Accounting Office has reported \n        that many schools are not using modern technology and many \n        students do not have access to facilities that can support \n        education into the 21st century. It is imperative that we now \n        view computer literacy as basic as reading, writing, and \n        arithmetic.\n            ``(10) Both the national economy and national security \n        require an investment in school construction. Students educated \n        in modern, safe, and well-equipped schools will contribute to \n        the continued strength of the American economy and will ensure \n        that our Armed Forces are the best trained and best prepared in \n        the world. The shortage of qualified information technology \n        workers continues to escalate and presently many foreign \n        workers are being recruited to staff jobs in America. Military \n        manpower shortages of personnel capable of operating high tech \n        equipment are already acute in the Navy and increasing in other \n        branches of the Armed Forces.\n\n``SEC. 12002. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this title is to provide Federal funds to enable \nlocal educational agencies to finance the costs associated with the \nconstruction, repair, and modernization for information technology of \nschool facilities within their jurisdictions.\n\n``SEC. 12003. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF GRANTS.\n\n    ``(a) Authority and Conditions for Grants.--\n            ``(1) In general.--To assist in the construction, \n        reconstruction, renovation, or modernization for information \n        technology of elementary and secondary schools, the Secretary \n        shall make grants of funds to State educational agencies for \n        the construction, reconstruction, or renovation, or for \n        modernization for information technology, of such schools.\n            ``(2) Formula for allocation.--From the amount appropriated \n        under section 12006 for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall \n        allocate to each State an amount that bears the same ratio to \n        such appropriated amount as the number of school-age children \n        in such State bears to the total number of school-age children \n        in all the States. The Secretary shall determine the number of \n        school-age children on the basis of the most recent \n        satisfactory data available to the Secretary.\n    ``(b) Conditions for Receipt of Grants.--\n            ``(1) Applications.--In order to receive a grant under this \n        title, a State shall submit to the Secretary an application \n        containing or accompanied by such information and assurances as \n        the Secretary may require. Such applications shall specify the \n        method by which the State educational agency will allocate \n        funds to local educational agencies and the procedures by which \n        projects will be selected for funding. Such applications shall \n        contain assurances that such funds will only be provided if the \n        State educational agency finds that such constructions will be \n        undertaken in an economical manner, and that any such \n        construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization is \n        not or will not be of elaborate or extravagant design or \n        materials.\n            ``(2) Priorities.--In approving projects for funding under \n        this title, the State educational agency shall consider--\n                    ``(A) the threat the condition of the physical \n                plant poses to the safety and well-being of students;\n                    ``(B) the demonstrated need for the construction, \n                reconstruction, renovation, or modernization as based \n                on the condition of the facility;\n                    ``(C) the age of the facility to be renovated or \n                replaced; and\n                    ``(D) the needs related to preparation for modern \n                technology.\n    ``(c) Amount and Condition of Grants.--A grant to a local \neducational agency may be in an amount not exceeding the total cost of \nthe facility construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization \nfor information technology, as determined by the State educational \nagency.\n\n``SEC. 12004.
