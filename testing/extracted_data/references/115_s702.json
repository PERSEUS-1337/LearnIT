DETERRING LABOR SLOWDOWNS.\n\n    (a) Amendments to the National Labor Relations Act.--The National \nLabor Relations Act is amended--\n            (1) in section 1 (29 U.S.C. 151), by adding at the end the \n        following:\n            ``International trade is one of the most important \n        components of the economy of the United States and will likely \n        continue to grow in the future. In order to remain competitive \n        in an increasingly competitive global economy, it is essential \n        that the United States possess a highly efficient and reliable \n        public and private transportation network. The ports of the \n        United States are an increasingly important part of such \n        transportation network. Experience has demonstrated that \n        frequent and periodic disruptions to commerce in the maritime \n        industry in the form of deliberate and unprotected labor \n        slowdowns at the ports of the United States have led to \n        substantial and frequent economic disruption and loss, \n        interfering with the free flow of domestic and international \n        commerce and threatening the economic health of the United \n        States, as well as its citizens and businesses. Such frequent \n        and periodic disruptions to commerce in the maritime industry \n        hurt the reputation of the United States in the global economy, \n        cause the ports of the United States to lose business, and \n        represent a serious and burgeoning threat to the financial \n        health and economic stability of the United States. It is \n        hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to \n        eliminate the causes and mitigate the effects of such \n        disruptions to commerce in the maritime industry and to provide \n        effective and prompt remedies to individuals injured by such \n        disruptions.'';\n            (2) in section 2 (29 U.S.C. 152), by adding at the end the \n        following:\n            ``(15) The term `employee engaged in maritime employment' \n        has the meaning given the term `employee' in section 2(3) of \n        the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. \n        902(3)).\n            ``(16) The term `labor slowdown'--\n                    ``(A) includes any intentional effort by employees \n                to reduce productivity or efficiency in the performance \n                of any duty of such employees; and\n                    ``(B) does not include any such effort required by \n                the good faith belief of such employees that an \n                abnormally dangerous condition exists at the place of \n                employment of such employees.'';\n            (3) in section 8(b) (29 U.S.C. 158(b))--\n                    (A) in paragraph (6), by striking ``and'' after the \n                semicolon;\n                    (B) in paragraph (7), by striking the period at the \n                end of the matter following subparagraph (C) and \n                inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(8) in representing, or seeking to represent, employees \n        engaged in maritime employment, to engage in a labor slowdown \n        at any time, including when a collective-bargaining agreement \n        is in effect.''; and\n            (4) in section 10(l) (29 U.S.C. 160(l)), in the first \n        sentence, by striking ``or section 8(b)(7)'' and inserting ``or \n        paragraph (7) or (8) of section 8(b)''.\n    (b) Amendment to the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.--Section \n303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C. 187) is \namended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``in section 8(b)(4)'' \n        and inserting ``under paragraph (4) or (8) of section 8(b)'';\n            (2) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following: \n        ``With respect to any unfair labor practice under section \n        8(b)(8) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n        158(b)(8)), the damages recovered shall be in an amount equal \n        to 2 times the amount of damages sustained and the cost of the \n        suit shall include any reasonable attorney fees and expert \n        witness fees.''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) In an action for damages resulting from a violation of \nsection 8(b)(8) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n158(b)(8)), it shall not be a defense that the injured party has, in \nany manner, waived, or purported to waive, the right of such party to \npursue monetary damages relating to the labor slowdown at issue--\n            ``(1) in connection with a contractual grievance alleging a \n        violation of a clause prohibiting a strike, or a similar \n        clause, in a collective-bargaining agreement; or\n            ``(2) in connection with an action for a breach of such a \n        clause under section 301.''."
