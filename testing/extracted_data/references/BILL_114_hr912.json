FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Communities surrounding mountaintop removal coal mining \n        projects, which involve surface coal mining including blasting \n        with explosives in the steep slope regions of Kentucky, \n        Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia, have raised concerns \n        that pollution of the water, air, and soil that results from \n        mountaintop removal coal mining may be causing health crises in \n        their communities.\n            (2) Peer-reviewed scientific research and reports have \n        raised serious concerns about mountaintop removal mining with \n        respect to elevated risks in categories of birth defects \n        studied: circulatory/respiratory, central nervous system, \n        musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal.\n            (3) Mountaintop removal coal mining has also been \n        associated with elevated levels of adult hospitalizations for \n        chronic pulmonary disorders and hypertension that are elevated \n        as a function of county-level coal production, as are rates of \n        mortality; lung cancer; and chronic heart, lung, and kidney \n        disease. These health problems strike both women and men in \n        mountaintop removal coal mining communities. These elevated \n        levels of disease, defects, and mortality persist even after \n        controlling for other variables.\n            (4) Initial scientific evidence, and the level of public \n        concern, warrant immediate action to stop new mountaintop \n        removal coal mining permits and increase environmental and \n        human health monitoring at existing mountaintop removal coal \n        mining projects while the reported links between health effects \n        and mountaintop removal coal mining are investigated by Federal \n        health agencies.\n            (5) The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences \n        is uniquely qualified to manage a working group of Federal \n        health agencies with expertise that is relevant to study of the \n        reported links.\n\nSEC. 3. HEALTH STUDIES.\n\n    (a) Studies.--The Director of the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, in consultation with the Administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency and the heads of such other \nFederal departments and agencies as the Director deems appropriate, \nshall--\n            (1) conduct or support comprehensive studies on the health \n        impacts, if any, of mountaintop removal coal mining on \n        individuals in the surrounding communities; and\n            (2) submit to the Secretary, and make publicly available, a \n        report on the results of such studies.\n    (b) Determination.--Upon receipt of the report under subsection \n(a)(2), the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall publish a \ndetermination on whether mountaintop removal coal mining presents any \nhealth risks to individuals in the surrounding communities.\n\nSEC. 4. MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL COAL MINING PERMIT MORATORIUM.\n\n    Until and unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services \npublishes a determination under section 3(b) concluding that \nmountaintop removal coal mining does not present any health risk to \nindividuals in the surrounding communities, a permit or other \nauthorization may not be issued for any mountaintop removal coal mining \nproject, or for any expansion of such a project, by--\n            (1) the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of \n        Engineers, or a State, under section 404 of the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344);\n            (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency, or a State, under section 402 of the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342); or\n            (3) the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \n        Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or a \n        State, under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n        1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 5. MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL COAL MINING CONTINUOUS HEALTH AND \n              ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--Until the Secretary of Health and Human Services \npublishes a determination under section 3(b)--\n            (1) any person conducting a mountaintop removal coal mining \n        project shall--\n                    (A) conduct continuous monitoring for any pollution \n                of water and air (including noise) and frequent \n                monitoring of soil as a result of such project for the \n                purposes of comprehensively--\n                            (i) characterizing any pollution emitted \n                        from the project; and\n                            (ii) identifying ways in which members of \n                        affected communities might be exposed to these \n                        emissions; and\n                    (B) submit the results of such monitoring to the \n                Secretary on a monthly basis; and\n            (2) the Secretary shall make such results available to the \n        public through the World Wide Web in a searchable database \n        format not later than 7 days after the date on which the \n        Secretary receives such results.\n    (b) Enforcement.--If a person conducting a mountaintop removal coal \nmining project fails to conduct monitoring and submit results in \nconnection with such project as required by subsection (a), a permit or \nother authorization may not be issued for the mountaintop removal coal \nmining project, or for an expansion of such project, by--\n            (1) the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of \n        Engineers, or a State, under section 404 of the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344);\n            (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency, or a State, under section 402 of the Federal Water \n        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342); or\n            (3) the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \n        Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or a \n        State, under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n        1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 6. FEE TO PAY FOR HEALTH STUDIES AND MONITORING.\n\n    (a) Collection and Assessment.--The President, acting through the \nOffice of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement of the Department \nof the Interior, shall assess and collect from each person that, as of \nthe date of the enactment of this Act, is conducting a mountaintop \nremoval coal mining project in the United States a one-time fee in an \namount sufficient to recover the Federal cost of implementing sections \n3 and 5.\n    (b) Use of Fee.--Amounts received by the United States as a fee \nunder this section may be used, to the extent and in the amount \nprovided in advance in appropriations Acts, only to pay the Federal \ncost of carrying out sections 3 and 5.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Mountaintop removal coal mining.--The term \n        ``mountaintop removal coal mining'' means surface coal mining \n        that uses blasting with explosives in the steep slope regions \n        of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia.\n            (2) Steep slope.--The term ``steep slope'' has the meaning \n        that term has under section 515(d)(4) of the Surface Mining \n        Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1265(d)(4))."
