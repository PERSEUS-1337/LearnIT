    "title": "SB 1014",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) In 2012, about 35,000 children were born to 15- to 19-year-olds in California. Nationwide, 70 percent of young parents are pushed out of school, and fewer than 4 in 10 young mothers graduate from high school by 18 years of age.\n(b) Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) and California law protect all pupils\u2019 rights to equal educational opportunities regardless of sex. Yet, only some of California\u2019s school districts provide pregnant and parenting pupil programs.\n(c) Pregnant and parenting pupils face overwhelming, system-enforced obstacles to graduating and receiving an education of equal quality to that of their peers that vary across school districts and include all of the following:\n(1) Inconsistent access to excused \u201cfamily leave\u201d absences to care for new infants during the critical period of early child development, with male parents often having no access.\n(2) Involuntary pushout due to high absence rates related to pregnancy and parenting responsibilities.\n(3) Rigid requirements to verify excused absences to care for a sick child.\n(4) Allowed \u201creasonable\u201d amount of time to make up work is defined by the school districts and not to the individual circumstances or to support a pupil\u2019s goal to graduate.\n(5) Varying levels of support and engagement from schools while pupils are absent.\n(6) Encouragement to pursue independent study that may not fulfill the \u201cA-G\u201d admission requirements for the California State University and the University of California or have inconsistent and rigorous attendance policies.\n(7) Parenting pupils\u2019 lack of awareness of their rights under Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) and California law, as well as pupils\u2019 different educational options during pregnancy, postpartum, and as a parent.\n(d) While California has an 80 percent high school graduation rate, only 38 percent of young moms who have a child before they are 18 years of age graduate from high school, 19 percent get a General Education Development (GED) credential, and only 2 percent go to college before 30 years of age.\n(e) Educational challenges set the stage for economic hardship: The median income for women over 25 years of age without a high school degree is $15,021, less than 53 percent of that of their peers\u2019 median income of $31,904.\n(f) Nearly 60 percent of mothers under 19 years of age live in poverty.\n(g) Children of teen mothers tend to struggle more in school, are less likely to complete high school, have lower performance on standardized tests, and are more likely to enter the foster care system and become teen parents themselves.\n(h) Studies show that pregnancy can motivate pupils to complete school and pursue postsecondary education.\n(i) Further, bonding time is critical for an infant\u2019s long-term development and the well-being of parents. California has acknowledged the importance of bonding time and paved the way in supporting bonding within working families.\n(j) Since 2004, workers have been entitled to up to six weeks of family leave to bond with their children. Working families benefit significantly from bonding time. Parenting pupils and their infants, some of our most vulnerable citizens, should not have to choose between their family and education.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 222.5 is added to the Education Code, to read:\n222.5.\nA school district shall notify pregnant and parenting pupils of their rights and options available pursuant to Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C.

The length of leave shall be determined by the pupil and shall not exceed the length of time allowed by this subdivision.\n(b) (1) Absences allowed pursuant to this section shall not be deemed absences in computing average daily attendance pursuant to Section 42238.5 if the governing board of the school district of attendance files an expectant and parenting pupil policy, including procedures for ensuring pupils are provided with schoolwork while on parental leave, with the department.\n(2) For purposes of calculating average daily attendance for a pupil on parental leave, one day of attendance shall be credited for each hour spent on activities related to the instruction of that pupil, with a maximum equivalent of the limits specified in subdivision (a). For purposes of this paragraph, \u201cactivities related to the instruction of that pupil\u201d means activities that require contact with the pupil.\n(3) An expectant and parenting pupil policy shall require a pupil to submit a parental leave request form, similar or the same as request forms used to request temporary disability time off, to the pupil\u2019s school before the end of the pregnant pupil\u2019s second trimester. A school shall process a request within five business days and provide makeup work plan development process guidelines to a pupil in conjunction with the positive determination of parental leave.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 48205 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n48205.\n(a) Notwithstanding Section 48200, a pupil shall be excused from school when the absence is:\n(1) Due to his or her illness.\n(2) Due to quarantine under the direction of a county or city health officer.\n(3) For the purpose of having medical, dental, optometrical, or chiropractic services rendered.\n(4) For the purpose of attending the funeral services of a member of his or her immediate family, so long as the absence is not more than one day if the service is conducted in California and not more than three days if the service is conducted outside California.\n(5) For the purpose of jury duty in the manner provided for by law.\n(6) Due to the illness or medical appointment during school hours of a child of whom the pupil is the custodial parent, including up to four absences per school year to care for a sick child, for which the school shall not require a note from a doctor.\n(7) For justifiable personal reasons, including, but not limited to, an appearance in court, attendance at a funeral service, observance of a holiday or ceremony of his or her religion, attendance at religious retreats, attendance at an employment conference, or attendance at an educational conference on the legislative or judicial process offered by a nonprofit organization when the pupil\u2019s absence is requested in writing by the parent or guardian and approved by the principal or a designated representative pursuant to uniform standards established by the governing board.\n(8) For the purpose of serving as a member of a precinct board for an election pursuant to Section 12302 of the Elections Code.\n(9) For the purpose of spending time with a member of the pupil\u2019s immediate family, who is an active duty member of the uniformed services, as defined in Section 49701, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or has immediately returned from, deployment to a combat zone or combat support position.
