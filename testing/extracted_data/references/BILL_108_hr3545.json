FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Sea otters were hunted to near extinction in the 18th \n        and 19th centuries along the west coast of the United States. \n        Today a small population of southern sea otters exists along \n        the California coastline.\n            (2) Southern sea otters are listed as a threatened species \n        under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and are recognized as \n        depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.\n            (3) Southern sea otters have educational, economic, \n        ecological, and scientific importance to the people of \n        California and the Nation.\n            (4) Recent studies have--\n                    (A) determined that an elevated level of mortality, \n                particularly in adult southern sea otters, is limiting \n                recovery of the population; and\n                    (B) determined that the major threats to the \n                southern sea otter are largely due to degraded marine \n                ecosystems, including infectious diseases, \n                sequestration of contaminants, food resource \n                limitations, and coastal oil spills.\n            (5) Enactment of provisions to implement the United States \n        Fish and Wildlife Service document entitled ``Final Revised \n        Recovery Plan for the Southern Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris \n        nereis'') could lead to delisting of the southern sea otter \n        under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n            (6) Research underlies every aspect of recovering southern \n        sea otter populations, educating citizens and stakeholders, and \n        restoring coastal ecosystems.\n\nSEC. 3. SOUTHERN SEA OTTER RECOVERY PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service (in this Act referred to as the \n``Secretary''), shall carry out a recovery program for southern sea \notter populations along the coast of California.
