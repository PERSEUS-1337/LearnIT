FINDING AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Finding.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) excessive and misguided regulations impose enormous \n        economic costs that, like excessive taxes, stifle economic \n        growth and job creation; and\n            (2) the cost of complying with Federal regulations alone is \n        estimated between $300,000,000,000 and $500,000,000,000 per \n        year, which amounts to $4,000 to $6,000 per working man and \n        woman in America.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to demonstrate the need to \nreexamine the policies and procedures of Federal agencies which impose \nregulatory burden, to determine what changes are necessary and \ndesirable in those policies and procedures.\n\nSEC. 3. REVIEW OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each of the commissions established under section \n4 by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (referred to \nin this Act as the ``Director'') shall review the regulations issued by \nthe department or agency with respect to which the commission is \nestablished.\n    (b) Standards of Review.--In reviewing regulations under this \nsection, each commission shall examine and determine--\n            (1) whether the regulations are--\n                    (A) within the scope of authority of the statutes \n                under which the regulations were issued; and\n                    (B) in accordance with the original intent of the \n                Congress in approving the statutes;\n            (2) whether administrative decisions made under the \n        regulations were based on adequate information concerning the \n        need for and consequences of proposed Governmental action;\n            (3) whether regulatory action was taken only in instances \n        where potential economic benefits to society of taking an \n        action exceed the economic costs to society of taking the \n        action;\n            (4) whether the objectives of regulatory actions were \n        selected to minimize net economic costs to society;\n            (5) whether in selecting among alternative approaches for \n        achieving objectives of regulatory actions, the alternative \n        selected was the alternative involving the least net economic \n        cost to society;\n            (6) whether Federal agencies, in selecting regulatory \n        priorities, have taken into account--\n                    (A) the condition of the particular employers and \n                employees affected by regulatory actions;\n                    (B) the condition of the regional and national \n                economy; and\n                    (C) other Federal regulatory actions being \n                considered; and\n            (7) whether the regulations are subject to judicial review.\n    (c) Consultation and Comment.--In carrying out reviews under this \nsection, each commission shall--\n            (1) consult with the Congress and relevant congressional \n        committees; and\n            (2) solicit and consider views and suggestions of persons \n        affected by the regulations reviewed by the commission.\n    (d) Reports.--\n            (1) In general.--Each commission established under section \n        4 shall submit reports in accordance with this subsection to \n        the Congress, the Director, and the head of the department or \n        agency with respect to which the commission is established.
