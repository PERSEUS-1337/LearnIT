For the purposes of this subsection, a fee \ncharged by any entity related to hunting activities on Federal land \nunder the jurisdiction of the Secretary that is in excess of that \nneeded to recoup costs of management of the Federal land shall be \ndeemed to be a restriction on hunting.\n    (d) Fees.--Fees charged related to hunting activities on Federal \nland shall be--\n            (1) retained by the head of the agency with jurisdiction \n        over such Federal land to offset costs directly related to \n        management of hunting on the Federal land upon which hunting \n        activities related to the fee are conducted; and\n            (2) limited to what the Secretary reasonably estimates to \n        be necessary to offset costs directly related to management of \n        hunting on the Federal land upon which hunting activities \n        related to the fee are conducted.\n    (e) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) Hunting.--The term ``hunting'' includes hunting, \n        trapping, netting, and fishing.\n            (2) Management plan.--The term ``management plan'' shall \n        include a management plan, management contract, or other \n        comprehensive plan for the management or use of Federal land.\n    (f) Applicability.--This section shall apply to all management \nplans developed, approved, or amended after the date of the enactment \nof this section."
