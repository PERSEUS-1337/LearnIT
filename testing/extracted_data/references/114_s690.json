    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Local School Board Governance and \nFlexibility Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the responsibility for education resides with the \n        States, which have delegated to local school boards the power \n        and authority to adopt policies, establish priorities, and \n        provide accountability to direct the operation of neighborhood \n        schools;\n            (2) local school boards are held accountable by local \n        voters to represent the interests of students, parents, local \n        businesses, civic organizations, taxpayers, and the community \n        at large in determining, subject to State laws and policies, \n        the direction, values, climate, and financial support of the \n        schools in their community;\n            (3) the vital national interest in local self-governance of \n        local educational agencies has been weakened through Department \n        of Education requirements that are either unnecessary to \n        achieve the specific direction of legislation enacted by \n        Congress, or that impose unnecessary limits on the flexibility \n        needed by local educational agencies in order to meet local, \n        State, and Federal goals in education; and\n            (4) to support the local decisionmaking function of local \n        educational agencies, the Secretary of Education should engage \n        only in issuing regulations, rules, grant conditions, guidance \n        materials, and other requirements under the jurisdiction of the \n        Department that are--\n                    (A) specifically required to implement Federal \n                legislation; and\n                    (B) demonstrated to be educationally, \n                operationally, and financially within the capacity of \n                local educational agencies to implement.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY.\n\n    Unless specifically authorized by Federal law, the Secretary may \nnot issue a Federal regulation, rule, grant condition, guidance \nmaterial, or other requirement pertaining to a State educational agency \nor a local educational agency that--\n            (1) conflicts with the power and authority of the local \n        educational agency delegated by the State regarding the \n        operation of the schools (including the school system's mission \n        and goals, organization, local budget and budget priorities, \n        education program, curriculum, or extra-curricular activities), \n        student health services and safety, transportation and school \n        boundaries, procurement policies, staffing and personnel \n        policies, capital construction, authority to levy taxes, issue \n        bonds, and acquire land, and other functions essential to the \n        daily operation of the schools within the jurisdiction of the \n        local educational agency;\n            (2) results in additional costs to the local educational \n        agency for reporting, grant administration, and general \n        operations, unless fully funded from Federal funds;\n            (3) conflicts with the power and authority of the local \n        educational agency to determine how to engage or act upon \n        community participation and advice;\n            (4) imposes requirements on a local educational agency or \n        State educational agency that would limit or adversely affect \n        the authority of the local educational agency or State \n        educational agency to function as a legislative, executive, or \n        quasi-judicial agency;\n            (5) conflicts with the authority of--\n                    (A) a State to determine the appropriate governance \n                structure of--\n                            (i) the State educational agency; or\n                            (ii) the State's local educational \n                        agencies; or\n                    (B) a State educational agency or local educational \n                agency to determine the appropriate governance and \n                management of the schools that the State educational \n                agency or local educational agency serve;\n            (6) establishes reporting requirements for State \n        educational agencies or local educational agencies that \n        duplicate existing Federal requirements or that are issued \n        without first conducting a fiscal impact statement related to \n        the costs to State educational agencies or local educational \n        agencies, as the case may be, including requests for data and \n        recommendations from State educational agencies or local \n        educational agencies and national education organizations \n        consistent with the provisions of section 4(a); or\n            (7) places conditions or requirements on a grant to a State \n        or local educational agency that are not directly related to, \n        or that do not directly support, the intent of the specific \n        purpose of the grant or the legislation authorizing such grant.\n\nSEC. 4.
