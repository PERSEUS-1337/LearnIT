FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not provide legal \n        protection for freedom of religion because Salafi Islam is the \n        official religion of the country.\n            (2) The Mutawwa'in, or religious police, has engaged in the \n        persecution of non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia, most recently in \n        the late May 2005 detention of seven Christians whose private \n        security and property were violated.\n            (3) The annual Department of State Report on International \n        Religious Freedom states that citizens of Saudi Arabia are \n        denied the freedom to choose or change their religion. \n        Specifically, conversion by a Muslim to another religion is \n        considered apostasy, a crime punishable by death if the accused \n        does not recant.\n            (4) Sunni Muslims are discriminated against in government \n        employment and higher education and there are still cases in \n        textbooks and teachings of anti-Shi'a instruction.\n            (5) Individuals of the Hindu and Sikh faiths are considered \n        under Sharia law to be polytheists and are therefore permitted \n        in accidental death or injury compensation to be allowed only \n        \\1/16\\ of the amount a male Muslim receives in compensation in \n        similar instances.\n            (6) Saudi Arabia continues to prohibit non-Muslim clergy to \n        enter the country and conduct religious services, which \n        particularly affects religious believers such as Catholics and \n        Orthodox Christians who require religious clergy and services \n        regularly as part of their faith.\n            (7) Many Christians in Saudi Arabia have been detained and \n        deported for praying or for other practices relating to the \n        expression of their faith.\n            (8) Saudi Arabia law requires Saudi citizens to carry an \n        Iqamas, or a legal resident identity card, which contains \n        designation for ``Muslim'' and ``non-Muslim'', which leads to \n        discrimination by the police of non-Muslims.\n            (9) The Government of Saudi Arabia continues to violate \n        freedom of speech, as exhibited in the November 2003 case of \n        Mansur al-Noqaidan who criticized the Saudi Government's \n        response to religious extremism in an editorial in The New York \n        Times and was subsequently sentenced to lashings for incendiary \n        comments.\n            (10) As compiled in an extensive report by Freedom House, \n        it was found that Saudi Arabia's General Presidency for \n        Managing Research and Religious Fatwas disseminated through \n        mosques in the United States ``Document No. 20,'' which states: \n        ``It is not right for a Muslim to support the unbelievers, or \n        to ask them to support him against his enemies, they are the \n        enemy, do not trust them . . . Muslims should not be recruited \n        into their Army, whether they are Arabs or non-Arabs, because \n        the unbeliever is the enemy of the believer.''.\n            (11) In the same Freedom House report, it was discovered \n        that the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., through its \n        Cultural Department, distributed fatwas against Muslims who are \n        seeking to obtain United States citizenship, even if such \n        individuals are stateless. As an example, ``Document No. 44'' \n        states: ``It is forbidden for a Muslim to become citizens of a \n        country [such as the United States] governed by infidels,'' \n        which exhibits a clear hatred and contempt for civil society \n        and pluralism in the United States.\n            (12) The Saudi Air Force, Foreign Ministry, and Embassy in \n        Washington, D.C., have been used to propagate the \n        aforementioned hate ideology and to facilitate religious \n        extremism into the United States by spreading anti-pluralistic \n        and anti-democratic ideologies.\n            (13) Saudi Arabia is a country that practices religious \n        apartheid and continuously subjugates its citizenry, both \n        Muslim and non-Muslim, to a specific interpretation of Islam. \n        Saudi Arabia is a country that, through its system of education \n        and segregation, is a breeding pool for terrorists. Saudi \n        Arabia is a country that exports through official government \n        agencies both terrorists and its discriminatory values. Saudi \n        Arabia is also a country that benefits from American money \n        through intermediate companies which fund such activities.\n\nSEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY RELATING TO DIVESTITURE FROM SAUDI ARABIA.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States to work to ensure that \nmanagers of United States Government pension plans or thrift savings \nplans, managers of pension plans maintained in the private sector by \nplan sponsors in the United States, and managers of mutual funds sold \nor distributed in the United States immediately initiate efforts to \ndivest all investments of such plans or funds in any bank or financial \ninstitution that directly or through a subsidiary has outstanding loans \nto or financial activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or its \ninstrumentalities. It shall further be the policy of the United States \nto ensure that assets from such divestitures are not to be invested in \nthe stocks, securities, or other obligations of any entity that \ndirectly or through a subsidiary is engaged in financial activities in \nSaudi Arabia or its instrumentalities.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY RELATING TO PROHIBITION ON FUTURE \n              INVESTMENT.\n\n     It shall be the policy of the United States to ensure that there \nis no future investment in any bank or financial institution that \ndirectly or through a subsidiary has outstanding loans to or financial \nactivities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or its instrumentalities. It \nshall further be the policy of the United States to ensure that no such \nassets are invested in the stocks, securities, or other obligations of \nany entity that directly or through a subsidiary is engaged in business \nwith Saudi Arabia or its instrumentalities.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and every six months thereafter, the Secretary \nof the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall \nsubmit to Congress a report on all investments sold, redeemed, \ndivested, or withdrawn from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or its \ninstrumentalities.\n    (b) Information to Be Included in Report.--The report required by \nsubsection (a) shall contain the following information with respect to \neach investment described in such subsection:\n            (1) The name or other identification of the entity.\n            (2) The amount of the investment in the entity.\n            (3) The progress made toward divestment.\n            (4) Efforts by the Department of the Treasury and \n        Department of Commerce to inform United States investors of \n        policies articulated in sections 3 and 4 of this Act and the \n        policies of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that this Act seeks to \n        address."
