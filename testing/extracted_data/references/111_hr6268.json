    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Wage Theft Prevention and Community \nPartnership Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Wage and hour violations are a serious and growing \n        problem for working Americans.\n            (2) According to a study by the Ford, Joyce, Hayne, and \n        Russell Sage Foundations, low-wage workers are routinely denied \n        proper overtime pay and are paid less then the minimum wage, \n        often resulting up to a 15-percent loss in pay.\n            (3) Widespread wage and hour violations place ethical \n        businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\n            (4) Wage and hour violations hurt local economies. State \n        and local governments lose vital tax revenues and spending \n        power when employers do not pay legally required wages and \n        workers receive less than full pay.\n            (5) Women are far more likely to suffer minimum wage \n        violations than men, while minority women suffer such \n        violations at a rate nearly triple the rate that white women \n        suffer such violations.\n            (6) Social service networks are further strained and \n        poverty increases when low-wage workers receive lower wages \n        than what is required by law.\n            (7) The Department of Labor and State departments of labor \n        could more adequately address wage and hour violations with a \n        significant partnership with stakeholders in the community.\n            (8) The Government Accountability Office recommended that \n        the Department of Labor identify ways to leverage its existing \n        tools to better address wage and hour violations by improving \n        services provided through partnerships.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act the following definitions apply:\n            (1) The term ``eligible partner'' means any of the \n        following:\n                    (A) A not-for-profit community organization that, \n                in whole or in part, is dedicated to combating poverty \n                and preventing abuse of wage and hour laws.\n                    (B) A labor organization as defined in section 2(5) \n                of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 152(5)).\n                    (C) A Joint Labor Management Cooperative Committee \n                established pursuant to section 205A of the Labor \n                Management Relations Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C. 175a).\n            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Labor.\n            (3) The term ``wage and hour violations'' refers to \n        violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act or the Migrant and \n        Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, or any regulations \n        issued under either such Act, or violations of any other law \n        enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of \n        Labor, as the Secretary may determine.\n\nSEC. 4.
