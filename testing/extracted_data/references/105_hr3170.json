GAINS FROM CONSTRUCTIVE OWNERSHIP TRANSACTIONS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--If the taxpayer has gain from a constructive \nownership transaction with respect to any financial position and such \ngain would (without regard to this section) be treated as a long-term \ncapital gain--\n            ``(1) such gain shall be treated as short-term capital gain \n        to the extent that such gain exceeds the net underlying long-\n        term capital gain, and\n            ``(2) to the extent such gain is treated as a long-term \n        capital gain after the application of paragraph (1), the \n        determination of the capital gain rate (or rates) applicable to \n        such gain under section 1(h) shall be determined on the basis \n        of the respective rate (or rates) that would

gain been \n                included in gross income ratably during the period the \n                constructive ownership transaction was open.\n        Any amount payable under this paragraph shall be taken into \n        account in computing the amount of any deduction allowable to \n        the taxpayer for interest paid or accrued during such taxable \n        year.\n            ``(2) No credits against increase in tax.--Any increase in \n        tax under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as tax imposed by \n        this chapter for purposes of determining--\n
