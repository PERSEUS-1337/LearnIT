FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) our Nation's schools are struggling to maintain an \n        environment that is conducive to learning and that fairly \n        educates girls and boys;\n            (2) recent studies show that women continue to be \n        underrepresented in careers in mathematical and scientific \n        fields because those fields are stereotyped as male \n        professions;\n            (3) because girls and young women are influenced at an \n        early age in making career choices, effective gender equity \n        training must occur in order to change the disparities in \n        mathematics and science achievement between girls and boys;\n            (4) a fundamental prerequisite for an effective learning \n        environment is that such environment be free from sexual \n        harassment and abuse as such harassment and abuse has a \n        measured impact on our children's school attendance, \n        concentration and class participation; and\n            (5) the Federal Government has an important role in \n        eliminating sexual harassment and abuse in our Nation's \n        schools, and providing a productive learning environment for \n        all students by encouraging education programs that include \n        training and technical assistance.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to enrich the quality of mathematics and science \n        education by encouraging gender-fair training, practices and \n        policies;\n            (2) to assist schools to eliminate sexual harassment and \n        abuse and to develop a safe and healthy learning environment; \n        and\n            (3) to improve overall instruction and training in all \n        federally funded education programs by increasing awareness of \n        the need for gender equity in education.\n\n      TITLE I--GENDER EQUITY IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE EDUCATION\n\nSEC. 101.
