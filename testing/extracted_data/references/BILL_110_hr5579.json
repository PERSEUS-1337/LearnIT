\n        and\n            (2) a servicer of pooled residential mortgage loans shall \n        be deemed to be acting on behalf of the securitization vehicle \n        in the best interest of all investors and holders of beneficial \n        interests in the pooled loans, in the aggregate, if for a loan \n        that is in payment default under the loan agreement or for \n        which payment default is imminent or reasonably foreseeable, \n        the loan servicer makes reasonable and documented efforts to \n        implement a modification or workout plan or, if such efforts \n        are unsuccessful or such plan would be infeasible, engages in \n        other loss mitigation, including accepting a short payment or \n        partial discharge of principal, or agreeing to a short sale of \n        the property, to the extent that the servicer reasonably \n        believes the particular modification or workout plan or other \n        mitigation actions will maximize the net present value to be \n        realized on the loan, including over that which would be \n        realized through foreclosure.\n    (b) Safe Harbor.--Absent contractual provisions to the contrary, a \nservicer of a residential mortgage loan that acts in a manner \nconsistent with the duty set forth in subsection (a), shall not be \nliable for entering into a qualified loan modification or workout plan, \nto--\n            (1) any person, based on that person's ownership of a \n        residential mortgage loan or any interest in a pool of \n        residential mortgage loans or in securities that distribute \n        payments out of the principal, interest and other payments in \n        loans on the pool;\n            (2) any person who is obligated pursuant to a derivatives \n        instrument to make payments determined in reference to any loan \n        or any interest referred to in paragraph (1); or\n            (3) any person that insures any loan or any interest \n        referred to in paragraph (1) under any law or regulation of the \n        United States or any law or regulation of any State or \n        political subdivision of any State.\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--No provision of this section shall be \nconstrued as limiting the ability of a servicer to enter into loan \nmodifications or workout plans other than qualified loan modification \nor workout plans.\n    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the following \ndefinitions shall apply:\n            (1) Qualified loan modification or workout plan.--The term \n        ``qualified loan modification or workout plan'' means a \n        modification or plan that--\n                    (A) is scheduled to remain in place until the \n                borrower sells or refinances the property, or for at \n                least 5 years from the date of adoption of the plan, \n                whichever is sooner;\n                    (B) does not provide for a repayment schedule that \n                results in negative amortization at any time;
