The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published reports related to past and potential shutdowns. The following documents investigate possible issues and provide historical context surrounding government shutdowns. U.S. Government Accountability Office, Government Shutdown: Three Departments Reporting Varying Degrees of Impacts on Operations, Grants, and Contracts , GAO-15-86, November 14, 2014, available at https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-86 . GAO reviewed how the 2013 shutdown affected some operations and services at three departments: the Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Transportation (DOT). GAO selected these three departments for review based on the value of grants and contracts, the percentage of employees expected to be furloughed, and the potential for longer-term effects. GAO recommended that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instruct agencies to document lessons learned in planning for and implementing a shutdown, as well as for resuming activities following a shutdown should a funding gap longer than five days occur in the future. OMB staff did not state whether they agreed or disagreed with the recommendation. U.S. General Accounting Office, Cost of the Recent Partial Shutdown of Government Offices , PAD-82-24, December 10, 1981, available at http://www.gao.gov/products/PAD-82-24 . According to GAO, this report was completed \"in response to congressional requests,\" for which \"GAO contacted 13 cabinet departments and 12 selected agencies and offices to obtain information about the costs of a 1981 partial shutdown of government offices.\" It includes cost estimates, background information about the costs, and GAO recommendations to Congress concerning agency operations in the event of a government shutdown. U.S. General Accounting Office, Funding Gaps Jeopardize Federal Government Operations , PAD-81-31, March 3, 1981, available at http://www.gao.gov/products/PAD-81-31 . According to GAO, as of March 1981, \"interruptions in federal agency funding at the beginning of the fiscal year (FY) and operations on continuing resolutions have become the norm rather than the exception.\" For years, many federal agencies continued to operate during a funding gap, while \"minimizing all nonessential operations and obligations, believing that Congress did not intend that agencies close down\" while waiting for the enactment of annual appropriations acts or continuing resolutions. During the FY1981 appropriations process, the President requested opinions on the Antideficiency Act from the then-U.S. Attorney General, Benjamin Civiletti. In two memoranda issued in 1980 and 1981, the Attorney General stated that the act required agencies to terminate all operations when their current appropriations expired. According to GAO, agencies were uncertain how to respond to the Attorney General's opinion and what activities they would be able to continue if appropriations expired. This GAO report outlines some of the problems surrounding late appropriations and funding gaps. It also includes Attorney General Civiletti's opinions within Appendices IV and VIII. U.S. General Accounting Office, Government Shutdown: Funding Lapse Furlough Information , GGD-96-52R, December 1, 1995, available at http://www.gao.gov/products/GGD-96-52R . GAO was asked to provide available information on the numbers of federal employees who might have been subject to furlough in the event of a second shutdown in 1995. GAO provided numbers that were based on plans provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to GAO in October 1995. The numbers included within this document do not represent actual furloughs. The numbers represent planned furloughs in advance of the two shutdowns, which occurred later in November and December\u2013January. U.S. General Accounting Office, Government Shutdown: Permanent Funding Lapse Legislation Needed , GGD-91-76, June 6, 1991, available at http://www.gao.gov/products/GGD-91-76 . In 1990, GAO issued a questionnaire to government agencies in an attempt to measure the effects of a partial shutdown which occurred on Columbus Day weekend. This report also includes estimates on the effects of a hypothetical three-day shutdown during a nonholiday workweek.

The November 1995 shutdown began on November 14, 1995, and ended on November 19, 1995. An estimated 800,000 federal employees were furloughed during the five full days of the shutdown. The furlough action was due to the expiration of a continuing resolution ( P.L. 104-31 ), which funded the government through November 13, 1995. On November 13, President William Clinton vetoed a second continuing resolution ( H.J.Res. 115 ) and a debt limit extension bill ( H.R. 2586 ) and instructed agencies to begin shutdown operations. The following presidential statements occurred during this time period.

Historical Context . The December 1995-January 1996 shutdown began on December 16, 1995, and ended on January 6, 1996. The shutdown was triggered by the expiration of a continuing funding resolution enacted on November 20, 1995 ( P.L. 104-56 ), which funded the government through December 15, 1995. This shutdown officially ended on January 6, with the passage of three continuing resolutions (CRs) ( P.L. 104-91 , P.L. 104-92 , and P.L. 104-94 ). There were five additional short-term continuing resolutions needed to prevent further funding gaps from occurring through April 26, 1996, when the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-134 ) was enacted to fund any agencies or programs not yet funded through FY1996.

Historical Context . A shutdown occurred at the beginning of FY2014 (October 1, 2013) and lasted for a total of 16 full days. At the beginning of the fiscal year, none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2014 were enacted. In addition, a continuing resolution to provide temporary funding for the previous year's projects and activities had also not been enacted. On September 30, however, an automatic continuing resolution was enacted that covered FY2014 pay and allowances for (1) certain members of the Armed Forces, (2) certain Department of Defense (DOD) civilian personnel, and (3) other specified DOD and Department of Homeland Security contractors ( P.L. 113-39 ).  A continuing resolution was signed into law ( P.L. 113-46 ) on October 17, 2013, which ended the shutdown and allowed government departments and agencies to reopen.

Historical Context. At the beginning of FY2018, none of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted, so the federal government operated under a series of CRs. The first, P.L. 115-56 , provided government-wide funding through December 8, 2017. The second, P.L. 115-90 , extended funding through December 22, and the third, P.L. 115-96 , extended it through January 19, 2018.  In the absence of agreement on legislation that would further extend the period of these CRs, a funding gap began with the expiration of P.L. 115-96 at midnight on January 19. A furlough of federal personnel began over the weekend and continued through Monday of the following week, ending with enactment of a fourth CR, P.L. 115-120 , on January 22.

Historical Context. The December 2018-January 2019 partial government shutdown began on December 22, 2018, and ended on January 25, 2019. At the beginning of FY2019 (October 1, 2018), five of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted in consolidated appropriations bills and the other seven appropriations bills were funded under two CRs. The first CR , P.L. 115-245 , provided funding for these remaining seven appropriations bills through December 7, 2018. The second CR, P.L. 115-298 , extended funding for these seven appropriations bills through December 21, 2018. When no agreement was reached on legislation to further extend the period of these CRs for the remaining seven appropriations bills, a funding gap began with the expiration of the funding in P.L. 115-298 at midnight at the end of the day on December 21, 2018.  The funding gap ended when a CR was signed into law on January 25, 2019, which ended the partial government shutdown and allowed government departments and agencies to reopen. The partial government shutdown lasted 35 days making it the longest shutdown in history, compared with other shutdowns that have occurred since key Department of Justice opinions were issued in 1980 and 1981. The following presidential statements occurred during the time period of December 21, 2019, through January 25, 2019, and included discussion of the shutdown.
