SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nutraceutical \nResearch and Education Act''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \nexpressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \nprovision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \nother provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Consumers spend annually an estimated $12,000,000,000 \n        on dietary supplements and billions more on medical and similar \n        foods. Nevertheless, the health benefits of these products have \n        not, in most cases, been demonstrated by clinical testing or \n        other means. In consequence, specific health claims may not be \n        advanced for them. Consumers are thus left uncertain as to the \n        value of these products in promoting health and well-being, and \n        preventing or reducing the risk of disease, including the \n        management of a disease or condition. The companies that \n        produce these products desire to provide them to consumers with \n        specific health claims based on clinical testing. The Federal \n        Government demands sound scientific evidence of safety and \n        effectiveness in order to fulfill its statutory mandate to \n        protect and promote the public health.\n            (2) Because dietary supplements and similar foods are \n        natural products widely available without a strong proprietary \n        position, a person who now finances the cost of research \n        successfully demonstrating the health benefits of such a \n        product receives no special economic benefit in the marketplace \n        to repay that cost. Others, who have not contributed to those \n        research costs, may nevertheless embrace the findings of that \n        research to support identical claims for their own versions of \n        the product. Without economic incentive to research and develop \n        new products, those who would finance the cost of research are \n        presently focusing their efforts on promotional activities to \n        the disservice of the public interest and health.\n            (3) It is in the national interest to encourage clinical \n        research into the health benefits of dietary supplements, \n        medical foods, and other foods.\n            (4) Current regulatory and epistemological chaos exists \n        with regard to health claims for foods, dietary supplement, and \n        medical foods. It is in the national interest to provide a \n        category of products that have recognized health benefits but \n        are not drugs and to recognize that these products are safe \n        when used as indicated on their labeling.\n            (5) It is necessary to promote research into the health \n        benefits of dietary supplements, medical foods, and other foods \n        and to require that these health benefits be established by the \n        results of clinical studies.\n            (6) It is necessary to establish a regulatory system within \n        the Food and Drug Administration for reviewing health claims of \n        health benefits of such products which is less burdensome than \n        the traditional regulatory scheme for drugs and to stimulate \n        the industry to devote resources to proving the health claims \n        anticipated under this Act since such claims relate to the \n        possibility of preventing or reducing the risk of disease, \n        including the management of a disease or health condition.\n            (7) It is necessary to update the present regulatory scheme \n        to reflect the fact that such products can safely prevent \n        disease and health conditions, manage or improve health, or \n        reduce the risk of disease.\n    (b) Statement of Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) promote research into the health benefits of dietary \n        supplements, medical foods, and other foods;\n            (2) establish a simplified process within the Food and Drug \n        Administration for reviewing, on a case by case method, health \n        claims of health benefits of such nutraceutical products made \n        under a petition under section 403(r)(4) of the Federal Food, \n        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(3));\n            (3) prescribe a period of exclusive marketing protection \n        for a person that demonstrates the health benefits of a dietary \n        supplement, medical food, or other food, and who markets such \n        product in association with approved labeling that describes \n        its contribution to human health; and\n            (4) confirm the health benefits of these products as \n        determined by clinical trials, and disseminate this information \n        to the public and the health care profession, so that the \n        public and the health care profession may integrate this \n        knowledge into practice.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 201 (21 U.S.C 321) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(kk) The term `nutraceutical' means a dietary supplement, food, \nor medical food, as respectively defined in paragraphs (f) and (ff) and \nsection 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee(b)(3)), that--\n                    ``(1) possesses health benefits; and\n                    ``(2) is safe for human consumption in such \n                quantity, and with such frequency, as required to \n                realize such properties.\n    ``(ll) The term `health benefit', when used with reference to a \nnutraceutical, means a benefit which prevents or reduces the risk of a \ndisease or health condition, including the management of a disease or \nhealth condition or the improvement of health.\n\nSEC. 4.

The results of the \n        clinical trial must demonstrate and characterize the beneficial \n        relationship or the significance of the relationship of the \n        nutraceutical in such product to a disease or its affects on a \n        health related condition, health problem, or health status. The \n        clinical trial must have a sufficient size to prove the \n        benefits and may have as its endpoints either surrogate markers \n        or clinical endpoints to support the claim. The application may \n        also include epidemiological or preclinical studies in support \n        of the clinical trial.
