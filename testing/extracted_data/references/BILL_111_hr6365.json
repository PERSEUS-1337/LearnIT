FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States supports the people of the Russian \n        Federation in their efforts to realize their full economic \n        potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and the rule \n        of law.\n            (2) The Russian Federation is a member of the United \n        Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n        Europe, and the International Monetary Fund, has ratified the \n        Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n        Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant \n        on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on \n        Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the United Nations \n        Convention against Corruption, and is bound by the legal \n        obligations set forth in the European Convention of Human \n        Rights.\n            (3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect \n        obligations and responsibilities through the adoption of \n        international agreements and treaties, which must be observed \n        in good faith in order to maintain the stability of the \n        international order. Human rights are an integral part of \n        international law, and lie at the foundation of the \n        international order. The protection of human rights, therefore, \n        particularly in the case of a country that has incurred \n        obligations to protect human rights under an international \n        agreement to which it is a party, is not left exclusively to \n        the internal affairs of that country.\n            (4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are \n        instrumental in the protection of human rights and in achieving \n        sustainable economic growth, which benefits both the people of \n        the Russian Federation and the international community through \n        the creation of open and transparent markets.\n            (5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in \n        democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights \n        protections; this is the case when public officials are allowed \n        to abuse their authority with impunity for political or \n        financial gains in collusion with private entities.\n            (6) The President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry \n        Medvedev, has addressed corruption in many public speeches, \n        including stating in his 2009 address to Russia's Federal \n        Assembly, ``[Z]ero tolerance of corruption should become part \n        of our national culture . . . In Russia we often say that there \n        are few cases in which corrupt officials are prosecuted . . . \n        [S]imply incarcerating a few will not resolve the problem. But \n        incarcerated they must be.''. President Medvedev went on to \n        say, ``We shall overcome underdevelopment and corruption \n        because we are a strong and free people, and deserve a normal \n        life in a modern, prosperous democratic society.''. \n        Furthermore, President Medvedev has acknowledged Russia's \n        disregard for the rule of law and used the term ``legal \n        nihilism'' to describe a criminal justice system that continues \n        to imprison innocent people.\n            (7) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his \n        arbitrary detention and mistreatment in custody, by the same \n        officers of the Russian Interior Ministry that Mr. Magnitsky \n        had implicated in the embezzlement of funds from the Russian \n        Treasury, reflects how deeply the protection of human rights is \n        affected by corruption. Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky died on \n        November 16, 2009, at the age of 37, in Matrosskaya Tishina \n        Prison in Moscow, Russia, and is survived by a wife and two \n        sons.\n            (8) There is extensive evidence that public officials from \n        the Russian Interior Ministry, the Russian Federal Tax \n        Authorities, the Russian General Prosecutor's Office, the \n        Russian Federal Security Service, as well as Russian regional \n        courts and the prison system have abused their powers and \n        positions to commit serious human rights violations, embezzled \n        funds from the Russian Treasury, and retaliated against \n        whistleblowers.\n            (9) The Public Oversight Commission for the Observance of \n        Human Rights in Penitentiary Centers of the city of Moscow, an \n        organization empowered by Russian law to independently monitor \n        prison conditions, concluded that ``A man who is kept in \n        custody and is being detained is not capable of using all the \n        necessary means to protect either his life or his health. This \n        is a responsibility of a state which holds him captive. \n        Therefore, the case of Sergei Magnitsky can be described as a \n        breach of the right to life. The members of the civic \n        supervisory commission have reached the conclusion that \n        Magnitsky had been experiencing both psychological and physical \n        pressure in custody, and the conditions in some of the wards of \n        Butyrka can be justifiably called torturous. The people \n        responsible for this must be punished.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
