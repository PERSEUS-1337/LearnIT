FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n        (1) June 15 through August 10, 1994, marks the 50th anniversary \n    of the Mariana campaign of World War II in which American forces \n    captured the islands of Saipan and Tinian in the Northern Marianas \n    and liberated the United States Territory of Guam from Japanese \n    occupation;\n        (2) an attack during this campaign by the Japanese Imperial \n    fleet, aimed at countering the American forces that had landed on \n    Saipan, led to the battle of the Philippine Sea, which resulted in a \n    crushing defeat for the Japanese by United States naval forces and \n    the destruction of the effectiveness of the Japanese carrier-based \n    airpower;\n        (3) the recapture of Guam liberated one of the few pieces of \n    United States territory that was occupied for two and one-half years \n    by the enemy during World War II and restored freedom to the \n    indigenous Chamorros on Guam who suffered as a result of the \n    Japanese occupation;\n        (4) Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard units \n    distinguished themselves with their heroic bravery and sacrifice;\n        (5) the Guam Insular Force Guard, the Guam militia, and the \n    people of Guam earned the highest respect for their defense of the \n    island during the Japanese invasion and their resistance during the \n    occupation; their assistance to the American forces as scouts for \n    the American invasion was invaluable; and their role, as members of \n    the Guam Combat Patrol, was instrumental in seeking out the \n    remaining Japanese forces and restoring peace to the island;\n        (6) during the occupation, the people of Guam--\n            (A) were forcibly removed from their homes;\n            (B) were relocated to remote sections of the island;\n            (C) were required to perform forced labor and faced other \n        harsh treatment, injustices, and death; and\n            (D) were placed in concentration camps when the American \n        invasion became imminent and were brutalized by their occupiers \n        when the liberation of Guam became apparent to the Japanese;\n        (7) the liberation of the Mariana Islands marked a pivotal point \n    in the Pacific war and led to the American victories at Iwo Jima, \n    Okinawa, the Philippines, Taiwan, and the south China coast, and \n    ultimately against the Japanese home islands;\n        (8) the Mariana Islands of Guam, Saipan, and Tinian provided, \n    for the first time during the war, air bases which allowed land-\n    based American bombers to reach strategic targets in Japan; and\n        (9) the air offensive conducted from the Marianas against the \n    Japanese war-making capability helped shorten the war and ultimately \n    reduced the toll of lives to secure peace in the Pacific.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n        (1) an appropriate commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the \n    Mariana campaign should be planned by the United States in \n    conjunction with the Government of Guam and the Government of the \n    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands;\n        (2) the Secretary of the Interior should take all necessary \n    steps to ensure that appropriate visitor facilities at War in the \n    Pacific National Historical Park on Guam are expeditiously developed \n    and constructed; and\n        (3) the Secretary of the Interior should take all necessary \n    steps to ensure that the monument referenced in section 3(b) is \n    completed before July 21, 1994, for the 50th anniversary \n    commemoration, to provide adequate historical interpretation of the \n    events described in section 1.\n\nSEC. 3.
