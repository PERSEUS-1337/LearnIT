FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The illegal importation of 3,4-methylenedioxy \n        methamphetamine, commonly referred to as ``MDMA'' or \n        ``Ecstasy'', has increased in recent years, as evidenced by the \n        fact that Ecstasy seizures by the United States Customs Service \n        have risen from less than 500,000 tablets during fiscal year \n        1997 to more than 4,000,000 tablets during the first 5 months \n        of fiscal year 2000.\n            (2) Use of Ecstasy can cause long-lasting, and perhaps \n        permanent, damage to the serotonin system of the brain, which \n        is fundamental to the integration of information and emotion, \n        and this damage can cause long-term problems with learning and \n        memory.\n            (3) Due to the popularity and marketability of Ecstasy, \n        there are numerous Internet websites with information on its \n        effects, production, and the locations of use, often referred \n        to as ``raves''. The availability of this information targets \n        the primary users of Ecstasy, who are most often college \n        students, young professionals, and other young people from \n        middle- to high-income families.\n            (4) Greater emphasis needs to be placed on--\n                    (A) penalties associated with the manufacture, \n                distribution, and use of Ecstasy;\n                    (B) the education of young people on the negative \n                health effects of Ecstasy, since the reputation of \n                Ecstasy as a ``safe'' drug is it's most dangerous \n                component;\n                    (C) the education of State and local law \n                enforcement agencies regarding the growing problem of \n                Ecstasy trafficking across the United States;\n                    (D) reducing the number of deaths caused by Ecstasy \n                use and its combined use with other ``club'' drugs and \n                alcohol; and\n                    (E) adequate funding for research by the National \n                Institute on Drug Abuse to--\n                            (i) identify those most vulnerable to using \n                        Ecstasy and develop science-based prevention \n                        approaches tailored to the specific needs of \n                        individuals at high risk;\n                            (ii) understand how Ecstasy produces its \n                        toxic effects and how to reverse neurotoxic \n                        damage;\n                            (iii) develop treatments, including new \n                        medications and behavioral treatment \n                        approaches;\n                            (iv) better understand the effects that \n                        Ecstasy has on the developing children and \n                        adolescents; and\n                            (v) translate research findings into useful \n                        tools and ensure their effective dissemination.\n\nSEC. 3. ENHANCED PUNISHMENT OF ECSTASY TRAFFICKERS.\n\n    (a) Amendment to Federal Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant to its \nauthority under section 994(p) of title 28, United States Code, the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission shall amend the Federal sentencing \nguidelines regarding any offense relating to the manufacture, \nimportation, or exportation of, or trafficking in--\n            (1) 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine;\n            (2) 3,4-methylenedioxy amphetamine;\n            (3) 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine; or\n            (4) any other controlled substance, as determined by the \n        Sentencing Commission in consultation with the Attorney \n        General, that is marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a \n        chemical structure substantially similar to that of 3,4-\n        methylenedioxy methamphetamine or and effect on the central \n        nervous system substantially similar to or greater than that of \n        3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine;\n(including an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in \nparagraph (1), (2), (3), or (4)) in violation of the Controlled \nSubstances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances \nImport and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law \nEnforcement Act (46 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.).\n    (b) General Requirement.--In carrying out this section, the United \nStates Sentencing Commission shall, with respect to each offense \ndescribed in subsection (a)--\n            (1) review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to \n        provide for increased penalties such that those penalties are \n        comparable to the base offense levels for offenses involving \n        any methamphetamine mixture; and\n            (2) take any other action the Commission considers to be \n        necessary to carry out this subsection.\n    (c) Additional Requirements.--In carrying out this section, the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission shall ensure that the Federal \nsentencing guidelines for offenders convicted of offenses described in \nsubsection (a) reflect--\n            (1) the need for aggressive law enforcement action with \n        respect to offenses involving the controlled substances \n        described in subsection (a); and\n            (2) the dangers associated with unlawful activity involving \n        such substances, including--\n                    (A) the rapidly growing incidence of abuse of the \n                controlled substances described in subsection (a) and \n                the threat to public safety that such abuse poses;\n                    (B) the recent increase in the illegal importation \n                of the controlled substances described in subsection \n                (a);\n                    (C) the young age at which children are beginning \n                to use the controlled substances described in \n                subsection (a); and\n                    (D) any other factor that the Sentencing Commission \n                deems appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4.
