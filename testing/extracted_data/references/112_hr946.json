FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are 13 groups of salmon and steelhead that are \n        listed as threatened species or endangered species under the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 that migrate through the lower \n        Columbia River.\n            (2) The people of the Northwest United States are united in \n        their desire to restore healthy salmon and steelhead runs, as \n        they are integral to the region's culture and economy.\n            (3) The Columbia River treaty tribes retain important \n        rights with respect to salmon and steelhead.\n            (4) Federal, State, and tribal governments have spent \n        billions of dollars to assist the recovery of Columbia River \n        salmon and steelhead populations.\n            (5) One of the factors impacting salmonid populations is \n        increased predation by marine mammals, including California sea \n        lions.\n            (6) The population of California sea lions has increased 6-\n        fold over the last 3 decades, and is currently greater than \n        300,000.\n            (7) In recent years, over 1,000 California sea lions have \n        been entering the lower 205 miles of the Columbia River up to \n        Miller Island during the peak spring salmonid run before \n        returning to the California coast to mate.\n            (8) The percentage of the spring salmonid run that has been \n        eaten or killed by California sea lions at Bonneville dam has \n        increased 7-fold since 2002.\n            (9) In recent years, California sea lions have with greater \n        frequency congregated near Bonneville dam and have entered the \n        fish ladders.\n            (10) Some of these California sea lions have not been \n        responsive to extensive hazing methods employed near Bonneville \n        dam to discourage this behavior.\n            (11) The process established under the 1994 amendment to \n        the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to address aggressive \n        sea lion behavior is protracted and will not work in a timely \n        enough manner to protect threatened and endangered salmonids in \n        the near term.\n            (12) In the interest of protecting Columbia River \n        threatened and endangered salmonids, a temporary expedited \n        procedure is urgently needed to allow removal of the minimum \n        number of California sea lions as is necessary to protect the \n        passage of threatened and endangered salmonids in the Columbia \n        River or its tributaries.\n            (13) On December 21, 2010, the independent Pinniped-Fishery \n        Interaction Task Force recommended lethally removing more of \n        the California sea lions in 2011.\n\nSEC. 3.
