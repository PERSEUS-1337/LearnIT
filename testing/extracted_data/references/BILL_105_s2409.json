FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Technological progress is the single most important \n        determining factor in sustaining growth in the Nation's \n        economy. It is estimated that technological innovation has \n        accounted for as much as half the Nation's long-term economic \n        growth over the past 50 years and will account for an even \n        higher percentage in the next 50 years.\n            (2) The number of jobs requiring technological expertise is \n        growing rapidly. For example, it is estimated that 1,300,000 \n        new computer engineers, programmers, and systems analysts will \n        be needed over the next decade in the United States economy. \n        Yet, our Nation's computer science programs are only graduating \n        25,000 students with bachelor's degrees yearly.\n            (3) There are more than 350,000 information technology \n        positions currently unfilled throughout the United States, and \n        the number of students graduating from colleges with computer \n        science degrees has declined dramatically.\n            (4) In order to help alleviate the shortage of graduates \n        with technology-based education and skills, businesses in a \n        number of States have formed partnerships with colleges, \n        universities, community-technical schools, and other \n        institutions of higher learning to give lectures, donate \n        equipment, plan curricula, and perform other activities \n        designed to help students acquire the skills and knowledge \n        needed to fill jobs in technology-based industries.\n            (5) Congress should encourage these partnerships by \n        providing a tax credit to businesses that enter into them. Such \n        a tax credit will help students obtain the knowledge and skills \n        they need to obtain jobs in technology-based industries which \n        are among the best paying jobs being created in the economy. \n        The credit will also assist businesses in their efforts to \n        develop a more highly-skilled, better trained workforce that \n        can fill the technology jobs such businesses are creating.\n\nSEC. 3. ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR BUSINESS-PROVIDED STUDENT EDUCATION AND \n              TRAINING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to business related \ncredits) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 45D.
