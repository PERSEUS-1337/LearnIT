FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1996, the international community created the \n        Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (the HIPC \n        Initiative) to reduce the debt burden that curtailed spending \n        on economic development and poverty-reducing programs in many \n        impoverished countries.\n            (2) Since adoption of the original HIPC Initiative in 1996 \n        and the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in 1999, donor countries have \n        committed more than $50,000,000,000 in bilateral and \n        multilateral debt stock cancellation to eligible countries.\n            (3) The 27 countries that have received debt relief through \n        the HIPC Initiative are estimated by World Bank and the \n        International Monetary Fund to have increased poverty reduction \n        expenditures by an average of approximately 75 percent between \n        1999 and 2004.\n            (4) Congress has demonstrated its support for bilateral and \n        multilateral debt relief through the enactment of comprehensive \n        debt relief initiatives for heavily indebted poor countries by \n        title V of H.R. 3425 of the 106th Congress, as enacted into law \n        by section 1000(a)(5) of the Act entitled ``An Act making \n        consolidated appropriations for the fiscal year ending \n        September 30, 2000, and for other purposes'', approved November \n        29, 1999 (Public Law 106-113; 113 Stat. 1501-311) and the \n        amendments made by such title, title II of H.R. 5526 of the \n        106th Congress, as enacted into law by section 101(a) of the \n        Act entitled ``An Act making appropriations for foreign \n        operations, export financing, and related programs for the \n        fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other \n        purposes'', approved November 6, 2000 (Public Law 106-429; 114 \n        Stat. 1900A-5), and title V of the United States Leadership \n        Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Public \n        Law 108-25; 117 Stat. 747) and the amendment made by such \n        title.\n            (5) A number of countries, including the United States, \n        have canceled 100 percent of the bilateral loans made by such \n        countries to countries that are eligible for debt relief under \n        the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and other major donor nations \n        have canceled a large percentage of such loans, however, a \n        number of countries eligible for such debt relief will continue \n        to owe substantial debts to international financial \n        institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the \n        International Development Association, and the African \n        Development Fund.\n            (6) Permanently canceling 100 percent of the debt owed by \n        the countries that are eligible for debt relief under the \n        Enhanced HIPC Initiative to multilateral institutions would \n        allow countries to increase investments in economic and social \n        infrastructure, including improving the quality of and access \n        to health care, education, and poverty reduction programs, and \n        thereby help them to move towards sustainable economic growth \n        and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set out in \n        United Nations Millennium Declaration, resolution 55/1 adopted \n        by the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 8, \n        2000, for eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and promoting \n        human development.\n            (7) On June 11, 2005, finance ministers representing the \n        members of the Group of 8 agreed to make a proposal, prior to \n        September 2005, to the shareholders of the World Bank, the \n        International Monetary Fund, and the African Development Bank, \n        for the immediate cancellation of 100 percent of the debt stock \n        owed to such institutions by 18 eligible countries, and the \n        eventual cancellation of such debt owed by an additional 20 \n        countries.\n            (8) That proposal would cancel approximately \n        $40,000,000,000 in debt stock owed by 18 countries immediately, \n        and would ultimately result in the cancellation of a total of \n        approximately $56,000,000,000 in debt stock owed by 38 \n        countries, saving such countries, on average, $1,500,000,000 \n        each year in debt service payments. To offset foregone interest \n        and principal repayments, donors would provide additional \n        resources to the World Bank and African Development Bank for \n        grants and lending to the poorest countries for investments in \n        the health, education, and well-being of the people of such \n        countries.\n\nSEC. 3.
