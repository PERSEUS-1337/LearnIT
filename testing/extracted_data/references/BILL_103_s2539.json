FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (referred to in this \n        section as the ``Act'') to recognize and settle the aboriginal \n        claims of Alaska Natives to the lands Alaska Natives had used \n        for traditional purposes.\n            (2) The Act awarded approximately $1,000,000,000 and \n        44,000,000 acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for the \n        establishment of Native corporations to receive and manage such \n        funds and land.\n            (3) Pursuant to the Act, Alaska Natives have been enrolled \n        in one of thirteen Regional Corporations.\n            (4) Most Alaska Natives reside in communities that are \n        eligible to form a Village or Urban Corporation under the Act \n        within the geographical area of a Regional Corporation.\n            (5) Village or Urban Corporations established pursuant to \n        the Act received cash and surface rights to the settlement land \n        described in paragraph (2), and the corresponding Regional \n        Corporation received cash and land which includes the \n        subsurface rights to the land of the Village or Urban \n        Corporation.\n            (6) The southeastern Alaska communities of Haines, \n        Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell are not listed \n        under the Act as communities eligible to form Village or Urban \n        Corporations, even though the population of such villages \n        comprises greater than 20 percent of the shareholders of the \n        Regional Corporation of southeastern Alaska and display \n        historic, cultural and traditional qualities of Alaska Natives.\n            (7) The five communities described in paragraph (6) have \n        sought full eligibility for lands and benefits under the Act \n        for more than two decades.\n            (8) In 1993, Congress directed the Secretary of the \n        Interior to prepare a report examining the reasons why the \n        communities listed in paragraph (6) had been denied eligibility \n        to form Village or Urban Corporations under the Act and receive \n        land and benefits pursuant to the Act.\n            (9) The report described in paragraph (8), published in \n        February, 1994, indicates that--\n                    (A) the five communities listed in paragraph (6) do \n                not differ significantly from the southeast Alaska \n                communities that were permitted to form Village or \n                Urban Corporations under the Act;\n                    (B) such communities are similar to other \n                communities that are eligible to form Village or Urban \n                Corporations under the Act and receive lands and \n                benefits under the Act--\n                            (i) in actual number and percentage of \n                        Native Alaskan population; and\n                            (ii) with respect to the historic use and \n                        occupation of land;\n                    (C) each such community was involved in advocating \n                the settlement of the aboriginal claims of the \n                community; and\n                    (D) some of the communities appeared on early \n                versions of lists of Native villages prepared before \n                the date of enactment of the Act, but were not included \n                as Native villages in the Act.\n            (10) The omissions described in paragraph (9)(D) are not \n        clearly explained in any provision of the Act or the \n        legislative history of the Act.\n            (11) On the basis of the findings described in paragraphs \n        (1) through (10), Alaska Natives who were enrolled in the five \n        unlisted communities and their heirs have been inadvertently \n        and wrongly denied the financial and cultural benefits of \n        enrollment in a Village or Urban Corporation established \n        pursuant to such Act.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to redress the omission of \nthe five communities described in subsection (a)(6) from eligibility--\n            (1) to form Village or Urban Corporations under the Act; \n        and\n            (2) to receive certain settlement lands pursuant to the \n        Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
