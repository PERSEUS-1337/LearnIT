    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Opportunity Investment Trust \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The First Morrill Act (7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), enacted \n        in 1862, and the Second Morrill Act (7 U.S.C. 321 et seq.), \n        enacted in 1890, brought about a significant change in the \n        system of education in the United States by providing for the \n        sale of public lands in the West and the dedication of the \n        proceeds of those sales to funding the establishment of \n        practical, accessible land grant colleges and universities \n        across the Nation.\n            (2) The land grant colleges and universities have a focus \n        on research, teaching, and outreach, and continue to this day \n        to be leaders in higher education by providing affordable \n        access to high-quality postsecondary education.\n            (3) The land grant colleges and universities also emerged \n        as one of the greatest sources of advanced research that \n        leverages the United States economy and powers the Nation's \n        global competitiveness.\n            (4) The land grant colleges and universities, in \n        conjunction with the Cooperative State Research, Education, and \n        Extension Service, serve to disseminate information learned \n        from research and link research activities to larger societal \n        needs.\n            (5) The potential of advanced Internet, digital spectrum, \n        and other telecommunications technologies to increase the \n        quality and reach of educational resources has barely been \n        tapped.\n            (6) Numerous local and regional educational and community \n        organizations are repositories of knowledge, information, and \n        educational resources and programs that, in terms of \n        accessibility to the potential beneficiaries, are fragmented \n        and uncoordinated.\n            (7) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Balanced \n        Budget Act of 1997 established a framework for the transitions \n        from analog to digital television and for the auction of \n        publicly owned analog spectrum.\n            (8) It has been estimated that the auction of analog \n        spectrum could yield over $20,000,000,000 in revenues for the \n        Treasury of the United States.\n            (9) It is both necessary and appropriate that a substantial \n        portion of the auction funds, stemming as they do from the \n        telecommunications sector, be returned for use in that sector. \n        Therefore, there should be created a multibillion dollar trust, \n        with the trust's funding coming from revenues earned by the \n        Federal Government from auctions of the publicly owned \n        electromagnetic spectrum, which is the 21st century equivalent \n        of the Nation's public lands of an earlier time.\n\nSEC. 3.
