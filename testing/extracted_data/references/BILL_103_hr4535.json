Until the \nearlier of the effective date of such rule or regulation or 240 days \nafter such date of enactment, such interval shall begin at the opening \nof trading on the day on which such security commences trading on the \nnational securities exchange with which such security is registered and \nend at the conclusion of the next day of trading.\n    ``(D) The Commission may prescribe, by rule or regulation such \nadditional procedures or requirements for extending unlisted trading \nprivileges to any security as the Commission deems necessary or \nappropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the \nprotection of investors and the public interest, or otherwise in \nfurtherance of the purposes of this title.\n    ``(E) No extension of unlisted trading privileges to securities \ndescribed in subparagraph (A)(ii) may occur except pursuant to a rule, \nregulation, or order of the Commission approving such extension or \nextensions. In promulgating such rule or regulation or in issuing such \norder, the Commission--\n        ``(i) shall find that such extension or extensions of unlisted \n    trading privileges is consistent with the maintenance of fair and \n    orderly markets, the protection of investors and the public \n    interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this \n    title;\n        ``(ii) shall take account of the public trading activity in \n    such securities, the character of such trading, the impact of such \n    extension on the existing markets for such securities, and the \n    desirability of removing impediments to and the progress that has \n    been made toward the development of a national market system; and\n        ``(iii) shall not permit a national securities exchange to \n    extend unlisted trading privileges to such securities if any rule \n    of such national securities exchange would unreasonably impair the \n    ability of a dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such \n    securities for its own account, or would unreasonably restrict \n    competition among dealers in such securities or between such \n    dealers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists \n    and such dealers who are not specialists.\n    ``(F) An exchange may continue to extend unlisted trading \nprivileges in accordance with this paragraph only if the exchange and \nthe subject security continue to satisfy the requirements for \neligibility under this paragraph, including any rules and regulations \nissued by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph, except that \nunlisted trading privileges may continue with regard to securities \nwhich had been admitted on such exchange prior to July 1, 1964, \nnotwithstanding the failure to satisfy such requirements. If unlisted \ntrading privileges in a security are discontinued pursuant to this \nsubparagraph, the exchange shall cease trading in that security, unless \nthe exchange and the subject security thereafter satisfy the \nrequirements of this paragraph and the rules issued hereunder.\n    ``(G) For purposes of this paragraph--\n        ``(i) a security is the subject of an initial public offering \n    if--\n            ``(I) the offering of the subject security is registered \n        under the Securities Act of 1933; and\n            ``(II) the issuer of the security, immediately prior to \n        filing the registration statement with respect to the offering, \n        was not subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or \n        15(d) of this title; and\n        ``(ii) an initial public offering of such security commences at \n    the opening of trading on the day on which such security commences \n    trading on the national securities exchange with which such \n    security is registered.\n    ``(2)(A) At any time within 60 days of commencement of trading on \nan exchange of a security pursuant to unlisted trading privileges, the \nCommission may summarily suspend such unlisted trading privileges on \nthe exchange. Such suspension shall not be reviewable under section 25 \nof this title and shall not be deemed to be a final agency action for \npurposes of section 704 of title 5, United States Code. Upon such \nsuspension--\n        ``(i) the exchange shall cease trading in the security by the \n    close of business on the date of such suspension, or at such time \n    as the Commission may prescribe by rule or order for the \n    maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of \n    investors and the public interest, or otherwise in furtherance of \n    the purposes of this title; and\n        ``(ii) if the exchange seeks to extend unlisted trading \n    privileges to the security, the exchange shall file an application \n    to reinstate its ability to do so with the Commission pursuant to \n    such procedures as the Commission may prescribe by rule or order \n    for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of \n    investors and the public interest, or otherwise in furtherance of \n    the purposes of this title.\n    ``(B) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect \nuntil the Commission, by order, grants approval of an application to \nreinstate, as described in subparagraph (A)(ii).\n    ``(C) A suspension under subparagraph (A) shall not affect the \nvalidity or force of an extension of unlisted trading privileges in \neffect prior to such suspension.\n    ``(D) The Commission shall not approve an application by a national \nsecurities exchange to reinstate its ability to extend unlisted trading \nprivileges to a security unless the Commission finds, after notice and \nopportunity for hearing, that the extension of unlisted trading \nprivileges pursuant to such application is consistent with the \nmaintenance of fair and orderly markets, the protection of investors \nand the public interest, and otherwise in furtherance of the purposes \nof this title. If the application is made to reinstate unlisted trading \nprivileges to a security described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), the \nCommission--\n        ``(i) shall take account of the public trading activity in such \n    security, the character of such trading, the impact of such \n    extension on the existing markets for such a security, and the \n    desirability of removing impediments to and the progress that has \n    been made toward the development of a national market system; and\n        ``(ii) shall not grant any such application if any rule of the \n    national securities exchange making application under this \n    subsection would unreasonably impair the ability of a dealer to \n    solicit or effect transactions in such security for its own \n    account, or would unreasonably restrict competition among dealers \n    in such security or between such dealers acting in the capacity of \n    marketmakers who are specialists and such dealers who are not \n    specialists.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 12(f)(3) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l(f)(3)) is amended by striking ``The \nCommission'' and inserting ``Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the \nCommission''.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
