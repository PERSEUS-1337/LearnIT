DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n                    (A) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n                Transportation of the Senate;\n                    (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n                Senate;\n                    (C) the Committee on Homeland Security and \n                Governmental Affairs of the Senate;\n                    (D) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n                    (E) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House \n                of Representatives;\n                    (F) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House \n                of Representatives; and\n                    (G) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n                Representatives.\n            (2) Foreign terrorist organization.--The term ``foreign \n        terrorist organization'' means an organization that is \n        designated by the Secretary of State as a foreign terrorist \n        organization pursuant to section 219(a) of the Immigration and \n        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)).\n            (3) Nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance.--\n        The term ``nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign \n        assistance'' has the meaning given the term in section 103 of \n        the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. \n        7102).\n\nSEC. 3. FOREIGN PARTNER ENGAGEMENT PLAN.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Consistent with the final report of the Committee on \nHomeland Security of the House of Representatives's bipartisan Task \nForce on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, Congress makes \nthe following findings:\n            (1) It is important for the national security of the United \n        States to assist foreign partners in closing security gaps that \n        may allow terrorists and foreign fighters to avoid detection \n        while traveling internationally.\n            (2) Building foreign partner capacity to combat terrorist \n        travel helps extend the United States security beyond its \n        border to mitigate threats before they reach the United States.\n            (3) Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, United States \n        Government departments and agencies have spent billions of \n        dollars helping foreign partners improve their security against \n        terrorist travel, including by providing such partners with \n        technical assistance, equipment, training, and other tools.\n            (4) The lack of a United States Government-wide, risk-based \n        approach increases the likelihood that--\n                    (A) systematic security gaps abroad will persist; \n                and\n                    (B) the United States Government will not maximize \n                its response efforts to close such gaps.\n            (5) Failure to effectively coordinate capacity-building \n        activities also increases the likelihood of overlap, waste, and \n        unnecessary duplication between the United States and \n        international programs.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States Government must ensure capacity-\n        building assistance is coordinated--\n                    (A) among United States Government departments and \n                agencies; and\n                    (B) with foreign implementing partners; and\n            (2) such assistance should be prioritized for the highest-\n        risk countries for travel by terrorists and foreign fighters.\n    (c) Plan.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, and every two years thereafter in \n        conjunction with the President's budget submission to Congress \n        under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, until 2023, \n        the Secretary of State, in accordance with the protection of \n        intelligence sources and methods, shall develop and submit to \n        the appropriate congressional committees unclassified and \n        classified versions of a foreign partner engagement plan, \n        which--\n                    (A) catalogs existing capacity-building initiatives \n                abroad to combat travel by terrorists and foreign \n                fighters; and\n                    (B) identifies areas for adjustment to align \n                ongoing efforts with risk-based priorities.\n            (2) Coordination and consultation.--The plan required under \n        paragraph (1) shall be developed in coordination with all \n        relevant United States Government departments and agencies and \n        in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the \n        Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the \n        Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and \n        the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n            (3) Contents.--The plan required under paragraph (1) \n        shall--\n                    (A) include an assessment of the countries of \n                greatest concern and risk for travel to the United \n                States by members of foreign terrorist organizations \n                and foreign fighters, which may be based on the minimum \n                standards described in section 5(b) and other factors, \n                as appropriate, including--\n                            (i) the number of flights to the United \n                        States that originate from last points of \n                        departure in each country;\n                            (ii) visa waiver program status or visa \n                        application and denial rates for each country;\n                            (iii) recent threats, terrorist and foreign \n                        fighter travel trends, and the overall terror \n                        threat environment in each country; and\n                            (iv) other criteria identified by the \n                        Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n                        Homeland Security;\n                    (B) detail existing United States Government \n                programs, projects, and activities intended to build \n                the capacity of such countries to combat travel by \n                terrorists and foreign fighters, including estimated \n                spending levels by country, to the extent practicable; \n                and\n                    (C) outline a plan for prioritizing United States \n                Government resources toward countries referred to in \n                subparagraph (A), including--\n                            (i) efforts that should be reformed, \n                        consolidated, or eliminated;
