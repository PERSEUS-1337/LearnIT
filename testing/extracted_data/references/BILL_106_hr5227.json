PROGRAM EXPANSION.\n\n    The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act (20 U.S.C. 8241 et \nseq.) is amended to read as follows:\n\n           ``PART I--21ST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS\n\n``SEC. 10901. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    ``This part may be cited as the `21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Act'.\n\n``SEC. 10902. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Each day during the school year, millions of children \n        return to unsupervised homes after school. Each week, between \n        5,000,000 and 15,000,000 children return from school to empty \n        homes.\n            ``(2) Child care experts believe that there is a direct \n        correlation between the degree of after-school supervision and \n        grade completion. Students who have little or no after-school \n        supervision are more apt to receive poor grades or to drop out \n        of school than students who are engaged in supervised, \n        constructive activities.\n            ``(3) A recent study found that twice as many parents want \n        supervised after-school programs for their children than are \n        currently available.\n            ``(4) Statistically, most juvenile crime takes place \n        between the hours of 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. and our children \n        are most at risk of being victims of crime during the hours \n        after school. Quality after-school programs help to protect our \n        children while affording them enhanced opportunities to succeed \n        academically.\n            ``(5) Twenty-first century community learning centers serve \n        as a marvelous local resource for our communities to develop \n        the best strategies to integrate after-school programs into the \n        whole education of their youth. Strategies developed locally \n        best fit the unique needs of each community and those of its \n        school-aged citizens.\n\n``SEC. 10903.
