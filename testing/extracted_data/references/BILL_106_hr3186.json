FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A stated intent of the Congress in enacting the \n        Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to reduce regulation.\n            (2) Under existing law, the Department of Justice and the \n        Federal Trade Commission exercise primary authority to review \n        all mergers, including telecommunications industry mergers. The \n        Federal Communications Commission has only limited authority \n        under the Clayton Act to review telecommunications industry \n        mergers.\n            (3) The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \n        Commission have extensive expertise in analyzing issues of \n        industry concentration and its effects on competition. The \n        Federal Communications Commission has only limited expertise in \n        analyzing such issues.\n            (4) Notwithstanding the limitations on its Clayton Act \n        jurisdiction and on its substantive expertise, the Federal \n        Communications Commission exercises broad authority over \n        telecommunications industry mergers pursuant to the nonspecific \n        public interest standard and other provisions in the \n        Communications Act of 1934 that allow it to impose terms and \n        conditions on the assignment and transfer of licenses and other \n        authorizations.\n            (5) The Federal Communications Commission's exercise of \n        broad authority over telecommunications industry mergers \n        overreaches its intended statutory authority and its \n        substantive expertise and produces delay and inconsistency in \n        its decisions.\n            (6) Under existing law, parties to a proposed \n        telecommunications industry merger are unable to proceed \n        without the prior approval of the Federal Communications \n        Commission, even if the Department of Justice or the Federal \n        Trade Commission have already approved the merger.\n            (7) The Federal Communications Commission's existing \n        rulemaking and enforcement prerogatives constitute normal and \n        effective means of assuring that all licensees, including \n        parties to a telecommunications industry merger, operate in the \n        public interest.\n            (8) The primary jurisdiction and preeminent expertise of \n        the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on \n        all matters involving industry concentration and its effects on \n        competition, combined with the Federal Communications \n        Commission's existing rulemaking and enforcement prerogatives, \n        make the exercise of separate telecommunications industry \n        merger approval authority by the Federal Communications \n        Commission unnecessary.\n            (9) Because the duplication of effort, inconsistency, and \n        delay resulting from the Federal Communications Commission's \n        review of telecommunications industry mergers is unnecessary, \n        it imposes unwarranted costs on the industry, on the \n        Commission, and on the public, and it fails to serve the public \n        interest.\n\nSEC. 3. REPEAL OF MERGER APPROVAL AUTHORITY.\n\n    Section 11(a) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 21(a)) is amended by \nstriking ``in the Federal Communications Commission where applicable to \ncommon carriers engaged in wire or radio communication or radio \ntransmission of energy;''.\n\nSEC. 4. REPEAL OF AUTHORITY TO CONDITION LICENSES, ETC.\n\n    (a) Basic Administrative Authority.--Section 4(i) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 154(i)) is amended by adding at \nthe end thereof the following: ``The authority of the Commission to \nimpose terms or conditions on the transfer or assignment of any license \nor other authorization assigned or transferred in a merger or other \ntransaction subject to review by the Department of Justice or the \nFederal Trade Commission is subject to section 314.''.\n    (b) Public Convenience and Necessity.--Section 214(c) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 214(c)) is amended by inserting \nafter ``require.'' the following: ``The authority of the Commission to \nimpose terms or conditions on the transfer or assignment of any such \ncertificate assigned or transferred in a merger or other transaction \nsubject to review by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade \nCommission is subject to section 314.''.\n    (c) Restrictions and Conditions Necessary To Carry Out 1934 Act; \nTreaties; International Conventions.--Section 303(r) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 303(r)) is amended by adding at \nthe end thereof the following: ``The authority of the Commission under \nthis paragraph to impose terms or conditions on the transfer or \nassignment of any license or other authority assigned or transferred in \na merger or other transaction subject to review by the Department of \nJustice or the Federal Trade Commission is subject to section 314.''.\n    (d) Alien-Operated Amateur Radio Stations.--Section 310(d) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 310(d)) is amended by adding at \nthe end thereof the following: ``The authority of the Commission to \nimpose terms or conditions on the transfer or assignment of any \nauthorization issued under this section that is assigned or transferred \nin a merger or other transaction subject to review by the Department of \nJustice or the Federal Trade Commission is subject to section 314.''.\n    (e) Preservation of Competition in Commerce.--Section 314 of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 314) is amended to read as \nfollows:\n\n``SEC. 314. PRESERVATION OF COMPETITION IN COMMERCE.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nCommission has no authority to review a merger or other transaction, or \nto impose any term or condition on the assignment or transfer of any \nlicense or other authorization issued under this Act that is proposed \nto be assigned or transferred in the course of a merger or other \ntransaction, while that merger or other transaction is subject to \nreview by either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade \nCommission.\n    ``(b) Communications Mergers Primarily Reviewable by DOJ and FTC.--\nThe Department of Justice, or the Federal Trade Commission, has primary \nauthority under existing law to review mergers and other transactions \ninvolving the proposed assignment or transfer of any license or other \nauthorization issued under this Act. The Commission may file comments \nin any proceeding before the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade \nCommission to review a merger or other transaction involving the \nproposed assignment or transfer of any license or other authorization \nissued under this Act if those comments reflect the views of a majority \nof the Commission.\n    ``(c) Commission Shall Implement DOJ or FTC Decision Without \nAdditional Terms or Conditions.--If--\n            ``(1) the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade \n        Commission reviews a merger or other transaction involving the \n        proposed assignment or transfer of any license or other \n        authorization issued under this Act; and\n            ``(2) it issues a written decision of absolute or \n        conditional approval of, or issues a written statement of \n        nonintervention in, the proposed merger or other transaction,\nthen the Commission shall authorize the assignment or transfer of any \nlicense or other authorization involved in the merger or transaction in \naccordance with the decision, if any, or as proposed, if a written \nstatement of nonintervention is issued. The Commission may not impose \nany other term or condition on the assignment or transfer of the \nlicense or other authorization so assigned or transferred, or impose \nany other obligation on any party to that merger or transaction.\n    ``(d) Commission Review of Mergers Absent DOJ or FTC \nPronouncement.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Commission may not review any \n        application for assignment or transfer of a license or other \n        authorization issued under this Act in connection with a merger \n        or other transaction unless neither the Department of Justice \n        nor the Federal Trade Commission issues a decision or statement \n        described in subsection (c)(2) in connection with that merger \n        or other transaction.\n            ``(2) 60-day turnaround.--The Commission shall conclude any \n        review of a merger or other transaction it may conduct under \n        paragraph (1) within 60 days after the date on which the \n        Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, \n        whichever is appropriate, issues such a decision or statement.\n            ``(3) Presumption; default approval.--In reviewing an \n        application under paragraph (1), the Commission shall apply a \n        presumption in favor of unconditional approval of the \n        application.
