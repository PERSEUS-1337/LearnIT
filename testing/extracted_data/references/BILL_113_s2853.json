PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide tools for the United States \nGovernment to use to accelerate the reduction of preventable maternal, \nnewborn, and child deaths in 24 United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) focus countries by 2020, saving 15,000,000 children \nand 600,000 mothers.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Over the past 2 decades, child mortality has reduced by \n        nearly 50 percent and maternal mortality has reduced by 40 \n        percent, thanks in large part to United States Government \n        action and intervention.\n            (2) In the last 3 years, 24 priority countries--of which 16 \n        are in Africa--have achieved an 8 percent reduction in under-5 \n        mortality, saving 500,000 lives.\n            (3) The report ``Acting on the Call: Ending Preventable \n        Child and Maternal Deaths'' developed by USAID provides a \n        critical foundation of evidence, knowledge, modeling, and \n        policy development on ending maternal, newborn, and child \n        deaths worldwide.\n            (4) To achieve Millennium Development Goal 4--to reduce \n        child mortality by \\2/3\\ between 1990 and 2015--on time, the \n        global annual rate of reduction in under-5 mortality would need \n        to rise to 15.6 percent from 2012 through 2015, much faster \n        than the 3.9 percent achieved from 2005 through 2012.\n            (5) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every \n        year 6,600,000 children under the age of 5--primarily infants--\n        die from preventable or treatable causes, and more than 800 \n        women die every day from complications during pregnancy and \n        childbirth.\n            (6) The vast majority of these deaths occur in the \n        developing world and countries in Africa have the highest \n        burden.\n            (7) The highest rates of child mortality are still in sub-\n        Saharan Africa, with an under-5 mortality rate of 98 deaths per \n        1,000 live births--more than 15 times the average for developed \n        regions.\n            (8) Investing in women and children reduces poverty, \n        stimulates economic growth, and most importantly, saves lives.\n            (9) Health products, such as vaccines and treatments, have \n        contributed significantly to recent successes in child and \n        maternal survival globally. New approaches and technologies are \n        critically needed to accelerate progress toward ending \n        preventable maternal and child deaths.\n            (10) The WHO identifies the following leading causes of \n        maternal, newborn, and child mortality:\n                    (A) Leading causes of maternal mortality in low-\n                income countries include post-partum bleeding, \n                infection, and hypertension.\n                    (B) Newborn deaths account for approximately 44 \n                percent of deaths among children under age 5 and are \n                predominantly caused by infections, premature birth, \n                and asphyxia.\n                    (C) Most deaths of children under the age of 5 are \n                a result of preventable causes, such as respiratory \n                infections (commonly from pneumonia), diarrhea, and \n                malaria.\n                    (D) Malnutrition is the underlying contributing \n                factor in about 45 percent of all child deaths, making \n                children more vulnerable to severe diseases.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States, in partnership with host \ngovernments, international financial institutions, nongovernmental \norganizations, faith-based organizations, and the private sector, to \nestablish a comprehensive, coordinated, integrated strategy to combat \nthe leading causes of maternal, newborn, and child mortality globally \nby--\n            (1) building on progress and success to date;\n            (2) scaling up the most effective evidence-based \n        interventions with a focus on country ownership;\n            (3) focusing on USAID's 24 priority countries;\n            (4) streamlining existing resources and scaling up \n        increased targeted resources;\n            (5) increasing transparency and accountability; and\n            (6) creating innovative new public-private financing \n        mechanisms.\n\nSEC. 5. STRATEGY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The President shall establish a strategy to \naccelerate action in each of the 24 priority countries set forth in \nsection 7, building on the evidence outlined in USAID's ``Acting on the \nCall: Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths''. The strategy will \nuse the current modeling and data that outlines the most proven \neffective interventions. The strategy shall further strengthen the \ncapability of the United States to be an effective leader in maternal, \nnewborn, and child health, particularly in Africa, and will be a first \nstep toward a broader, concerted effort to end maternal, newborn, and \nchild deaths worldwide.\n    (b) Elements.--The strategy established under subsection (a) \nshall--\n            (1) include specific objectives, multisectoral approaches, \n        and specific strategies to address the leading causes of death \n        among mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, and post-delivery; \n        newborns in their first 28 days; and children under the age of \n        5;\n            (2) clarify the responsibilities of the country, the \n        implementing organization, and the United States in the \n        achievement of such objectives;\n            (3) include regular benchmarks to measure, where \n        appropriate, progress toward achieving such objectives;\n            (4) utilize data and modeling to implement the most \n        effective interventions for saving 15,000,000 children and \n        600,000 mothers;\n            (5) illustrate the result of coordination among relevant \n        executive branch agencies, foreign governments, and \n        international organizations;\n            (6) provide projected levels of resources needed to achieve \n        the stated objectives;\n            (7) expand public-private partnerships for research and \n        innovation and for leveraging resources in new and innovative \n        ways; and\n            (8) use open, fair, and competitive procedures wherever \n        appropriate and possible in the administration, execution, and \n        evaluation of the program.\n    (c) Targeted Services.--The strategy established under subsection \n(a) should focus on the following evidence-based categories of \nintervention:\n            (1) Safe motherhood and newborn survival, including--\n                    (A) prenatal and postnatal care for mothers and \n                newborns;\n                    (B) quality care during labor and delivery, \n                including in emergencies; and\n                    (C) education on healthy timing and spacing of \n                pregnancies.\n            (2) Healthy households and schools, including Water, \n        Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH).\n            (3) Nutrition, including--\n                    (A) maternal and child nutrition during the first \n                1,000 days; and\n                    (B) prevention of maternal malnutrition.\n            (4) Healthy childhood, including--\n                    (A) vaccines for the leading causes of maternal, \n                newborn, and child deaths;\n                    (B) prevention and treatment for pneumonia and \n                diarrhea;\n                    (C) prevention of mother-to-child transmission of \n                HIV (PMTCT);\n                    (D) prevention and treatment of malaria; and\n                    (E) capacity-building of health professionals.\n\nSEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE PUBLIC-PRIVATE FINANCING \n              MECHANISM.\n\n    The United States Government shall establish a pilot program for \ninnovative financing mechanisms for delivering maternal, newborn, and \nchild health interventions in the 24 priority countries set forth in \nsection 7 based on the specific recommendations outlined by the \nconvening of high-level global experts at the 2014 United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. The innovative financing framework will establish a \nmethod to mobilize capital for health utilizing tools, including loans \nand loan guarantees, volume guarantees, development impact bonds, or \npartner government taxes, levies, fees, and funds.\n\nSEC. 7.
