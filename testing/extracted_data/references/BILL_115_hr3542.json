FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The international law of armed conflict prohibits, \n        during any armed conflict, the exploitation of the presence of \n        civilians, or movement of civilians, in an effort to impede \n        attack on or otherwise shield lawful targets from attack.\n            (2) Violation of this obligation is commonly referred to as \n        using persons as ``human shields'', the unlawful exploitation \n        of civilian persons or property in an attempt to impede attack \n        on or otherwise shield lawful targets from attack.\n            (3) The international law of armed conflict also prohibits \n        exposing prisoners of war, other detainees, or the wounded and \n        sick to unnecessary risks resulting from the conduct of \n        hostilities, which clearly includes a prohibition against using \n        such personnel in an effort to impede attack on or otherwise \n        shield lawful targets from attack.\n            (4) Under the international law of armed conflict, the use \n        of human shields is a critical consideration when assessing \n        whether infliction of civilian harm by a party to the conflict \n        was in fact unreasonable under the circumstances.\n            (5) Throughout the violent takeover of Gaza by Hamas in \n        2007, the organization engaged in summary executions and \n        torture, and put the lives of civilians at constant risk.\n            (6) Since that 2007 takeover of Gaza, Hamas forces have \n        repeatedly fired rockets into Israel in an indiscriminate \n        manner, routinely striking civilian population areas that \n        cannot plausibly be considered lawful military targets.\n            (7) Hamas attacks are routinely launched from firing \n        positions in areas of dense civilian population, often in or \n        near schools, mosques, or hospitals, with no plausible \n        justification based on military necessity.\n            (8) Unlawful Hamas tactics also include routinely forcing \n        Palestinian civilians to gather on the roofs of their homes to \n        act as human shields.\n            (9) Because these Hamas tactics cannot be justified by \n        military necessity, they indicate an effort to endanger both \n        Israeli and Palestinian civilians.\n            (10) The Israel Defense Force, in response to such serious \n        violations by Hamas, has vigorously taken all feasible \n        precautions to minimize civilian casualties and protect \n        civilian objects, in accordance with the international laws of \n        armed conflict. Such tactics have included providing warnings \n        to civilians when feasible.\n            (11) Since 2010, Hamas has enlisted children to work as \n        laborers in the tunnel networks between Gaza and Egypt.\n            (12) On June 9, 2017, the United Nations Relief and Works \n        Agency announced it had discovered Hamas tunnels under two of \n        its schools in the Gaza Strip, adding it was ``unacceptable \n        that students and staff are placed at risk in such a way''.\n            (13) Hamas was designated as a foreign terrorist \n        organization by the Secretary of State on October 8, 1997.\n            (14) In addition to Hamas, other armed groups, such as \n        Hezbollah, the Islamic State, al-Qa'ida, and al-Shabaab, \n        typically use civilians as human shields.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) officially and publicly condemn Hamas for violating the \n        international law of armed conflict by exploiting civilians, \n        civilian property, and other specially protected personnel and \n        facilities, in an effort to shield military targets from lawful \n        attack; and\n            (2) take effective action against those knowingly engaging \n        in, supporting, facilitating, or enabling such undisputed \n        violations of international law through the use of human \n        shields.\n\nSEC. 4. UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL.\n\n    The President should direct the United States Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and \ninfluence of the United States at the United Nations Security Council \nto secure support for a resolution that would--\n            (1) impose multilateral sanctions against Hamas for the use \n        of human shields;\n            (2) require member nations to take specific steps to \n        prevent the use of human shields and impose consequences on \n        those who use human shields;\n            (3) require the United Nations to track and report the use \n        of human shields in any conflict monitored by an organization \n        or agency of the United Nations; and\n            (4) specify steps to prevent, and consequences for, the use \n        of United Nations employees as human shields or the use of \n        United Nations facilities or infrastructure to enable the use \n        of civilians as human shields.\n\nSEC. 5.
