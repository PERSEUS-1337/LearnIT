    "content": "Social Security is a federally administered, work-related entitlement program authorized by Title II of the Social Security Act. The program is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by individuals who work in Social Security-covered employment and their employers. Employees and their employers each pay 6.2% of covered earnings, up to an annual limit on taxable earnings; self-employed individuals pay 12.4% of net self-employment income, up to an annual limit on taxable earnings. The program is also credited with federal income taxes that some beneficiaries pay on a portion of their benefits; reimbursements from the general fund of the Treasury for a variety of purposes; and interest income from the Treasury on the investment of Social Security revenues in special federal government obligations.  The program provides monthly cash benefits to eligible retired or disabled workers and their family members, and to the family members of deceased workers. To be eligible for a retired-worker benefit, a worker needs 10 years of covered employment, among other requirements. Fewer years of covered employment are needed to qualify for a disabled-worker benefit, depending on the age of the worker when he or she becomes disabled. As of December 2014, there were approximately 59 million Social Security beneficiaries: 42 million retired workers and their family members (71%); 11 million disabled workers and their family members (19%); and 6 million survivors of deceased workers (10%). For more information, see CRS Report R42035, Social Security Primer , by [author name scrubbed].  A worker becomes eligible for Social Security benefits by working in Social Security-covered employment for a specified period, among other requirements. To be eligible for a retired-worker benefit, a worker needs 40 earnings credits (10 years of covered employment). Fewer credits are needed to qualify for a disabled-worker benefit if the worker is under age 62. The number of credits needed varies, depending on the age of the worker when he or she becomes disabled. For example, a worker who becomes disabled before age 24 needs six credits (1\u00bd years of covered employment) in the three years before the onset of the disability. For Social Security purposes, disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last for at least 12 months or result in death. Generally, the worker must be unable to do any kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy, taking into account age, education, and work experience. A worker is eligible to receive a retirement benefit as early as age 62. However, if a worker begins receiving a retirement benefit before the full retirement age (FRA), his or her benefit is permanently reduced to take into account early retirement and the longer expected period of benefit receipt. The FRA ranges from age 65 to age 67, depending on the worker's year of birth.  As of December 2014, retired workers accounted for 66% of the beneficiary population, and disabled workers accounted for 15% of all beneficiaries. A worker's monthly Social Security benefit is based on his or her career-average earnings in covered employment. Specifically, a worker's primary insurance amount (PIA) is his or her monthly benefit payable at the FRA. The PIA is determined based on the following steps: (1) the worker's annual earnings in covered employment are indexed to historical wage growth, to bring past earnings up to near-current wage levels; (2) the highest 35 years of indexed earnings are summed to get the total earnings; (3) the total earnings are divided by 420 months (35 years x 12 months) to get the amount of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) over the worker's career in covered employment; and finally, (4) a progressive benefit formula is applied to the worker's AIME (the progressive benefit formula is designed to provide a higher replacement rate for lower-wage workers compared to higher-wage workers).  The monthly benefit that is payable to a worker may be less than or greater than his or her PIA, depending on the circumstances. For example, a worker's benefit is permanently reduced if he or she claims retirement benefits before the full retirement age, to take into account the longer expected period of benefit receipt (based on average life expectancy). Similarly, a worker's benefit is permanently increased if he or she claims retirement benefits after the full retirement age (up to age 70), to take into account the shorter expected period of benefit receipt. In addition to benefit adjustments based on age, other benefit adjustments may apply, such as reductions/offsets based on simultaneous entitlement to more than one type of Social Security benefit (a Social Security retired-worker benefit and a spousal benefit, for example) or receipt of a pension from work that was not covered by Social Security.  As of December 2014, the average monthly benefit was $1,329 among retired workers and $1,165 among disabled workers.  In addition to qualifying for Social Security benefits based on one's own work record, a person may qualify for benefits based on another person's work record as an eligible family member. Benefits are payable to the spouse, divorced spouse, or child of a retired or disabled worker. Benefits are also payable to the widow(er), divorced widow(er), child, or dependent parent of a deceased worker. In addition, a mother's/father's benefit is payable to a young widow(er) who is caring for a deceased worker's child, if the child is under the age of 16 or disabled and entitled to benefits. See Table A-1 for a summary of Social Security benefits payable to family members and the basic eligibility requirements for each type of benefit. As of December 2014, dependents and survivors of retired, disabled, or deceased workers accounted for about 19% of the beneficiary population.  Sections 216(a) through (g) of the Social Security Act define the terms spouse, surviving spouse, wife, widow, divorced spouse, child, husband, and widower for purposes of qualifying for benefits as an eligible family member of the worker. In order to qualify for these benefits as one of these family members, the applicant must meet the relationship requirements to the Number Holder (also referred to as the insured) as set out in these provisions. The Number Holder is the worker on whose record benefits are claimed. Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act ( Determination of Family Status ) references the use of state law in the determination of entitlement to Social Security benefits as a spouse, surviving spouse, child, or parent of the worker. While state law does not affect a person's entitlement to benefits as a retired or disabled worker, it does affect a person's entitlement to benefits as a family member of a retired, disabled or deceased worker. In determining family relationship for purposes of a person's application for benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse , SSA looks to the laws of the state - as interpreted by the courts of that state - where the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of the application, or at the time of the Number Holder's death, as specified in Section 216(h)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act. SSA has interpreted \"domiciled\" in this context to mean the \"true and fixed home (legal domicile) of a person...to which a person intends to return whenever he or she is absent.\" The relationship requirement is met if the applicant and the Number Holder were validly married under state law as interpreted by the courts of that state at the time of application for spousal benefits, or at the time of the Number Holder's death in the case of an application for surviving spouse benefits.  Alternatively, the relationship requirement is met if, under state intestate law, the applicant would be able to inherit a wife's, husband's, widow's, or widower's share of the Number Holder's personal property if the Number Holder were to die without leaving a will. The Uniform Probate Code, which serves as a guideline for the intestate laws of some states, does not explicitly define \"spouse\" or \"marriage.\" For the purposes of defining marriage in intestate law, the Uniform Probate Code instead directs state legislatures to incorporate that state's particular legal definition of marriage. If a relationship by marriage cannot be established under state law, the applicant may be eligible for benefits as the wife, husband, widow, or widower of the Number Holder under other circumstances (i.e., based upon a deemed valid marriage), as specified in Section 216(h)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act. For example, the regulations state, in part: You will be deemed to be the wife, husband, widow, or widower of the insured if, in good faith, you went through a marriage ceremony with the insured that would have resulted in a valid marriage except for a legal impediment. A legal impediment includes only an impediment which results because a previous marriage had not ended at the time of the ceremony or because there was a defect in the procedure followed in connection with the intended marriage. Therefore, under current Social Security law, the determination of entitlement to benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse can vary from state to state, regardless of the gender of each individual in a couple. With respect to same-sex married couples, two factors in determining entitlement to Social Security benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse are that (1) the couple was validly married in a state that permits same-sex marriage and (2) the Number Holder is domiciled in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage at the time of application for spousal benefits, or at the time of the Number Holder's death in the case of an application for surviving spouse benefits. In addition, persons in civil unions or other nonmarital legal same-sex relationships can qualify for Social Security benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse in some cases.  Benefits payable to family members are equal to a specified percentage of the worker's PIA, subject to a maximum family benefit. For example, the spouse of a retired worker may receive up to 50% of the retired worker's PIA, and the widow(er) of a deceased worker may receive up to 100% of the deceased worker's PIA. Benefits payable to family members are subject to adjustments based on a number of factors, including the person's age at entitlement, receipt of a Social Security benefit based on his or her own work in covered employment, and receipt of a pension based on work that was not covered by Social Security. In addition, there is an overall limit on the total amount of benefits payable to a family based on a worker's record. If total benefits payable to the family exceed this limit (the maximum family benefit), the benefit payable to each dependent or survivor is reduced on a proportional basis. Table A-1 provides a summary of Social Security benefits payable to family members, including the basic eligibility requirements and the basic benefit amount before any applicable adjustments. As of December 2014, the average monthly benefit was $673 among spouses of retired workers, $315 among spouses of disabled workers, and $1,276 among nondisabled widow(er)s. SSA is currently processing Social Security benefit claims in which entitlement depends on a same-sex marriage or nonmarital legal relationship, such as a civil union or domestic partnership. Claimants whose familial connection to the Number Holder has been established via a recognized same-sex marriage or nonmarital legal relationship and who meet all other requirements are eligible to receive family benefits. As noted earlier, Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act allows SSA to approve family benefit claims only if the determination of family status is deemed valid under state law. Because of differences in marriage and inheritance laws across states, SSA is currently unable to approve all claims in which entitlement or eligibility is affected by a same-sex marriage or nonmarital legal relationship.  SSA determines which same-sex marriage claims can be approved based on guidance provided by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in conjunction with the agency's own counsel. Table 1 lists the states that SSA recognizes as having laws that allow same-sex marriage (as of March 20, 2015). SSA processes benefit claims from individuals in these states based on the date(s) that these states permitted or recognized same-sex marriage.  Similarly, Table 2 lists the states with nonmarital legal relationships that SSA recognizes as meeting the family status requirements under Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act (as of January 26, 2015).SSA processes benefit claims from individuals in these states based on the date(s) that these states permitted or recognized certain nonmarital legal relationships. On June 26, 2013 (the date of the Windsor decision), President Barack Obama directed the Attorney General to work with other members of his Cabinet to assess the decision's impact on federal programs in order to ensure the \"swift and smooth\" implementation of the decision. Shortly thereafter, SSA began working with DOJ to identify and resolve legal questions surrounding the implementation of the decision, as well as develop guidance for SSA personnel in processing claims in which entitlement or eligibility is affected by a same-sex marriage. Once initial guidance was developed, the processing of claims affected by a same-sex marriage was rolled out gradually. In August 2013, SSA started processing some retirement spousal claims for same-sex married couples. Later that year, SSA began to process some widow(er)'s claims by surviving members of same-sex marriages. In June 2014, SSA published new guidance that allowed the agency to recognize certain nonmarital legal relationships as marriages for determining entitlement to Social Security benefits. As of the date of this report, SSA is processing nearly all types of family benefit claims in which entitlement or eligibility is affected by a same-sex marriage or nonmarital legal relationship.  This section answers common questions regarding same-sex couples and Social Security. Specifically, it discusses questions about same-sex marriage and (1) the basic eligibility criteria for Social Security family benefits; (2) how different jurisdictions and legal relationships affect eligibility; and (3) SSA's application process. This section is not intended to address every eligibility contingency concerning same-sex marriage.  Yes, if the applicant meets all of the other requirements for entitlement to Social Security benefits. In order for SSA to recognize a same-sex couple as married, the couple must have a valid marriage and the Number Holder must be domiciled in a state that recognizes such marriage at the time of the application. For example, Lauren (the applicant) and Allison (the Number Holder) marry in Washington (WA) after WA recognizes same-sex marriage. While they are domiciled in WA, Lauren files for spousal benefits on Allison's record. If they meet all other factors of entitlement, SSA would likely find that Lauren is eligible for Social Security benefits. Yes, if the state in which the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of the application would recognize the same-sex marriage. The same-sex couple does not need to live in the same state in which they were married for benefit eligibility. According to the Social Security Act, the same-sex couple is married if the \"courts of the State in which such insured individual [Number Holder] is domiciled at the time such applicant files [an] application ... would find that such applicant and such insured individual were validly married.\" Therefore, the state where the Number Holder lives at the time of the application must recognize that out-of-state same-sex marriage, in order for SSA to consider the same-sex couple validly married for benefit eligibility. For example, David (the applicant) and Michael (the Number Holder) marry in WA after WA recognizes same-sex marriage. After the marriage ceremony, the couple then moves to California (CA), which recognizes out-of-state same-sex marriages. Additionally, Michael is living in California at the time David files the application for spousal benefits. Because Michael is domiciled in a state that recognizes out-of-state same-sex marriages at the time David files the application, David would be eligible for spousal benefits on Michael's record, if all other requirements were met.  Yes, if the state in which the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of the application would recognize the same-sex marriage. The Social Security Act does not require couples to be domiciled in the same state to meet the marital relationship eligibility requirements. SSA's determination of marital status for Social Security benefits depends on whether the state where the Number Holder is domiciled would recognize her marriage with the applicant. If, at the time of the application, the applicant lives in a state that does recognize same-sex marriage but the Number Holder is domiciled in a state that does not recognize such marriages, SSA would not consider the applicant and Number Holder validly married for the purposes of benefit eligibility. For example, Carolyn (the applicant) and Barbara (the Number Holder) marry in WA after WA recognizes same-sex marriage. At the time of the application, Carolyn is domiciled in WA, but Barbara is domiciled in Kentucky (KY), which does not recognize same-sex marriages. Therefore, Carolyn would not be eligible for spousal benefits on Barbara's wage record.  The Social Security Act directs SSA to look at whether the courts of the state where the Number Holder is domiciled \"at the time such applicant files [an] application\" would consider the couple as validly married. Thus, if the state in which the Number Holder was domiciled at the time the spouse filed the application would recognize the marriage, SSA would consider the couple as married for the purposes of benefit entitlement, even if the couple moves to another state after the application is filed. For example, David (the applicant) and Michael (the Number Holder) are domiciled and marry in WA after WA recognizes same-sex marriage. David files for spousal benefits on Michael's record while domiciled in WA. While the application is pending, David and Michael move to and establish their domicile in Oregon (OR), which recognizes same-sex marriage. They meet all other factors of entitlement. SSA would recognize the couple as married because when the claim was filed, David and Michael were domiciled in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage.  Generally, an applicant in a same-sex marriage is not eligible for spousal benefits if the Number Holder lives in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage. For an applicant to receive benefits based on the work record of his spouse (referred to as Number Holder), the applicant and the Number Holder must qualify as married under the Social Security Act and state law. Under SSA's current interpretation of the Social Security Act's definition of family status found in Section 216(h), the agency would not recognize the same-sex marriage because the state where the Number Holder is domiciled does not recognize same-sex marriage. Generally, an applicant in a same-sex marriage is not eligible for survivors' benefits if the Number Holder has died in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage. For an applicant to receive benefits based on the work record of his spouse (referred to as Number Holder), the applicant and the Number Holder must qualify as married under the Social Security Act and state law. Under SSA's current interpretation of the Social Security Act's definition of family status found in Section 216(h), the agency would not recognize the same-sex marriage because the state where the Number Holder has died does not recognize same-sex marriage.  The duration-of-marriage requirement for spousal benefits is one continuous year before the day on which the application is filed. For widow(er)'s benefits, the duration requirement is nine months immediately prior to the day in which the Number Holder died (certain exceptions apply). SSA considers the date the couple was married in determining the duration of the marriage; it does not rely on the date of the Windsor decision. Generally, biological or adoptive children of Number Holders are considered children for purposes of entitlement to child's benefits under the Social Security Act. Stepchildren are typically entitled to benefits on a Number Holder's record if their relationship to the Number Holder was created by the Number Holder's marriage to the child's biological or adoptive parent. Stepchildren must also be dependent on the Number Holder and meet other eligibility requirements. For a stepchild to qualify for benefits on a Number Holder's record based on a same-sex marriage, the Number Holder's state of domicile must recognize the same-sex marriage or nonmarital legal relationship between the Number Holder and the child's biological or adoptive parent. However, due to variation in state laws, SSA may need to obtain a legal opinion on a case-by-case basis to process some child claims in which entitlement depends on a same-sex marriage.  The SSA determines the state in which a claimant lives by looking at the person's \"true and fixed home...to which a person intends to return whenever he or she is absent.\" The state of the claimant's domicile determines which state law to apply when determining \"family status\" as part of benefits eligibility. For a claimant to change his domicile, the claimant must be physically present in the new place and intend to make a home in that new place permanently or for an indefinite period.  No, marital status is not relevant to a claim for retirement or disability benefits filed by a Number Holder in a same-sex marriage because the entitlement to these benefits is based on the Number Holder's own record of work history and contributions to Social Security and not based on marital status. A civil union is a nonreligious partnership, with certain rights and benefits granted to the partners, depending on the laws of the state. Some states grant same-sex couples in a civil union the same rights as married couples, including the right to inherit property after the death of one partner. Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act permits the agency to recognize an applicant, who is in a civil union with the Number Holder, as the Number Holder's spouse if the state of the Number Holder's domicile would allow the applicant to inherit under intestate law. Therefore, if the state's civil union laws grant inheritance rights to same-sex couples in a civil union, then SSA will generally treat the couple's civil union as a marital relationship.  When considering these types of relationships, SSA first determines whether the nonmarital legal relationship was valid in the place it was established and whether the relationship qualifies as a marital relationship under the laws of the state of the Number Holder's domicile. SSA determines whether a nonmarital legal relationship qualifies as a marital relationship using the intestate laws of the Number Holder's domicile. If under such a state's intestate laws, an applicant could inherit a spouse's share of the Number Holder's personal property if the Number Holder died without a will, then SSA will consider the same-sex couple's relationship as a marital relationship for the purposes of determining entitlement to Social Security benefits. If the Number Holder's domicile-state at the time of application does not recognize the nonmarital legal relationship for same-sex couples or does not grant that type of relationship with the rights to inherit under intestate law, then SSA would not consider that marriage as valid for the purposes of determining entitlement to benefits.  For example, Colorado's \"Civil Union Act\" grants parties to a civil union the rights and benefits granted to spouses in a legal marriage. These rights include those relating to the acquisition, ownership, or transfer of real or personal property at death. Because Colorado's civil union law allows same-sex couples in a civil union to inherit as each other's spouse, SSA would treat such a couple as spouses for the purposes of determining their entitlement to spousal benefits.  A domestic partnership is generally a relationship between two individuals who share a common domestic life but are not married. Often a domestic partnership is established when both individuals file a legal declaration with the appropriate state government office. Some states grant same-sex couples in a domestic partnership the same rights as married couples, including the right to inherit property after the death of one partner. Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act permits the agency to recognize an applicant who is in a domestic partnership with the Number Holder as the Number Holder's spouse if the state of the Number Holder's domicile would allow the applicant to inherit under intestate law. Therefore, if the state's domestic partnership laws grant inheritance rights to same-sex couples in a domestic partnership, then the SSA will generally treat the couple's domestic partnership as a marital relationship.  When considering these types of relationships, SSA first determines whether the nonmarital legal relationship was valid in the place it was established and whether the relationship qualifies as a marital relationship under the laws of the state of the Number Holder's domicile. SSA determines whether a nonmarital legal relationship qualifies as a marital relationship using the intestate laws of the Number Holder's domicile. If under such a state's intestate laws, an applicant could inherit a spouse's share of the Number Holder's personal property if the Number Holder died without a will, then SSA will consider the same-sex couple's relationship as a marital relationship for the purposes of determining entitlement to Social Security benefits. If the Number Holder's domicile state at the time of application does not recognize the nonmarital legal relationship for same-sex couples or does not grant that type of relationship with the rights to inherit under intestate law, then SSA would not consider that marriage as valid for the purposes of determining entitlement to spousal benefits.  For example, under Washington state law, a state-registered domestic partner can inherit the decedent partner's estate in the absence of a will. Due to these inheritance rights, a Washington state-registered domestic partnership would meet SSA's requirements for a marital relationship. SSA defines a foreign marriage as a \"ceremonial marriage that was celebrated somewhere other than in a state.\" For the purposes of determining marital status, a state is either one of the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands. When determining benefits eligibility, SSA would consider an applicant married if the same-sex marriage is valid in the jurisdiction in which it was celebrated and the courts of the state of the Number Holder's domicile would recognize the foreign same-sex marriage as valid. If the Number Holder is domiciled in a foreign jurisdiction, then SSA considers whether the courts in the District of Columbia would recognize the foreign same-sex marriage as valid. For nonmarital legal relationships, SSA uses state intestate law to determine marital status for the purposes of Social Security benefits. Specifically, SSA considers whether the courts of the state of the Number Holder's domicile would allow the applicant to inherit as the spouse of the Number Holder, if the Number Holder were to die without leaving a will. If the Number Holder is domiciled in a foreign jurisdiction, then SSA considers whether the courts in the District of Columbia would permit the applicant to inherit as the spouse of the Number Holder, if the Number Holder were to die without leaving a will. In both cases, the nonmarital legal relationship must be valid in the foreign jurisdiction where it was celebrated or established. SSA may consider a same-sex marriage as valid if the domicile state recognizes same-sex marriages from other states and the marriage were celebrated during the period in which that state recognized same-sex marriages. For the purposes of Social Security, SSA does not recognize same-sex marriages that were celebrated outside of the period that the laws of the state permitted same-sex marriage. Even if the applicant filed for the claim at the time when the state of domicile permitted same-sex marriage, SSA has determined that the Number Holder and the applicant cannot be recognized as married for these purposes if the ceremony occurred before the state recognized same-sex marriage.  Similarly, SSA does not recognize a same-sex couple as married, for the purposes of determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, if the Number Holder died before the state in which the Number Holder and applicant were domiciled at the time of death recognized same-sex marriages. When processing an application for Social Security benefits, SSA looks to the current laws of the state when the application is open. This is state in which Number Holder was domiciled at the time of the spouse files the application. An application remains open during the appeals process. The application is closed after the administrative law judge has made a final determination. Section 216(h)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act directs SSA to determine marital status based on whether the \"courts of the State in which such insured individual is domiciled ... would find that such applicant and such insured individual were validly married at the time such applicant files such application.\" Therefore, subsequent to a court overturning a same-sex marriage ban, SSA may consider the couple validly married, if a same-sex couple married in that state and then filed for Social Security benefits while domiciled in that state. SSA will not approve applications for Social Security benefits if the applicant is in a marriage that SSA has determined cannot be recognized for purposes of determining entitlement under Title II. SSA may hold certain applications depending on the Department of Justice's guidance regarding the interpretation of state laws.  If dissatisfied with the initial determination or decision, an applicant may request further review through SSA's administrative review process. The applicant, or appointed representative, must request a review within 60 days from the date the applicant received notice of the decision. At the first step of the review process, an applicant may ask for a reconsideration of the initial determination by SSA about the applicant's entitlement to benefits. After such reconsideration, the applicant may request a hearing before an administrative law judge. The applicant may appeal a decision by an administrative law judge to the Appeals Council. After this review process, SSA would have made a final decision. Only with this final decision can the applicant file an action in a federal court for judicial review of SSA's final decision. A federal court would conduct the review using the \"substantial evidence\" standard, which includes such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Yes, the place-of-domicile rule has been used since the creation of family benefits under the Social Security Amendments of 1939 (P.L. 76-379). As part of the legislation, Congress added language to the Social Security Act specifying that determinations of family status would be made according to the law of the state where the Number Holder was located or died using the state's law on devolution of intestate personal property. Specifically, Congress established Section 209(m), which stated, In determining whether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of a fully insured or currently insured individual for purposes of this title, the Board shall apply such law as would be applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the courts of the State in which such insured individual is domiciled at the time such applicant files application, or, if such insured individual is dead, by the courts of the State in which he was domiciled at the time of his death, or if such insured individual is or was not so domiciled in any State, by the courts of the District of Columbia. Applicants who according to such law would have the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a wife, widow, child, or parent shall be deemed such. None of the reports accompanying the 1939 amendments gave any indication of why this provision was enacted. Congress later moved the text of Section 209(m) to Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act under the Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 (P.L. 81-734). The reports accompanying these amendments did not comment on the changes. Although it made subsequent changes to the formatting and language of Section 216(h), Congress maintained the basic principle of the place-of-domicile rule. Benefits payable to family members are equal to a specified percentage of the worker's PIA, subject to a maximum family benefit; other benefit adjustments may apply. Table A-1 provides a summary of Social Security benefits payable to family members, including the basic eligibility requirements and the basic benefit amount before any applicable adjustments."
