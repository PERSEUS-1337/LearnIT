DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Performance-based assessment.--The term ``performance-\n        based assessment'' means assessments that evaluate applications \n        of knowledge to real-world tasks. Such assessments are designed \n        to measure higher order thinking and performance skills.\n            (2) Higher order thinking and performance skills.--The term \n        ``higher order thinking and performance skills'' means the \n        abilities to--\n                    (A) frame and solve problems;\n                    (B) find, evaluate, analyze, and synthesize \n                information;\n                    (C) apply knowledge to new problems or situations;\n                    (D) develop and test complex ideas; and\n                    (E) communicate ideas or solutions proficiently in \n                oral or written form.\n            (3) Multiple measures.--The term ``multiple measures'' \n        means different sources of evidence of student learning in a \n        subject or across subject areas. Such sources of evidence \n        provide multiple opportunities to demonstrate achievement, are \n        accessible to students at varying levels of proficiency, and \n        utilize different methods for demonstrating achievement.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To empower States to develop assessment systems that--\n                    (A) are aligned with student learning standards;\n                    (B) provide multiple measures of student learning, \n                including performance assessments that assess higher \n                order thinking and performance skills;\n                    (C) include local assessments that provide timely, \n                diagnostic information about student learning;\n                    (D) are consistent with nationally recognized \n                professional standards for test construction and test \n                use, including standards of fairness, reliability, and \n                validity;\n                    (E) employ principles of universal design and use \n                appropriately designed assessments and accommodations \n                for special populations and English language learners; \n                and\n                    (F) are used for purposes for which they are valid \n                and reliable.\n            (2) To ensure that local assessments include common \n        assessments developed for use at the school or district level, \n        and classroom-based evidence obtained from curriculum-embedded \n        assessments. Such assessments may be used in the State \n        assessment system when they--\n                    (A) assess student learning in light of content \n                standards, including higher order thinking and \n                performance skills;\n                    (B) meet technical requirements of validity and \n                reliability;\n                    (C) are fair and unbiased;\n                    (D) include multiple sources of evidence about \n                student learning; and\n                    (E) can be used to demonstrate student progress \n                toward and attainment of proficiency.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANTS FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) Program Established.--From funds made available to carry out \nthis Act, the Secretary shall award grants to State educational \nagencies receiving funds under title I of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 that demonstrate to the satisfaction of the \nSecretary, based on peer review, that the requirements of this section \nwill be met, to--\n            (1) enable States (or consortia of States) to collaborate \n        with institutions of higher education, other research \n        institutions, or other organizations to improve the quality, \n        validity, and reliability of State and local academic \n        assessments, including the development or enhancement of State \n        or local performance assessments that can be used for \n        diagnostic purposes and as part of the State accountability \n        system;\n            (2) enable States to develop the capacity of local \n        education agencies to validly and reliably assess student \n        academic achievement using multiple sources of evidence, \n        including school-based performance assessments; and\n            (3) enable States and local districts to develop the \n        capacity of teachers and school leaders to develop, use, and \n        reliably evaluate the results of locally-administered \n        performance assessments.\n    (b) Minimum Award.--Each grant under this section shall be for at \nleast $5,000,000 per year.\n    (c) Duration.--Each grant under this section shall be for a period \nof not more than 5 years.\n    (d) Technical Assistance.--Each State receiving a grant under this \nsection shall allocate at least 5 percent of the grant for technical \nassistance.
