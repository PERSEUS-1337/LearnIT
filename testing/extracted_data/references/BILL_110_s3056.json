FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States imports more oil from the Middle East \n        today than before the attacks on the United States on September \n        11, 2001;\n            (2) the United States remains the most oil-dependent \n        industrialized nation in the world, consuming approximately 25 \n        percent of the oil supply of the world;\n            (3) the ongoing dependence of the United States on foreign \n        oil is one of the greatest threats to the national security and \n        economy of the United States; and\n            (4) the United States needs to take transformative steps to \n        wean itself from its addiction to oil.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY ON REDUCING OIL DEPENDENCE.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to reduce the dependence of \nthe United States on oil, and thereby--\n            (1) alleviate the strategic dependence of the United States \n        on oil-producing countries;\n            (2) reduce the economic vulnerability of the United States; \n        and\n            (3) reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with oil \n        use.\n\nSEC. 4. OIL SAVINGS PLAN.\n\n    (a) Initial Oil Savings Target and Action Plan.--Not later than 270 \ndays after the date of enactment of this Act, an interagency task force \ncomposed of the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Transportation, \nthe Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary \nof the Treasury, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, and the head of any other agency the President determines \nappropriate (referred to in this section as the ``Interagency Task \nForce'') shall publish in the Federal Register an action plan \nconsisting of--\n            (1) a draft list of proposals for agency action that will \n        be sufficient, when taken together, to save from the baseline \n        determined under subsection (d)--\n                    (A) 2,500,000 barrels of oil per day on average \n                during calendar year 2016;\n                    (B) 7,000,000 barrels of oil per day on average \n                during calendar year 2026; and\n                    (C) 10,000,000 barrels per day on average during \n                calendar year 2030; and\n            (2) a Federal Government-wide analysis demonstrating--\n                    (A) the expected oil savings from the baseline to \n                be accomplished by--\n                            (i) chapter 329 of title 49, United States \n                        Code (including regulations promulgated to \n                        carry out that chapter);

and\n                    (B) that the proposals described in paragraph (1), \n                taken together with expected oil savings described in \n                subparagraph (A), will achieve the oil savings \n                specified in this subsection.\n    (b) Review and Update of Action Plan.--\n            (1) Review.--Not later than January 1, 2011, and every 3 \n        years thereafter, the Interagency Task Force shall submit to \n        Congress, and publish, a report that--\n                    (A) evaluates the progress achieved in implementing \n                the oil savings targets established under subsection \n                (a);\n                    (B) analyzes the expected oil savings under the \n                action plan established under that subsection; and\n                    (C)(i) analyzes the potential to achieve oil \n                savings that are in addition to the oil savings goals \n                under that subsection; and\n                    (ii) if the President determines that it is in the \n                national interest, requires an analysis under that \n                subsection for a higher oil savings goal for calendar \n                year 2017 or any subsequent calendar year.\n            (2) Insufficient oil savings.--If the oil savings are less \n        than the targets described in subsection (a), simultaneously \n        with the report required under paragraph (1), the Interagency \n        Task Force shall publish a revised action plan that is \n        sufficient to achieve the targets.\n    (c) Public Comment and Final Proposals.--\n            (1) In general.--After a 30-day period for public comment \n        on the publications under subsection (a) and (b), the \n        Interagency Task Force shall, not later than 1 year after the \n        date of enactment of this Act, issue a final list of proposals \n        to meet the requirements of this section.\n            (2) Additional legislative authority.--The proposals shall \n        include a request to Congress for any additional legislative \n        authority necessary to implement the proposals.\n    (d) Baseline and Analysis Requirements.--In performing the analyses \nrequired for the action plan to achieve the oil savings described in \nsubsection (a), the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of \nTransportation, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Agriculture, \nthe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the head \nof any other agency the President determines to be appropriate shall--\n            (1) determine oil savings as the projected reduction in oil \n        consumption from the baseline established by the reference case \n        contained in the report of the Energy Information \n        Administration entitled ``Annual Energy Outlook 2008'';\n            (2) determine the oil savings projections required on an \n        annual basis for each of calendar years 2009 through 2030; and\n            (3) account for any overlap among implementation actions to \n        ensure that the projected oil savings from all the \n        implementation actions, taken together, are as accurate as \n        practicable.\n    (e) Relationship to Other Laws.--Nothing in this section affects \nthe authority provided or responsibility delegated under any other law."
