Prohibition relating to human rights abuses.\nSec. 6. Authorization of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--\n            (1) The United States and the People's Republic of China \n        signed a bilateral agreement on November 15, 1999, on accession \n        of China to the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred \n        to as the ``China-WTO Agreement''), under which China made a \n        detailed set of concessions eliminating or limiting tariff and \n        non-tariff barriers to trade in order to become a member of the \n        World Trade Organization (WTO).\n            (2) Under the China-WTO Agreement, the Government of the \n        People's Republic of China will be required to amend many of \n        its laws, transform its institutions, and change its policies \n        to bring them into conformity with international trade rules.\n            (3) Officials of the Government of the People's Republic of \n        China, both at the national and provincial levels, must \n        interpret and implement the terms and conditions of the China-\n        WTO Agreement and the WTO regime into concrete policies, rules, \n        and regulations--a process which can materially benefit or harm \n        United States companies and their workers.\n            (4) The China-WTO Agreement, despite the desperate need in \n        the People's Republic of China for independent labor unions and \n        other resources which inform workers of their rights and fight \n        against exploitative working conditions, does not require China \n        to make changes in the labor rights area.\n            (5) The United States currently provides a small amount of \n        assistance to promote the rule of law in the People's Republic \n        of China, but does not have authorization to help officials of \n        the Chinese Government to write the laws, rules, and \n        regulations necessary to implement its obligations under the \n        China-WTO Agreement, or to promote better enforcement of labor \n        laws and regulations and respect for core labor rights as \n        developed by the International Labor Organization.\n            (6) Major United States trade competitors, including the \n        European Union, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, and Australia, \n        have already launched extensive, multi-year rule of law \n        programs in the People's Republic of China designed to promote \n        rationality and openness in the administration of commercial \n        law as well as to assist the People's Republic of China in \n        revising its trade and investment laws to make them consistent \n        with the requirements of the WTO, through training programs, \n        workshops, seminars, and exchanges.\n            (7) It is critical that the United States aggressively \n        protect its hard-won concessions from the People's Republic of \n        China relating to WTO membership by ensuring that China--\n                    (A) writes laws, rules, and regulations that are \n                fair, open, and transparent, and that do not \n                discriminate against United States commercial \n                interests; and\n                    (B) revises and expands existing labor legislation \n                to bring labor laws into compliance with \n                internationally-recognized core labor standards, as \n                defined by the International Labor Organization, and as \n                noted in the International Covenants on Civil and \n                Political Rights, and Economic, Social and Cultural \n                Rights.\n            (8) Over the last eight years, the Commercial Law \n        Development Division of the United States Department of \n        Commerce has dispatched United States lawyers to developing \n        countries to help such countries improve their laws and \n        institutions in order to promote economic reform and compliance \n        with international trade regimes.\n            (9) Extending commercial and labor rule of law programs in \n        the People's Republic of China will further United States \n        national interests even if the Government of China continues to \n        impede the development of the rule of law in others aspects of \n        Chinese society.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish commercial \nand labor rule of law programs in the People's Republic of China to \nenhance rationality and accountability in the administration of justice \nin the commercial area, strengthen labor rights protection, and lay the \nintellectual and institutional groundwork for further reforms.\n\nSEC. 3.
