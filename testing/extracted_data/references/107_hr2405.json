    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Microbicide Development Act of \n2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Sexually transmitted diseases (``STDs'') and the human \n        immunodeficiency virus (``HIV'') are producing serious and \n        costly epidemics of infectious disease in populations \n        worldwide.\n            (2) This year, 15,400,000 people in the United States will \n        acquire a new STD.\n            (3) Globally, 36,100,000 people are infected with HIV, with \n        more than 15,000 new infections occurring daily.\n            (4) Racial and ethnic minorities have been \n        disproportionately infected with STDs, especially HIV. For \n        example, although together African American and Latina women \n        represent roughly 25 percent of the total U.S. female \n        population, they account for 77 percent of all reported female \n        HIV cases.\n            (5) STDs cause serious, costly, even deadly conditions for \n        women and their children: infertility, pregnancy complications, \n        cervical cancer, infant mortality, and higher risk of \n        contracting HIV.\n            (6) Estimated annual costs of STDs and their complications \n        in the United States range from $8,400,000,000 in direct \n        medical costs to nearly $20,000,000,000, including out-of-\n        pocket costs and lost productivity.\n            (7) Microbicides are a promising new technology for STD and \n        HIV prevention.\n            (8) Microbicides are user-controlled products that could \n        kill or inactivate the bacteria and viruses that cause STDs and \n        HIV.\n            (9) Microbicides would fill a critical gap in the array of \n        STD-prevention technologies, first as an important backup or \n        alternative to the condom, and second, as a technology that, \n        unlike most vaccines, could offer protection against various \n        STDs, not just HIV.\n            (10) Several potential microbicides are poised for \n        successful development; more than 20 products are in clinical \n        trials and nearly 35 promising compounds exist that could be \n        investigated further.\n            (11) Studies into the market potential for microbicides \n        indicate that they would have broad appeal. One nationally \n        representative survey indicated that at least 21,000,000 \n        sexually active women in the United States would be interested \n        in such products, if they were available.\n            (12) Federal support for microbicide research and \n        development is crucial.\n            (13) At present, there appear to be insufficient perceived \n        economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies to become \n        actively engaged in microbicide research and development.\n            (14) Numerous small biotechnology companies and university \n        researchers are actively engaged in microbicide research, but \n        they are almost totally dependent on public-sector grants to \n        continue their work and test their products.\n            (15) Despite public health need and tremendous scientific \n        opportunity, microbicide research and development currently \n        receives less than 1 percent of the Federal HIV research \n        budget--not nearly enough to keep pace with the raging STD and \n        HIV epidemics.\n            (16) Existing public sector grants for microbicides are too \n        small and too short-term to move product leads forward, and the \n        availability of clinical trial sites is limited by funding \n        constraints.\n            (17) There is a backlog in the research and development \n        pipeline, so that innovative and promising product concepts are \n        languishing, while infection rates are growing.\n            (18) For significant progress to be made, the current \n        amount of Federal investment needs to increase to $75,000,000 \n        in fiscal year 2002, to $100,000,000 in fiscal year 2003, with \n        $100,000,000 yearly in the successive out-years as required, in \n        order to sustain multiyear funding at a productive level.\n\n   TITLE I--MICROBICIDE RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\nSEC. 101.
