DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \nmeans the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives \nand the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While often overlooked, the countries of the Caribbean \n        are important United States partners.\n            (2) United States-Caribbean cooperation on commerce, \n        security, and energy must be deepened.\n            (3) The countries of the Caribbean are key voting members \n        of the Organization of American States.\n            (4) There are five countries in the Caribbean with which \n        the United States has diplomatic relations, but within which \n        the United States does not have a permanent diplomatic \n        presence. Those countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, \n        St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the \n        Grenadines.\n            (5) Diplomatic relations with these five countries are \n        conducted through the United States Embassy in Bridgetown, \n        Barbados.\n            (6) Due to the lack of presence of United States diplomats \n        in these five countries, citizens of these five countries are \n        required to travel to Barbados for all consular services.\n            (7) Due to the lack of presence of United States diplomats \n        in these five countries, in order to meet with local officials, \n        civil society representatives, private sector leaders, United \n        States citizens or others, embassy officials must fly from \n        Barbados to these countries on what are often expensive, \n        sometimes infrequent flights and remain overnight in what are \n        often expensive hotel rooms.\n            (8) Due to the lack of presence of United States diplomats \n        in these five countries, United States citizens living in and \n        visiting these five countries do not have full consular \n        services, and in the event of a consular emergency, air traffic \n        could be shut off to any of these islands, in effect stranding \n        United States citizens without full in-country consular \n        services.\n            (9) Due to the lack of presence of United States diplomats \n        in these five countries, key events, meetings, ceremonies, and \n        other opportunities are often not attended by United States \n        officials as they are in other countries where there is a \n        permanent diplomatic presence.\n            (10) Due to the lack of presence of United States diplomats \n        in these five countries, it is more difficult for United States \n        diplomats to establish close working relationships with local \n        officials, civil society representatives, and others.\n            (11) Due to the lack of presence of United States diplomats \n        in these five countries, United States official diplomatic \n        interaction with these countries, including delivery of \n        demarches and other diplomatic messages, which the Secretary of \n        State sometimes requires embassy officials to personally \n        deliver, particularly if of a confidential nature, is often \n        relegated to telephone, facsimile, or email, dramatically \n        reducing the ability of the United States to engage host \n        governments in substantive dialogue.\n            (12) Due to the lack of presence of United States diplomats \n        in these five countries, it is more difficult for the United \n        States to conduct public diplomacy in these five countries.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF UNITED STATES EMBASSIES WITH CONSULAR SERVICES \n              IN ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, DOMINICA, ST. KITTS AND NEVIS, \n              ST. LUCIA, AND ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES.\n\n    Not later than five years after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the Secretary of State shall establish United States embassies \nwith consular services in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and \nNevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to--\n            (1) provide consular services to citizens of these \n        countries and United States citizens living in or traveling to \n        these countries; and\n            (2) engage in direct diplomacy with appropriate government \n        counterparts in these countries.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT.\n\n    Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act \nand annually thereafter until the requirements under section 4 have \nbeen satisfied, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \ncongressional committees a report on the progress made toward carrying \nout such section.\n\nSEC. 6. EXCEPTION FOR DELAY.\n\n    The Secretary of State may delay for up to one year the carrying \nout of section 4 if the Secretary determines that more time is needed \nto carry out such section and submits to the appropriate congressional \ncommittees a report explaining the reason for such delay.\n\nSEC. 7. LIMITATION ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING.\n\n    To carry out this Act, the Secretary of State may use only amounts \nthat are available from the Embassy Security, Construction, and \nMaintenance account and the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account of \nthe Department of State for such purpose."
