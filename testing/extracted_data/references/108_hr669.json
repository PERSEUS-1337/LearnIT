FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The video game industry has grown into a $10 billion \n        market for game software publishing, wholesaling, and \n        retailing.\n            (2) The use and observation of video games that contain \n        sexual or violent content can be harmful to minors and \n        reasonable restrictions will significantly decrease the number \n        of minors using these games.\n            (3) On July 26, 2000, six of the Nation's most respected \n        public health groups, including the American Medical \n        Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \n        Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Academy of Child \n        and Adolescent Psychiatry, found that viewing entertainment \n        violence can lead to increases in aggressive attitudes, \n        behaviors, and values, particularly in children.\n            (4) The ratings and content descriptors of video and \n        computer games issued by the entertainment industry reflect the \n        notion that certain video and computer games are suitable only \n        for adults due to graphic depictions of sex or violence.\n            (5) In December 2001, a study by the Federal Trade \n        Commission showed that retailers allowed 78 percent of \n        unaccompanied minors, ages 13 to 16, to purchase games rated as \n        ``Mature'' by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.\n            (6) The sale of video games and computer games \n        substantially affects interstate commerce because they are sold \n        in interstate commerce on a nationwide basis.\n            (7) The Nation has a compelling interest in preventing \n        minors from purchasing video and computer games that are only \n        suitable for adults due to graphic depictions of sex or \n        violence.\n            (8) There is a need to enact narrowly tailored legislation \n        to restrict the sale and use of video games that contain sexual \n        or violent content that is intended for adults only, and that \n        such legislation not restrict adults' access to these games.\n\nSEC. 3.
