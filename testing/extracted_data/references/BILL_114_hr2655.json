A Member may make the motion \n        only on the day after the calendar day on which the Member \n        announces to the House concerned the Member's intention to make \n        the motion, except that, in the case of the House of \n        Representatives, the motion may be made without such prior \n        announcement if the motion is made by direction of the \n        committee to which the bill was referred. All points of order \n        against the bill (and against consideration of the bill) are \n        waived. The motion is highly privileged in the House of \n        Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is not \n        debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, or to a \n        motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the \n        consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the \n        vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not \n        be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the \n        bill is agreed to, the respective House shall immediately \n        proceed to consideration of the joint bill without intervening \n        motion, order, or other business, and the bill shall remain the \n        unfinished business of the respective House until disposed of.\n            (B) Debate on the bill, and on all debatable motions and \n        appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more \n        than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between those \n        favoring and those opposing the bill. An amendment to the bill \n        is not in order, except that a single amendment which is \n        entirely clerical in nature may be offered by a Member favoring \n        the bill. A motion further to limit debate is in order and not \n        debatable. A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the \n        consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the \n        bill is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which \n        the bill is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n            (C) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a \n        bill described in paragraph (1) and a single quorum call at the \n        conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the \n        rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final passage of \n        the bill shall occur.\n            (D) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n        application of the rules of the Senate or the House of \n        Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating \n        to a bill described in paragraph (1) shall be decided without \n        debate.\n            (5) Consideration by other house.--(A) If, before the \n        passage by one House of a bill of that House described in \n        paragraph (1), that House receives from the other House a bill \n        described in paragraph (1), then the following procedures shall \n        apply:\n                    (i) The bill of the other House shall not be \n                referred to a committee and may not be considered in \n                the House receiving it except in the case of final \n                passage as provided in clause (ii)(II).\n                    (ii) With respect to a bill described in paragraph \n                (1) of the House receiving the bill--\n                            (I) the procedure in that House shall be \n                        the same as if no bill had been received from \n                        the other House; but\n                            (II) the vote on final passage shall be on \n                        the bill of the other House.\n            (B) Upon disposition of the bill received from the other \n        House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the bill that \n        originated in the receiving House.\n            (6) Exercise of rulemaking authority.--This subsection is \n        enacted by Congress--\n                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the \n                Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and \n                as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, \n                respectively, but applicable only with respect to the \n                procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a \n                bill described in paragraph (1), and it supersedes \n                other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent \n                with such rules; and\n                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional \n                right of either House to change the rules (so far as \n                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, \n                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the \n                case of any other rule of that House.\n\nSEC. 7.
