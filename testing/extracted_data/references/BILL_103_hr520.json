FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Growing numbers of children live in an environment of \n        social and economic conditions that greatly increase their risk \n        of academic failure when they become students.\n            (2) More than 20 percent of the Nation's children live in \n        poverty while at the same time the Nation's infrastructure of \n        social support for children of poor families has greatly \n        eroded; for example, 40 percent of eligible children do not \n        receive free or reduced price lunches or benefit from food \n        stamps, 25 percent are not covered by health insurance, and \n        only 20 percent are accommodated in public housing.\n            (3) Many at-risk students suffer the effects of inadequate \n        nutrition and health care, overcrowded and unsafe living \n        conditions and homelessness, family and gang violence, \n        substance abuse, sexual abuse, and child abuse, involuntary \n        migration, and limited English proficiency that often create \n        severe barriers to learning the knowledge and skills needed to \n        become literate, independent, and productive citizens.\n            (4) Almost half of all children and youths live in a single \n        parent family for some period of their lives, greatly reducing \n        parental involvement in their education.\n            (5) High proportions of disadvantaged and minority children \n        are with never married mothers or teenage mothers, greatly \n        limiting the resources available for early childhood \n        development and education.\n            (6) Large numbers of children and youths are recent \n        immigrants or children of recent immigrants with limited \n        English proficiency and significant unmet educational needs.\n            (7) Services for at-risk students are fragmented, \n        expensive, overregulated, often ineffective and duplicative, \n        and focused on narrow problems and not the needs of the whole \n        child and family.\n            (8) School personnel and other support service providers \n        often lack knowledge of and access to available services for \n        at-risk students and their family in the community, are \n        constrained by bureaucratic obstacles from providing the \n        services most needed, and have few resources or incentives to \n        coordinate services.\n            (9) Service providers for at-risk students such as \n        teachers, social workers, health care givers, juvenile justice \n        workers and others are trained in separate institutions, \n        practice in separate agencies, and pursue separate professional \n        activities that provide little support for coordination and \n        integration of services.\n            (10) Coordination and integration of services for at-risk \n        students emphasizing prevention and early intervention offer a \n        great opportunity to break the cycle of poverty that leads to \n        academic failure, teenage parenthood, leaving school, low skill \n        levels, unemployment, and low income.\n            (11) Coordination of services is more cost effective for \n        schools and support agencies because it reduces duplication, \n        improves quality of services, and substitutes prevention for \n        expensive crisis intervention.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Improvement of Student Performance.--It is the purpose of this \nAct to establish a program of grants to local educational agencies to \nimprove the educational performance of at-risk students by--\n            (1) removing barriers to their learning;\n            (2) coordinating and enhancing the effectiveness of \n        educational support services;\n            (3) replicating and disseminating programs of high quality \n        coordinated support services;\n            (4) increasing parental educational involvement;\n            (5) improving the capacity of school and support services \n        personnel to collaborate;\n            (6) integrating services, regulations, data bases, \n        eligibility procedures, and funding sources whenever possible; \n        and\n            (7) focusing school and community resources on prevention \n        and early intervention strategies to address student needs \n        holistically.\n    (b) Coordination.--It is also the purpose of this Act to provide \nassistance to foster planning, coordination, and collaboration among \nlocal, county, State, and Federal educational and other student support \nservice agencies and levels of government, nonprofit organizations, and \nthe private sector to improve the educational performance of at-risk \nstudents by--\n            (1) identifying and removing unnecessary regulations, \n        duplication of services, and obstacles to coordination;\n            (2) improving communication and information exchange;\n            (3) creating joint funding pools or resource banks;\n            (4) providing cross-training of agency personnel; and\n            (5) increasing parental and community involvement in \n        education.\n\nSEC. 4.
