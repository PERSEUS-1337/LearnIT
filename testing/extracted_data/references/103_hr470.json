REVIEW OF CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF AIR \n              CARRIERS.\n\n    ``(a) General Rule.--No person shall acquire, directly or \nindirectly, any voting securities of a major air carrier or person who \ncontrols a major air carrier unless the acquiring person files \nnotification pursuant to the rules under subsection (d), the waiting \nperiod described in subsection (b)(1) has expired, and the Secretary \nhas not disapproved such acquisition under subsection (c)--\n            ``(1) if such acquisition is of 15 percent or more of the \n        voting securities of the acquired person; or\n            ``(2) if, before such acquisition, the acquiring person \n        holds less than 15 percent of the voting securities of the \n        acquired person and, as a result of such acquisition, the \n        acquiring person would hold 15 percent or more of the voting \n        securities of the acquired person.\n    ``(b) Waiting Period.--\n            ``(1) General Rule.--The waiting period required under \n        subsection (a) shall--\n                    ``(A) begin on the date of receipt by the Secretary \n                of the completed notification required under this \n                section from the acquiring person; and\n                    ``(B) end on the 30th day after the date of such \n                receipt or such later date as may be set under \n                subsection (e)(2).\n            ``(2) Termination.--The Secretary may, in individual cases, \n        terminate the waiting period specified in paragraph (1) and \n        allow any person to proceed with any acquisition subject to \n        this section and promptly shall cause to be published in the \n        Federal Register a notice that the Secretary does not intend to \n        take any action within such period with respect to such \n        acquisition.\n    ``(c) Disapproval.--The Secretary shall disapprove an acquisition \nof voting securities subject to this section if the Secretary finds--\n            ``(1) that the acquistion is likely to weaken the acquired \n        person financially to such an extent--\n                    ``(A) that a deterioration in the ability of the \n                air carrier to comply with its established safety \n                procedures would occur;\n                    ``(B) that the air carrier would be unable to take \n                the steps necessary to continue to operate with the \n                highest degree of safety;\n                    ``(C) that the air carrier would be required to \n                dispose of a substantial portion of its aviation-\n                related assets in order to meet its financial \n                obligations;

except in any case in \n        which--\n                    ``(A) such disposition would be necessary, in the \n                absence of the acquisition, to avoid the financial \n                failure of the air carrier,\n                    ``(B) the assets to be disposed of could not be \n                used profitably by the air carrier, or\n                    ``(C) such disposition would be in the public \n                interest;\n            ``(3) that the acquisition would result in a person who is \n        not a citizen of the United States having power to exercise \n        control over the air carrier;\n            ``(4) that the acquisition would result in a major \n        reduction in wages, benefits, or number of employees of the air \n        carrier which is not agreed to by the employees and is required \n        primarily as a result of added costs arising out of the \n        acquisition;
