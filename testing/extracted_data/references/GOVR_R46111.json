    "content": "Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services, as well as long-term services and supports (LTSS), to a diverse low-income population. This population includes children, pregnant women, adults, individuals with disabilities, and those aged 65 and older. Medicaid is authorized under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (SSA) and financed by the federal government and the states. Federal Medicaid spending is an entitlement, with total expenditures dependent on state policy decisions and enrollees' use of services. Participation in Medicaid is voluntary, though all states, the District of Columbia, and the territories choose to participate. States design and administer their Medicaid programs based on broad federal guidelines. The federal government requires states to cover certain mandatory populations and services but allows states to cover other optional populations and services. In addition, several waiver and demonstration authorities in statute allow states to operate their Medicaid programs outside of certain federal rules. Due to this flexibility, factors such as eligibility, covered benefits, and provider payment rates vary substantially by state. At the federal level, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for administering Medicaid. This report focuses on Medicaid eligibility for adults aged 65 and older\u00e2\u0080\u0094referred to as older adults\u00e2\u0080\u0094and adults under the age of 65 and children with disabilities. Specifically, this report examines the statutory provisions that provide Medicaid eligibility for individuals who are considered to be aged, blind, or disabled. These populations are of interest to lawmakers primarily for two reasons: (1) they are more likely to need LTSS, and (2) they account for a large share of Medicaid spending.  Older adults and individuals with disabilities are more likely to need LTSS due to physical limitations, cognitive impairment, or chronic disabling health conditions. Those with LTSS needs are a diverse group that range in age from very young children to older adults. Disabilities can be wide ranging, including, for example, physical limitations, visual impairments (i.e., blindness), intellectual or developmental disabilities, cognitive and behavioral health conditions, traumatic brain injuries, and HIV/AIDS.  Federal policymakers have an interest in understanding Medicaid eligibility as the program is an important source of coverage for those with long-term care needs. Medicaid provides LTSS coverage (e.g., extended nursing facility care, personal care, and other home and community-based services) that is generally not covered by Medicare or major health insurance plans offered in the private market. As the largest single payer of LTSS in the United States, Medicaid plays a key role in providing LTSS coverage. In 2016, total Medicaid LTSS spending (federal and state combined) was $154 billion, accounting for 42% of all LTSS expenditures nationally.  Because many older adults and individuals with disabilities use LTSS, they tend to account for a disproportionate share of Medicaid spending, which has implications for both federal and state budgets. In FY2016, Medicaid provided health care services to about 71 million enrollees, with expenditures of approximately $538 billion (federal and state combined). Although older adults and individuals with disabilities made up only about one-quarter (23%) of all Medicaid enrollees that year, they accounted for more than half (54%) of all benefit spending. Among all Medicaid enrollees, 30% of Medicaid spending in FY2013 was on LTSS, compared with 62% among older adults (i.e., aged) and 36% among individuals with disabilities (i.e., disabled). The next section of this report provides an overview of Medicaid eligibility, followed by a summary of eligibility pathways for older adults and individuals with disabilities. The report then describes specific information about each eligibility pathway for older adults and individuals with disabilities. The Appendix includes summary tables with statutory references and general financial eligibility criteria for each of the eligibility pathways described in this report. Eligibility for Medicaid is determined by both federal and state law, whereby states set individual eligibility criteria within federal minimum standards. This arrangement results in substantial variability in Medicaid eligibility across states. Therefore, the ways that individuals can qualify for Medicaid reflect state policy decisions within broad federal requirements.  In general, individuals qualify for Medicaid coverage by meeting the requirements of a specific eligibility pathway (sometimes referred to as an eligibility group) offered by the state. Some eligibility groups are mandatory, meaning all states with a Medicaid program must cover them. Other eligibility groups are optional, meaning states may elect to cover them. Within this framework, states may have some discretion to determine certain eligibility criteria for both mandatory and optional eligibility groups. In addition, states may apply to CMS for a waiver of federal law to expand health coverage beyond the mandatory and optional eligibility groups specified in federal statute. An \"eligibility pathway\" is the federal statutory reference(s) under Title XIX of the SSA that extends Medicaid coverage to one or more groups of individuals. Each eligibility pathway specifies the group of individuals covered by the pathway (i.e., the categorical criteria), the financial requirements applicable to the group (i.e., the financial criteria), whether the pathway is mandatory or optional, and the extent of the state's discretion over the pathway's requirements. Individuals who have met the categorical and financial requirements of a given eligibility pathway and are in need of Medicaid-covered LTSS must also meet additional requirements. In general, they must demonstrate the need for such care by meeting state-based level-of-care criteria. They may also be subject to a separate set of Medicaid financial eligibility rules to receive LTSS coverage. All Medicaid applicants, regardless of their eligibility pathway, must meet federal and state requirements regarding residency, immigration status, and documentation of U.S. citizenship. Not all Medicaid enrollees have access to the same set of services. An applicant's eligibility pathway often dictates the Medicaid services that a program enrollee is entitled to (e.g., women eligible due to their pregnancy status are entitled to Medicaid pregnancy-related services). Most Medicaid beneficiaries receive services in the form of what is sometimes called \"traditional\" Medicaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094an array of required or optional medical assistance items and services listed in statute. However, states may furnish Medicaid in the form of alternative benefit plans (ABPs). In addition, states may also offer LTSS under traditional Medicaid or through a waiver program for individuals who meet state-based level-of-care criteria for services. Low-income older adults and individuals with disabilities may qualify for Medicaid through a number of eligibility pathways. In general, Medicaid data report the following broad categorical eligibility groups: children, adults, aged, and disabled. This report focuses on the eligibility of older adults and individuals with disabilities based on their age or disability status; that is, the pathways where the categorical criteria are being aged, blind, or disabled (sometimes referred to as \"ABD\" or \"ABD eligibility\").  Individuals who qualify for Medicaid on the basis of being blind or disabled include adults under the age of 65 as well as children. Most (but not all) ABD pathways recognize blindness as a distinct condition from other disabilities and, as such, provide separate categorical criteria for this condition. However, when reporting data on broad categorical eligibility groups, CMS includes statutorily blind individuals in the \"disabled\" category.  Individuals with disabilities may also be eligible for Medicaid under pathways available more broadly to able-bodied children and adults for a number of reasons; for example, because they do not meet the definition of disability under an ABD eligibility pathway, have income or assets above certain limits, do not meet the state-based level-of-care criteria, or have one or more chronic condition(s) but have not developed a chronic-disabling condition. Adults under the age of 65 and children who qualify for Medicaid on the basis of a reason other than being blind or disabled are classified by CMS as \"adults\" and \"children,\" respectively. Individuals applying for Medicaid may be eligible for the program through more than one pathway. In this situation, applicants may choose the pathway that would be most beneficial to them\u00e2\u0080\u0094both in terms of how income and sometimes assets are used to determine Medicaid eligibility, and in terms of the available services associated with each eligibility pathway.  This report classifies the ABD eligibility pathways for older adults and individuals with disabilities into two broad coverage groups: (1) Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-Related Pathways and (2) Other ABD Pathways (see Table 1 ). The SSI-Related Pathways consist of mandatory and optional eligibility groups that generally meet the requirements of the federal SSI program. These groups include older adults and individuals with disabilities who are SSI eligible, are deemed to be SSI eligible, or would be SSI eligible if not for a certain SSI program rule.  The Other ABD Pathways consist of optional eligibility groups that have levels of income or resources above SSI program rules. These groups generally use SSI categorical criteria to define older adults and individuals with disabilities and may use certain SSI financial criteria to determine their financial eligibility for Medicaid. Each of the specific pathways under these broad coverage groups are described in more detail below. Table A-1 in the Appendix lists the statutory references and certain eligibility criteria for each Medicaid ABD eligibility pathway. Medicaid categorical eligibility criteria are the characteristics that define the population qualifying for Medicaid coverage under a particular eligibility pathway; in other words, the nonfinancial requirements that an individual must meet to be considered eligible under an eligibility group. Medicaid covers several broad coverage groups, including children, pregnant women, adults, individuals with disabilities, and individuals aged 65 and older (i.e., aged). Each of these broad coverage groups includes a number of distinct Medicaid eligibility pathways. Historically, Medicaid eligibility was limited to poor families with dependent children who received cash assistance under the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, as well as poor aged, blind, or disabled individuals who received cash assistance under the SSI program. Medicaid eligibility rules reflected these historical program linkages\u00e2\u0080\u0094both in terms of the categories of individuals who were served, and because the financial eligibility rules were generally based on the most closely related social program for the group involved (e.g., AFDC program rules for low-income families with dependent children and pregnant women, and SSI program rules for aged, blind, or disabled individuals). Over time, Medicaid eligibility has expanded to allow states to extend coverage to individuals whose eligibility is not based on the receipt of cash assistance, including the most recent addition of the ACA Medicaid expansion population (i.e., individuals under the age of 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level). Moreover, Medicaid's financial eligibility rules have been modified over time for certain groups. Medicaid is a means-tested program that is limited to those with financial need. However, the criteria used to determine financial eligibility\u00e2\u0080\u0094income and, sometimes, resource (i.e., asset) tests\u00e2\u0080\u0094vary by eligibility group. These income and resource tests are expressed separately as an income standard and a resource standard . The income standard is expressed as a dollar amount or as a share of the federal poverty level (FPL). The resource standard is expressed as a dollar amount. The ways in which income and resources are counted for the purposes of applying the respective standard are referred to as the income - counting methodology and resource - counting methodology (see text box \"Medicaid Financial Criteria: Terminology\"). Under the income-counting methodology, certain types of income may be disregarded before comparing a person's (or household's) income against the income standard, enabling individuals with higher amounts of gross income to meet the income standard and qualify for Medicaid. Similarly, certain rules determine how an applicant's resources (i.e., assets) are counted before they are compared to the specified resource standard. For most eligibility groups\u00e2\u0080\u0094nonelderly and nondisabled individuals, children under the age of 18, and adults and pregnant women under the age of 65\u00e2\u0080\u0094the financial criteria used to determine Medicaid eligibility are based on Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) income-counting rules. No resource or asset test is used to determine Medicaid financial eligibility for MAGI-eligible individuals.  Although MAGI applies to most Medicaid eligible populations, certain populations (e.g., older adults and individuals with disabilities) are statutorily exempt from MAGI income-counting rules. Instead, Medicaid financial eligibility for MAGI-exempted populations is based on the income-counting rules that match the most closely related social program for the group involved (e.g., SSI program rules for the aged, blind, or disabled eligibility groups). Thus, SSI program rules form the foundation of Medicaid eligibility for older adults and individuals with disabilities under mandatory and optional eligibility pathways and include both an income and a resource or asset test (see the next section for more information on SSI rules). However, under optional SSI-Related and Other ABD eligibility pathways, states may modify SSI program rules when determining income- and resource-counting methodologies. For example, some optional eligibility pathways allow states to choose their own income- or resource-counting methodology. Other eligibility pathways allow states to use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA, which lets them choose more liberal income- or resource-counting methodologies than those under the SSI program. Thus, for certain optional eligibility pathways, a state can choose to include or disregard certain sources of income or resources, in part or in whole, when determining whether an applicant meets the income or resource standards for that optional eligibility pathway. (See Table A-2 in the Appendix , which lists the financial eligibility criteria\u00e2\u0080\u0094income standard and counting methodologies and resource standard and counting methodologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094for each Medicaid eligibility pathway identified in this report.) In addition, state Medicaid programs are required to establish an Asset Verification System (AVS) that meets certain minimum requirements to determine and re-determine Medicaid eligibility for aged, blind, or disabled Medicaid applicants and enrollees. Further discussion of AVS is beyond the scope of this report. SSI program rules form the foundation of Medicaid categorical and financial eligibility criteria for older adults and individuals with disabilities. Medicaid generally uses SSI categorical criteria to define the ABD populations. In addition, Medicaid often uses or adapts SSI's financial standards and counting methodologies to specify the financial eligibility requirements applicable to the SSI-Related Pathways and the Other ABD Pathways. Thus, understanding SSI program rules is important to understanding Medicaid eligibility rules for older adults and individuals with disabilities.  SSI is a federal assistance program authorized under Title XVI of the SSA that provides monthly cash payments to aged, blind, or disabled individuals who have limited income and resources. SSI is intended to provide a guaranteed minimum income to adults who have difficulty covering their basic living expenses due to age or disability and who have little or no Social Security or other income. It is also designed to supplement the support and maintenance of needy children under the age of 18 who have severe disabilities. Unlike Medicaid, SSI eligibility requirements and benefit levels are based on nationally uniform standards. SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration but is not part of the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program, commonly known as Social Security.  The following sections provide a brief overview of SSI's categorical and financial eligibility criteria. For more information on these and other SSI criteria, see CRS Report R44948, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI): Eligibility, Benefits, and Financing .  To be categorically eligible for SSI, a person must be an \"aged, blind, or disabled individual,\" as defined in Title XVI of the SSA ( Table 2 ). The term \"aged\" refers to individuals aged 65 and older. The term \"blind\" refers to individuals of any age who have central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens, or a limitation in the fields of vision so that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle of 20 degrees or less (i.e., tunnel vision).  Adults aged 18 and older are considered \"disabled\" if they are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. The Social Security Administration uses a monthly earnings standard to determine whether an individual's work activity constitutes SGA. The agency adjusts this standard annually to reflect changes in national wage levels. In 2019, the SGA earnings standard is $1,220 per month. (The SGA earnings standard is a proxy measure for total disability; it is not used to determine financial eligibility for SSI.) Adults generally qualify as disabled if they have an impairment (or combination of impairments) of such severity that they are unable to perform any kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy in significant numbers, taking into consideration their age, education, and work experience. Children under the age of 18 are considered \"disabled\" if they have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that (1) results in marked and severe functional limitations and (2) can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. Children typically qualify as disabled if they have a severe impairment (or combination of impairments) that limits their ability to engage in age-appropriate childhood activities at home, in childcare, at school, or in the community. In addition, the child's earnings must not exceed the SGA standard. The Social Security Administration periodically reevaluates blind or disabled SSI recipients to determine if they continue to meet the applicable definition of blindness or disability. In general, the Social Security Administration schedules continuing disability reviews (CDRs) of blind or disabled SSI recipients at least once every three to seven years, depending on the likelihood of medical improvement. In addition, the agency reevaluates child SSI recipients under the adult definition of disability when they attain age 18. To be financially eligible for SSI, a person must have income and resources within certain limits ( Table 2 ). The SSI income standard is equal to the SSI federal benefit rate (FBR), which is the maximum monthly SSI payment available under the program. In 2019, the SSI FBR is $771 per month for an individual and $1,157 per month for a married couple if both members are SSI eligible. Expressed as a share of the federal poverty level (FPL), the SSI FBR in 2019 is about 74% of FPL for an individual and 82% of FPL for a couple. The SSI FBR is adjusted annually for inflation by the same cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) applied to Social Security benefits. The SSI resource standard is $2,000 for an individual and $3,000 for a couple. These amounts are not adjusted for inflation and have remained at their current levels since 1989. Under the SSI program, a person's income and resources are counted against the income and resource standards unless they are excluded by federal law or by the Commissioner of Social Security pursuant to discretionary authority provided in statute. The SSI income-counting methodology excludes, among other things, the first $20 per month of any income, as well as the first $65 per month of earned income plus one-half of any earnings above $65. These amounts are not adjusted for inflation and have remained in place since SSI was enacted in 1972. The SSI resource-counting methodology excludes, among other things, a person's primary residence, household goods and personal effects, one automobile used for transportation, and property essential to self-support. For an eligible individual without an eligible spouse, the SSI income- and resource-counting methodologies are generally person-based, meaning the program counts the income and resources owned or used by the individual to determine eligibility for SSI and the amount of the payment. In certain situations, however, SSI may count a portion of the income or resources of certain ineligible family members toward the eligible individual's income or resource standard. This process, known as \"deeming,\" applies primarily to eligible children under the age of 18 who live in the same household as their ineligible parent(s) and to eligible married adults who live in the same household as their ineligible spouse. SSI deeming rules are complex and beyond the scope of this report. The Social Security Administration calculates a person's countable income and resources (i.e., gross income and resources less applicable exclusions) and then subtracts those amounts from the income and resource standards to determine financial eligibility and the amount of the cash payment (if any). Individuals with countable income and resources at or below the applicable standards are eligible for SSI. The Social Security Administration periodically reevaluates an SSI recipient's financial circumstances (i.e., income, resources, and living arrangements) to determine if the person is still eligible for SSI and receiving the correct payment amount. Automatic redeterminations are scheduled annually or once every six years, depending on the likelihood of change in a recipient's circumstances.  Medicaid enrollees\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the ABD populations\u00e2\u0080\u0094may have long-term care needs as well. In general, to receive Medicaid LTSS coverage, enrollees must also meet state-based level-of-care eligibility criteria. In other words, they must demonstrate the need for long-term care. In addition, such individuals may be subject to a separate set of Medicaid financial eligibility rules to receive LTSS coverage. Level-of-care eligibility criteria for most Medicaid-covered LTSS specify that individuals must require care provided in a nursing facility or other institutional setting. A state's institutional level-of-care criteria, in general, are also applied to Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) eligibility. That is, eligibility for Medicaid LTSS, both institutional care and most HCBS, is tied to needs-based criteria that require an individual to meet an institutional level-of-care need.  There is no federal definition for Medicaid institutional level-of-care, and each state defines its level-of-care criteria. To define institutional level-of-care criteria, states may use \"functional\" criteria, such as an individual's ability to perform certain activities of daily living (ADLs). States may also use \"clinical\" level-of-care criteria, such as the diagnosis of an illness, injury, disability or other medical condition; treatment and medications; and cognitive status or behavioral issues, among other criteria. Most states use a combination of functional and clinical criteria in defining the need for LTSS. Certain optional ABD eligibility pathways (as described in the section entitled \" Other ABD Pathways \") are available for older adults and individuals with disabilities \u00e2\u0080\u0094Special Income Level, Special Home and Community-Based Waiver Group, Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) State Plan, and Katie Beckett. These optional eligibility pathways establish eligibility to Medicaid, in general, along with Medicaid-covered LTSS for individuals who receive institutional care, or for those who need the level of care provided in an institution and receive Medicaid-covered HCBS. Medicaid enrollees in other mandatory or optional eligibility pathways may also be eligible to receive LTSS if they meet the level of care criteria. Applicants seeking Medicaid-covered LTSS are subject to a separate set of Medicaid financial eligibility rules (e.g., limits on the value of home equity and asset transfer rules). These additional financial rules are in place to ensure that program applicants apply their assets toward the cost of their care and do not divest them to gain eligibility sooner. In addition, Medicaid specifies rules for equitably allocating income and assets to non-Medicaid-covered spouses to determine LTSS coverage eligibility for nursing facility services and some HCBS. Commonly referred to as spousal impoverishment rules , these rules are intended to prevent the impoverishment of the spouse who does not need LTSS. Medicaid has another set of rules for the treatment of income after an individual is determined eligible for certain Medicaid-covered LTSS, referred to as Post-Eligibility Treatment of Income (PETI) rules. In general, eligible beneficiaries whose income exceeds specified amounts are required to apply their income toward the cost of their care. Within federal guidelines, a participant may retain a certain amount of income for personal use based on the services he or she receives. This amount varies by care setting (i.e., institutional versus HCBS). These specific financial eligibility rules for Medicaid-covered LTSS are not described in this report; for more information, see CRS Report R43506, Medicaid Financial Eligibility for Long-Term Services and Supports . In addition, most states offer Medicaid-covered LTSS under waiver programs that operate outside requirements under the Medicaid State plan. Under SSA Section 1915(c), states can cover HCBS, which includes a wide variety of nonmedical, social, and supportive services that allow individuals who require an institutional level of care to live independently in the community. SSA Section 1915(c) authorizes the HHS Secretary to waive requirements regarding comparability of services and offering services statewide (i.e., referred to as statewideness). In addition, states may waive certain income and resource rules applicable to persons in the community, so that a spouse's or parent's income (and, to some extent, resources) are not considered available to the applicant for the purposes of determining Medicaid financial eligibility. States may use Section 1915(c) concurrently with other waiver authorities. For example, states may combine Section 1915(b) and 1915(c) authorities to offer mandatory managed care for HCBS. States may also limit or cap program enrollment in the waiver. For each Section 1915(c) waiver program, states must identify the Medicaid eligibility groups receiving waiver services from those groups already covered under the Medicaid State plan. In doing so, states may include both mandatory and optional groups. To expand LTSS coverage, states may use Section 1115 of the SSA to waive certain state plan requirements. States have used Section 1115 waivers to expand eligibility to groups beyond those the statute allows, to cap program enrollment, and to impose waiting periods prior to enrollment. States have also used Section 1115 waiver programs to modify the income- and resource-counting rules and methodologies for specified groups\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, to encourage participation in managed LTSS, and to otherwise liberalize or limit income-counting rules for specified subpopulations. Moreover, states have used Section 1115 waiver authority to modify spend-down requirements, and to modify periods of retroactive eligibility and/or periods for eligibility redeterminations, among other eligibility-related purposes. Further discussion of Medicaid eligibility under these waiver programs is beyond the scope of this report. SSI-Related Pathways consist of mandatory and optional eligibility groups that meet the general requirements of the SSI program. These groups include aged, blind, or disabled individuals who are SSI eligible, deemed to be SSI eligible, or would be SSI eligible if not for a certain SSI program rule. This report organizes the SSI-Related Pathways into three subgroups, each of which contains multiple eligibility pathways: (1) SSI Recipients, (2) Special Groups of Former SSI Recipients, and (3) Other SSI-Related Groups. The pathways for SSI Recipients extend Medicaid coverage to individuals who are enrolled in the SSI program and who either receive SSI, are deemed to receive SSI, or receive only state supplementary payments (SSPs, discussed below). States are generally required to provide Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients. However, states may use more restrictive eligibility criteria than those of the SSI program if they were using such criteria in 1972. Individuals in receipt of SSI for a given month are usually eligible for Medicaid for that month. SSI recipients typically become ineligible for Medicaid whenever their cash payments are suspended or terminated. In December 2018, 8.1 million individuals received SSI or federally administered SSP.  Unless states elect the option discussed in the next section, they must provide Medicaid coverage for all SSI recipients. Most states that provide Medicaid coverage for all SSI recipients do so automatically. Section 1634 of the SSA allows states to enter into an agreement with the Social Security Administration for the agency to conduct Medicaid eligibility determinations and redeterminations for SSI recipients on the state's behalf. In these states, an SSI application is also an application for Medicaid, and an SSI redetermination is also a redetermination of Medicaid eligibility. States that choose to contract with the Social Security Administration under Section 1634 of the SSA are known as \"1634 states.\" In 2019, 34 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients using this option (see Table 3 ). Some states that provide Medicaid coverage for all SSI recipients choose to conduct their own Medicaid eligibility determinations and redeterminations. These states use the same standards and methodologies of the SSI program to determine Medicaid eligibility but require SSI recipients to file a separate Medicaid application with the state or local Medicaid office. States that elect this option are known as \"SSI criteria states.\" In 2019, eight states provide Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients using this option (see Table 3 ). Under Section 1902(f) of the SSA, states have the option of applying eligibility criteria that are more restrictive than those of the SSI program in determining Medicaid eligibility for SSI recipients. However, any more restrictive eligibility criteria that are applied to SSI recipients may not be more restrictive than those contained in the state's Medicaid plan that was in effect on January 1, 1972. States that provide Medicaid coverage for only those SSI recipients who meet more restrictive eligibility criteria than SSI criteria are known as \"209(b) states,\" after the section of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-603) that established the option. In 2019, eight states provide Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients using this option (see Table 3 ). 209(b) states apply at least one eligibility criterion that is more restrictive than SSI criteria in determining Medicaid eligibility for SSI recipients, such as a stricter definition of blindness or disability, a lower income or resource standard, a less generous methodology for counting income or resources, or some combination of those factors. For example, New Hampshire imposes a longer duration-of-impairment requirement for individuals with a disability other than blindness (48 months instead of SSI's 12-month standard), and Virginia limits ownership of property contiguous to an individual's home (i.e., land other than the lot occupied by the home) to $5,000. 209(b) states may also use eligibility criteria that are more liberal than those of the SSI program under the authority provided in Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA; however, they must retain at least one eligibility criterion that is more restrictive than SSI criteria to remain in 209(b) status. 209(b) states are required to deduct the value of SSI and any optional state supplementary payments (discussed below) from an SSI recipient's income in determining Medicaid eligibility. They must also allow SSI recipients to \"spend down\" or deduct incurred medical expenses from their income to the point where they meet the applicable income standard needed for Medicaid eligibility. Because SSI program rules form the foundation of Medicaid eligibility criteria for the ABD populations, 209(b) states may apply their more restrictive eligibility criteria to most other eligibility pathways for ABD individuals, subject to the same terms and conditions discussed above. Some states complement federal SSI payments with optional state supplementary payments (SSPs), which are made solely with state funds. SSPs are intended to help individuals whose basic needs are not fully met by the SSI federal benefit rate (FBR). States may provide SSPs to all SSI recipients, or they may limit payments to certain individuals, such as residents of domiciliary-care facilities or blind individuals. SSP amounts, standards, and methodologies are determined by the states, pursuant to certain federal requirements. States may self-administer their SSP program (i.e., state administered SSP), or they may contract with the Social Security Administration for the agency to administer the program on the state's behalf (i.e., federally administered SSP). In 2019, 44 states and the District of Columbia provide optional SSPs to some or all SSI recipients. States have the option to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who receive only an optional SSP. Individuals receive an optional SSP, but no SSI payment, if their countable income is at least equal to the SSI income standard but less than the state-established income standard used to determine optional SSPs. The \"SSP income standard\" is effectively the combined amount of the SSI FBR and the maximum applicable SSP. For example, in 2019, the SSP income standard for a disabled individual living independently in California is $931.72 per month: the SSI FBR of $771 per month plus the maximum applicable SSP of $160.72 per month. In this case, the disabled individual would receive only an optional SSP if his or her countable income were at least $771 per month but less than $931.12 per month. In general, states must apply the same standards and methodologies to individuals under this pathway that they apply to individuals receiving SSI, including any standards or methodologies that are more restrictive than those of the SSI program in the case of 209(b) states. However, 209(b) states and SSI criteria states that self-administer their SSP program may apply a more restrictive income-counting methodology to individuals under this pathway than the one they apply to individuals receiving SSI. According to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC), 43 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid for individuals who receive only an optional SSP. (This pathway is closed to new enrollment and applies to relatively few people.) Section 212 of P.L. 93-66 requires nearly all states to maintain the December 1973 income levels of individuals who were transferred from the former federal-state cash assistance programs for the aged, blind, and disabled (hereinafter \"former adult assistance programs\") to the SSI program in January 1974. To receive federal Medicaid funding, states must provide a special payment, known as a mandatory SSP, to individuals who were converted from the former adult assistance programs to the SSI program if the individual's SSI payment plus other income from the current month is less than his or her December 1973 state grant amount plus certain other income. The amount of the mandatory SSP is the difference between the current SSI payment and the individual's December 1973 payment under the former adult assistance program. Section 13(c) of P.L. 93-233 requires states to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who receive mandatory SSPs.  All states (including 209[b] states) are required to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who are enrolled in the SSI program but have earnings above certain SSI limits. Under Section 1619(a) and 1619(b) of the SSA, individuals who would continue to be eligible to receive SSI if not for their earnings may be deemed to be receiving SSI for Medicaid eligibility purposes if they continue to work and meet certain other requirements. To qualify under the 1619 provisions, individuals must have been eligible for and received SSI for at least one month before the month the 1619 determination is made. (Adults aged 65 and older may qualify for the 1619 provisions, provided they meet the SSI definition of blindness or disability.) Individuals who live in 209(b) states must also have been eligible for Medicaid in the month immediately prior to becoming eligible for 1619 status. Section 1619(a) of the SSA provides for the continuation of cash payments for disabled SSI recipients with earnings that would otherwise disqualify them from SSI. Under this provision, disabled individuals who have earnings at or above the substantial gainful activity (SGA) standard ($1,220 per month in 2019) but whose countable income is less than the SSI income standard are eligible to receive special SSI payments in lieu of regular SSI payments. (SSI does not require blind individuals to meet the SGA standard; thus, 1619[a] does not apply to blind SSI recipients.) These 1619(a) payments are calculated in the same manner as regular SSI payments and are payable for as long as an individual performs SGA and meets all other SSI eligibility criteria. In addition to providing special payments, Section 1619(a) requires all states to provide Medicaid coverage for 1619(a) recipients on the same basis as they provide Medicaid coverage for regular SSI recipients.  Section 1619(b) of the SSA requires all states to provide Medicaid coverage for blind or disabled individuals who would continue to be eligible for regular SSI payments or 1619(a) payments if not for their earnings. Under this provision, blind or disabled individuals who lose SSI eligibility because their countable income exceeds the SSI income standard (or applicable SSP income standard) due to excess earnings are deemed to be receiving SSI for Medicaid eligibility purposes. To qualify under this pathway, individuals must (1) continue to be blind or disabled, (2) meet all SSI financial eligibility requirements except for earnings, (3) need Medicaid to continue working, and (4) have earnings that are considered insufficient to provide a reasonable equivalent of the benefits that would be provided if they did not have those earnings (i.e., SSI, SSP, Medicaid, and publically funded personal or attendant care). The Social Security Administration uses an annual earnings standard to determine when 1619(b) eligibility ends. The agency calculates this standard based on the sum of the amount of gross earnings that would reduce the SSI payment (or the combined amount of the SSI payment and the SSP) to zero for an individual living independently with no other income, and the state's average annual per capita Medicaid expenditures for blind or disabled SSI recipients.  The standard varies from state to state, depending on the amount of the SSP (if any) and per capita Medicaid expenditures. In 2019, the annual earnings standard for disabled 1619(b) participants ranges from $27,826 in Alabama to $66,452 in Connecticut, with the median being $36,548. If an individual's annual earnings exceed the predetermined standard, then the Social Security Administration will determine his or her eligibility using an individualized standard that takes into account the person's actual Medicaid expenditures, as well as the value of any publicly funded personal or attendant care that the individual receives from a program other than Medicaid. The pathways for Special Groups of Former SSI Recipients extend Medicaid coverage to special former SSI/SSP recipients who would continue to be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for receipt of certain Social Security benefits. Special former recipients are deemed to be receiving SSI/SSP for Medicaid eligibility purposes; however, unlike 1619 participants, they no longer have a current connection to the SSI program (i.e., they have been formally terminated from the rolls). In determining Medicaid eligibility, most states must disregard the applicable Social Security benefit or increases in that benefit from the special former recipient's countable income. In most instances, 209(b) states have the option to disregard all, some, or none of the applicable Social Security benefit or increases in that benefit from the special former recipient's countable income in determining Medicaid eligibility. However, 209(b) states must provide Medicaid coverage for special former recipients on the same basis as they provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who receive SSI/SSP. Section 503 of P.L. 94-566 generally requires states to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who would continue to be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for increases in their Social Security benefits due to COLAs. Individuals qualify under this pathway it they are receiving Social Security benefits, lost SSI/SSP but would still be eligible for those benefits if Social Security COLAs received since losing SSI/SSP were deducted from their income, and were eligible for and receiving SSI/SSP concurrently with Social Security for at least one month after April 1, 1977. 209(b) states may exclude all, some, or none of the Social Security benefit increases that caused ineligibility for SSI/SSP. This pathway is often known as the \"Pickle Amendment\" after the late Representative J.J. Pickle. (This pathway is closed to new enrollment and applies to relatively few people.) Social Security provides widow(er)'s benefits starting at age 60, or at age 50 if the individual is disabled and meets certain other criteria. The amount of the aged or disabled widow(er)'s benefit is based on the deceased insured worker's past earnings from covered employment, subject to a permanent reduction for each month of entitlement before the widow(er)'s full retirement age (65-67, depending on year of birth). Under P.L. 98-21 , lawmakers eliminated the additional reduction factor (ARF) for disabled widow(er)s aged 50-59, meaning their reduction penalty for claiming benefits before their full retirement age was capped at the percentage applicable to aged widow(er)s who first claim at age 60. All states (including 209[b] states) are required to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who would continue to be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for increases in their widow(er)'s benefits due to the elimination of the ARF (known as \"ARF Widow[er]s\"). Individuals qualify under this pathway if they were entitled to Social Security benefits in December 1983 and received disabled widow(er)'s benefits and SSI/SSP in January 1984, lost SSI/SSP eligibility because of the elimination of the ARF, have been continuously entitled to widow(er)'s benefits since January 1984, filed for Medicaid continuation before July 1, 1988 (or a slightly later date in some cases), and would continue to be eligible for SSI/SSP if the value of the increase in disabled widow(er)'s benefits under P.L. 98-21 and any subsequent COLAs were deducted from their countable income.  Disabled adult children of retired, disabled, or deceased insured workers typically qualify for Social Security disabled adult child's (DAC) benefits if they are at least age 18 and became disabled before they attained age 22. States are generally required to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who lose eligibility for SSI/SSP due to entitlement to or an increase in DAC benefits. Individuals qualify under this pathway if they lose eligibility for SSI/SSP due to receipt of DAC benefits on or after July 1, 1987, and would continue to be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for their entitlement to or an increase in DAC benefits. 209(b) states may exclude all, some, or none of the DAC benefit or increases in that benefit that caused ineligibility for SSI/SSP. States are generally required to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals aged 50 to 64 who lose eligibility for SSI/SSP due to entitlement to Social Security widow(er)'s benefits but who are not yet entitled to Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance). Individuals qualify under this pathway if they are at least age 50 but have not yet attained age 65, received SSI/SSP in the month before their widow(er)'s benefits began, are not entitled to Medicare Part A, and would continue to be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for their entitlement widow(er)'s benefits.  Eligibility for Medicaid under this pathway continues until the individual becomes entitled to Medicare Part A. 209(b) states may exclude all, some, or none of the widow(er)'s benefit that caused ineligibility for SSP/SSI.  (This pathway is closed to new enrollment and applies to relatively few people.) Section 249E of P.L. 92-603 requires states to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who would be eligible for SSI/SSP in the absence of a Social Security COLA enacted in 1972 under P.L. 92-336. Individuals qualify under this provision if they were entitled to Social Security benefits in August 1972, were receiving cash assistance under the former adult assistance programs in August 1972 (or would have been eligible for such assistance in certain instances), and would be eligible for SSI/SSP had the COLA under P.L. 92-336 not been applied to their Social Security benefits. The pathways for Other SSI-Related Groups extend Medicaid coverage to certain individuals who were eligible for Medicaid just prior to SSI's start in 1974, and to aged, blind, or disabled individuals who would be eligible for SSI/SSP today if not for a certain requirement in those programs. Although these groups may have received SSI/SSP in the past, their eligibility for Medicaid under these pathways is not conditional on their prior receipt of such payments. (These pathways are closed to new enrollment and apply to relatively few people.) Sections 230 to 232 of P.L. 93-66 require states to provide Medicaid to three groups that were eligible for Medicaid in December 1973: (1) essential spouses, (2) institutionalized individuals, and (3) blind or disabled individuals. Essential spouses are the spouses of cash assistance recipients under the former adult assistance programs whose needs were included in determining the amount of the cash payment to the recipient. Institutionalized individuals are inpatients of medical institutions or residents of intermediate care facilities who received cash assistance under the former adult assistance programs (or who would have been eligible for such assistance if they were not institutionalized). Blind or disabled individuals are individuals who met the state-established criteria for blindness or disability under the state's Medicaid plan in December 1973. States must provide Medicaid for these groups if they continue to meet the respective eligibility criteria that were in effect in December 1973, in addition to meeting certain other requirements. States have the option to provide Medicaid coverage for aged, blind, or disabled individuals who meet the income and resource requirements for SSI/SSP but who do not receive cash payments. Individuals may be eligible for but not receiving SSI/SSP because they have not applied for benefits. According to estimates from HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, about 60% of single adults aged 18 and older who were eligible for SSI in 2015 participated in the program that year. In 209(b) states, eligibility under this pathway is determined before the deduction of any incurred medical expenses recognized under a state plan (i.e., before spend-down). Residents of public institutions are generally ineligible for SSI. However, residents of certain medical institutions are eligible for a reduced SSI payment if more than 50% of the cost of their care is paid for by Medicaid (or in the case of a child under the age of 18, by any combination of Medicaid and private health insurance). The reduced SSI payment, known as a personal needs allowance (PNA), is used to pay for small comfort items not provided by the facility. Capped at $30 per month, or $60 per month for couples in certain situations, the PNA is not indexed to inflation and has remained at its current level since July 1988. Some states supplement the PNA (i.e., provide an SSP) for institutionalized individuals who meet certain requirements. Any countable income reduces the PNA for institutionalized individuals; however, the SSI/SSP income standard is used in determining their eligibility for the SSI program.  States have the option to provide Medicaid coverage for institutionalized individuals who are ineligible for SSI/SSP because of the lower income standards used to determine eligibility for the PNA but who would be eligible for SSI/SSP if they were not institutionalized. In other words, states may provide Medicaid to individuals who reside in certain Title XIX-reimbursable institutions who have countable income at or above the PNA standard ($30 for an individual) but within the SSI/SSP income standard ($771 for an individual in 2019). States are generally required to provide Medicaid coverage for aged, blind, or disabled individuals who would be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for an eligibility requirement used in those programs that is prohibited by Medicaid. For example, Section 4735 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-33 ) requires states to exclude from eligibility determinations certain settlement payments made to hemophilia patients who were infected with HIV. However, federal law does not exempt such payments from being counted as income or resources under the SSI program. CMS regulations require states to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who lost SSI eligibility because they received settlement payments. States may extend Medicaid coverage to older adults and individuals with disabilities who have higher levels of income or resources than those permitted by SSI program rules under optional aged, blind, or disabled (ABD) eligibility pathways. In addition, some optional ABD eligibility pathways allow states to choose their own methodology for counting income and resources; others permit states to use less restrictive income- or resource-counting methodologies compared with SSI rules. As previously mentioned, certain optional eligibility pathways for older adults and individuals with disabilities (e.g., Special Income Level, Special Home and Community-Based Waiver Group, Home and Community-Based Services [HCBS] State Plan, and Katie Beckett) establish eligibility to Medicaid, in general, along with Medicaid-covered LTSS. In addition, Medicaid gives states the option to extend eligibility to individuals who \"spend down\" or deplete their income on medical expenses, including LTSS, to specified levels. Therefore, some individuals with higher levels of income and resources compared with those permitted under SSI rules may be Medicaid-eligible.  This section describes the following optional Medicaid eligibility pathways for ABD individuals: (1) Poverty-Related; (2) Special Income Level; (3) Special Home and Community-Based Services Waiver Group; (4) Home and Community-Based Services State Plan Option; (5) Katie Beckett; (6) Buy-In Groups; and (7) Medically Needy. Enacted under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86; P.L. 99-509 ), the optional Poverty-Related eligibility pathway allows states to cover aged and/or disabled individuals who have incomes that are higher than SSI standards, with family income up to 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL), provided that the state also covers certain eligible pregnant women and children. Aged individuals are defined as being 65 years old and older, and disabled individuals must meet the SSI program's applicable definition of disability. States may employ a reasonable definition of a \"family\" for purposes of the individual's countable income. In general, states must use SSI rules in determining what income is counted or not counted. An individual's resources cannot exceed the SSI resource standard with SSI rules used in determining countable resources. However, states may use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA to disregard additional countable income or resources. In 2018, 24 states and the District of Columbia (DC) offered the optional Poverty-Related eligibility pathway. Seventeen states and DC had an income standard that was set at 100% of the FPL under the Poverty-Related pathway; seven maintained a more restrictive income standard than 100% of the FPL. For example, Florida's standard was 88% of the FPL, and Idaho's was 77% of the FPL. The optional Special Income Level eligibility pathway allows states to establish a higher income standard for Medicaid coverage of nursing facility services and other institutional services, sometimes referred to as the special income rule , or the \"the 300% rule.\" To be eligible for Medicaid through this pathway, individuals must require care provided by a nursing facility or other medical institution for no less than 30 consecutive days, and have an income standard that does not exceed a specified level\u00e2\u0080\u0094no greater than 300% of the SSI FBR (i.e., the maximum SSI payment), which is approximately 222% of the FPL. Only the applicant's income (i.e., no income from spouses) is counted, and all income sources are counted in determining eligibility; there are no income disregards or deductions. For individuals seeking eligibility based on being aged 65 and older, or having blindness, or disability, the SSI resource standard and resource-counting methodology are used to determine eligibility. States may also use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA to disregard additional income or resources. Under the Special Income Level pathway, eligibility starts on the first of the 30 days that the individual resides in an institution. Thus, Medicaid can cover all of the care an individual receives in a nursing facility. In 2018, 42 states and the District of Columbia used the Special Income Level to enable persons to qualify for Medicaid coverage of institutional care.  The Special Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver Group eligibility pathway allows states to extend Medicaid eligibility to individuals receiving HCBS under a waiver program who require the level of care provided by a nursing facility or other medical institution. This eligibility pathway is sometimes referred to as the \"217 Group\" in reference to the specific regulatory section for this group, 42 C.F.R. Section 435.217. States use the highest income and resource standard of a separate eligibility group covered by the state plan under which an individual would otherwise qualify if institutionalized. For example, states that offer the Special Income Level pathway described above can extend eligibility to waiver program participants with income up to 300% of the SSI FBR. States must use the income- and resource-counting methodologies used to determine eligibility for this same eligibility group. States may also apply Section 1902(r)(2)'s more liberal income-counting rules to this group. States may establish an independent eligibility pathway into Medicaid through the Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) State Plan option. This option is made available by extending the required and optional Medicaid state plan services, sometimes referred to as \"traditional\" Medicaid services, to individuals who are also receiving a targeted package of HCBS state plan services. In general, receipt of the Medicaid HCBS State Plan option is conditional on an individual having a need for long-term care (i.e., individuals must meet certain level-of-care criteria). Unlike Section 1915(c) HCBS waiver programs, which require that eligible individuals need the level of care provided in an institution (e.g., hospital or nursing facility), the HCBS state plan option delinks this requirement so that individuals with long-term care needs are not required to meet an institutional level of care need. The HCBS State Plan option was first enacted under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171 ) and amended under the ACA. The income standard for the HCBS State Plan option applies to individuals who have income no higher than 150% of the FPL. For individuals who otherwise meet the requirements for an approved waiver program, the income standard can be no higher than 300% of the SSI FBR. States may choose to cover individuals under either or both income standards. Generally, states use SSI income-counting methodologies; however, states have some discretion to apply alternative methodologies, subject to the approval of the Secretary of HHS. There are no resource standards for this eligibility group, with the exception for those individuals who seek to establish eligibility based on an approved waiver program. For these individuals, states must use the same income and resource standards and counting methodologies as applied to those individuals eligible under the applicable waiver program. States may also use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA to disregard additional income or resources. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available, 15 states and the District of Columbia offered at least one Section 1915(i) HCBS State Plan option; however, only two states (Indiana and Ohio) used this state plan authority as an independent eligibility pathway to Medicaid. As another option, states may choose to provide HCBS state plan services to those who are eligible for Medicaid under one of the state's existing Medicaid eligibility pathways. Enacted under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA; P.L. 97-248 ), the Katie Beckett optional pathway provides coverage to severely disabled children whose parents' income is otherwise too high for the child to qualify for Medicaid LTSS at home. Under the Katie Beckett pathway, states may extend Medicaid coverage to disabled children who meet the applicable SSI definition of disability and who are age 18 or younger and live at home. In addition, the state must determine that (1) the child requires the level of care provided in an institution, (2) it is appropriate to provide care outside the facility, and (3) the cost of care at home is no more than institutional care. States electing this option are required to cover all disabled children who meet these criteria. States must use SSI income and resources rules to determine eligibility; however, only the child's income and resources, if any, are counted. Parents' income and resources are not counted. A child's income cannot exceed the highest income standard used to determine eligibility for any separate group under which the individual would be eligible if institutionalized. In general, states set income standards up to 300% of the SSI FBR, which is about 222% of the FPL. States may not use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA to use more liberal income- or resource-counting methodologies. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available, 24 states and the District of Columbia offered the Katie Beckett pathway under their Medicaid state plan.  There are several optional Medicaid Buy-In eligibility pathways for working individuals with disabilities or working families who have a child with a disability. In general, individuals eligible under Buy-In pathways would be eligible for Medicaid except for the fact that their income is higher than the income standard allowed by the SSI program under Section 1619(b) of the SSA, which varies by state. Medicaid Buy-In pathways are designed to allow disabled individuals to work and still retain their Medicaid coverage, or to use their Medicaid coverage to access wraparound services that are not covered under an employer-sponsored plan. States can also impose premiums or other types of cost-sharing requirements on eligible individuals, which can be done on a sliding scale based on income. The extent to which states impose premiums and cost-sharing varies by state.  Medicaid Buy-In pathways include the BBA 97 Eligibility Group, the Basic Eligibility Group, and the Medical Improvement Group. There is also a separate Buy-In pathway for disabled children, called the Family Opportunity Act. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available, 44 states and the District of Columbia chose to offer coverage through at least one Buy-In pathway. Enacted under Section 4733 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97; P.L. 105-33 ), this optional pathway is available to individuals with disabilities who work and have family income below 250% of the FPL, based on the size of the family. Individuals with disabilities must meet the SSI program's applicable definition of disability. Each state determines what constitutes a \"family\" for the purposes of this eligibility group. Family income is determined by applying the SSI income-counting methodology. In addition to the family income requirement, the applicant's unearned income must be less than the SSI income standard. All earned income is disregarded. An individual's countable resources must be less than or equal to the SSI resource standard using the SSI resource-counting methodology. However, states may use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA to disregard additional income or resources. Enacted under Section 201 of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (TWWIIA; P.L. 106-170 ), this optional pathway is similar to the BBA 97 Eligibility Group but is available to people with higher levels of income (i.e., above 250% of the FPL). There are no federal income or resource standards for the Basic Eligibility Group; rather, states can determine the income and resource standards, including no standards, rather than using the SSI program's requirements. However, if a state chooses to establish an income and/or resource standard, SSI income- and resource-counting methodologies apply. States may use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA to disregard additional earned income above the SSI-earned-income disregard, including disregarding all earned income. Individuals with disabilities eligible under this pathway must be aged 16 to 64 and meet the SSI program's applicable definition of disability. The Medical Improvement Group pathway was also enacted under Section 201 of TWWIIA. For states to cover this eligibility group, they must also cover the TWWIIA Basic Eligibility Group. Individuals eligible under the Medical Improvement Group were previously eligible under the Basic Eligibility Group but lost that eligibility because they were determined to have \"medically improved,\" meaning they no longer meet the definition of disability under the SSI or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs but continue to have a severe medically determinable impairment. Eligible individuals must be aged 16 to 64, earn at least the federal minimum wage, and work at least 40 hours per month or be engaged in a work effort that meets certain criteria for hours of work, wages, or other measures, as defined by the state and approved by the Secretary of HHS. As with the Basic Eligibility Group, states may determine the income and resource standards, including no standards, for this pathway. Similarly, states may use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA to disregard additional earned income above the SSI-earned-income disregard, including disregarding all earned income. Established under Section 6061 of the DRA, the Family Opportunity Act (FOA) optional pathway allows families with income up to 300% of the FPL to buy Medicaid coverage for their disabled child aged 18 or younger (states can exceed 300% of the FPL without federal matching funds for such coverage). When determining a child's Medicaid eligibility, states choosing this pathway use the SSI program's applicable definition of disability, as well as SSI's income-counting methodology for a family, based on its size. There is no resource standard or applicable resource-counting methodology. States may use Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA to disregard additional earned income above the SSI-earned-income disregard. States must require certain parents of eligible children under the FOA optional coverage group to enroll in, and pay premiums for, family coverage through employer-sponsored insurance as a condition of continuing Medicaid eligibility for the child.  The Medically Needy option is targeted toward individuals with high medical expenses who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid except that their income exceeds the income standards for other state-covered eligibility pathways. Individuals may qualify in one of two ways: either (1) their income or resources are at or below a state established standard, or (2) they spend down their income to the state-established standard by subtracting incurred medical expenses from their income. For example, if an individual has $1,000 in monthly income and the state's income threshold is $600, then the applicant would be required to incur $400 in out-of-pocket medical expenses during a state-determined budget period before being eligible for Medicaid. Examples of medical expenses that may be deducted from income include Medicare and other health insurance premiums, deductibles and coinsurance charges, and other medical expenses included in the state's Medicaid plan or recognized under state law. For individuals who spend down to Medicaid eligibility, states select a specific time period for determining whether or not the applicant meets the spend-down obligation, often referred to as a \"budget period,\" which generally ranges from one to six months. States that choose to offer the Medically Needy option must cover pregnant women and children under the age of 18, and may choose to extend eligibility to the aged, blind, or disabled, among other groups. The Medically Needy option allows aged and disabled individuals who need expensive institutional LTSS to qualify for Medicaid nursing facility services. However, nursing facility services are optional services that states may elect to cover for Medically Needy individuals.  Under the Medically Needy option, states establish the income eligibility standard; however, it may be no higher than 133\u00e2\u0085\u0093% of the state's AFDC level in 1996. Typically, the AFDC level is lower than the income standard for SSI benefits. For example, in 2015 the median Medically Needy income standard for an individual was $483 per month, or about 49% of the FPL. States use the SSI income-counting methodology for aged, blind, or disabled individuals. States also set the resource standards within certain federal requirements. For aged, blind, or disabled individuals, the resource standard is generally the same as in the SSI program. In general, states must use SSI's applicable definition of disability when determining eligibility for the disabled eligibility group. In 2018, 32 states and the District of Columbia offered coverage to the Medically Needy.  Table A-1 lists selected Medicaid eligibility pathways that cover older adults and individuals with disabilities. These eligibility pathways are organized into two broad coverage groups: (1) SSI-Related Pathways and (2) Other ABD Pathways. The table includes a brief description of each pathway, the age criterion for eligibility, whether the pathway is mandatory or optional, the Social Security Act citation, and any applicable regulatory citations.  Table A-2 lists the income and resource standards, as well as the counting methodology, that applies to each standard for the selected Medicaid eligibility pathways that cover older adults and individuals with disabilities. In general, standards or limits on the amount of income and resources required for eligibility are expressed in relationship to the federal poverty level (FPL) or the SSI federal benefit rate (FBR). Where applicable, the income standard is presented as a monthly dollar amount for an individual in 2019.
