SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Sweatshops \nAct of 1997''.\n    (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \nexpressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \nprovision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \nother provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 \net seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The production of garments in violation of minimum \n        labor standards burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n        commerce by spreading and perpetuating labor conditions that \n        undermine minimum living standards and by providing an unfair \n        means of competition to the detriment of employers who comply \n        with the law.\n            (2) The existence of working conditions detrimental to fair \n        competition and the maintenance of minimum standards of living \n        necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of \n        workers is a continuing and growing problem in the domestic \n        garment industry.\n            (3) The Congress concurs in the findings of the Comptroller \n        General that most sweatshop employers violate the recordkeeping \n        requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and that \n        the failure of such employers to maintain adequate records has \n        affected, and continues to affect adversely, the ability of the \n        Department of Labor to collect wages due to workers.\n            (4) The amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n        to provide for legal responsibility on the part of \n        manufacturers for compliance with such Act's wage and hour, \n        child labor, and industrial homework provisions by contractors \n        in the garment industry and to provide civil penalties for \n        violations of that Act's recordkeeping requirements is \n        necessary to promote fair competition and working conditions \n        that are not detrimental to the maintenance of health, \n        efficiency, and general well-being of workers in the garment \n        industry.\n\nSEC. 3.
