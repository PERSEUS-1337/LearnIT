FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The People's Republic of China comprises one-fifth of \n        the world's population, or 1,200,000,000 people, and its \n        policies have a profound effect on the world economy and global \n        security.\n            (2) The People's Republic of China is a permanent member of \n        the United Nations Security Council and plays an important role \n        in regional organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic \n        Cooperation Forum and the ASEAN Regional Forum.\n            (3) The People's Republic of China is a nuclear power with \n        the largest standing army in the world, and has been rapidly \n        modernizing and expanding its military capabilities.\n            (4) The People's Republic of China is currently undergoing \n        a change of leadership which will have dramatic implications \n        for the political and economic future of the Chinese people and \n        for China's relations with the United States.\n            (5) China's estimated $600,000,000,000 economy has enjoyed \n        unparalleled growth in recent years.\n            (6) Despite increased economic linkages between the United \n        States and China, bilateral relations have deteriorated \n        significantly because of fundamental policy differences over a \n        variety of important issues.\n            (7) The People's Republic of China has violated \n        international standards regarding the nonproliferation of \n        weapons of mass destruction.\n            (8) The Government of the People's Republic of China, a \n        member of the United Nations Security Council, is obligated to \n        respect and uphold the United Nations Charter and Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights.\n            (9) According to the State Department Country Report on \n        Human Rights Practices for 1994, there continue to be \n        ``widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in China, \n        in violation of internationally accepted norms...(including) \n        arbitrary and lengthy incommunicado detention, torture, and \n        mistreatment of prisoners.... The regime continued severe \n        restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly and \n        association, and tightened control on the exercise of these \n        rights during 1994. Serious human rights abuses persisted in \n        Tibet and other areas populated by ethnic minorities.''.\n            (10) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n        continues to detain political prisoners and continues to \n        violate internationally recognized standards of human rights by \n        arbitrary arrests and detention of persons for the nonviolent \n        expression of their political and religious beliefs.\n            (11) The Government of the People's Republic of China does \n        not ensure the humane treatment of prisoners and does not allow \n        humanitarian and human rights organizations access to prisons.\n            (12) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n        continues to harass and restrict the activities of accredited \n        journalists and to restrict broadcasts by the Voice of America.\n            (13) In the weeks leading to the 6th anniversary of the \n        June 1989 massacre, a series of petitions were sent to the \n        Chinese Government calling for greater tolerance, democracy, \n        rule of law, and an accounting for the 1989 victims and the \n        Chinese Government responded by detaining dozens of prominent \n        intellectuals and activists.\n            (14) The unjustified and arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, \n        and initiation of criminal proceedings against Harry Wu, a \n        citizen of the United States, has greatly exacerbated the \n        deterioration in relations between the United States and the \n        People's Republic of China, and all charges against him should \n        be dismissed.\n            (15) China has failed to release political prisoners with \n        serious medical problems, such as Bao Tong, and on June 25, \n        1995, revoked ``medical parole'' for Chen-Ziming reimprisoning \n        him at Beijing No. 2 Prison, and Chinese authorities continue \n        to hold Wei Jingsheng incommunicado at an unknown location \n        since his arrest on April 1, 1994.\n            (16) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n        continues to engage in discriminatory and unfair trade \n        practices, including the exportation of products produced by \n        prison labor, the use of import quotas and other quantitative \n        restrictions on selected products, the unilateral increasing of \n        tariff rates and the imposition of taxes as surcharges on \n        tariffs, the barring of the importation of certain items, the \n        use of licensing and testing requirements to limit imports, and \n        the transshipment of textiles and other items through the \n        falsification of country of origin documentation.\n            (17) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n        continues to employ the policy and practice of controlling all \n        trade unions and continues to suppress and harass members of \n        the independent labor union movement.\n            (18) The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 states \n        that Congress wishes to see the provisions of the joint \n        declaration implemented, and declares that ``the human rights \n        of the people of Hong Kong are of great importance to the U.S. \n        Human Rights also serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued \n        prosperity,''. This together with the rule of law and a free \n        press are essential for a successful transition in 1997.\n            (19) The United States currently has numerous sanctions on \n        the People's Republic of China with respect to government-to-\n        government assistance, arms sales, and other commercial \n        transactions.\n            (20) It is in the interest of the United States to foster \n        China's continued engagement in the broadest range of \n        international fora and increased respect for human rights, \n        democratic institutions, and the rule of law in China.\n\nSEC. 3.
