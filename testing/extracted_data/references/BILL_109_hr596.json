FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \n        and conducted in full compliance with applicable Food and Drug \n        Administration regulations has demonstrated the feasibility of \n        using cord blood for clinical applications. Stem cells, \n        obtained from the blood contained in the delivered placenta and \n        umbilical cord and donated by the mother, can be used for bone \n        marrow reconstitution by transplantation to recipients with \n        certain malignancies (such as leukemia and lymphoma), genetic \n        disorders (such as sickle cell anemia), and acquired diseases.\n            (2) The placenta, umbilical cord, and the neonatal blood \n        they contain are normally discarded after childbirth. This \n        residual neonatal blood, termed cord blood, is a source of stem \n        cells that can be collected as donor tissue without risk to the \n        donor and can be preserved through freezing for many years and \n        be made immediately available for transplantation in routine or \n        emergency clinical situations. Scientific research on cord \n        blood stem cells may uncover a potential to treat a wide \n        variety of diseases not yet attempted.\n            (3) Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants include \n        no risk to the donor, and reduced risk of certain transplant \n        complications, including graft versus host disease and latent \n        virus infections (such as Epstein-Barr virus or \n        cytomegalovirus) and immediate availability of cord blood stem \n        cell units, whenever needed.\n            (4) Cord blood gives all patients a chance for a \n        transplant, regardless of their ethnic background. An \n        ethnically diverse inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell \n        units would help provide appropriate matches for 80 to 90 \n        percent of patients seeking matched cord blood stem cell \n        transplants.\n            (5) Some genetic conditions are more prevalent in members \n        of particular ethnic groups, such as sickle cell anemia, a \n        disease that occurs in one out of 500 African-American \n        newborns. From early infancy, patients with sickle cell anemia \n        have a high risk of severe or fatal bacterial blood infections. \n        Many patients develop painful crises beginning in infancy and \n        occurring up to 20 times per year. Children with recurrent \n        crises, chest syndrome or strokes, are at great risk of dying \n        before the age of 20 years. The median life-span of a patient \n        with sickle cell disease is 42 years, but patients with severe \n        disease in childhood rarely live beyond 20 years. Cord blood \n        stem cell transplantation has cured patients with sickle cell \n        anemia: 80 percent of children transplanted with related cord \n        blood to correct sickle cell anemia or thalassemia were cured \n        in a recently published study. The earlier in the course of \n        severe disease, the transplant is performed, the better the \n        outcomes. Unrelated cord blood transplants are especially \n        beneficial for African-American and other ethnic minority \n        patients because cord blood does not have to match as closely \n        as bone marrow. With an ethnically balanced national cord blood \n        stem cell network of at least 150,000 units, some 80 to 90 \n        percent of African American patients who suffer from sickle \n        cell anemia or other conditions requiring bone marrow \n        replacement would be able to find appropriately matched cord \n        blood stem cells for successful treatment.\n            (6) Cord blood is an alternate to bone marrow as a source \n        of stem cells for transplantation. Cord blood banks, therefore, \n        serve the same kinds of patients as marrow donor registries. \n        However, its collection, processing, storage and selection for \n        transplant require unique systems and expertise.\n            (7) Radiation exposure, from accidents or hostile actions, \n        could cause bone marrow failure in a portion of those exposed \n        and require treatment, including bone marrow reconstitution. In \n        these cases the rapid availability of frozen cord blood stem \n        cell units may be an important resource to help rescue the \n        victims years later, those who were exposed and survived may \n        incur an increased risk of leukemia or lymphoma, which might \n        also require stem cell transplantation.\n            (8) Recent scientific developments suggest that further \n        research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater \n        understanding of certain chronic diseases. This research might \n        improve therapies for, and possibly cure, debilitating diseases \n        such as Parkinson's disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, heart \n        disease, and certain types of cancer. These diseases cause a \n        disproportionately large share of chronic disabilities and \n        account for a large portion of health care expenditures in the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
