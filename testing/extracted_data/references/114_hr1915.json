FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Israel is threatened by missiles and rockets from \n        adversaries in the region.\n            (2) Over the past several years, with the assistance of the \n        governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria, \n        Hezbollah and Hamas have increased their stockpile of rockets \n        and missiles, which are ready to be fired at Israel. The \n        Lebanon conflict in 2006 proved that Large Caliber Artillery \n        Rockets (LCARs) and Short Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBMs) have \n        become an immediate mortal threat to the Israeli civilian \n        population and are in the possession of Hezbollah and Syria.\n            (3) In 2014, Hezbollah took possession of advanced guided-\n        missile systems from Syria, representing a major upgrade from \n        the tens of thousands unguided rockets in Hezbollah's \n        possession.\n            (4) Hamas militants recently acquired long-range M-302 \n        rockets and fired them deeper into Israel than they ever had \n        before.\n            (5) In 2008, the United States and Israel signed a project \n        agreement to co-develop the David's Sling system.\n            (6) The David's Sling system will provide Israel an \n        effective and affordable defense against the threat of LCAR, \n        Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBM) and against the emerging \n        Cruise Missile and similar representative threats, currently \n        proliferating in the region.\n            (7) Israeli Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) multi-tier \n        architecture is comprised of the Upper Tier (Arrow Weapon \n        System with Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 interceptors) and Lower Tier \n        (David's Sling and Iron Dome systems). Arrow 2 and Iron Dome \n        are operational, while David's Sling is expected to reach its \n        initial operational capability shortly, followed by Arrow 3 in \n        near future.\n            (8) Each system is designed to optimally encounter its own \n        range of threats, with a limited planned overlap between them. \n        David's Sling is designed to provide a regionally versatile \n        defense in a range between Iron Dome and Arrow 2 systems.\n            (9) The missile and rocket threat to Israel is immediate. \n        Rapid development and deployment of the David's Sling system is \n        crucial to provide an enhanced defense to the State of Israel \n        and its people.\n            (10) The fiscal year 2016 requirement for maintaining the \n        cost and schedule for the Arrow II, Arrow III, David's Sling, \n        and Iron Dome programs is $475,200,000 to support research, \n        testing, development, and procurement of these systems.\n            (11) Of the $475,200,000, $136,900,000 is required in \n        fiscal year 2016 for completion of research and development and \n        $150,000,000 is required for the procurement of David's Sling \n        system components.\n            (12) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation \n        Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150) reaffirmed the commitment of \n        the United States to the security of Israel as a Jewish State \n        and to assist in the defense of Israel and to protect United \n        States interests.\n            (13) The United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of \n        2014 (Public Law 113-296) designated Israel as a Major \n        Strategic Partner of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF DAVID'S SLING WEAPONS PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Authority.--The Secretary of Defense may carry out activities \nrelating to the research, development, test, and evaluation and \nprocurement of the David's Sling weapons program.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to amounts \notherwise authorized to be appropriated for the Department of Defense \nfor fiscal year 2016, to carry out this section there is authorized to \nbe appropriated for fiscal year 2016--\n            (1) for procurement, Defense-wide, $150,000,000; and\n            (2) for research, development, test, and evaluation, \n        Defense-wide, $136,900,000.\n    (c) Sense of Congress on Coproduction.--It is the Sense of Congress \nthat--\n            (1) the United States and the Government of Israel should \n        enter into a production agreement that specifies the terms of \n        coproduction, program schedule, and an itemization of costs \n        with respect to the David's Sling weapons program production \n        activities;\n            (2) such production agreement should strive for \n        coproduction of the David's Sling components to the most \n        optimal level and schedule; and\n            (3) reaching such a bilateral production agreement, to \n        include funds disbursement policy, should be a priority, as has \n        been done in other missile defense programs."
