Each state agency that is required to make a report to the Director of General Services pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 14838.1 shall include the goals in its report. The director shall also include the goals in the department report made pursuant to Section 10111 of the Public Contract Code.\n(b) Provide for small business preference, or nonsmall business preference for bidders that provide for small business and microbusiness subcontractor participation, in the award of contracts for goods, information technology, services, and construction, as follows:\n(1) In solicitations where an award is to be made to the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications, the preference to small business and microbusiness shall be 5 percent of the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications. The preference to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation shall be, up to a maximum of 5 percent of the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications, determined according to rules and regulations established by the Department of General Services.\n(2) In solicitations where an award is to be made to the highest scored bidder based on evaluation factors in addition to price, the preference to small business or microbusiness shall be 5 percent of the highest responsible bidder\u2019s total score. The preference to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation shall be up to a maximum 5 percent of the highest responsible bidder\u2019s total score, determined according to rules and regulations established by the Department of General Services.\n(3) The preferences under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be awarded to a noncompliant bidder and shall not be used to achieve any applicable minimum requirements.\n(4) The preference under paragraph (1) shall not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for any bid, and the combined cost of preferences granted pursuant to paragraph (1) and any other provision of law shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). In bids in which the state has reserved the right to make multiple awards, this fifty thousand dollar ($50,000) maximum preference cost shall be applied, to the extent possible, so as to maximize the dollar participation of small businesses, including microbusinesses, in the contract award.\n(c) Give special consideration to small businesses and microbusinesses by both:\n(1) Reducing the experience required.\n(2) Reducing the level of inventory normally required.\n(d) Give special assistance to small businesses and microbusinesses in the preparation and submission of the information requested in Section 14310.\n(e) Under the authorization granted in Section 10163 of the Public Contract Code, make awards, whenever feasible, to small business and microbusiness bidders for each project bid upon within their prequalification rating. This may be accomplished by dividing major projects into subprojects so as to allow a small business or microbusiness contractor to qualify to bid on these subprojects.\n(f) Small business and microbusiness bidders qualified in accordance with this chapter shall have precedence over nonsmall business bidders in that the application of a bidder preference for which nonsmall business bidders may be eligible under this section or any other provision of law shall not result in the denial of the award to a small business or microbusiness bidder. In the event of a precise tie between the low responsible bid of a bidder meeting specifications of a small business or microbusiness, and the low responsible bid of a bidder meeting the specifications of a disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness, the contract shall be awarded to the disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness. This provision applies if the small business or microbusiness bidder is the lowest responsible bidder, as well as if the small business or microbusiness bidder is eligible for award as the result of application of the small business and microbusiness bidder preference granted by subdivision (b).\nSEC. 3.\nSection 10111 of the Public Contract Code is amended to read:\n10111.\nCommencing January 1, 2007, the department shall make available a report on contracting activity containing the following information:\n(a) A listing of consulting services contracts that the state has entered into during the previous fiscal year.
