FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The newly independent countries of the South Caucasus \n        region, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, after decades of \n        domination as part of the Soviet Union, have charted a new \n        course as independent, sovereign nations.\n            (2) Economic interdependence spurred mutual cooperation \n        among the peoples of the Caucasus and restoration of the \n        historic relationships and economic ties between those peoples \n        is an important element of ensuring their sovereignty as well \n        as the success of democratic and market reforms.\n            (3) The development of strong political and economic ties \n        between countries of the South Caucasus and the West will \n        foster stability in the region.\n            (4) The development of open market economies, open \n        democratic systems, and the removal of all blockades and border \n        closures in the countries of the South Caucasus will provide \n        positive incentives for international private investment, \n        increased trade, and other forms of commercial interactions \n        with the rest of the world.\n            (5) The Caspian Sea Basin, overlapping the territory of the \n        countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia, contains \n        significant oil and gas reserves.\n            (6) The region of the South Caucasus and the neighboring \n        region of Central Asia may produce oil and gas in sufficient \n        quantities to reduce the dependence of the United States on \n        energy from the volatile Persian Gulf region.\n            (7) United States foreign policy and international \n        assistance should support democracy-building, free-market \n        policies, human rights, and regional economic integration among \n        the countries of the South Caucasus.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States in the countries of the \nSouth Caucasus--\n            (1) to promote and strengthen independence, sovereignty, \n        democratic government, and respect for human rights;\n            (2) to assist actively in the resolution of regional \n        conflicts and the lifting of all blockades and re-opening of \n        closed borders;\n            (3) to promote friendly relations and economic cooperation;\n            (4) to help promote market-oriented principles and \n        practices;\n            (5) to assist in the development of the infrastructure \n        necessary for communications, transportation, and energy and \n        trade on an East-West axis in order to build strong \n        international relations and commerce between those countries \n        and the stable, democratic, and market-oriented countries of \n        the Euro-Atlantic Community; and\n            (6) to support United States business interests and \n        investments in the region.\n\nSEC. 4. UNITED STATES EFFORTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN GEORGIA AND \n              AZERBAIJAN.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the President should use all \ndiplomatic means practicable, including the engagement of senior United \nStates Government officials, to press for an equitable, fair, and \npermanent resolution acceptable to all parties to the conflict in \nNagorno-Karabakh and other regional conflicts.\n\nSEC. 5.
