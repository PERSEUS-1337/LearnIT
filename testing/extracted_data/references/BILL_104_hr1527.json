SKI AREA PERMIT RENTAL CHARGE.\n\n    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental charge for \nall ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 of the National \nForest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b), the Act of March \n4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 U.S.C. 497), or the 9th through \n20th paragraphs under the heading ``SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS'' under \nthe heading ``UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR'' in the Act of June \n4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, chapter 2), on National Forest System lands. \nPermit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to the National \nForest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be calculated as set forth in \nsubsection (b). Permit rental charges for existing ski area permits \nissued pursuant to the Act of March 4, 1915, and the Act of June 4, \n1897, shall be calculated in accordance with those existing permits: \nProvided, That a permittee may, at the permittee's option, use the \ncalculation method set forth in subsection (b).\n    (b)(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be \ncalculated by adding the permittee's gross revenues from lift ticket/\nyear-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from ski school \noperations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by the slope transport \nfeet percentage (STFP) on National Forest System land. That amount \nshall be increased by the gross year-round revenue from ancillary \nfacilities (GRAF) physically located on national forest land, including \nall permittee or subpermittee lodging, food service, rental shops, \nparking and other ancillary operations, to determine the adjusted gross \nrevenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental charge. The final rental \ncharge shall be calculated by multiplying the AGR by the following \npercentages for each revenue bracket and adding the total for each \nrevenue bracket:\n            (A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below \n        $3,000,000;\n            (B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between \n        $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;\n            (C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between \n        $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and\n            (D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue \n        that exceeds $50,000,000.\n    Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection the ski \narea permit fee (SAPF) formula can be simply illustrated as:\n\n      SAPF=((LT+SS)&lt;greek-e&gt;STFP)+GRAF=AGR; AGR&lt;greek-e&gt;% BRACKETS\n\n    (2) In cases where ski areas are only partially located on national \nforest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on national forest \nland referred to in subsection (b) shall be calculated as generally \ndescribed in the Forest Service Manual in effect as of January 1, 1992. \nRevenues from Nordic ski operations shall be included or excluded from \nthe rental charge calculation according to the percentage of trails \nphysically located on national forest land.\n    (3) In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair and \nequitable to both the United States and ski area permittees, the \nadjusted gross revenue figures for each revenue bracket in paragraph \n(1) shall be adjusted annually by the percent increase or decrease in \nthe national Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year. No \nlater than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act and \nperiodically thereafter the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the \nCommittee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives a \nreport analyzing whether the ski area permit rental charge legislated \nby this Act is returning a fair market value rental to the United \nStates together with any recommendations the Secretary may have for \nmodifications of the system.\n    (c) The rental charge set forth in subsection (b) shall be due on \nJune 1 of each year and shall be paid or pre-paid by the permittee on a \nmonthly, quarterly, annual or other schedule as determined appropriate \nby the Secretary in consultation with the permittee. Unless mutually \nagreed otherwise by the Secretary and the permittee, the payment or \nprepayment schedule shall conform to the permittee's schedule in effect \nprior to enactment of this Act. To reduce costs to the permittee and \nthe Forest Service, the Secretary shall each year provide the permittee \nwith a standardized form and worksheets (including annual rental charge \ncalculation brackets and rates) to be used for rental charge \ncalculation and submitted with the rental charge payment. Information \nprovided on such forms shall be compiled by the Secretary annually and \nkept in the Office of the Chief, United States Forest Service.\n    (d) The ski area permit rental charge set forth in this section \nshall become effective on June 1, 1996 and cover receipts retroactive \nto June 1, 1995: Provided, however, That if a permittee has paid rental \ncharges for the period June 1, 1995, to June 1, 1996, under the \ngraduated rate rental charge system formula in effect prior to the date \nof enactment of this Act, such rental charges shall be credited toward \nthe new rental charge due on June 1, 1996. In order to ensure \nincreasing rental charge receipt levels to the United States during \ntransition from the graduated rate rental charge system formula of this \nAct, the rental charge paid by any individual permittee shall be--\n            (1) for the 1995-1996 permit year, either the rental charge \n        paid for the preceding 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge \n        calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher;\n            (2) for the 1996-1997 permit year, either the rental charge \n        paid for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge \n        calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher;\n            (3) for the 1997-1998 permit year, either the rental charge \n        for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge calculated \n        pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher.\nIf an individual permittee's adjusted gross revenue for the 1995-1996, \n1996-1997, or 1997-1998 permit years falls more than 10 percent below \nthe 1994-1995 base year, the rental charge paid shall be the rental \ncharge calculated pursuant to this Act.\n    (e) Under no circumstances shall revenue, or subpermittee revenue \n(other than lift ticket, area use pass, or ski school sales) obtained \nfrom operations physically located on non-national forest land be \nincluded in the ski area permit rental charge calculation.\n    (f) To reduce administrative costs of ski area permittees and the \nForest Service the terms ``revenue'' and ``sales'', as used in this \nsection, shall mean actual income from sales and shall not include \nsales of operating equipment, refunds, rent paid to the permittee by \nsublessees, sponsor contributions to special events or any amounts \nattributable to employee gratuities or employee lift tickets, \ndiscounts, or other goods or services (except for bartered goods and \ncomplimentary life tickets) for which the permittee does not receive \nmoney.\n    (g) In cases where an area of national forest land is under a ski \narea permit but the permittee does not have revenue or sales qualifying \nfor rental charge payment pursuant to subsection (a), the permittee \nshall pay an annual minimum rental charge of $2 for each national \nforest acre under permit or a percentage of appraised land value, as \ndetermined appropriate by the Secretary.\n    (h) Where the new rental charge provided for in subsection (b)(1) \nresults in an increase in permit rental charge greater than one half of \none percent of the permittee's adjusted gross revenue as determined \nunder subsection (b)(1), the new rental charge shall be phased in over \na five year period in a manner providing for increases for \napproximately equal increments.\n    (i) To reduce federal costs in administering the provisions of this \nAct, the reissuance of a ski area permit to provide activities similar \nin nature and amount to the activities provided under the previous \npermit shall not constitute a major Federal action for the purposes of \nthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. WITHDRAWALS.\n\n    Subject to valid existing rights, all lands located within the \nboundaries of ski area permits issued prior to, on or after the date of \nenactment of this Act pursuant to authority of the Act of March 4, 1915 \n(38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 U.S.C. 497), and the Act of June 4, \n1897, or the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. \n497b) are hereby and henceforth automatically withdrawn from all forms \nof appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition under all \nlaws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing and all amendments \nthereto. Such withdrawal shall continue for the full term of the permit \nand any modification, reissuance, or renewal thereof. Unless the \nSecretary requests otherwise of the Secretary of the Interior, such \nwithdrawal shall be canceled automatically upon expiration or other \ntermination of the permit and the land automatically restored to all \nappropriation not otherwise restricted under the public land laws.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives April 30, 1996.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                ROBIN H. CARLE,\n\n                                                                 Clerk.\n                                     \n\n                                                       "
