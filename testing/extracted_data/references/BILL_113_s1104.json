FINDINGS.\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near the \n    Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving an estimated \n    220,000 people dead, including 103 United States citizens, 101 \n    United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent of the nation's \n    civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, 115,000 homes destroyed, \n    and 1,500,000 people displaced.\n        (2) According to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted \n    by the Government of Haiti, with technical assistance from the \n    United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development \n    Bank, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, \n    and the European Commission, an estimated 15 percent of the \n    population was directly affected by the disaster and related \n    damages and economic losses totaled $7,804,000,000.\n        (3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti had some of the lowest \n    socioeconomic indicators and the second highest rate of income \n    disparity in the world, conditions that have further complicated \n    post-earthquake recovery efforts and, according to the World Bank, \n    have significantly reduced the prospects of addressing poverty \n    reduction through economic growth.\n        (4) According to the World Food Programme, more than 6,700,000 \n    people in Haiti (out of a population of about 10,000,000) are \n    considered food insecure.\n        (5) In October 2010, an unprecedented outbreak of cholera in \n    Haiti resulted in over 500,000 reported cases and over 8,000 deaths \n    to date, further straining the capacity of Haiti's public health \n    sector and increasing the urgency of resettlement and water, \n    sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) efforts.\n        (6) The international community, led by the United States and \n    the United Nations, mounted an unprecedented humanitarian response \n    in Haiti, with donors pledging approximately $10,400,000,000 for \n    humanitarian relief and recovery efforts, including debt relief, \n    supplemented by $3,100,000,000 in private charitable contributions, \n    of which approximately $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed and an \n    additional $3,800,000,000 has been committed as of September 30, \n    2013.\n        (7) The emergency response of the men and women of the United \n    States Government, led by the United States Agency for \n    International Development (USAID) and the United States Southern \n    Command, as well as of cities, towns, individuals, businesses, and \n    philanthropic organizations across the United States, was \n    particularly swift and resolute.\n        (8) Since 2010, a total of $1,300,000,000 in United States \n    assistance has been allocated for humanitarian relief and \n    $2,300,000,000 has been allocated for recovery, reconstruction, and \n    development assistance in Haiti, including $1,140,000,000 in \n    emergency appropriations and $95,000,000 that has been obligated \n    specifically to respond to the cholera epidemic.\n        (9) Of the $3,600,000,000 in United States assistance allocated \n    for Haiti, $651,000,000 was apportioned to USAID to support an \n    ambitious recovery plan, including the construction of a power \n    plant to provide electricity for the new Caracol Industrial Park \n    (CIP) in northern Haiti, a new port near the CIP, and permanent \n    housing in new settlements in the Port-au-Prince, St-Marc, and Cap-\n    Haitien areas.\n        (10) According to a recent report of the Government \n    Accountability Office, as of June 30, 2013, USAID had disbursed 31 \n    percent of its reconstruction funds in Haiti, the port project was \n    2 years behind schedule and USAID funding will be insufficient to \n    cover a majority of the projected costs, the housing project has \n    been reduced by 80 percent, and the sustainability of the power \n    plant, the port, and the housing projects were all at risk.\n        (11) GAO further found that Congress has not been provided with \n    sufficient information to ensure that it is able to conduct \n    effective oversight at a time when most funding remains to be \n    disbursed, and specifically recommends that a periodic reporting \n    mechanism be instituted to fill this information gap.\n        (12) Donors have encountered significant challenges in \n    implementing recovery programs, and nearly 4 years after the \n    earthquake, an estimated 171,974 people remain displaced in camps, \n    unemployment remains high, corruption is rampant, land rights \n    remain elusive, allegations of wage violations are widespread, the \n    business climate is unfavorable, and government capacity remains \n    weak.\n        (13) For Haiti to achieve stability and long term economic \n    growth, donor assistance will have to be carefully coordinated with \n    a commitment by the Government of Haiti to transparency, a market \n    economy, rule of law, and democracy.\n        (14) The legal environment in Haiti remains a challenge to \n    achieving the goals supported by the international community.\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n    It is the policy of the United States to support the sustainable \nrebuilding and development of Haiti in a manner that--\n        (1) promotes efforts that are led by and support the people and \n    Government of Haiti at all levels so that Haitians lead the course \n    of reconstruction and development of Haiti;\n        (2) builds the long term capacity of the Government of Haiti \n    and civil society in Haiti;\n        (3) reflects the priorities and particular needs of both women \n    and men so they may participate equally and to their maximum \n    capacity;\n        (4) respects and helps restore Haiti's natural resources, as \n    well as builds community-level resilience to environmental and \n    weather-related impacts;\n        (5) provides timely and comprehensive reporting on goals and \n    progress, as well as transparent post program evaluations and \n    contracting data;\n        (6) prioritizes the local procurement of goods and services in \n    Haiti where appropriate; and\n        (7) promotes the holding of free, fair, and timely elections in \n    accordance with democratic principles and the Haitian Constitution.\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n    It is the sense of Congress that transparency, accountability, \ndemocracy, and good governance are integral factors in any \ncongressional decision regarding United States assistance, including \nassistance to Haiti.\nSEC. 5.
