    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bleeding Disorder Screening, \nAwareness, and Further Education (SAFE) Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Millions of men and women in the United States may have \n        an inherited bleeding disorder and not know it.\n            (2) The most common bleeding disorder, Von Willebrand \n        Disease (VWD), affects up to one in fifty Americans, occurring \n        equally amongst men and women.\n            (3) Most of those affected by Von Willebrand Disease remain \n        undiagnosed.\n            (4) The current combination of laboratory tests, clinical \n        observations, and family history to diagnose blood disorders \n        like Von Willebrand Disease is antiquated and unreliable.\n            (5) During adolescence, men and women may become aware of \n        some of the symptoms of bleeding disorders.\n            (6) Many Americans with bleeding disorders learn to live \n        with the chronic health risks which their bleeding causes, and \n        do not realize that they may have a bleeding disorder.\n            (7) It is believed that many of the 30,000 women who have \n        hysterectomies performed each year to treat severe bleeding may \n        actually have a bleeding disorder, and that these women could \n        avoid those unnecessary hysterectomies if properly diagnosed.\n            (8) Improved diagnosis of bleeding disorders, through \n        expanded screening of adolescents, improved physician \n        awareness, and additional research, could improve the quality \n        of life for millions of Americans.\n\nSEC. 3.
