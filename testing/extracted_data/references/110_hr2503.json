FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) With respect to the Office of Women's Health within the \n        Food and Drug Administration:\n                    (A) When first established, the Office reported \n                directly to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n                    (B) In the current organization of the Food and \n                Drug Administration (``FDA''), the Office of Women's \n                Health is located at the second level reporting within \n                the Office of the Commissioner and is within the Office \n                of Science and Health Coordination.\n            (2) With respect to the regulation by the FDA of silicone \n        breast implants:\n                    (A) In a draft guidance issued in January 2004, the \n                FDA asked manufacturers of such implants--\n                            (i) to describe the rates of implant \n                        rupture over the lifetime of the product;\n                            (ii) to describe the incidence of gel \n                        migration resulting from ruptures; and\n                            (iii) to characterize the health \n                        consequences of ruptures and associated \n                        migration.\n                    (B) The FDA approved silicone gel breast implants \n                in November 2006 despite the lack of data responding to \n                those three essential questions.\n                    (C) A study published by FDA researchers in 2001, \n                using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze women \n                whose silicone gel breast implants were an average of \n                17 years old found that 69 percent of the women had \n                ruptures in one or both silicone breast implants, and \n                21 percent experienced gel migration outside the scar \n                capsule surrounding the implant. Implant manufacturers \n                have not established whether the implants in their \n                premarket-approval applications would have similar or \n                different failure rates and leakage.\n                    (D) In April 2005, a study published in the \n                American Journal of Surgical Pathology focusing on gel \n                migration found that 90 percent of the women studied \n                who had silicone implants showed silicone in their \n                lymph nodes. The study also showed that 95 percent of \n                these women had abnormal cells in their lymph nodes, \n                compared with only 33 percent of women who had breast \n                cancer surgery but did not have silicone implants. The \n                Secretary of Health and Human Services has not provided \n                enforceable conditions to ensure that women are not \n                harmed by leaking silicone from their breast implants.\n                    (E) In 2003, the United States Government entered \n                into a settlement with breast implant manufacturers for \n                reimbursement for medical expenses paid by the \n                Government for women harmed by silicone gel breast \n                implants. No information has been made public about the \n                use of those funds to provide health care or disability \n                benefits for women harmed by breast implants.\n            (3) With respect to the applications submitted to the FDA \n        by Barr Laboratories for approval of the contraceptive drug \n        marketed as Plan B:\n                    (A) The FDA rejected the first Plan B application \n                in May 2004 because of concerns that easier access to \n                Plan B might result in increased promiscuity among \n                women under 16, despite studies disproving this \n                contention.\n                    (B) The FDA said it would not approve the Plan B \n                application unless it included an age-based sales \n                distinction. In response, Barr Laboratories submitted a \n                new application to provide over-the-counter sales of \n                plan B to women 16 years and older. More than one year \n                later, FDA expressed concern that the age-based sales \n                distinction would present regulatory concerns, even \n                though the amended application was the result of FDA's \n                recommendations.\n                    (C) According to court documents released on August \n                3, 2006, the director of FDA's Office of New Drugs \n                learned early in 2004 that the then-FDA Commissioner \n                had decided against approval of Plan B before FDA staff \n                could complete their analysis.\n                    (D) In another sworn deposition contained in the \n                same court documents, one FDA official was told in \n                January 2004 by the FDA Deputy Commissioner that Plan B \n                needed to be rejected to ``appease the administration's \n                constituents''.\n                    (E) In a letter and congressional testimony on \n                August 1, the FDA Commissioner recommended that the \n                appropriate age range for over-the-counter Plan B is 18 \n                and older. This recommendation was established \n                arbitrarily and acknowledged by FDA as not supported by \n                scientific data.\n                    (F) A former FDA Commissioner testified in a sworn \n                statement that he delayed approving over-the-counter \n                sales of Plan B to determine how to restrict sales to \n                young teens.\n                    (G) A study in the Journal of Obstetrics & \n                Gynecology concluded that young women are able to use \n                Plan B ``effectively and safely without health care \n                provider intervention''.\n                    (H) In November 2005, the Government Accountability \n                Office found that the May 2004 decision to deny OTC \n                status to Plan B emergency contraception ``was \n                unusual'' in that the decision was made at a much \n                higher level within FDA than is usual practice, that \n                the decision overruled recommendations by several \n                levels of professional staff, and that the decision to \n                limit OTC access to only those over a certain age was \n                made prior to the completion of the regular review \n                process.\n\nSEC. 3. OFFICE OF WOMEN'S HEALTH WITHIN FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--Section 903 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 392) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n        (g) and (h), respectively;\n            (2) in subsection (h) (as so redesignated), in paragraph \n        (1), by striking ``subsection (f)'' and inserting ``subsection \n        (g)''; and\n            (3) by inserting after subsection (e) the following \n        subsection:\n    ``(f) Office of Women's Health.--\n            ``(1) In general.--There is established within the Office \n        of the Commissioner an office to be known as the Office of \n        Women's Health (referred to in this subsection as the \n        `Office'). The Office shall be headed by a director, who shall \n        report directly to the Commissioner.\n            ``(2) Duties.--With respect to activities of the Food and \n        Drug Administration that relate to women's health, the Director \n        of the Office shall--\n                    ``(A) assess the level of agency activity;\n                    ``(B) set short-range and long-range goals; and\n                    ``(C) be responsible for activities related to \n                prevention, research, education and training, service \n                delivery, and policy development.''.\n    (b) Prohibition Against Transfer of Funds.--Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law authorizing the transfer of funds within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services or within the Food and Drug \nAdministration, any funds appropriated for the Office of Women's Health \nwithin the Food and Drug Administration shall not be transferred to any \nother agency or office.\n\nSEC. 4. SCIENCE ON BREAST IMPLANTS.\n\n    (a) Classification of Breast Implants.--Section 513(f) of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(6) A breast implant (as such term is defined in section 515A(f)) \nis deemed to be a class III device and shall be required to have an \napproval under section 515 of an application for premarket approval. \nThis paragraph applies to a breast implant irrespective of whether the \nimplant has been cleared under section 510(k) before the date of the \nenactment of this paragraph.''.\n    (b) Demonstration of Safety.--Subchapter A of chapter V of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) is amended \nby inserting after section 515 the following section:\n\n``SEC. 515A.
