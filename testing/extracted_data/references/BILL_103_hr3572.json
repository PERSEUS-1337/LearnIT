FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds:\n            (1) Concern about the environment is growing and \n        environmental issues now affect all aspects of American \n        business and life. Americans now spend close to $70,000,000,000 \n        annually on environmental-related expenditures.\n            (2) Business and industry spend approximately \n        $9,000,000,000 annually on various environmental consulting \n        services, including $1,200,000,000 for Phase I Environmental \n        Site Assessments.\n            (3) There are currently a large number of environmental \n        professionals performing Phase I Environmental Site Assessments \n        who are not properly trained and who do not perform the \n        assessments in a manner consistent with proper environmental \n        standards and guidelines. Such assessments, therefore, pose a \n        significant danger to the public health, safety, and welfare.\n            (4) Many organizations issue environmental certifications \n        without properly training or testing the candidates applying \n        for certification.\n            (5) The Federal Government does not presently have \n        authority to regulate the quality of training and certification \n        programs for environmental professionals and, with very few \n        exceptions, the certification of environmental professionals.\n            (6) Several organizations provide high quality training in \n        the environmental sciences, and the Federal Government should \n        support these efforts.\n            (7) Federal oversight is needed to ensure that training and \n        certification of environmental professionals meets certain \n        minimum quality standards which ultimately will serve to \n        protect the public interest.\n\nSEC. 3.
