CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A strong United States motor vehicle sector is critical \n        to our international competitiveness and to the health of our \n        industrial base.\n            (2) The United States motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts \n        industries directly employ 1,200,000 workers in high-paying \n        jobs, and indirectly support another million jobs in supplier \n        industries.\n            (3) The United States motor vehicle industry accounts for \n        4.5 percent of the Gross National Product, 77 percent of the \n        total consumption of the natural rubber industry, 67 percent of \n        the lead industry, 40 percent of the machine tool industry, 25 \n        percent of the glass industry, 20 percent of the semiconductor \n        industry, 18 percent of the aluminum industry, and 12 percent \n        of the steel industry. The United States motor vehicle industry \n        also accounts for 12.4 percent of all corporate research and \n        development.\n            (4) United States motor vehicle makers have experienced \n        serious financial difficulty over the past several years, with \n        the Big Three losing $8,000,000,000 in 1991 alone. Hundreds of \n        United States motor vehicle parts companies have gone out of \n        business in the last several years, and tens of thousands of \n        United States motor vehicle parts workers have lost their jobs.\n            (5) The problems facing the United States motor vehicle \n        sector are reflected in the trade deficit of that sector with \n        Japan, which exceeded $30,000,000,000 in 1991 and accounted for \n        almost half of the entire United States world trade deficit.\n            (6) Despite years of negotiations through the MOSS process, \n        United States motor vehicle parts companies have been excluded \n        from the Japanese market, where they account for less than 1 \n        percent of all sales. This trade imbalance, which has been \n        caused in part by Japanese structural barriers such as \n        keiretsu, poses a threat to the health of the United States \n        motor vehicle parts industry, as well as to the many United \n        States industries that supply the motor vehicle parts industry.\n            (7) High health care costs have a significant impact of the \n        competitiveness of United States motor vehicle makers. The Big \n        Three must pass along to consumers as much as $700 more per car \n        in health care costs than Japanese companies.\n            (8) Worldwide excess capacity in the motor vehicle industry \n        of several million units has put further pressure on the United \n        States market and the United States motor vehicle industry.\n            (9) Clear, broad-based government economic, trade, health \n        and United States tax policies are needed to improve the \n        competitiveness of the United States motor vehicle sector and \n        to stem further job losses in these industries.\n\nSEC. 3. MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established the Motor Vehicle Industry \nCompetitiveness Commission (hereinafter in this section referred to as \nthe ``Commission'').\n    (b) Functions.--\n            (1) Investigation and study.--The Commission shall make a \n        complete investigation and study of the financial condition of \n

recommendations.--Based on the results of the \n        investigation and study required to be conducted under \n        paragraph (1), the Commission shall recommend to the President \n        and

   (C) reduce the motor vehicle sector trade deficit \n                with foreign countries, particularly Japan;\n                    (D) implement an industry-wide health care plan \n                that helps relieve the burden of excessive health care \n                costs on the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts \n                industries; and\n                    (E) promote job
