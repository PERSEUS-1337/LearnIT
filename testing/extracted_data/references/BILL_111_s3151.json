SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Quality Assistance and \nLeadership and Improving Transparency for Women Act'' or the ``EQUALITY \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Women are vital to successful development. On January \n        6, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton stated, ``Women and girls \n        are one of the world's greatest untapped resources. Investing \n        in the potential of women to lift and lead their societies is \n        one of the best investments we can make. . . . (S)tudies have \n        shown when a woman receives even just one year of schooling, \n        her children are less likely to die in infancy or suffer from \n        illness or hunger, and more likely to go to school \n        themselves.''.\n            (2) According to the World Bank--\n                    (A) investing in women and girls yields large \n                social and economic returns, including breaking \n                intergenerational cycles of poverty; and\n                    (B) societies that treat males and females more \n                equally experience more rapid economic growth and \n                poverty reduction than societies that discriminate \n                based on gender.\n            (3) United Nations Millennium Development Goal 3 (MDG3) \n        calls for redressing gender disparities and empowering women. \n        According to the United Nations, women have more access to \n        employment now than ever before; but they still earn \\1/3\\ less \n        than men. According to the World Bank, MDG3 is the critical \n        avenue through which several other goals are achievable, \n        including--\n                    (A) universal primary education (MDG2);\n                    (B) a \\2/3\\ reduction in the mortality rate among \n                children younger than 5 years of age (MDG4);\n                    (C) improvements in maternal health (MDG5); and\n                    (D) a reduction in the likelihood of contracting \n                HIV/AIDS and other major diseases (MDG6).\n            (4) Properly investing in women requires a cross-cutting, \n        multi-sectoral approach. On October 8, 2009, Melanne Verveer, \n        Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, stated ``The \n        major economic, security, governance, and environmental \n        challenges of our time cannot be solved without the \n        participation of women at all levels of society. Empowering \n        women is one of the most effective and positive forces for \n        improving conditions around the globe. Indeed, no country can \n        prosper if half its people are left behind.''.\n            (5) The Department of State and the United States Agency \n        for International Development need stronger tools to create a \n        comprehensive plan and approach to mainstreaming women in \n        development. As of 2010, these efforts are only nascent. In his \n        December 2, 2009, confirmation hearing before the Committee on \n        Foreign Relations of the Senate, USAID Administrator Dr. Rajiv \n        Shah stated ``I believe effective gender integration is often \n        the difference between success and failure of a broad variety \n        of development investments.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
