FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) trade and professional associations serve the public \n        interest by conducting research, collecting and distributing \n        information, and otherwise providing services to their members \n        with regard to products and materials purchased and used by \n        those members;\n            (2) in the decade preceding the date of enactment of this \n        Act, many large class action lawsuits have been filed against \n        manufacturers for allegedly defective products;\n            (3) as a result of the lawsuits referred to in paragraph \n        (2), many members of trade and professional associations who \n        are consumers of those products have relied increasingly on \n        trade and professional associations for information concerning \n        those products, including information concerning--\n                    (A) the conditions under which such a product may \n                be used effectively;\n                    (B) whether it is necessary to repair or replace \n                such a product, and if such a repair or replacement is \n                necessary, the appropriate means of accomplishing that \n                repair or replacement; and\n                    (C) any litigation concerning such a product;\n            (4) trade and professional associations have, with an \n        increasing frequency, been served broad and burdensome third-\n        party subpoenas from litigants in product defect lawsuits, \n        including class action lawsuits;\n            (5) members of trade and professional associations are \n        seeking potentially beneficial information relating to product \n        defects, quality, or performance from the trade and \n        professional associations;\n            (6) trade and professional associations have been subject \n        to lawsuits concerning methods of collection and dissemination \n        of that information;\n            (7) the burden of responding to third-party subpoenas in \n        product defect lawsuits and the threat of litigation have had a \n        substantial chilling effect on the ability and willingness of \n        trade and professional associations to disseminate information \n        described in paragraph (5) to members, and the threat that \n        information provided on a confidential basis to members could \n        be subject to discovery in a civil action also has a chilling \n        effect;\n            (8) because of the national scope of the problems described \n        in paragraphs (1) through (7), it is not possible for States to \n        fully address the problems by enacting State laws; and\n            (9) the Federal Government has the authority under the \n        United States Constitution (including article I, section 8, \n        clause 3 of the Constitution and the 14th amendment to the \n        Constitution) to remove barriers to interstate commerce and \n        protect due process rights.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to promote the free \nflow of goods and services and lessen burdens on interstate commerce in \naccordance with the authorities referred to in subsection (a)(9) by \nensuring the free flow of information concerning product defects, \nquality, or performance among trade and professional associations and \ntheir members.\n\nSEC. 2.
