FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) within certain States, the willingness of volunteers to \n        offer their services has been increasingly deterred by a \n        perception that they thereby put personal assets at risk in the \n        event of liability actions against the organization they serve;\n            (2) as a result of this perception, many nonprofit public \n        and private organizations and governmental entities, including \n        voluntary associations, social service agencies, educational \n        institutions, local governments, foundations, and other civic \n        programs, have been adversely affected through the withdrawal \n        of volunteers from boards of directors and service in other \n        capacities;\n            (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n        is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n        programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were \n        participating; and\n            (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost \n        effective social service programs which depend heavily on \n        volunteer participation, protection of voluntarism through \n        clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n        assumed by the volunteer in connection with such participation \n        is an appropriate subject for Federal encouragement of State \n        reform.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) promote the interests of social service program \n        beneficiaries and taxpayers; and\n            (2) sustain the availability of programs and nonprofit \n        organizations and governmental entities which depend on \n        volunteer contributions\nby encouraging reasonable reform of State laws to provide protection \nfrom personal financial liability to volunteers serving with nonprofit \norganizations and governmental entities for actions undertaken in good \nfaith on behalf of such organizations.\n\nSEC. 3. NO PREEMPTION OF STATE TORT LAW.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preempt the laws of any \nState governing tort liability actions.\n\nSEC. 4. STATE STATUTES PROVIDING FOR LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY FOR \n              VOLUNTEERS.\n\n    An allotment may be increased for a State under the provisions of \nsection 5, if the State statute referred to under subsection (a) of \nsuch section includes the following provisions:\n            (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (4), any \n        volunteer of a nonprofit organization or governmental entity \n        shall incur no personal financial liability for any tort claim \n        alleging damage or injury from any act or omission of the \n        volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity if--\n                    (A) such individual was acting in good faith and \n                within the scope of such individual's official \n                functions and duties with the organization or entity; \n                and\n                    (B) such damage or injury was not caused by willful \n                and wanton misconduct by such individual.\n            (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n        any civil action brought by any nonprofit organization or any \n        governmental entity against any volunteer of such organization \n        or entity.\n            (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n        the liability of any nonprofit organization or governmental \n        entity with respect to injury caused to any person.\n            (4) The following conditions on, and exceptions to, the \n        granting of liability may be imposed for protection to any \n        volunteer of an organization or entity required under paragraph \n        (1):\n                    (A) The organization or entity shall adhere to risk \n                management procedures, including mandatory training of \n                volunteers.\n                    (B) The organization or entity shall be liable for \n                the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the same \n                extent as an employer is liable, under the laws of the \n                State, for the acts or omissions of its employees.\n                    (C) The protection from liability shall not apply \n                if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle or was \n                operating a vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for \n                which a pilot's license is required.\n                    (D) The protection from liability shall not apply \n                in the case of a suit brought by an appropriate officer \n                of a State or local government to enforce a Federal, \n                State, or local law.\n                    (E) The protection from liability shall apply only \n                if the organization or entity provides a financially \n                secure source of recovery for individuals who suffer \n                injury as a result of actions taken by a volunteer on \n                behalf of the organization or entity. A financially \n                secure source of recovery may be an insurance policy \n                within specified limits, comparable coverage from a \n                risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or \n                alternative arrangements that satisfy the State that \n                the entity will be able to pay for losses up to a \n                specified amount. Separate standards for different \n                types of liability exposure may be specified.\n\nSEC. 5. CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT AND ADJUSTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES \n              BLOCK GRANT ALLOTMENTS.\n\n    (a) Certification and Block Grant Allotments.--In the case of any \nState which certifies, not later than 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, to the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nthat it has enacted, adopted, or otherwise has in effect State law \nwhich substantially complies with section 4, the Secretary shall \nincrease by 1 percent the fiscal year allotment which would otherwise \nbe made to such State to carry out the Social Services Block Grant \nProgram under title XX of the Social Security Act.\n    (b) Continuation of Increase.--Any increase made under subsection \n(a) in an allotment to a State shall remain in effect only if the State \nmakes a certification to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nnot later than the end of each 1-year period occurring successively \nafter the end of the 2-year period described in subsection (a), that it \nhas in effect State law which substantially complies with section 4(a).\n\nSEC. 6.
