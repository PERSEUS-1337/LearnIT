FORT PRESQUE ISLE NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE, PENNSYLVANIA.\n\n    (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n            (1) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n                    (A) Fort Presque Isle was a frontier outpost \n                located on Garrison Hill in the area of present-day \n                Erie, Pennsylvania, which was the site of the American \n                installations built in 1795 and 1796 and in the War of \n                1812.\n                    (B) General Anthony Wayne was a Revolutionary War \n                hero who served under General George Washington and, at \n                one point, was commanding general of the United States \n                Army. He first arrived in the area of Presque Isle in \n                1786.\n                    (C) Legend has it that General Wayne was nicknamed \n                ``Mad'' by his troops, not for being rash or foolish, \n                but for his leadership and bravery on and off the \n                battlefield.\n                    (D) The original blockhouse of Fort Presque Isle \n                was built in 1795 by 200 Federal troops from General \n                Wayne's army, under the direction of Captain John \n                Grubb. It was the first blockhouse used as part of a \n                defensive system established to counter Native American \n                uprisings. It was also used during the War of 1812.\n                    (E) General Wayne was stricken ill at Fort Presque \n                Isle and died there in 1796. At his request, his body \n                was buried under the flagpole of the northwest \n                blockhouse of the fort.\n                    (F) The original blockhouse of Fort Presque Isle \n                burned in 1852, and the existing structure was built by \n                the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1880 as a memorial \n                to General Wayne.\n                    (G) The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum \n                Commission has recognized the reconstructed blockhouse \n                as eligible for placement on the National Register of \n                Historic Places.\n            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are the \n        following:\n                    (A) To provide for reconstruction of the frontier \n                fort at Presque Isle for the benefit, inspiration, and \n                education of the people of the United States.\n                    (B) To preserve the original grave site of General \n                ``Mad'' Anthony Wayne at Fort Presque Isle.\n                    (C) To broaden understanding of the historical \n                significance of Fort Presque Isle.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Historic site.--The term ``historic site'' means the \n        Fort Presque Isle National Historic Site established by \n        subsection (c).\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Interior.\n    (c) Establishment of Fort Presque Isle National Historic Site.--\n            (1) Establishment.--There is established as a unit of the \n        National Park System the Fort Presque Isle National Historic \n        Site in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n            (2) Description.--\n                    (A) In general.--The historic site shall consist of \n                land and improvements comprising the historic location \n                of Fort Presque Isle, including the existing blockhouse \n                replica at that location, as depicted on a map entitled \n                ``________'', numbered ________ and dated ________, \n                comprising approximately ________ acres.\n                    (B) Map and boundary description.--The map referred \n                to in subparagraph (A) and accompanying boundary \n                description shall be on file and available for public \n                inspection in the office of the Director of the \n                National Park Service and any other office of the \n                National Park Service that the Secretary determines to \n                be an appropriate location for filing the map and \n                boundary description.\n    (d) Administration of the Historic Site.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall administer the \n        historic site in accordance with this section and the \n        provisions of law generally applicable to units of the National \n        Park System, including the Act of August 25, 1916 (commonly \n        known as the National Park Service Organic Act;
