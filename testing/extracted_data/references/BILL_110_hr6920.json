FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Heating oil, propane, and natural gas help to keep 70 \n        percent of United States households warm.\n            (2) For 8,000,000 homes alone in the United States, heating \n        oil is the primary source of heating and 6,200,000 of those \n        homes are in the Northeast, including the Central Atlantic \n        States.\n            (3) Over the last year and a half, the retail cost of \n        heating oil has nearly tripled, as follows:\n                    (A) In January 2007, a gallon of heating oil cost \n                $1.59.\n                    (B) By autumn of 2007, the cost of 1 gallon was \n                $2.75.\n                    (C) From October 2008 through March 2009, heating \n                oil is projected to average $4.13 per gallon, an \n                increase of about 25 percent over last winter.\n                    (D) Increases in natural gas and propane prices \n                this winter are also projected.\n            (4) Many homeowners, already strapped financially, simply \n        will not be able to heat their homes this winter.\n            (5) In Northeastern Pennsylvania this winter, the average \n        homeowner who uses 950 gallons of home heating oil will have to \n        pay between $3,000 to $4,000 for heating.\n            (6) While the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n        operated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services through \n        the Administration for Children and Families (the program is \n        commonly referred to as ``LIHEAP'') is a big help to consumers, \n        the Program by itself is not enough to meet the challenge and \n        the Congress should act to increase its funding as a separate \n        matter.\n            (7) Heating oil dealers have faced and will continue to \n        face tremendous stress because of the price increase.\n            (8) Home heating oil dealers suffered cash flow problems in \n        the Winter of 2007-2008 and, with such large price increases, \n        the problems will only get worse in the Winter of 2008-2009.\n            (9) In the usage of trade in the home heating oil supply \n        and distribution system, home heating oil dealers must \n        typically pay suppliers within 10 days of delivery of oil.\n            (10) If customers cannot make timely payments to dealers, \n        dealers, in turn, lack the cash to pay suppliers to keep \n        supplies flowing to consumers.\n\nSEC. 3.
