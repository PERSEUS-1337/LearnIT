SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Uniformed and Overseas Citizen \nAbsentee Voting Reform Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) Some 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 American citizens, \n        including 576,000 Federal employees and their overseas \n        dependents in the armed services and in other Federal agencies, \n        live permanently or temporarily reside outside the 50 States \n        and the District of Colombia.\n            (2) Both the members of the armed services, their \n        dependents, other employees of the Federal Government and their \n        dependents, and the roughly 3,000,000 to 5,500,000 million \n        other American citizens abroad make an inestimable contribution \n        to the security, economic well-being, and cultural vitality of \n        the United States.\n            (3) Although great progress has been made in recent decades \n        in assuring that these citizens have the chance to participate \n        fully in our democratic process, the national elections of \n        November 2000 revealed grave shortcomings in our system, with \n        nearly 40 percent of overseas ballots rejected in one State \n        alone.\n            (4) Moreover, during these elections it became apparent \n        that timely information about the numbers of American citizens \n        seeking to vote and voting from abroad, information which is \n        essential to measure the effectiveness of our overseas voting \n        system, is not currently provided by the States.\n\nSEC. 3.
