FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The California missions represent some of our Nation's \n        oldest historical treasures.\n            (2) The first of the California missions was founded in \n        1769, and eventually a chain of 21 missions and various sub-\n        missions extended along the coast of California on El Camino \n        Real.\n            (3) The California missions contribute greatly to the rich \n        historical, cultural, and architectural heritage of California \n        and the American West.\n            (4) The knowledge and cultural influence of native \n        California Indians made a lasting contribution to the early \n        settlement of California and the development of the California \n        missions.\n            (5) More than 5,300,000 people visit the California \n        missions annually, and the historical importance of the \n        California missions extends worldwide as they have become a \n        frequent destination for foreign visitors to the United States.\n            (6) The history of the California missions is an important \n        educational component in California schools, and the study of \n        the California missions is part of the Statewide fourth grade \n        curricula on California history.\n            (7) Restoration and repair of the California missions, and \n        the preservation of the Spanish colonial and mission-era \n        artworks and artifacts of the California missions, for the \n        public enjoyment will ensure that future generations also have \n        the benefit of experiencing and appreciating these great \n        symbols of the spirit of exploration and discovery in the \n        American West.\n\nSEC. 3.
