    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nanotechnology in the Schools Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is \n        generating scientific and technological breakthroughs that will \n        benefit society by improving the way many things are designed \n        and made.\n            (2) Nanotechnology is likely to have a significant, \n        positive impact on the security, economic well-being, and \n        health of Americans as fields related to nanotechnology expand.\n            (3) In order to maximize the benefits of nanotechnology to \n        individuals in the United States, the United States must \n        maintain world leadership in the field of nanotechnology, \n        including nanoscience and microtechnology, in the face of \n        determined competition from other nations.\n            (4) According to the National Science Foundation, foreign \n        students on temporary visas earned 32 percent of all science \n        and engineering doctorates awarded in the United States in \n        2003, the last year for which data is available. Foreign \n        students earned 55 percent of the engineering doctorates. Many \n        of these students expressed an intent to return to their \n        country of origin after completing their study.\n            (5) To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the \n        United States must make a long-term investment in educating \n        United States students in secondary schools and institutions of \n        higher education, so that the students are able to conduct \n        nanoscience research and develop and commercialize \n        nanotechnology applications.\n            (6) Preparing United States students for careers in \n        nanotechnology, including nanoscience, requires that the \n        students have access to the necessary scientific tools, \n        including scanning electron microscopes designed for teaching, \n        and requires training to enable teachers and professors to use \n        those tools in the classroom and the laboratory.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to strengthen the capacity \nof United States secondary schools and institutions of higher education \nto prepare students for careers in nanotechnology by providing grants \nto those schools and institutions to provide the tools necessary for \nsuch preparation.\n\nSEC. 3.
