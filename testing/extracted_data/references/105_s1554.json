FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) punitive damage awards in jury verdicts in financial \n        injury cases are a serious and growing problem, and according \n        to a Rand Institute for Civil Justice study in 1997 of punitive \n        damage verdicts from calendar years 1985 through 1994 in States \n        that represent 25 percent of the United States population--\n                    (A) nearly 50 percent of all punitive damage awards \n                are made in financial injury cases (those in which the \n                plaintiff is alleging a financial injury only and is \n                not alleging injuries to either person or property);\n                    (B) punitive damages are awarded in 1 in every 7 \n                financial injury verdicts overall and 1 in every 5 \n                financial injury cases in the State of California;\n                    (C) between calendar years 1985 through 1989 and \n                calendar years 1990 through 1994, the average punitive \n                damage verdict in financial injury cases increased from \n                $3,400,000 to $7,600,000;\n                    (D) between calendar years 1985 through 1989 and \n                calendar years 1990 through 1994, the award of such \n                damages at the 90th percentile increased from \n                $3,900,000 to $12,100,000;\n                    (E) between calendar years 1985 through 1989 and \n                calendar years 1990 through 1994, the total amount of \n                punitive damages awarded increased from $1,200,000,000 \n                to $2,300,000,000, for a 10-year total of \n                $3,500,000,000;\n                    (F) punitive damages represent a very large \n                percentage of total damages awarded in all financial \n                injury verdicts, increasing from 44 percent to 59 \n                percent during the period analyzed; and\n                    (G) in the State of Alabama, punitive damages \n                represent 82 percent of all damages awarded in \n                financial injury cases;\n            (2)(A) punitive damage verdicts are only the tip of the \n        iceberg because only a small percentage of all complaints filed \n        (1.6 percent according to a Department of Justice study in \n        1995) result in a jury verdict; and\n            (B) the Rand Institute of Civil Justice calls the impact of \n        these verdicts on settlements the ``shadow effect'' of punitive \n        damages;\n            (3) excessive, unpredictable, and often arbitrary punitive \n        damage awards have a direct and undesirable effect on \n        interstate commerce by increasing the cost and decreasing the \n        availability of goods and services;\n            (4) as a result of excessive, unpredictable, and often \n        arbitrary punitive damage awards, consumers have been adversely \n        affected through the withdrawal of products, producers, \n        services, and service providers from the marketplace, and from \n        excessive liability costs passed on to consumers through higher \n        prices;\n            (5) excessive, unpredictable, and often arbitrary punitive \n        damage awards jeopardize the financial well-being of many \n        individuals and companies, particularly the Nation's small \n        businesses, and adversely affect government and taxpayers;\n            (6) individual State legislatures can create only a partial \n        remedy to address these problems because each State lacks the \n        power to control the imposition of punitive damages in other \n        States;\n            (7) it is the constitutional role of the national \n        Government to remove barriers to interstate commerce and to \n        protect due process rights;\n            (8) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and \n        fairness to the award of punitive damages in order to protect \n        against excessive, arbitrary, and uncertain awards;\n            (9) establishing a rule of proportionality, in cases that \n        primarily involve financial injury, between the amount of \npunitive damages awarded and the amount of compensatory damages, as 15 \nStates have established, would--\n                    (A) be fair to both plaintiffs and defendants; and\n                    (B) address the constitutional objection of the \n                United States Supreme Court in BMW of North America v. \n                Gore 116 S. Ct. 1589 (1996) to punitive damages that \n                are grossly excessive in relation to the harm suffered; \n                and\n            (10) permitting a maximum for each claimant recovery for \n        punitive damages of the greater of 3 times the amount of \n        economic loss or $250,000 is a balanced solution that would \n        reduce grossly excessive punitive damage awards by as much as \n        40 percent, according to the Rand Institute for Civil Justice.\n    (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in Article I, \nsection 8, clause 3 and section 5 of the 14th amendment of the United \nStates Constitution, the purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) promote the free flow of goods and services and to \n        lessen burdens on interstate commerce; and\n            (2) uphold constitutionally protected due process rights by \n        placing reasonable limits on damages over and above the actual \n        damages suffered by a claimant.\n\nSEC. 3.

Punitive damages \n        may, to the extent permitted by applicable State law, be \n        awarded against a person in such a case only if the claimant \n        establishes that the harm that is the subject of the action was \n        proximately caused by such person. Notwithstanding any other \n        provision of this Act, punitive damages may, to the extent \n        permitted by applicable State law, be awarded against a \n        qualified charity only if the claimant established by clear and \n        convincing evidence that the harm that is the subject of the \n        action was proximately caused by an intentionally tortious act \n        of such qualified charity.\n            (2) Question of law.--What constitutes death, serious and \n        permanent physical scarring or disfigurement, loss of a limb or \n        organ, or serious and permanent physical impairment of an \n        important bodily function shall be a question of law for the \n        court.\n    (b) Exceptions.--\n            (1) In general.--The provisions of this Act shall not apply \n        to any person in a civil action described in subsection (a)(1) \n        if the misconduct for which punitive damages are awarded \n        against that person--\n                    (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term \n                is defined in section 16 of title 18, United States \n                Code) for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n                court;\n                    (B) constitutes an act of terrorism for which the \n                defendant has been convicted in any court;\n                    (C) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used \n                in the Hate Crime Statistics Act, Public Law 101-275; \n                104 Stat. 140; 28 U.S.C. 534 note) for which the \n                defendant has been convicted in any court;\n                    (D) occurred at a time when the defendant was under \n                the influence (as determined pursuant to applicable \n                State law) of intoxicating alcohol or any drug that may \n                not lawfully be sold without a prescription and had \n                been taken by the defendant other than in accordance \n                with the terms of a lawful prescription; or\n                    (E) constitutes a felony sexual offense, as defined \n                by applicable Federal or State law, for which the \n                defendant has been convicted in any court.\n            (2) Question of law.--The applicability of this subsection \n        shall be a question of law for determination by the court. The \n        liability of any other person in such an action shall be \n        determined in accordance with this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. PROPORTIONAL AWARDS.\n\n    (a) Amount.--\n            (1) In general.--The amount of punitive damages that may be \n        awarded to a claimant in any civil action that is subject to \n        this Act shall not exceed the greater of--\n                    (A) 3 times the amount awarded to the claimant for \n                economic loss; or\n                    (B) $250,000.\n            (2) Special rule.--\n                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in \n                any civil action that is subject to this Act against an \n                individual whose net worth does not exceed $500,000 or \n                against an owner of an unincorporated business, or any \n                partnership, corporation, association, unit of local \n                government, or organization that has fewer than 25 \n                full-time employees, the amount of punitive damages \n                shall not exceed the lesser of--\n                            (i) 3 times the amount awarded to the \n                        claimant for economic loss; or\n                            (ii) $250,000.\n                    (B) Applicability.--For purposes of determining the \n                applicability of this paragraph to a corporation, the \n                number of employees of a subsidiary of a wholly owned \n                corporation shall include all employees of a parent \n                corporation or any subsidiary of that parent \n                corporation.\n    (b) Application of Limitations by the Court.--The limitations in \nsubsection (a) shall be applied by the court and shall not be disclosed \nto the jury.\n\nSEC. 6.
