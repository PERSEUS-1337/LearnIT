FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the \n        United States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and \n        the large majority of those species, the neotropical migrants, \n        winter in Latin America and the Caribbean;\n            (2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable \n        environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits \n        to the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;\n            (3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once \n        considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to \n        the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in \n        jeopardy; and\n            (B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations \n        of those species is habitat loss and degradation (including \n        pollution and contamination) across the species' range; and\n            (4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across \n        numerous international borders each year, their conservation \n        requires the commitment and effort of all countries along their \n        migration routes; and\n            (B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve \n        migratory birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be \n        significantly strengthened and enhanced by increased \n        coordination.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical \n        migratory birds;\n            (2) to assist in the conservation of neotropical migratory \n        birds by supporting conservation initiatives in the United \n        States, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and\n            (3) to provide financial resources and to foster \n        international cooperation for those initiatives.\n\nSEC. 4.
