FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant \n        ecological and public health concern. Exposure to mercury \n        occurs largely by consumption of contaminated fish. Children \n        and women of childbearing age who consume large amounts of fish \n        are at high risk of adverse effects. It is estimated that \n        200,000 to 400,000 children born each year in the United States \n        have been exposed to mercury levels in their mothers' wombs \n        high enough to impair neurological development. The Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention have found that eight percent of \n        the women in the United States of childbearing age have blood \n        mercury levels in excess of values deemed safe by the \n        Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) As of 2004, fish consumption advisories due to mercury \n        contamination have been issued for 44 States, including 21 \n        statewide advisories for freshwaters and 12 statewide \n        advisories for coastal waters. These advisories represent more \n        than 52,000 square kilometers of lakes and 1,230,000 kilometers \n        of rivers. Yet, fish and shellfish are an important source of \n        dietary protein, and a healthy fishing resource is important to \n        the economy. The extent of fish consumption advisories \n        underscores the extensive human and ecological health risk \n        posed by mercury pollution.\n            (3) In most locations, the primary route for mercury input \n        to aquatic ecosystems is by atmospheric transport and \n        deposition. Mercury's interaction with the environment and \n        bioaccumulation in biota are not fully understood. Computer \n        models and other assessment tools predict varying effectiveness \n        in reducing mercury concentrations in fish, and no broad-scale \n        data sets exist to test model predictions.\n            (4) In September 2003, the Society of Environmental \n        Toxicology and Chemistry convened a workshop of 32 mercury \n        scientists to develop a system to measure and document changes \n        resulting from reductions in mercury emissions in the United \n        States. The resulting plan is documented in the book ``State of \n        Science for Mercury Effects: Assessment for Aquatic and \n        Terrestrial Environments'', published in 2007.\n            (5) On January 1, 2005, ``Monitoring the Response to \n        Changing Mercury Deposition'' was published in the periodical \n        Environmental Science and Technology. The article proposed a \n        ``holistic, multimedia, long-term mercury monitoring program''.\n            (6) Many regulations limiting mercury emissions have either \n        gone into effect or will soon be enacted, but scientists are \n        not adequately measuring the environmental benefits of reduced \n        mercury emissions. As governments advance regulations, \n        governments should document whether their rules are effective.\n            (7) On May 15, 2006, the Office of Inspector General of the \n        Environmental Protection Agency issued a report entitled, \n        ``Monitoring Needed to Assess Impact of EPA's Clean Air Mercury \n        Rule (CAMR) on Potential Hotspots'', Report No. 2006-P-0025, \n        which states, in part: ``Without field data from an improved \n        monitoring network, EPA's ability to advance mercury science \n        will be limited and `utility-attributable' hotspots that pose \n        health risks may occur and go undetected'' and ``We recommend \n        that EPA develop and implement a mercury monitoring plan to (1) \n        assess the impact of CAMR, if adopted, on mercury deposition \n        and fish tissue; and (2) evaluate and refine mercury estimation \n        tools and models''.\n            (8) On January 4, 2007, ``Contamination in Remote Forest \n        and Aquatic Ecosystems in the Northeastern U.S.: Sources, \n        Transformations and Management Options'' and ``Biological \n        Mercury Hotspots in the Northeastern U.S. and Southeastern \n        Canada'' were published in the journal BioScience. The authors \n        identified five biological mercury hotspots and nine areas of \n        concern in the northeastern United States and southeastern \n        Canada associated primarily with atmospheric mercury emissions \n        and deposition. They further located an area of particularly \n        high mercury deposition adjacent to a coal-fired electric \n        utility in southern New Hampshire. The authors of the studies \n        concluded that local impacts from mercury emissions should be \n        closely monitored in order to assess the impact of State and \n        Federal policies.\n\nSEC. 3.
