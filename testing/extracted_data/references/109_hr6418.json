    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nursing Relief Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are more vacant nursing positions in the United \n        States than there are qualified registered nurses and nursing \n        school candidates to fill those positions.\n            (2) According to the Department of Labor, the current \n        national nursing shortage exceeds 126,000.\n            (3) States in the West and Southwest have a \n        disproportionate number of nursing vacancies because of rapid \n        population growth, which exacerbates a widening gap in the \n        number of facilities and staff compared to patients that need \n        care.\n            (4) Foreign countries such as the Philippines, India, and \n        China have an oversupply of nurses.\n            (5) Major hospital systems in the United States spend \n        hundreds of millions of dollars every year recruiting foreign \n        nurses under our current immigration system.\n            (6) Current law, with certain limited exceptions, requires \n        health care providers to sponsor desired nurses for permanent \n        resident status while the nurses remain outside of the United \n        States, which can take as much as 3 years.\n            (7) This cost is passed on to consumers and adds to the \n        rising cost of health care.\n            (8) Health care providers cannot efficiently and \n        effectively recruit qualified foreign nurses through the \n        existing immigration process.\n            (9) Our health care system requires an immediate \n        modification of Federal laws relating to recruitment of \n        qualified foreign nurses in order to operate at an efficient \n        and effective level.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a new \nnonimmigrant visa category for registered nurses and establish \nadmission requirements for such nonimmigrants.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION OF NONIMMIGRANT NURSES.\n\n    (a) Establishment of a New Nonimmigrant Category.--Section \n101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)(15)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (U),\n            (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (V) \n        and inserting ``; or''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(W) an alien who is coming temporarily to the United \n        States to perform services as a professional nurse, as \n        described in section 212(v)(1)(A), who meets the qualifications \n        described in section 212(v)(1)(B), and with respect to whom the \n        Secretary of Labor determines and certifies to the Secretary of \n        Homeland Security and the Secretary of State that the intending \n        employer has filed with the Secretary of Labor an attestation \n        under section 212(v)(2), and the alien spouse and children of \n        any such principal alien, if accompanying or following to join \n        the principal alien.''.\n    (b) Requiring Petition of Importing Employer.--Section 214(c) of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(c)) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:.\n    ``(15)(A) The question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant \nunder section 101(a)(15)(W) in any specific case or specific cases \nshall be determined by the consular officer, after consultation with \nappropriate agencies of the Government, upon petition of the importing \nemployer. Such petition shall be made and approved before the visa is \ngranted. The petition shall be in such form and contain such \ninformation as the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prescribe by \nregulation.
