SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY.\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Through economic mismanagement, undemocratic practices, and \n    the costly deployment of troops to the Democratic Republic of the \n    Congo, the Government of Zimbabwe has rendered itself ineligible to \n    participate in International Bank for Reconstruction and \n    Development and International Monetary Fund programs, which would \n    otherwise be providing substantial resources to assist in the \n    recovery and modernization of Zimbabwe's economy.
