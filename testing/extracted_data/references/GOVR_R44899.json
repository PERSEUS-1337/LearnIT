    "content": "The first section of this report provides an overview of the consideration of FY2018 legislative branch appropriations, with subsections covering each action, including the initial submission of the request on May 23, 2017; hearings held by the House and Senate Legislative Branch Subcommittees in May and June, 2017; the House subcommittee markup on June 23, 2017; the House full committee markup on June 29, 2017; the July 18, 2017, inclusion of the text of the legislative branch bill, H.R. 3162 , in a print issued by the House Rules Committee; the meeting of the House Rules Committee on July 24 and 25, 2017, to consider a special rule for consideration of H.R. 3219 , which included legislative branch funding as Division B; consideration of H.R. 3219 in the House on July 26 and passage on July 27; the markup and reporting by the Senate Appropriations Committee of its version of the legislative branch appropriations bill on July 27 ( S. 1648 ); the enactment on September 8, of a continuing resolution providing funding through December 8, 2017; the agreement in the House on September 14 to H.Res. 500 , which included the text of Rules Committee Print 115-31, as amended, in an amendment in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 3354 . The text of the legislative branch bill, as agreed to in H.R. 3219 , was unchanged. H.R. 3354 , which then includes text for all 12 appropriations bills, was agreed to in the House on September 14, 2017. H.R. 3354 was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar but no further action was taken; the enactment of additional continuing appropriations resolutions ( P.L. 115-90 , through December 22, 2017; P.L. 115-96 , through January 19, 2018; P.L. 115-120 , through February 8, 2018; and P.L. 115-123 , through March 23, 2018); and the enactment of the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 115-141 ) on March 23, 2018, which provides $4.700 billion for FY2018, an increase of $260.0 million (5.9%) from FY2017.  It is followed by a section on prior year actions and funding, which contains a historical table and figure.  The report then provides an overview of the FY2018 budget requests of individual legislative branch agencies and entities.   Table 5 through Table 9 list enacted funding levels for FY2017 and the requested and reported levels for FY2018, while the Appendix lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports; public law numbers; and enactment dates since FY1998. A shooting on June 14, 2017, at a practice for the Congressional Baseball Game, which wounded one Member of Congress, two U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) officers, and two members of the public in Alexandria, Virginia, had an impact on consideration of the FY2018 legislative branch bill.  In particular, according to the House report, H.R. 3162 \"provides additional resources to the USCP in the amount of $7,500,000 and House Sergeant at Arms in the amount of $5,000,000 to enhance security for Members both in Washington D.C. and in Congressional districts.\" The report also indicates that the \"Committee has provided resources necessary to support the Committee on House Administration's plan to increase Member's Representational Allowance (MRA) by $25,000 per account this year for the purpose of providing Member security when away from the Capitol complex.\" Between the subcommittee and full committee markup sessions, on June 27, 2017, the House approved the MRA authorization increases when it agreed to H.Res. 411 , by unanimous consent.  The report also refers to a request to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to issue guidance on the allowance of all Members to use campaign funds for security improvements to their residences. The advisory opinion was issued on July 13, 2017. Subsequently, on July 28, 2017, House Sergeant at Arms Paul D. Irving issued a \"Dear Colleague\" letter announcing that his office \"will assume the cost of and oversee future District Office security upgrades, maintenance, and monthly monitoring fees.\"  On August 15, 2017, the Committee on House Administration issued a \"Dear Colleague\" letter announcing updates to the Members' Congressional Handbook incorporating these and other changes. The MRA remains available for security measures necessitated by official duties as discussed in the letter and the Handbook . The FY2018 act and explanatory statement further address security for Members, staff, and visitors, stating, This agreement provides additional resources to the United States Capitol Police and the Sergeants at Arms of both chambers to enhance security for Members of Congress, their staff, and office visitors. Over the past year there have been humbling reminders of the threats Members of Congress and their staff face as public servants. The Congressional community has also been reminded of the heroic capabilities of the men and women of the United States Capitol Police. There is no higher priority in this agreement than providing adequate resources for the physical security of Members and their staff as well as constituents and visitors to the Capitol campus.  ... The agreement includes $7,500,000 to enhance Member protection, including funds for increased training, equipment and technology-related support items. The men and women of the Capitol Police have an increasingly difficult mission of protecting Members of Congress and the overall Capitol complex. Their mission can, at times, put them in harm's way. Ensuring these officers have the best tools and resources to carry out their duties is of the upmost importance to Congress. The Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 was submitted on May 23, 2017. It contains a request for $4.865 billion in new budget authority for legislative branch activities. By law, the legislative branch request is submitted to the President and included in the budget without change.  In general, FY2018 legislative branch budget requests had already been developed and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prior to the enactment of funding for FY2017, which occurred on May 5. Accounts in the Budget therefore include the following disclaimer: Note.\u2014A full-year 2017 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, the budget assumes this account is operating under the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 114-254 ). The amounts included for 2017 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution.  Table 2 lists the dates of hearings of the legislative branch subcommittees in 2017. Prepared statements of witnesses were posted on the subcommittee websites. On June 23, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Legislative Branch held a markup of the FY2018 bill.  The subcommittee recommended $3.58 billion (a $100 million increase, or +2.8%, from the comparable FY2017 enacted level), not including Senate items, which are historically considered by the Senate.  No amendments were offered.  On June 29, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee met to mark up the FY2018 bill reported from its legislative branch subcommittee. The following amendments were considered: a manager's amendment, offered by Chairman Yoder of Kansas, with technical changes, which was agreed to by voice vote; an amendment offered by Representative McCollum of Minnesota, related to the public release of CRS reports, which was not agreed to by voice vote; an amendment offered by Representative Lee of California, related to House staff diversity and addressing bias in hiring and promotion, which was agreed to by voice vote; an amendment offered by Representative Wasserman Schultz of Florida, related to the House historic buildings revitalization trust fund, which was withdrawn. The bill was reported out of committee by voice vote ( H.R. 3162 , H.Rept. 115-199 ). On July 18, 2017, the text of H.R. 3162 was included in a print issued by the House Rules Committee referred to as the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018, and short titled the \"Defense, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water Development National Security Appropriations Act, 2018\" (Committee Print 115-30). An announcement regarding the amendment process was issued.  The House Rules Committee met on July 24 and 25, 2017, to consider a special rule for consideration of this bill, H.R. 3219 , which included legislative branch funding as Division B. A total of 34 amendments were considered by the committee for Division B (including 7 the committee considered late or late revised).  Ten amendments to Division B were made in order under the rule reported by the House Rules Committee ( H.Res. 473 , amendments printed in H.Rept. 115-259 ).  H.Res. 473 was agreed to in the House on July 26, 2017 (232-192, Roll no. 415; see also H.Res. 478 ). The House proceeded to consideration of H.R. 3219 on July 26. Of the 10 amendments to Division B made in order, 9 were offered.  Four were agreed to by voice vote:  H.Amdt. 214 , relating to the use of the Members' Representational Allowance for Member security; H.Amdt. 215 , increasing funding for the House Wounded Warrior Program by $250,000 (offset by a decrease in funding for the Architect of the Capitol); H.Amdt. 218 , providing designated baby changing stations in the Capitol Complex; and H.Amdt. 221 , prohibiting the delivery of printed copies of the Federal Register to Representatives unless specifically requested. Two failed by voice vote:  H.Amdt. 213 , increasing funding for the Government Accountability Office, offset by a reduction in the Members' Representational Allowance; and H.Amdt. 220 , limiting mass mailings to the size of a standard postcard. Three failed by roll call vote:  H.Amdt. 216 and H.Amdt. 217 , which would have reduced funding for the Congressional Budget Office; and H.Amdt. 219 , which would have provided funding for the reestablishment of the Office of Technology Assessment, offset from funds from the Architect of the Capitol's Capital Construction and Operations Account.  H.R. 3219 was passed in the House the next day (235-192, Roll no. 435). On July 27, the Senate Appropriations Committee met to mark up its version of the FY2018 legislative branch appropriations bill. It reported the bill on the same day (by recorded vote, 31-0; S. 1648 , S.Rept. 115-137 ).  S. 1648 would have provided $3.171 billion, not including House items, an increase of $122.4 million (+4.0%) from the comparable FY2017 enacted level.  A continuing appropriations resolution (CR) providing funding for legislative branch activities through December 8, 2017, was enacted on September 8, 2017 ( H.R. 601 , P.L. 115-56 ). Two provisions in the CR related to the legislative branch.  Section 140 allowed for amounts made available for salaries for employees in the Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper to be apportioned at rates necessary to maintain current Senate cybersecurity capabilities. In general, 2 U.S.C. \u00a74577 prohibits spending more than one-quarter of the total amount available for employees covered by this line-item in the first quarter of a fiscal year.  P.L. 115-56 also contained a provision continuing \"section 175 of Public Law 114-223, as amended by division A of Public Law 114-254.\" This provision prohibited a Member pay adjustment in FY2017. The continuance of this provision prohibited the Member pay adjustment for the duration of the CR, and it was extended in the subsequent FY2018 CRs. Member pay was then frozen for the remainder of the fiscal year in Section 7 of the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. On September 14, the House agreed to H.Res. 500 , providing for consideration of the bill ( H.R. 3354 ) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes.  The resolution also provided for the inclusion of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-31, modified by Rules Committee Print 115-32 and the amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying the resolution, in an amendment in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 3354 (Roll no. 443). The text of the legislative branch bill, as agreed to in H.R. 3219 , was unchanged.  H.R. 3354 , as amended to include text for all 12 appropriations bills, was agreed to in the House on September 14, 2017 (Roll no. 528). No further action was taken.  Additional continuing appropriations resolutions provided funding through December 22, 2017 ( P.L. 115-90 ); January 19, 2018 ( P.L. 115-96 ); February 8, 2018 ( P.L. 115-120 ). This law also amended Title 44 of the U.S. Code to restrict the distribution of free printed copies of Federal Register to Members of Congress and federal employees; and March 23, 2018 ( P.L. 115-123 ). Title IX of Division B also provided $14.0 million to the Government Accountability Office \"for audits and investigations relating to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and the 2017 wildfires.\" On March 22, 2018, a rule for the consideration of H.R. 1625 , consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-66, was reported by the House Committee on Rules. The committee print contained the text of the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The rule, H.Res. 796 , was agreed to (211-207, Roll no. 124). The House then agreed to H.R. 1625 (256-167, Roll no. 127). The following day, the Senate invoked cloture (67-30, Record Vote Number 62) and then agreed to H.R. 1625 (65-32, Record Vote Number 63).  Division I of the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 115-141 ) provides $4.700 billion for legislative branch activities, an increase of $260.0 million (5.9%) from the FY2017 level.  The percentage of total discretionary budget authority provided to the legislative branch has remained relatively stable at approximately 0.4% since at least FY1976. The maximum level, 0.48%, was in FY1995, and the minimum, 0.31%, was in FY2009.  FY2017 funding was provided in Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ), which was enacted on May 5, 2017. The $4.440 billion provided by the act represented a $77.0 million increase (+1.7%) from the FY2016 enacted level.  FY2016 funding was provided in Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), which was enacted on December 18, 2015. The $4.363 billion provided by the act represented a $63.0 million increase (+1.5%) from the FY2015 enacted level.  FY2015 funding was provided in Division H of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), which was enacted on December 16, 2014. The $4.300 billion provided by the act represented an increase of $41.7 million (+1.0%) from FY2014.  Neither a legislative branch appropriations bill nor a continuing appropriations resolution (CR) containing FY2014 funding was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. A funding gap, which resulted in a partial government shutdown, ensued for 16 days. The funding gap was terminated by the enactment of a CR ( P.L. 113-46 ) on October 17, 2013. The CR provided funding through January 15, 2014. Following enactment of a temporary continuing resolution on January 15, 2014 ( P.L. 113-73 ), a consolidated appropriations bill was enacted on January 17 ( P.L. 113-76 ), providing $4.259 billion for the legislative branch for FY2014. FY2013 funding of approximately $4.061 billion was provided by P.L. 113-6 , which was signed into law on March 26, 2013. The act funded legislative branch accounts at the FY2012 enacted level, with some exceptions (also known as \"anomalies\"), not including across-the-board rescissions required by Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 . Section 3004 was intended to eliminate any amount by which the new budget authority provided in the act exceeded the FY2013 discretionary spending limits in Section 251(c)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-240 ). Subsequent to the enactment of P.L. 113-6 , OMB calculated that additional rescissions of 0.032% of security budget authority and 0.2% of nonsecurity budget authority would be required. The act did not alter the sequestration reductions implemented on March 1, which reduced most legislative branch accounts by 5.0%. The accompanying OMB report indicated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled in each account containing nonexempt funds.  Division G of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ) provided $4.307 billion for the legislative branch. This level was $236.9 million below (-5.2%) the FY2011 enacted level. P.L. 112-10 provided $4.543 billion for legislative branch operations in FY2011. This level represented a $125.1 million decrease from the $4.668 billion provided in the FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-68 ) and the FY2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-212 ). The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $4.402 billion. In FY2009, an additional $25.0 million was provided for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. P.L. 111-32 , the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, also contained funding for a new Capitol Police radio system ($71.6 million) and additional funding for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) ($2.0 million).  As seen in Table 3 , the FY2017 legislative branch budget, adjusted for inflation, remained below the FY2007 level. When compared to FY2010, which was the peak of legislative branch funding, the FY2017 level decreased 4.9% when not adjusted for inflation and 14.9% when adjusted for inflation.  Figure 1 shows the same information graphically, while also demonstrating the division of budget authority across the legislative branch in FY2017.   Figure 2 shows the timing of legislative branch appropriations actions, including the issuance of House and Senate reports, bill passage, and enactment, from FY1996 through FY2018. It shows that fiscal year funding for the legislative branch has been determined on or before October 1 five times during this period (FY1997, FY2000, FY2004, FY2006, and FY2010), with another two bills enacted during the first month of the fiscal year (FY1998 and FY1999), two in November (FY1996 and FY2002), six in December (FY2001, FY2005, FY2008, FY2012, FY2015, and FY2016), and eight in the next calendar year (FY2003, FY2007, FY2009, FY2011, FY2013, FY2014, FY2017, and FY2018). FY2017 funding, enacted on May 5, 2017, represented the latest date of enactment during this period.  The following sections discuss the various legislative branch accounts.  During consideration of the legislative branch bills, the House and Senate conform to a \"longstanding practice under which each body of Congress determines its own housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without intervention.\" As stated above, FY2018 legislative branch budget requests were generally developed and submitted to OMB prior to the determination of FY2017 funding, which was enacted on May 5, 2017.  The Senate requested $948.3 million for FY2018, an 8.8% increase over the $871.2 million provided in FY2017. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $899.8 million (+3.3%), and the FY2018 act provides $919.9 million (+5.6%). Additional information on the Senate account is presented in Table 6 . Appropriations for Senate committees are contained in two accounts. The inquiries and investigations account contains funds for all Senate committees except Appropriations. The Senate-reported and FY2018 enacted level of $133.3 million continues the level provided since FY2015. The Senate had requested $135.8 million (+1.9%). The Committee on Appropriations account contains funds for the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate-requested and -reported level of $15.1 million, which was provided in the FY2018 act, is equivalent to the level provided since FY2015.  The Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account (SOPOEA) provides each Senator with funds to administer an office. It consists of an administrative and clerical assistance allowance, a legislative assistance allowance, and an official office expense allowance. The funds may be used for any category of expenses, subject to limitations on official mail.  The Senate requested $452.6 million, $62.6 million above (+16.1%) the $390.0 million provided each year since FY2014. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $404.0 million (+3.6%), and the FY2018 act provides $424.0 million (+8.7%). The Senate-reported bill contained five administrative provisions: 1. One provision, which was first included in FY2016, requires amounts remaining in the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account (SOPOEA) to be used for deficit reduction or to reduce the federal debt. This provision was included in the FY2018 act. 2. One provision related to Senate procurements, which was included in the FY2018 act. 3. One provision which would continue the freeze on Member salaries at the 2009 level. Member salaries are funded in a permanent appropriations account, and the legislative branch bill does not contain language funding or increasing Member pay. A provision prohibiting the automatic Member pay adjustments could be included in any bill, or be introduced as a separate bill. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act froze Member salaries in Section 7. 4. One provision which would address student loan repayment for employees of departing Senators and Vice Presidents. This provision was included in the FY2018 act. 5. One provision would require Senate political committees to file campaign finance disclosure reports electronically and directly with the Federal Election Commission. This provision was not included in the FY2018 act. The House requested $1.223 billion for FY2018, a 2.9% increase from the FY2017 enacted level of $1.189 billion. The House-passed level of $1.194 billion would have provided a $4.8 million increase (+0.4%). The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $1.200 billion, a $10.95 million increase (+0.9%). Additional information on headings in the House of Representatives account is presented in Table 7 . Funding for House committees is contained in the appropriation heading \"committee employees,\" which comprises two subheadings. The first subheading contains funds for personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of House committees, except the Appropriations Committee, as authorized by the House in a committee expense resolution. The House requested $129.1 million (+1.6%). The House-passed bill and the FY2018 act provided $127.1 million, a continuation of the FY2017 level and an increase of 2.5% from the level provided in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016.  The second subheading contained funds for the personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of the Committee on Appropriations. The House-passed bill and the FY2018 act provided $23.2 million, a slight decrease ($45,000) from the level provided in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. The Members' Representational Allowance is available to support Members in their official and representational duties.  The $562.6 million in the House-passed bill and the FY2018 act is a continuation of the FY2017 level and an increase of $8.3 million (+1.5%) from the level provided in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016.  The House committee report indicates that the recommended \"level of funding will allow the MRAs to operate at authorized levels as approved by the Committee on House Administration.\"  The House requested the continuation of administrative provisions from prior years related to 1. unexpended balances from the MRA; 2. limiting amounts available from the MRA for leased vehicles; and 3. limiting or prohibiting the delivery of copies of bills and resolutions, the Congressional Record , the U.S. Code , the Statement of Disbursements , the Daily Calendar , and the Congressional Pictorial Directory . These provisions, as well as a new provision amending the House Services Revolving Fund to allow for the collection of a fee from vendors for failure to abide by and maintain House security policies, were all included in the House-passed bill. These provisions, with the exception of the vendors' fee provision, were included in the FY2018 act. The House-passed bill also contained an administrative provision which would freeze Member salaries at the 2009 level. The provision was included in the bill as reported by the House Appropriations Committee, and no separate vote was taken on the pay adjustment. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act froze Member salaries in Section 7. The U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are responsible for the security of the Capitol Complex, including, for example, the U.S. Capitol, the House and Senate office buildings, the U.S. Botanic Garden, and the Library of Congress buildings and adjacent grounds.  The USCP requested $422.3 million for FY2018, an increase of $29.0 million (+7.4%) from the $393.3 million the USCP received for FY2017.  The House-passed and Senate-reported bills would have provided $422.5 million (+7.4%). The FY2018 act provides $426.5 million, an increase of $33.2 million (+8.4%). Additional information on the USCP is presented in Table 8 . Appropriations for the police are contained in two accounts\u2014a salaries account and a general expenses account.  Salaries\u2014the Capitol Police requested $347.1 million for salaries, an increase of $21.8 million (+6.7%) from the $325.3 million provided in FY2017. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills would have provided $347.7 million (+6.9%). The FY2018 act provides $351.7 million (+8.1%). General Expenses\u2014the Capitol Police requested $75.2 million for general expenses, an increase of $7.2 million (+10.6%) from the $68.0 million provided in FY2017. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills, and the FY2018 act, provide $74.8 million (+10.0%).  Another appropriation relating to the Capitol Police appears within the Architect of the Capitol account for Capitol Police buildings and grounds. USCP requested $54.2 million, an increase of $34.1 million (+170.4%) from the $20.0 million provided in FY2017. The House-passed bill would have provided $33.2 million (+66.0%) and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $30.8 million (+53.9%). The FY2018 act provides $34.2 million (+71.0%). For additional discussion of FY2018 funding, see the section on \" Security Funding Following the June 14, 2017, Shooting at a Congressional Baseball Game Practice .\" The Capitol Police requested one administrative provision, which would amend language in the United States Capitol Police Administrative Technical Corrections Act regarding terminations from employment (2 U.S.C. 1907(e)(1)). The House-passed and Senate-reported bills did not include this provision, nor did the FY2018 act.  The Office of Compliance is an independent and nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch. It was established to administer and enforce the Congressional Accountability Act, which was enacted in 1995. The act applies various employment and workplace safety laws to Congress and certain legislative branch entities. The Office of Compliance requested $4.1 million for FY2018, an increase of $97,000 (+2.5%). The House-passed and Senate-reported bills would have provided $3.96 million, a continuation of the level provided each year since FY2015. The FY2018 act provides $4.959 million, an increase of $1.0 million (+25.3%). Following increased attention beginning in late 2017 to sexual harassment policies in Congress, the House passed the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act ( H.R. 4924 ) on February 6, 2018. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  In addition, the House agreed to H.Res. 630 on November 29, 2017, requiring a training program on workplace rights and responsibilities for all House Members, officers, and employees. Since then, discussions related to potential future changes to the Congressional Accountability Act have continued. The FY2018 explanatory statement further addressed this: Ensuring and protecting workplace rights of employees is imperative and the funds provided in this act support that effort. Processes to protect workplace rights have been in place for many years but they are not perfect. As Congress considers changes to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which will impact the Office of Compliance's operations, there is a need to strengthen the agency's overall capacity, including the quality of its training and information technology processes.  The FY2018 explanatory statement also addressed efforts and funding implications specific to the House: This agreement provides $5,000,000 to the CAO for workplace rights initiatives. The funds will support mandatory training requirements for all Members and staff included in House Resolution 630, as well as the establishment of the Office of Employee Advocacy created in House Resolution 724. Mandatory training is an important first step to ensure that every Member, staff, intern, fellow and detailee is fully aware of the laws that apply to them and their right to a harassment-free workplace under the Congressional Accountability Act. The Office of Employee Advocacy will provide House employees with immediate access to a dedicated advocate who will provide legal consultation, representation, and assistance on allegations, claims, and complaints under the Congressional Accountability Act in proceedings before the Office of Compliance and Committee on Ethics. CBO is a nonpartisan congressional agency created to provide objective economic and budgetary analysis to Congress. CBO cost estimates are required for any measure reported by a regular or conference committee that may vary revenues or expenditures. CBO requested $49.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million (+7.4%) from the $46.5 million provided in FY2017. The House-passed bill would have provided $48.5 million (+4.3%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $48.1 million (+3.4%). The FY2018 act provides $49.9 million (+7.4%). The FY2018 act includes one administrative provision, also included in the FY2019 budget request (submitted prior to the enactment of the FY2018 act), which applies certain Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) to CBO. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the U.S. Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol and its grounds, House and Senate office buildings, Library of Congress buildings and grounds, Capitol Power Plant, Botanic Garden, Capitol Visitor Center, and Capitol Police buildings and grounds. The Architect is responsible for the Supreme Court buildings and grounds, but appropriations for their expenses are not contained in the legislative branch appropriations bill. Operations of the Architect are funded in the following 10 accounts: capital construction and operations, Capitol building, Capitol grounds, Senate office buildings, House office buildings, Capitol Power Plant, Library buildings and grounds, Capitol Police buildings and grounds, Capitol Visitor Center, and Botanic Garden.  The Architect requested $782.96 million for FY2018, an increase of $165.1 million (+26.7%) from the FY2017 level of $617.9 million.  The House Appropriations Committee Legislative Branch Subcommittee recommended $577.8 million, not including funding for the Senate office buildings. A manager's amendment adopted at the full committee markup (voice vote) increased this amount by $4.0 million (adjusting the House office buildings account).  The House-passed level of $581.6 million represented a $52.1 million increase (+9.8%) from the $529.5 million provided for similar items in FY2017. This level includes H.Amdt. 215 , which increased funding for the House Wounded Warrior Program by $250,000, offset by a reduction in the AOC Capital construction and operations account.  The Senate-reported bill would have provided $454.0 million, not including funding for the House office buildings or the House Historic Buildings Revitalization Fund. This represents an increase of $38.9 million (+9.4%) from the $415.2 million provided for similar items in FY2017. The FY2018 act provides $712.1 million, an increase of $94.2 million (+15.2%). Additional funding information on the individual AOC accounts is presented in Table 9 . The AOC also requested two administrative provisions, which were included in the House-passed and Senate-reported bills and the FY2018 act: 1. a provision prohibiting the use of funds for bonuses for contractors behind schedule or over budget, first included in FY2015; and 2. a provision prohibiting scrims containing photographs of building facades during restoration or construction projects performed by the Architect of the Capitol, first included in FY2015.  The Library of Congress serves simultaneously as Congress's parliamentary library and the de facto national library of the United States. Its broader services to the nation include the acquisition, maintenance, and preservation of a collection of more than 162.5 million analog items; service to the general public and scholarly and library communities; administration of U.S. copyright laws by its Copyright Office; and administration of a national program to provide reading material to the blind and physically handicapped. Its direct services to Congress include the provision of legal research and law-related services by the Law Library of Congress, and a broad range of activities by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), including in-depth and nonpartisan public policy research, analysis, and legislative assistance for Members and committees and their staff; congressional staff training; information and statistics retrieval; and continuing legal education for Members of both chambers and congressional staff. The Library requested $703.4 million for FY2018, an increase of $71.5 million (+11.3%) from the $631.96 million provided in FY2017.  The House-passed bill would have provided $648.0 million, an increase of $16.1 million (+2.5%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $638.9 million, an increase of $6.9 million (+1.1%).

The FY2018 act provides the House-passed level of $28.4 million (+23.2%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $25.3 million (+9.4%). These levels do not include authority to spend receipts and prior year unobligated balances ($45.7 million in FY2017; $46.3 million in the request; $43.6 million in the House-passed and Senate-reported bills and the FY2018 act). Total budget authority, including receipts and balances, is $68.8 million in FY2017; $77.7 million in the request; $72.0 million in the FY2018 act and the House-passed bill; and $68.8 million in the Senate-reported bill. Congressional Research Service\u2014The Library requested $119.3 million for FY2018, an increase of $11.3 million (+10.5%) from the FY2017 level of $107.9 million. The House-passed bill would have provided $111.5 million (+3.3%), and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $112.7 million (+4.4%). The FY2018 act provides the requested level of $119.3 million (+10.5%). Books for the Blind and Physically Handicapped\u2014The Library requested $52.8 million, a $2.6 million (+5.1) increase from the $50.2 million provided in FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017. The House-passed and Senate-reported FY2018 bills would have continued the prior-year level. The FY2018 act provides $51.5 million (+2.5%). The Architect's budget also contains funds for the Library buildings and grounds. For FY2018, $121.2 million was requested, an increase of $74.1 million (+157.4%) from the $47.1 million provided for FY2017. The House-passed bill would have provided $76.1 million (+61.6%). Of this total, $45.0 million would be allocated for a collection storage module at Ft. Meade, MD. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $27.4 million (-41.7%). The FY2018 act provides $74.9 million (+59.0%), including the funding for the storage module. The Library requested  1. authority to obligate funds for reimbursable and revolving fund activities ($190.6 million); 2. an amendment to its gifts authorities; and 3. language related to the operations of the Copyright Office in the event of a lapse in annual appropriations. Due to timing, the budget request also included a provision establishing the Library of Congress National Collection Stewardship Fund, although this was included in the FY2017 act.  The House-passed bill included the reimbursable and revolving fund language.  The Senate-reported bill included the reimbursable and revolving fund authority as well as provisions to (1) update the revolving fund language, (2) amend gift authorities, (3) apply certain aspects of the Congressional Accountability Act to the Library of Congress, and (4) provide for the availability of CRS reports through the Government Publishing Office website.

Government Publishing Office Business Operations Revolving Fund\u2014the revolving fund supports the operation and maintenance of the Government Publishing Office. GPO requested, and the House-passed and Senate-reported bills and the FY2018 act provide $8.5 million, an increase of $708,000 (+9.0%).  GAO responds to requests for studies of federal government programs and expenditures. GAO may also initiate its own work.  GAO requested $590.7 million, an increase of $46.2 million (+8.5%) from the $544.5 million provided in FY2017. The House-passed bill would have continued the FY2017 level, and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $562.8 million (+3.4%). The FY2018 act provides $578.9 million (+6.3%).

The Open World Leadership Center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries by inviting their leaders to observe democracy and free enterprise in the United States. The first program was authorized by Congress in 1999 to support the relationship between Russia and the United States. The program encouraged young federal and local Russian leaders to visit the United States and observe its government and society. Established at the Library of Congress as the Center for Russian Leadership Development in 2000, the center was renamed the Open World Leadership Center in 2003, when the program was expanded to include specified additional countries. In 2004, Congress further extended the program's eligibility to other countries designated by the center's board of trustees, subject to congressional consideration. The center is housed in the Library and receives services from the Library through an interagency agreement. The legislative branch bills, including the House-passed and Senate-reported FY2018 bills, have included a provision since FY2016 stating  That funds made available to support Russian participants shall only be used for those engaging in free market development, humanitarian activities, and civic engagement, and shall not be used for officials of the central government of Russia.  Open World requested $5.8 million for FY2018, an increase of $200,000 (+3.6%) from the FY2017 enacted level. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills, and the FY2018 act, continue the FY2017 enacted level of $5.6 million.  The location and future of Open World, attempts to assess its effectiveness, and its inclusion in the legislative branch budget have been discussed at appropriations hearings and in report language for more than a decade. The funding level for Open World has also varied greatly during this period. In FY2017, the House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.0 million (-82.1%) for expenses associated with shutting down the program. During full committee consideration, an amendment was offered and withdrawn to increase funding for this program. The committee report stated, For many years the Committee has had concern with the placement of the Open World Leadership Center (OWLC) in the Legislative Branch with it mirroring numerous similar or nearly identical programs administered by other Federal agencies. In this fiscal environment where our national debt exceeds $19 trillion, it is important to eliminate duplicative programs. The Committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the OWLC. The Committee directs the Director to retain any necessary prior year funds in the Trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill to be utilized for the orderly shutdown. The Director is further directed that the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2017 appropriation bill. The Senate-reported FY2017 bill would have continued funding at the FY2016 level, and this level was continued in the FY2017 act.  For FY2016, the House subcommittee mark proposed $1.0 million for an orderly shutdown of Open World. Language in the full committee print, released prior to the markup of the FY2016 bill, stated,  The Committee believes given our current fiscal environment, and in light of both the lack of quantifiable results from the Open World Leadership Center and its duplication of programs more appropriately offered by the State Department, the program has long outlived its short-term intent. The Committee has provided an allocation to be used for the orderly shutdown during fiscal year 2016 of the Open World Leadership Center. An amendment offered by Representative Fortenberry at the FY2016 full committee markup proposed to add $4.7 million for Open World, offset from funding for the \"Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Power Plant\" budget. The operations of Open World, including assessments of its impact, were discussed prior to the adoption (by voice vote) of the amendment. An amendment made in order by the House Rules Committee proposed the elimination of the $5.7 million included in the House-reported bill for Open World and would have applied the savings to the spending reduction account. The amendment, H.Amdt. 239 , was agreed to (224-199). Open World was also the subject of two amendments proposed but not made in order by the House Rules Committee: (1) one amendment submitted would have redirected the $4.7 million added to Open World during the full committee markup back to the \"Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Power Plant\"; and (2) one amendment would have redirected $2.5 million from Open World to reinstitute the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). The Senate-reported FY2016 bill would have provided $5.7 million, equivalent to the FY2015 level, and the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $5.6 million. For FY2015, the House committee recommended $3.4 million, while the Senate committee recommended $5.7 million. Both reports discussed the conflict in Ukraine and Open World's activities in the region. The FY2015 act provided $5.7 million.  For FY2014, the House subcommittee mark would have provided $1.0 million. An amendment to restore funding for Open World to the FY2013 postsequester level was debated and withdrawn during the full committee markup. The House committee report stated, For many years the Committee has had concern with the placement of the Open World Leadership Center (OWLC) in the Legislative Branch. The Committee understands the program has some strong champions on the Committee. However, with further reductions being made to every program within the Legislative Branch, the Committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the OWLC. The Committee directs the Executive Director of the OWLC to retain any necessary prior year funds in the Trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill [to] be utilized for the orderly shutdown. The Executive Director is further directed that the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2014 appropriation bill. The FY2014 Senate-reported bill would have provided $4.0 million, as well as a provision allowing the Librarian of Congress to transfer up to $6.0 million in nonappropriated funds to Open World. The final enacted FY2014 level was $6.0 million. The FY2013 House-reported bill would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of $9.0 million (-90.0%), from the $10.0 million provided in FY2012 and requested for FY2013. The House report stated that this funding level would \"cover the cost associated with the shutdown\" and directed that \"the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill.\" H.Amdt. 1281 , agreed to by recorded vote (204-203, Roll no. 373), eliminated this funding. At the Senate FY2013 budget request hearing on March 1, 2012, the subcommittee discussed potential options for increasing private funding, including the hire of a development professional. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $10.0 million. The FY2013 act provided $8.0 million, not including sequestration or the across-the-board rescission.  The House-passed FY2012 bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of 91.2% from FY2011. The House report stated, \"The program has some strong champions on the Committee, but with reductions being made to most every program within the Federal budget the Committee has elected to shut down the program and recommends $1,000,000 for shutdown expenses.\" The Senate-reported bill, in contrast, would have provided $10.0 million (-12.1%). The Senate report stated that \"despite the fiscal constraints of the budget this program is necessary for the promotion of democratic principles in countries with historically oppressive rule.\" The FY2012 act contained the Senate-reported level.  The FY2011 level of $11.4 million represented a decrease of $623,000 (-5.2%) from the $12.0 million provided for FY2010.  The FY2010 level represented a decrease of $1.9 million (-13.7%) from FY2009. Additionally, the FY2010 House Appropriations Committee report stated that \"the Legislative Branch Subcommittee has been clear that it expects the Open World program to become financially independent of funding in this bill as soon as possible.\" This sentiment was also expressed in the conference report, which stated  The conferees are fully supportive of expanded efforts of the Open World Center to raise private funding and expect this effort to reduce the requirements for funding from the Legislative Branch appropriations bill in future years. The Committees look forward to a report of progress being made by the Center's fundraising program prior to hearings on its fiscal year 2011 budget request. The FY2009 level of $13.9 million was a $4.92 million increase (+54.8%) from FY2008. The location within the legislative branch was discussed during a hearing on the FY2009 budget. Ambassador John O'Keefe, the executive director of Open World, testified that the program may attract different participants if associated with the executive branch rather than the Library of Congress, which may be seen as more neutral and nonpartisan. The FY2009 explanatory statement directed the Open World Leadership Center Board of Trustees to work with the State Department and the judiciary to establish a shared funding mechanism.  The $8.98 million provided in FY2008 represented a decrease of $4.88 million (-35.2%) from the $13.86 million provided in FY2007 and FY2006. The location of Open World was also discussed during the FY2008 appropriations cycle, and language was included in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act requiring Open World to prepare a report by March 31, 2008, on \"potential options for transfer of the Open World Leadership Center to a department or agency in the executive branch, establishment of the Center as an independent agency in the executive branch, or other appropriate options.\"  In 2004, GAO issued a report on the Open World program, examining program participation, purpose, and accountability.  The center was created by Congress in 1988 to encourage public service by congressional staff through training and development programs. The FY2018 budget request and the House-passed and Senate-reported bills and the FY2018 act contain $430,000, approximately the same level provided since FY2006.  As in past years, Congress considered a number of general provisions related to the legislative branch. Table 4 lists the provisions considered, the stage originally proposed, and final disposition.  Table 5 through Table 9 provide information on funding levels for the legislative branch overall, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Capitol Police, and the Architect of the Capitol.  The tables are followed by an Appendix , which lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports; public law numbers; and enactment dates since FY1998."
