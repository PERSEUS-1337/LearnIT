CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Joint Federal-State Commission on Policies and \n        Programs Affecting Alaska Natives (hereafter in this Act \n        referred to as the ``Alaska Natives Commission'') was \n        established by the Indian Law Enforcement Act (42 U.S.C. 2991a \n        note) following--\n                    (A) the publication in 1989 of the report entitled \n                ``Report on the Status of Alaska Natives: A Call for \n                Action by the Alaska Federation of Natives''; and\n                    (B) extensive congressional hearings that focused \n                on the need for the first comprehensive assessment of \n                the social, cultural, and economic condition of 86,000 \n                Alaska Natives since the enactment of the Alaska Native \n                Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).\n            (2)(A) The 14-member Alaska Natives Commission held--\n                    (i) 15 regional hearings throughout Alaska between \n                July 1992 and October 1993; and\n                    (ii) 2 statewide hearings in Anchorage, Alaska, \n                coinciding with the conventions of 1992 and 1993 of the \n                Alaska Federation of Natives.\n            (B) In May 1994, the Alaska Natives Commission issued a 3-\n        volume, 440-page report.\n            (3) As required by the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act, \n        the report referred to in paragraph (2) was formally conveyed \n        to the Congress, the President of the United States, and the \n        Governor of Alaska.\n            (4) The Alaska Natives Commission found that many Alaska \n        Native individuals, families, and communities were experiencing \n        a social, cultural, and economic crisis marked by rampant \n        unemployment, the lack of economic opportunity, alcohol abuse, \n        depression, and morbidity and mortality rates that were \n        described by health care professionals as staggering.\n            (5) The Alaska Natives Commission found that due to the \n        high rate of unemployment and lack of economic opportunities \n        for Alaska Natives, government programs for the poor have \n        become the foundation of many village economies.\n            (6) Displacing traditional Alaska Native social safety \n        nets, the programs referred to in paragraph (5) (that were \n        developed with well-meaning intentions) have--\n                    (A) undermined the healthy interdependence and \n                self-sufficiency of Alaska Native tribes and families; \n                and\n                    (B) placed Alaska Native tribes and families at \n                risk of becoming permanent dependents of the Federal \n                Government.\n            (7) Despite the seemingly insurmountable problems referred \n        to in the preceding paragraphs, the Alaska Natives Commission \n        found that Alaska Natives, building on the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act, had commenced a unique process of critical \n        self-examination that, if supported by the Congress through \n        innovative legislation and effective public administration at \n        all levels, including traditional Native governance, could \n        provide the basis for an Alaska Native social, cultural, \n        economic, and spiritual renewal.\n            (8) The Alaska Natives Commission recognized that the key \n        to the future well-being of Alaska Natives resided in--\n                    (A) the systematic resumption of responsibility by \n                Alaska Natives for the well-being of the members of \n                Alaska Native tribes;\n                    (B) the strengthening of the economies of Alaska \n                Natives;\n                    (C) the strengthening, operation, and control of \n                their systems of governance, social services, \n                education, health care, and law enforcement; and\n                    (D) exercising rights that Alaska Natives have as a \n                result of the special relationship of Alaska Natives \n                with the Federal Government and as citizens of the \n                United States and Alaska.\n            (9) The Alaska Natives Commission recognized that the \n        following 3 basic principles must be respected in addressing \n        the myriad of problems facing Alaska Natives--\n                    (A) self-reliance;\n                    (B) self-determination; and\n                    (C) the integrity of Native cultures.\n            (10) There is a need to address the problems confronting \n        Alaska Natives referred to in the preceding paragraphs.\n            (11) The problems referred to in paragraph (10) should be \n        addressed rapidly, with certainty, and in conformity with the \n        real economic, social, and cultural needs of Alaska Natives.\n            (12) The Congress--\n                    (A) retains and has exercised its constitutional \n                authority over Native affairs in Alaska subsequent to \n                the Treaty of Cession of Alaska to the United States; \n                and\n                    (B) through this Act, exercises that authority.\n\nSEC. 2.
