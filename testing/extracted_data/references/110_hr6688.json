FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) When it is possible to reduce the regulatory burden on \n        depository institutions associated with reporting requirements \n        under chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, while at the \n        same time maintaining the utility of such reports to law \n        enforcement efforts, it is appropriate to do so.\n            (2) In February 2008, the Comptroller General issued a \n        report titled ``Bank Secrecy Act: Increased Use of Exemption \n        Provisions Could Reduce Currency Transaction Reporting While \n        Maintaining Usefulness to Law Enforcement Efforts'' (GAO-08-\n        355).\n            (3) The Comptroller General finds that since transactions \n        of exempt customers are of little or no value to law \n        enforcement efforts, efforts made to increase the use of such \n        exemptions by depository institutions could reduce the \n        regulatory burden associated with filing unnecessary cash \n        transaction reports and the government's costs to process them, \n        while maintaining the utility of such reports to law \n        enforcement efforts.\n            (4) The Comptroller General finds that the requirement that \n        depository institutions file biennial renewals for Phase II \n        customer exemptions duplicates the required annual review of \n        such exemptions and discourages the use of some exemptions.\n            (5) The Comptroller General finds that eliminating the \n        requirement that depository institutions file biennial renewals \n        for Phase II customer exemptions could increase the use of such \n        exemptions and reduce the burden associated with filing \n        unnecessary cash transaction reports.\n            (6) The Comptroller General recommends eliminating the \n        requirement that depository institutions biennially renew Phase \n        II exemptions.\n            (7) The Comptroller General finds that the cash \n        transactions of government entities and depository institutions \n        are likely of little or no use to law enforcement efforts and \n        that cash transaction reports related to these entities are \n        unnecessary.\n            (8) The Comptroller General finds that, although the \n        amendments made to chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, \n        by the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 required the \n        Secretary of the Treasury to exempt depository institutions \n        from filing cash transaction reports on the transactions of \n        government entities and depository institutions and did not \n        explicitly require the filing of exemption forms or annual \n        review of such information with respect to the exempt entities \n        to effectuate any such exemption, the regulations prescribed by \n        the Secretary nonetheless require depository institutions to \n        file such exemption forms and annual reviews.\n            (9) The Comptroller General finds that the requirement that \n        depository institutions file forms to exempt government \n        entities and depository institutions, and conduct annual \n        reviews of related information, discourages the use of such \n        exemptions and creates cash transaction reports that are of \n        little or no value to law enforcement efforts.\n            (10) The Comptroller General recommends eliminating the \n        requirement that depository institutions file exemption forms \n        and annually review the supporting information for government \n        entities and depository institutions.\n            (11) The Comptroller General finds that requiring \n        depository institutions to wait 12 months before exempting \n        certain customers with large numbers of cash transactions may \n        needlessly create cash transaction reports that are not highly \n        useful to law enforcement efforts.\n            (12) The Comptroller General finds that allowing depository \n        institutions to exempt clients with frequent cash transactions \n        within a time period of less than a year could avoid the filing \n        of unnecessary cash transaction reports.\n            (13) The Comptroller General recommends considering a \n        change in requirements to allow depository institutions to \n        exempt otherwise-eligible customers with frequent large cash \n        transactions within a period of time shorter than 12 months.\n\nSEC. 3.
