    "content": "U.S. relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) remained remarkably smooth during the 110 th Congress, as they were throughout most of the George W. Bush Administration. The two governments continued to have regular and robust high-level visits and exchanges of working level officials. Washington and Beijing also continued to develop military-to-military relations, cooperated on anti-terror initiatives, and worked together on a multilateral effort to restrain and eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons activities. U.S. companies continued to invest heavily in China, and the Chinese central government overtook Japan to become the largest holder of U.S. Treasuries used to finance the federal budget deficit, holding about $600 billion in Treasuries by the end of 2008. Despite these growing connections, thorny problems continued to be factors in the relationship, including difficulties over China's intentions toward, and U.S. commitments, to democratic Taiwan, various disputes over China's failure to protect U.S. intellectual property rights, the alleged economic advantage China gains from managing its exchange rate, and growing concerns about the quality and safety of some exported Chinese products. In addition, some U.S. policymakers expressed growing concern about the significant long-term implications that China's accelerating rise in the world had for U.S. global power and influence. Some U.S. lawmakers suggested that U.S. policies should be reassessed in light of the PRC's continued strong economic growth and more assertive international posture. As the U.S. financial system deteriorated during the 110 th Congress, it became clear that the PRC was positioned to play a crucial role in any policy designed to address the problems. In order to mitigate the renminbi's appreciation against the dollar, China's central bank was forced to make heavy purchases of U.S. dollars. As a result, China by the 110 th Congress had amassed a huge level of foreign exchange reserves, totaling $1.9 trillion as of December 2008, and the Chinese central government had become an ever more important purchaser of U.S. Treasuries and other U.S. debt. Some U.S. policymakers expressed concern that this posed an economic risk to the United States should China's foreign exchange purchase patterns change, and a political risk should China use this position to seek advantages on other diplomatic issues. The financial crisis unfolding in the United States in 2008 and the Bush Administration's (and the incoming Obama Administration's) proposed financial rescue programs each required a substantial level of new U.S. government borrowing, with China positioned to be a major purchaser of this new U.S. government debt.  In addition, the scope of the financial crisis suggested that global economic decision-making in the future would be moving beyond the confines of the developed \"G-7\" countries, where China does not participate, and into the broader arena of the \"G-20\" countries, where China does participate, making Beijing a more important potential player in the global economic decision-making process. The G20 countries met in Washington DC on November 15, 2008, in an attempt to address the financial crisis, and scheduled another G20 meeting in London on April 2, 2009.  Beginning in March and April 2007, reports began to surface about tainted and unsafe food and consumer products in China, and concerns about product safety continued to plague U.S.-China relations throughout the rest of the 110 th Congress. An investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) early in 2007 linked tainted exports of pet food with wheat gluten from China to reports of pet deaths from kidney failure in the United States. The Canadian company that had imported the product, Menu Foods, initiated a massive recall of its products on March 16, 2007, and the recall effort later expanded to more brands of pet foods and other pet food manufacturers. On April 3, 2007, the FDA began halting imports of wheat gluten from a PRC company, the Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co. Ltd., saying it had tested positive for the tainted wheat gluten. Although the PRC government initially denied its pet food products were tainted, it later reversed that position, admitting on April 26, 2007, that PRC companies had exported melamine-laced wheat gluten to the United States. The pet food contamination was the beginning of a series of well publicized recalls of PRC imported products including fish, tires, toothpaste, and toys. Two of these\u2014Menu Foods pet food recall and Mattel's voluntary recall of over 18 million toys, announced on August 14, 2007\u2014were reported on most widely. But by August 17, 2007, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) had issued nearly 150 recall notices in 2007 for Chinese-manufactured products, including electric throws, ceramic heaters, folding recliner chairs, children's jewelry, kayak paddle floats, baby cribs, candles, oil-filled electric heaters, boom boxes, bicycles, clothing, gas lighters, remote controls, lamps, curling irons, and hair dryers.  In September 2008, concerns began to mount about infant formula and milk powder in China tainted with melamine, an industrial chemical that appears to make products more protein-rich. Amid a widening scandal and an extensive public outcry after thousands of babies sickened and some died, the PRC government took increasingly assertive measures to close down suspect producers and make arrests. On October 9, 2008, Beijing announced it was setting its first standards on melamine in milk, imposing a limit of 1 milligram per kilogram in infant formula and 2.5 milligrams per kilogram in liquid milk. On October 14, 2008, the PRC government ordered a recall of all milk products produced before September 14, 2008. Members of the 110 th Congress addressed the safety of products from China in several ways. These included:  Legislation targeted on the Chinese government to condemn poor product safety ( H.Res. 925 ), which died in the House Foreign Affairs Committee);  Legislation targeted on the U.S. government and on U.S. consumers, such as a request for the resignation of the Chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( H.Res. 803 ); a bill urging Americans to buy American-made products ( H.Res. 831 ); and legislation directing the Consumer Product Safety Commission to increase safety standards for infants and toddler products ( H.R. 1698 ), all of which died in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Bilateral efforts on the quality of Chinese exports to the United States had been underway for several years by the 110 th Congress. In 2004, the CPSC and China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to cooperate on increasing the safety of specific consumer products, including clothing, toys, cigarette and multipurpose lighters, home appliances, hazardous chemical consumer products, and bicycle helmets. The two agencies held a Consumer Product Safety Summit (CPSS) in Beijing in 2005, and a second CPSS meeting in Washington D.C. on September 11, 2007. The United States, China, and the European Union launched a \"Joint U.S.-EU-China Initiative on Consumer Product Safety Compliance\" in Beijing from September 19-24, 2008, followed by a \"High-Level Consumer Product Safety Trilateral Meeting\" in Brussels in November 2008. Concerns about Chinese products also led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to open an office in Beijing on November 18, 2008, to increase inspections of PRC food and medicine. From August 8-24, 2008, China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. The opening ceremony and most of the athletic events were held in Beijing, but six other PRC cities co-hosted Olympic competitions as well, including Qingdao (sailing); Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Qinhuangdao (soccer), and Hong Kong (equestrian events). Beijing reportedly spent $43 billion, more than any other Olympic host city, to prepare for the games. A number of controversies surfaced in the run-up to the 2008 Games. Multiple interest groups opposed to various PRC behaviors saw China's hosting of the games as an excellent opportunity to put pressure on leaders in Beijing to reform PRC policies. These groups included: Tibetan activists pushing either for Tibetan independence or for more enlightened Chinese policies in Tibet, actions which may have led to the March 2008 protests in Tibet and China's crackdown there; activists for Darfur seeking to pressure China to withdraw its support for the Sudanese government (Steven Spielberg resigned in February 2008 as artistic advisor for the Beijing Olympics over this issue); and a number of groups, such as Reporters without Borders and Human Rights Watch, arguing that China had not kept its promises to the International Olympic Committee to provide journalistic freedom to reporters and a cleaner environment for the athletes during the games.  Members of the 110 th supported some of these initiatives. Among the measures Members introduced were: Legislation calling on the PRC to use its leverage with Sudan to stop the violence in Darfur and to comply with U.N. directives. ( H.Res. 422 and S.Res. 203 , both of which passed their respective bodies.) The measures stated that the spirit of the Olympics is incompatible with acts supporting genocide. Legislation expressing the sense of the House that the President boycott the summer 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing because of PRC activities in Sudan. ( H.Res. 628 , which died in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.) Legislation expressing the sense of the House that the United States boycott the summer 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing unless the PRC stops human rights abuses against its own citizens and stops supporting human rights abuses by the governments of Sudan, Burma, and North Korea. ( H.Res. 608 , which died in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.) Legislation urging the President to boycott the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Olympic Games unless the PRC took steps to stop the genocide in Darfur and allowed full deployment of the U.N.-African Union mission there. ( H.Res. 1093 , which died in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.) Legislation calling on the PRC to end its human rights abuses, stop persecuting Tibetans and Uighurs, and end support for the governments of Burma and Sudan to honor the spirit of the Olympic Games. ( H.Res. 1370 , which the House passed under suspension.) Despite these and other issues, periodic calls for a boycott of either the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony or the entire summer games did not lead countries to pull their teams from the competitions nor world leaders to snub the opening ceremony. President Bush, in fact, became the first sitting U.S. President ever to attend an overseas Olympic Games ceremony. PRC leaders placed a high priority on security at the games. Among other steps, China fielded specially trained anti-terrorist teams (Snow Leopard and Blue Sword Commando Units); stepped up surveillance and searches around Olympic venues and in more than a dozen airports around China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang; and deployed anti-aircraft missiles around the National Stadium (dubbed \"the Bird's Nest\") holding the opening ceremony. Chinese officials also designated three public parks close to Olympic venues in Beijing\u2014Zizhuyuan Park, Ritan Park, and Shijie Park\u2014where public protests ostensibly could be held. By the end of the Games, the Government reportedly had approved none of the 77 applications submitted to hold public protests in the parks.  Tibet remained a difficult issue in U.S.-China relations and a matter of debate among U.S. policymakers during the 110 th Congress. Controversy continued over Tibet's current political status as part of China, the role of the Dalai Lama and his Tibetan government-in-exile, and the impact of Chinese control on Tibetan culture and religious traditions. The U.S. government recognizes Tibet as part of China and has always done so, although some dispute the historical consistency of this U.S. position. But the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, has long had strong supporters in the U.S. Congress who have continued to pressure the White House to protect Tibetan culture and give Tibet greater status in U.S. law. It was largely because of this congressional pressure that in 1997, U.S. officials created the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues. Paula Dobriansky, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, who served as the Special Coordinator in the Bush Administration and through the 110 th Congress, was the highest-ranking U.S. official to that point to have held this position. Late in 2006, the 109 th Congress passed legislation to award the Dalai Lama a Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of his international status and accomplishments. The decision was denounced by Beijing as a move that \"seriously interferes with China's internal affairs and damages U.S.-China relations.\" With President Bush in attendance, a move that further raised the profile of the event, the Dalai Lama was awarded the medal during the 110 th Congress in a ceremony on October 17, 2007 in the Capitol Rotunda. In his speech at the ceremony, the Dalai Lama said \"... let me take this opportunity to restate categorically that I am not seeking independence. I am seeking a meaningful autonomy for the Tibetan people within the People's Republic of China.\" In a written appeal directly to the Chinese people on March 28, 2008, the Dalai Lama reiterated that he had \"no desire to seek Tibet's separation [from China]\" ... but that he sought to \"ensure the survival of the Tibetan people's distinctive culture, language, and identity.\" The PRC has considered this approach of the Dalai Lama to be a \"sidetrack to independence.\" On March 10, 2008, a series of demonstrations began in Lhasa and elsewhere in Tibetan regions of China to mark the 49 th anniversary of an unsuccessful Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Although reports differed on the details, the 2008 demonstrations appeared to begin peacefully with a small group demonstrating in the Barkhor Plaza in front of the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. According to one report, the protestors at this event were arrested, and Buddhist monks from the Drepung, Sera, and Ganden monasteries around Lhasa then began protesting the arrests. These demonstrations also were contained by security forces. Both the protests and the response of the PRC authorities escalated in the ensuing days, spreading out from the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) and into parts of Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai Provinces populated by Tibetans. By the afternoon of March 14, 2008, in the absence of an apparent response by PRC security forces, mobs of angry people were burning and looting businesses and other establishments in downtown Lhasa. Although official Chinese reports later stated that large caches of weapons had been found in Lhasa's monasteries, a special report shown on China's official state television, China Central Television (CCTV) showed no weapons being used by protesters other than fists, rocks, and the occasional knife. The CCTV report began its account of the protests with the violence on March 14, 2008, when rioters began rampaging in Lhasa; the television account made no mention of any peaceful protests or arrests in the preceding days. Reports differed on the numbers and identities of those killed during the initial demonstrations. By March 31, 2008, official PRC sources reportedly claimed that 18 had died, while the Tibetan government-in-exile reportedly claimed 140 had died. Based on numerous and sometimes sketchy reports, the dead included both Tibetans and ethnic Han Chinese merchants, some of the former reportedly having been shot by police, and some of the latter reportedly having died in their establishments in fires set by the mob. According to news reports, on March 16, 2008, the TAR government declared a \"people's war\" in Tibet\u2014a term from revolutionary Maoism\u2014ostensibly to eradicate support for the Dalai Lama and stamp out the aspirations of some Tibetans for independence. The demonstrations resulted in a greatly enhanced presence of PRC security forces in Tibetan areas. By some reports, security forces beginning in late March 2008 conducted house-to-house searches for those that may have been involved in the demonstrations. According to one report, Burma turned over to China two Tibetan political activists who were said to have fled into Burma from China's Yunnan Province after demonstrations there. Although Beijing sealed off Tibet to tourists and foreign reporters (with the exception of a few selected groups of journalists), sketchy reports continued to suggest that isolated demonstrations in Tibetan areas of China recurred during the enhanced security presence. March is one of the two months (the other being October) that are especially\u2014and for many Tibetans, unhappily\u2014symbolic months of Chinese rule. March 10 marks the anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising in 1959, and October 7 marks the anniversary of the PRC invasion of Tibet in 1950. Outside China, Tibetan groups proceeded with other commemorations of the 1959 Tibetan National Uprising. As he has for many years on the anniversary date, the Dalai Lama gave a speech in 2008 in which he expressed fear for the welfare of the Tibetan people and criticized the Chinese government for \"unimaginable and gross violations of human rights, denial of religious freedom, and the politicization of religious issues.\" He used the occasion of the speech also to reiterate his support for Beijing's hosting of the August 2008 Olympic Games, and to urge Tibetans to work \"peacefully and within the law\" to ensure their legitimate rights as citizens of the PRC. On the same date, other Tibetan exiles began a protest march into Tibet from Dharamsala, India, reportedly to increase pressure on Beijing to improve the situation in Tibet. Tibetan supporters, among other groups, also took part in disruptions of Beijing's ambitious Olympic Torch Relay in the months preceding the Games, particularly in Paris and London.  A new Tibetan activist grouping appeared to begin on January 4, 2008, when five Tibetan organizations outside China launched the Tibetan People's Uprising Movement (TPUM) to engage in \"direct action to end China's illegal and brutal occupation of [Tibet].\" The organization announced that it was seeking to take advantage of two approaching historic moments: the Beijing Olympics in August 2008 and the coming 50 th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. Among the group's stated demands were: the Dalai Lama's return to Tibet as its sole leader; the end of China's \"colonial occupation\" of Tibet; release of all Tibetan political prisoners and restoration of religious and human rights to Tibetans; and cancellation of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Controversy also was generated by reports of differing media coverage of the March 2008 demonstrations in Tibet, with PRC officials charging that western media coverage was biased. On March 21, 2008, a PRC web log, with disturbingly inflammatory language, was established purporting to show this media bias. The site reproduced videos shot by observers in Lhasa showing the violence of the riots; discussed news photos cropped in ways some said were misleading; and cited errors in news stories, captions, and photos in which police in Nepal and India, roughing up Tibetan demonstrators, appeared with written descriptions of PRC police actions in Lhasa. Tibetan supporters countered that PRC accounts made no mention of the days of peaceful demonstrations preceding the riots, and that Chinese press reports focused on reportage of the Han Chinese victims to the riots. During the March 2008 demonstrations, official PRC reports routinely referred to diverse Tibetan organizations outside Tibet as the \"Dalai clique,\" suggesting that all these groups were controlled and directed by the Dalai Lama and thereby represented his views and effectively were acting on his behalf. The PRC alleged that the agenda of some of these groups proved that the Dalai Lama has never renounced his dream of an independent Tibet. The PRC's Ministry of Public Security (MPS) asserted that it \"had gathered sufficient evidence\" showing that the March 2008 unrest in Lhasa and elsewhere \"was organized, premeditated, masterminded and instigated by the Dalai clique and its 'Tibet independence' forces.\" According to a PRC official, \"The [Lhasa] incident has once more exposed the separatist essence and the hypocrisy and deceitfulness of the alleged \"peace\" and \"nonviolence\" of the Dalai clique.\" Two decades earlier, the PRC had used similar language to refer to the widespread demonstrations in Tibet from 1987-1989: \"We have conclusive evidence to show that the Lhasa riot early this month was instigated and engineered by the Dalai Separatist clique.\" Other PRC references to the Dalai Lama in 2008 were more venomous. On March 18, 2008, the Communist Party Secretary of Tibet called the Dalai Lama \"a jackal and wolf clothed in [a monk's robes], and a vicious devil who is a beast in human form.\" For years there has been growing speculation about what happens upon the death and (according to Buddhist tradition) the subsequent reincarnation of the current Dalai Lama (the 14 th ), who turned 73 in 2008. In 2007, Beijing took steps designed to assure its future control over the selection process. On August 3, 2007, the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA) issued a set of regulations, effective September 1, 2007, requiring prior government approval for all Tibetan Buddhist reincarnations through the submission of a \"reincarnation application.\" In a statement accompanying the regulations, SARA called the step \"... an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living Buddhas.\"  The Dalai Lama's Special Envoy, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, described the new regulations as a blow against \"the heart of Tibetan religious identity.\" The regulations also required that reincarnation applications come from \"legally registered venues\" for Tibetan Buddhism\u2014a provision seen as an attempt to illegalize the reincarnation of the current, 14 th Dalai Lama, who has declared he will not be reborn in China if circumstances in Tibet remain unchanged. In the aftermath of the adoption of the 2007 reincarnation law, the Dalai Lama also said that he was thinking of alternative ways of choosing his successor, including selecting a candidate before his own death. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman responded to these comments by saying that such a move would \"violate religious rituals and historical conventions of Tibetan Buddhism.\" The new reincarnation law inserted the PRC government directly into what for centuries has been one of the principal mystical and religious aspects of Tibetan Buddhism. One of the responsibilities of the U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibet is to encourage negotiations and other contacts between the PRC government and the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile. Under the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (Section 613 of P.L. 107-228 ), the Coordinator is to issue an annual report on her office's activities and on the status of any Sino-Tibetan negotiations. A report submitted by Under Secretary Dobriansky, dated June 2007, found grounds for limited optimism on Sino-Tibetan contacts, but raised questions about whether the momentum could be sustained. In addition to this report, the Under Secretary's office is responsible for submitting the annual State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, mandated by Sections 116(d) and 502(B)(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The section on China specifically includes separate accounts for Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau. Two such reports were issued during the 110 th Congress: on March 6, 2007 and on March 11, 2008. Both judged the PRC government's human rights record in Tibet to remain very poor, and the 2008 report found that PRC repression in Tibet had increased over the previous year.  Until the March 2008 crackdown, grounds for optimism in Sino-Tibetan talks had been raised slightly by a set of recurring interactions between the PRC government and delegations from the Tibetan community led by the Dalai Lama's special envoy in the United States, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari. In these negotiations, the Dalai Lama's special envoy acknowledged differences but also had favorable reactions to the talks, saying \"Our Chinese counterparts made clear their interest in continuing the present process and their firm belief that the obstacles can be overcome through more discussions and engagements.\" Progress appeared to stall in 2008, however, with the 8 th round of Sino-Tibetan negotiations (held in October 2008) resulting in no developments. The stalemate led the Dalai Lama to call an unusual meeting of Tibetan exiles in Dharamsala. The group began meeting on November 17, 2008, reportedly to explore new strategies for the Tibetan movement with respect to China. The earthquake in Sichuan Province on May 12, 2008, measured at a magnitude of 7.9, is estimated to have killed more than 69,000 people, with hundreds of thousands more injured and 5 million estimated to be homeless. The quake zone was in a mountainous area that is home to over 15 million people (the entire province has over 81 million people) and some of China's most scenic areas. The quake zone occurred along the Longmenshan Fault and included the Wolong National Nature Reserve, China's primary breeding center for the giant panda. After initial reluctance, the PRC government allowed extraordinarily broad journalistic coverage of the quake zone and for the first time asked for and accepted foreign assistance. The tragedy brought world sympathy to China and a positive assessment of the government's swift and unusually open response, muting criticism of the government's crackdown in Tibet in March 2008. Many children died in collapsed schools, a special hardship in a country that enforces a \"one-child\" policy. Some speculated that public reaction to the quake may force the government to conduct widespread investigations of shoddy school construction practices and may increase pressure on Beijing to reassess the country's population control policies. Both the House and Senate in the 110 th Congress adopted resolutions expressing condolences and support for the quake victims ( H.Res. 1195 and S.Res. 569 ); the Senate measure in addition called for U.S. support for humanitarian aid. Since the quake knocked out communications and damaged roads into the quake zone, officials could only estimate initial casualty figures\u2014a number they put at 10,000 on May 12, 2008. This figure rapidly escalated as rescue workers and journalists reached the area. According to official estimates as of August 2008, the quake killed 69,222 people, injured 374,638, and left 18,176 missing. In addition to the dead and injured, about 5 million were left homeless and about 15 million were estimated to have been displaced. Some of these lost their homes outright due to quake activity, either in the main earthquake of May 12, 2008, or in the thousands of following aftershocks. Others were evacuated multiple times due to warnings of landslides, further quakes, or potential flooding from 35 so-called \"quake lakes\" that developed after the quake\u2014rivers blocked by debris and massive landslides that became lakes behind the blockages. Officials also were concerned about 69 reservoirs left in danger of collapse, with an additional 310 judged to be \"highly dangerous.\"  According to China's official news agency, there were 1,044 villages in the quake zone, many with substantial damage. In addition, Chinese sources cited 14,207 business and industrial enterprises in the quake zone, estimating that direct property damage to these was 67 billion yuan ($9.6 billion), with an additional 15 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) in damage to transportation infrastructure. Relatively little of these losses were covered by insurance. Other risk assessment groups gave different estimates ranging from $10 billion to $20 billion. In the weeks after the quake, China began accepting foreign assistance. According to USAID, the U.S. Government provided $4.9 million in FY2008 humanitarian funding, including $2.7 million provided by USAID and $2.2 million provided by the U.S. Department of Defense. Private American assistance supplemented U.S. Government assistance in the aftermath of the quake, including donations from the National Zoo, the San Diego Zoo, the American Red Cross, and others. The Philadelphia Orchestra, in Beijing to perform a concert on June 2, 2008, turned the occasion into a charitable event to raise funds for Sichuan earthquake relief. The PRC Embassy in Washington DC hosted a reception on August 12, 2008, entitled \"Sichuan Earthquake: Relief, Recovery, and Reconstruction\" in appreciation of U.S. public and private aid. One point of contention in the earthquake zone was how badly some elementary and middle schools seemed to fare. The earthquake occurred in the middle of the school day, so schools were filled with students, making the buildings' collapse especially lethal. Some news coverage featured photos of collapsed schools standing between two other lightly damaged buildings. Grieving parents and family members pointed out that government buildings seemed to hold up well, and asserted that the schools had shoddy construction because of official corruption and use of cheap materials. According to others, school design may have been a contributing factor, with large classrooms (accommodating 70 or 80 students) having insufficient wall support given their size. Unregulated work, outdated building codes, and lack of enforcement of existing codes also were cited. The loss of children was a special hardship in a country that enforces a \"one-child\" policy. Some speculated that public reaction to the quake may force the government to reassess the country's population control policies. Local population officials in Sichuan Province announced on May 27, 2008 that parents who lost an only child in the earthquake could apply for legal permission to have another. On June 6, 2008, Xinhua announced that medical teams in Sichuan would offer reverse sterilization surgery for women who had lost their only child in the quake. Although Chinese authorities were praised worldwide for their rapid response to the earthquake and their unprecedented willingness to permit widespread press coverage, they were more vulnerable on the question of school collapses. In the weeks after the quake, parents and others in the quake zone called increasingly for government investigations into the school collapses and for harsh punishment in cases where official malfeasance may have contributed to the tragedy. Some parent groups organized to bolster their strength and place increasing pressure on the government. In the beginning, there was widespread media coverage of parents' concerns, with local and central government authorities promising investigations and stern punishment for anyone found liable. But Chinese authorities adopted a tougher stance over time, issuing new directives prohibiting the news media from raising questions about school construction. On June 4, 2008, police in Dujiangyan surrounded a group of parents protesting school construction practices and prevented them from filing a lawsuit with the courts over the collapse of a middle school. With the departure of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in December 2006, the 110 th Congress saw important changes in the senior levels of U.S. military leadership, with attending consequences for the U.S. position in the Pacific and toward China. In addition to Defense Secretary Robert Gates (sworn in on December 18, 2006), other new U.S. senior defense officials appointed during the 110 th included: Admiral Timothy Keating (Commander, U.S. Pacific Command beginning March 26, 2007); Admiral Mike Mullen (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff beginning October 1, 2007); and Admiral Gary Roughead (Chief of Naval Operations beginning September 29, 2007). Each of these military officers had gone on record as pledging to make closer U.S. relations with China's military a top priority. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in the executive branch and in the 110 th Congress continued to voice private and public concerns about China's expanding military budget and issues potentially involving U.S. national security. U.S. security concerns included the ultimate focus of China's military build-up; lack of PRC military transparency; recurring instances of apparent PRC attempts to gain U.S. military secrets; evidence of improving PRC military and technological prowess; and PRC military and technological assistance to rogue states and other bad actors.  Issues involving allegations of PRC espionage in the United States continued to concern the 110 th Congress. On March 27, 2007, Mr. Chi Mak, a Chinese-born U.S. engineer arrested in 2005, went on trial in federal court in Los Angeles for allegedly providing China with sensitive high-tech Navy weapons technology that he had helped develop while working for his employer, Power Paragon. According to the allegations, the technology included sensitive details about the Navy's Aegis-class battleship technology; quiet drive technology for new generations of warships; electro-magnetic artillery; and missile detection and nuclear defense. The defense maintained that the material was not classified but was in the public domain. According to a U.S. counterintelligence official, Mak had secured a job with a U.S. defense contractor twenty years earlier as part of a long-time, systematic PRC plan to \"steal secrets.\" On May 11, 2007, Chi Mak was found guilty of conspiracy to violate export regulations and for failing to register as a Chinese agent. Mak was sentenced to 24 \u00bd years in federal prison on March 24, 2008. The Pentagon released two congressionally mandated reports on China's Military Power during the 110 th Congress: one in May 2007, and one in March 2008. In the latest of these, the Pentagon concluded that China was greatly improving its military, including the number and capabilities of its nuclear forces. U.S. military planners and other American military specialists maintained that PRC improvements appeared largely focused on a Taiwan contingency and on strategies to \"deny access\" to the military forces of a third party\u2014most probably the United States\u2014in the event of a conflict over Taiwan. The report maintained that this build-up posed a long-term threat to Taiwan and ultimately to the U.S. military presence in Asia. In March 2007, after Beijing announced that its military budget would increase during the year by nearly 18%, U.S. officials called China's military build-up a continuing \"source of concern and interest\" for the world, and urged PRC leaders to address these concerns by adopting greater transparency in military matters.  On January 11, 2007, the PRC carried out its first successful anti-satellite (ASAT) test by destroying one of its moribund orbiting weather satellites with a ballistic missile fired from the ground. Previously, only the United States and the Soviet Union had conducted successful ASAT tests. Both countries reportedly halted these more than 20 years ago because of resulting space debris that could endanger other orbiting satellites. U.S. officials reportedly received no advance notice from Beijing, nor did Chinese officials publicly confirm the ASAT test until January 24, 2007, 13 days after the event and almost a week after the U.S. Government had publicly revealed the PRC test on January 18, 2007. The January PRC ASAT test and the lack of advance notification to U.S. officials by Beijing raised a number of concerns for U.S. policy. Chief among these were questions about the new potential vulnerability of U.S. satellites\u2014crucial for both U.S. military operations and a wide range of civilian communications applications\u2014and the credibility of PRC assertions that it is committed to the peaceful use of space. In addition, officials from the United States and other countries criticized China for either ignoring or failing to realize the extent of the test's contributions to the growing problem of space debris. China's ASAT test helped illustrate the country's ambitious and growing space program. In the 21 st century, China had become only the third country, after Russia and the United States, to send manned flights into space\u2014the first on October 15, 2003 (Shenzhou 5), with a single astronaut orbiting the earth; the second on October 11, 2005 (Shenzhou 6), orbiting two astronauts; and the third with three astronauts (Shenzhou 7) on September 25, 2008 after the 2008 Olympic Games. This latter mission included a space walk and the reported release of a small \"companion\" satellite into orbit, a move reportedly with potential military implications. Meanwhile, completed the first stage of its three-stage lunar program on October 24, 2007, launching its first unmanned lunar probe, the Chang'e 1 orbiter, aboard a Long March 3A rocket. Among other accomplishments, the PRC in September 2008 also launched two new environment and disaster monitoring satellites from its Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi Province.  U.S.-China military relations, which once had been suspended following the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, continued to improve during the 110 th Congress. On November 4, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates arrived in Beijing for a three-day visit, his first official visit to China as Secretary. He met with his counterpart, Defense Secretary Cao Gangchuan, with Central Military Commission Vice-Chairmen Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, and with Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo. Both sides announced they had reached agreement on setting up an official military hotline; strengthening dialogue and exchanges, particularly between young and middle-aged military officers; and holding exercises on humanitarian rescue and disaster relief. The Secretary also reportedly raised the issue of China's January 2007 anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon test as well as the need for greater PRC transparency about its military intentions and the modernization of its military forces. PRC concerns reportedly centered on Taiwan. In addition to the 2007 visit by Secretary Gates, other senior-level military contacts during the 110 th Congress included: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Peter Pace (to China in March 2007); Commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific (PACOM) Admiral Timothy Keating (to China in May 2007 and again in January 2008); and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs-nominee, Admiral Michael Mullen (to China in August 2007). In addition, U.S. and PRC military officials held the ninth round of the Defense Consultative Talks (DCT) from December 3 \u2013 4, 2007. According to an official DoD news release, the DCT resulted in the two sides agreeing \"to increase military-to-military ties\" and to seek a \"proposed dialogue on nuclear policy, strategy and programs\"\u2014a move that would require congressional action, as U.S.-China talks on nuclear operations are banned under P.L. 106-65 , the National Defense Authorization Act of 1999. Finally, the U.S. military provided assistance to China in the aftermath of the Sichuan earthquake in May 2008.  For a brief period beginning on November 20, 2007, the PRC government denied the requests of a series of U.S. military ships and aircraft to visit or take refuge in the port of Hong Kong\u2014a series of decisions revealed piecemeal over the course of a week or so. While this was not the first time China had denied Hong Kong port-visits to U.S. military vessels, the sequencing, rapidity, and lack of explanation offered concerned U.S. military officials. The first denial was to two U.S. minesweepers, the Patriot and the Guardian, that reportedly requested refuge in Hong Kong harbor on November 20 from a storm at sea. U.S. Navy officials described Beijing's refusal to offer safe harbor to ships in trouble at sea as the more troubling refusal. Admiral Timothy Keating said of it: \"That is behavior that we do not consider consonant with a nation who advocates a peaceful rise and harmonious relations.\" The November 20 denial was followed on November 21 by the denial of a port visit to the Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier strike group for a Thanksgiving reunion with family, many of whom reportedly had flown to Hong Kong from the United States for the holiday reunion. This denial just as unexpectedly was reversed the following day but, according to the U.S. Navy, only after the Kitty Hawk had left Hong Kong waters to return to its home port in Japan. At the same time, Beijing also denied the request for a New Year's holiday port visit by a U.S. Navy frigate, the Reuben James. Navy officials later also said that the PRC had denied landing rights to a C-17 U.S. Air Force cargo plane scheduled to make its quarterly re-supply run to the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong. The port visit denials appeared to catch U.S. military officials by surprise and produced mixed and confusing responses from PRC officials. To many, the sudden tensions were especially troubling given the greatly improved atmosphere in U.S.-China military relations since the departure late in 2006 of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who was seen to be tough on China. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had just visited China earlier in November 2007. Although the denials were troubling, they apparently were insufficient to derail the U.S.-PRC Defense Consultative Talks (DCT), which proceeded on schedule at the Pentagon on December 3-4, 2007.  Unraveling the sequences of events surrounding the port-access denials suggested that multiple factors may have been in play. China's first public reference to any U.S. ship visits to Hong Kong came after the Kitty Hawk had been turned away. On November 22, 2007, with no explanation of why Beijing the previous day had denied the request, a Foreign Ministry spokesman announced that China now had decided to allow the Kitty Hawk visit \"out of humanitarian considerations.\" A White House spokesperson later told reporters that China's Foreign Minister, Yang Jiechi, had assured President Bush at a White House meeting that the Kitty Hawk incident was a \"misunderstanding.\" A U.S. Government analysis suggested that \"a lack of coordination between the PLA and other government agencies may have been a factor in China's contradictory behavior.\" Several days later, a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman denied there had been a misunderstanding, saying the U.S. bore responsibility for sending the Kitty Hawk back to Japan. On November 28, 2007, a Pentagon official reportedly called in China's defense attache in Washington DC to protest the denial of safe refuge to the two minesweepers. The following day, a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking about the Kitty Hawk only, said that China had received no U.S. protest. Spokespersons for the White House and the State Department as late as November 29 said they were awaiting clarification from Beijing about the reasoning behind the decision. Admiral Keating called the Chinese decisions \"perplexing.\" According to the U.S. Navy Office of Legislative Affairs, the Kitty Hawk had requested a Hong Kong port visit on October 23, 2007 in a phone call to the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), following it up on October 24, 2007 by a diplomatic note faxed to the MFA. Having had no response by November 21, the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong called the MFA at 4:30 pm to ask about the request's status; one hour later, according to the U.S. Navy, the MFA informed the consulate the request had been denied. Over 20 hours later on November 22, MFA called the U.S. consulate to reverse the denial. By then, according to the U.S. Navy, the Kitty Hawk already was on its way to Japan. On December 3, 2007, the PRC Embassy in Washington, DC provided the following statement concerning the Kitty Hawk decision: In mid November just before Thanksgiving, the Chinese side was informed that the officers and men on board USS Kitty Hawk and its accompanying ships urgently requested to dock at Hong Kong for family reunion. Out of humanitarian considerations, the Chinese side agreed to allow USS Kitty Hawk and its fleet access to Hong Kong harbor for the purpose of resting. As for why the US naval ships did not go to Hong Kong afterwards, it was the US business. The Chinese position on the port call at Hong Kong by USS Kitty Hawk carrier group is impeccable. The US side is completely clear about the entire process of the matter. One possible explanation is that the PRC may have denied the ship visits to signal opposition to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The original denial of safe refuge to the two minesweepers on November 20 coincided with publication of a U.S. announcement of a proposed arms sale to Taiwan for upgrade and refurbishment of PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Guided Missiles. Beijing repeatedly objects to such arms sales as a violation of Sino-U.S. communiques on Taiwan, and the denial of U.S. ship visits to Hong Kong could have been intended as a signal. Some find symbolic justification for this reasoning in the route that the U.S. carrier strike group took back to Japan\u2014through the sensitive area of the Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and the PRC, ostensibly because of weather conditions. (The PRC conveyed \"grave concern\" to the United States over the ship transit.) But symbolic protests usually are advertised as such, and PRC spokespersons made no mention of any difficulties in U.S.-China relations in the days immediately surrounding the denials. PRC spokespersons brought up the matter of difficulties in U.S.-China relations only later, on November 29\u2014mentioning U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the congressional gold medal awarded to the Dalai Lama\u2014without linking the ship denials with these events. A second explanation involved unannounced, large-scale military exercises reportedly being held by China's East and South China Sea fleets from November 16-23, 2007, possibly involving new stealth technologies. According to news accounts, the exercises were conducted east of Taiwan and north of the Philippines, and involved the PRC's Nanjing and Guangzhou military regions\u2014circumstances judged by some to be exercises for a possible use of military force against Taiwan. Media in Hong Kong reported that the maneuvers included sudden and unexpected air restrictions in southern China that caused significant delays for airline passengers in the region. One account reported that the Kitty Hawk may have been in the region to monitor the PRC exercises. According to another, the PRC ships conducting the exercises may have had a \"chance encounter\" with the Kitty Hawk carrier strike group. If so, it would not have been the first such encounter; it was the Kitty Hawk and its carrier strike group that a PRC submarine surfaced close to in November 2006, apparently having evaded the strike force's surveillance systems.  Economic and trade issues remained an extremely complicated set of issues in the U.S.-China relationship. During the 110 th Congress, the PRC was the second-largest U.S. trading partner, with total U.S.-China trade in 2007 at $387 billion. Issues the 110 th considered in U.S.-China economic relations included the substantial and growing U.S. trade deficit with China (which climbed to $256 billion in 2007 and was projected to hit $267 billion in 2008), repeated PRC inabilities to protect U.S. intellectual property rights, and the PRC's continuing restrictive trade practices, such as its exchange rate policies. The end of the 110 th Congress also saw the end of the World Trade Organization (WTO) clothing and textile safeguards mechanism available to other WTO members against Chinese clothing and textile products. The safeguards mechanism ended on December 31, 2008. (Issues involving allegations about tainted or faulty PRC exports to the United States and about the global financial crisis are dealt with elsewhere in this report.)  During the 110 th Congress, on September 29, 2007, the PRC established its chief sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation (CIC), with $200 billion in initial capital. According to PRC officials, the purpose of the fund was to manage and invest the country's huge pool of foreign exchange reserves more profitably. U.S. observers and Members of Congress raised concerns that the fund's establishment signaled that PRC officials were interested in changing their strategy of investing in U.S. Treasurys and other government securities, and that such a change could inflict more damage on the already weakened U.S. economy and financial markets. The CIC's establishment also raised concerns that it would provide the PRC with a significant new \"soft power\" tool, raising China's global geopolitical clout and influence accordingly. The U.S. Treasury Department released four congressionally mandated, semi-annual reports on international exchange rates during the 110 th Congress: in June and December 2007, and in May and December 2008. In general, all of these reports concluded that China's economy was out of balance\u2014overly dependent on exports and with weak consumer spending at home. The Treasury reports prompted renewed calls and legislation in the 110 th Congress for firmer U.S. action to mitigate the effects of China's currency restrictions. The U.S. concern about the PRC's decision to keep the value of its currency low had been building for several years. Until 2005, the PRC pegged its currency, the renminbi (RMB), to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 8.3 RMB to the dollar\u2014a valuation that many U.S. policymakers concluded kept the PRC's currency artificially undervalued, making PRC exports artificially cheap and making it harder for U.S. producers to compete. U.S. critics of the PRC's currency peg urged Beijing either to raise the RMB's value or to make it freely convertible subject to market forces. On July 1, 2005, the PRC changed this valuation method, instead announcing it would follow a \"managed float\" policy for the RMB using a basket of multiple other currencies. By the end of 2008, the RMB had appreciated by about 20% against the dollar, but this was not sufficient to assuage ongoing U.S. congressional concerns. In the 110 th Congress, multiple measures were introduced addressing currency exchange rate issues. These measures, none of which was enacted, included: The Fair Currency Act of 2007: To provide that artificial exchange rates by any country are countervailable export subsidies. ( H.R. 782 ; S. 796 ) The Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2007: To extend the applicability of U.S. countervailing duty laws to non-market as well as to market economies. ( H.R. 1229 ) The Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2007: To provide for identification and corrective action against \"misaligned currencies\" that adversely affect U.S. interests. ( S. 1607 ) The Currency Reform and Financial Markets Access Act of 2007: To require the U.S. Treasury Secretary to analyze the exchange rate policies of foreign countries on an annual basis. ( S. 1677 ) Reflecting legislation that had been introduced and considered by the House Ways and Means Committee the previous month ( H.R. 1229 ), on March 20, 2007, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a preliminary decision to apply countervailing duties (an anti-subsidy remedy) to two PRC companies exporting \"coated free sheet\" (glossy) paper to the United States. The announcement broke with a 23-year U.S. policy, adopted in 1984, which held that \"subsidies\" within the context of U.S. countervailing duty laws cannot be found in non-market economies such as China. Citing a 177% increase in imports of PRC glossy paper products from 2005-2006, Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez said that the PRC economy had evolved significantly in the last two decades and that U.S. tools to address unfair competition needed to evolve in response. The move signaled a new U.S. willingness to be assertive in challenging PRC trade policies and suggested that other American industries affected by the PRC's exports, such as textile, steel, and plastics, may seek similar remedies. Beijing's sharp criticism of the U.S. move hinted at potential future trade retaliation and possible negative implications for the ongoing U.S.-China \"Strategic Economic Dialogue,\" which was chaired by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson under the Bush Administration. One of the most important issues in U.S.-China bilateral trade during the 110 th Congress was China's inability to live up to its World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments to protect intellectual property rights (IPR). According to the International Intellectually Property Rights Alliance (IIPA), IPR piracy in China cost U.S. firms $3.5 billion in lost sales in 2007. U.S. officials during the 110 th Congress routinely urged Beijing to crack down on IPR piracy, and a series of U.S. officials visiting China stressed that China needed to do better at IPR protection. In addition, the United States filed two IPR cases against China in the WTO in 2007 which remained outstanding at the end of the 110 th Congress: a case charging that China had failed to enforce IPR laws; and a case that China had failed to provide sufficient market access to IPR-related products. The United States maintains dozens of bilateral dialogues with China at various levels and across multiple agencies. The substance of and form that these dialogues will take in the Obama Administration was yet to be determined as of the date of this report. In the months before the 110 th Congress, during the first of his trips to China as Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson announced on September 20, 2006 that he would chair a new senior-level mechanism for bilateral dialogue agreed to by Presidents Bush and Hu, the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED). The SED, Secretary Paulson announced, would be held twice annually so that Cabinet-level officials in both governments could hold regular talks on key issues. According to a background paper from the SED, the purpose of the SED would be to advance U.S.-China economic relations and encourage China's continued economic transition to that of a responsible global player. The more regularized bilateral engagement that continued to characterize U.S.-China relations during the 110 th Congress suggested U.S. recognition of the PRC's growing development and international involvement\u2014what has been called \"China's rise\"\u2014and the growing political clout accompanying it.  The Strategic Economic Dialogue held its second through fifth rounds during the 110 th Congress: in Washington on May 22-23, 2007; in Beijing on December 11-13, 2007; in Annapolis on June 16-18, 2008; and in Beijing on December 4-5, 2008. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry (\"Hank\") Paulson was the U.S. host for all of these rounds. For the PRC, Vice Premier Wu Yi hosted the second and third rounds and Vice Premier Wang Qishan hosted the fourth and fifth rounds. The SED process during the 110 th resulted in multiple bilateral agreements and understandings, and tended to build on and expand past progress at future meetings. Some achievements included: Increasing market access for the United States in China, including for U.S. products and the financial services industry; cooperating on development of new clean coal technology; and strengthening cooperation on intellectual property rights (May 2007) Increasing cooperation on product safety, including drugs, food, chemicals, and consumer products; commitments on further financial reforms; and discussions on energy and environmental cooperation; progress on a bilateral investment treaty; and promoting transparency in administrative rule-making (December 2007) Agreement on a Ten-Year Energy and Environment Cooperation Framework, including establishment of a steering committee to guide cooperation (June 2008) Discussion of strategies to manage macroeconomic risk and address the global financial crisis (December 2008)  The Senior Dialogue (under the State Department), another relatively new bilateral dialogue in the U.S.-China process, held its fourth through the sixth rounds during the 110 th Congress: in Washington in June 2007; in Guiyang in January 2008; and in Washington D.C.in December 2008. For all three, the chief counterparts were U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and PRC State Councilor Dai Bingguo. The Senior Dialogue was first suggested by PRC President Hu Jintao in 2004 during a meeting with President Bush. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and PRC Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo presided over its initial round in Beijing in August 2005. The topics of discussion centered around various foreign policy problems, such as Taiwan, the bombing in Mumbai in 2008, the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, and Iran.  As in previous congresses, Taiwan remained potentially the most sensitive and certainly the most complex bilateral policy issue that U.S. policymakers faced in the 110 th Congress. U.S. policymakers continued strongly to support Taiwan's democracy, but at times were troubled by the confrontational rhetoric and actions that Taiwan's democracy produced. Until May 2008, China watchers had been especially concerned with potential cross-strait conflict because of Taiwan's unpredictable political environment, where the balance of political power had teetered precipitously between two contending political party coalitions of nearly equal strength. One of these was a coalition led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which controlled the presidency for eight years and which was identified closely with advocates of Taiwan independence. This DPP position and the confrontational rhetoric and actions of Taiwan's democratically elected president, DPP member Chen Shui-bian, had complicated U.S. policy throughout much of the George W. Bush Administration. Fears of cross-strait contention were eased during the 110 th Congress on March 22, 2008, when, in a large turnout, voters in Taiwan elected Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Nationalist Party (the KMT) as president. Ma out-polled rival DPP candidate Frank Hsieh by a 2.2 million vote margin of 58% to 42%. Coming on the heels of the KMT's sweeping victory in legislative elections in January 2008, the presidential election result appeared to be a further repudiation of President Chen Shui-bian's record of governance and recently revealed corruption. President Ma, who began his tenure on May 20, 2008, moved quickly to implement improvements in cross-strait relations, expanding on foundations laid by the previous Chen administration. Official talks between China and Taiwan reopened in Beijing on June 11-12, 2008, resulting in groundbreaking new agreements to allow regular weekend direct charter flights, to open permanent offices in each other's territories, and to boost PRC tourism to Taiwan, among other actions. Members of the 110 th Congress acting in support of Taiwan's interests generally sought to improve Taiwan's international standing, ease diplomatic restrictions on Taiwan officials, and support Taiwan's democratic development. General legislation in the 110 th included: H.R. 1390 : legislation requiring Senate confirmation for the position of U.S. director of the American Institute in Taiwan, or AIT. (The bill did not pass.) H.Con.Res. 73 : a measure expressing the sense of Congress that the United States should resume diplomatic relations with Taiwan. (The measure died in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.) S.Con.Res. 48 and H.Con.Res. 136 : measures calling for lifting of restrictions on U.S. visits by senior Taiwan officials. ( S.Con.Res. 48 died in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; H.Con.Res. 136 passed the House by voice vote on July 30, 2007). H.Con.Res. 137 : a measure expressing the sense of Congress that the United States should initiate negotiations on a free trade agreement with Taiwan. (The measure died in the House Ways and Means Committee.) H.Con.Res. 170 : a measure urging the International Olympic Committee to allow Taiwan to participate in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing under a name of its own choosing. (The measure died in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.) On October 3, 2008, the U.S. government notified Congress of its intention to sell a package of defense articles and services, worth as much as $6.4 billion, to Taiwan. The announcement marked the end of a period where no arms sales were made\u2014what some suggested was a U.S. arms sales \"freeze\" to Taiwan prior to the 2008 Olympic Games (as Admiral Timothy Keating appeared to confirm in a briefing on July 16, 2008). Many U.S. policymakers in recent years had grown frustrated with Taiwan's falling military expenditures and its perceived decline in defense readiness. Political disagreements in Taiwan also kept the government from purchasing much of the weaponry President Bush had approved for sale in 2001. Until 2007, these disagreements stalled a special arms acquisition budget that the government had submitted repeatedly to Taiwan's legislature\u2014originally for $18 billion, then slashed to $15 billion and finally to $6.3 billion\u2014in an effort to attract legislative support. Other U.S. officials also appeared frustrated with delays over the special arms budget and raised questions about future U.S. defense commitments to Taiwan if the delays continued. Concerns about Taiwan's defense spending eased throughout 2007. On June 15, 2007, Taiwan's legislature passed an annual defense budget which included funds for portions of the 2001 U.S. weapons package, including funds for P3-C anti-submarine warfare aircraft. The Bush Administration notified Congress on September 12, 2007 of the proposed sale to Taiwan of 12 excess P3-C planes; on November 20, 2007, the Federal Register published the announcement of another proposed arms sale to Taiwan for upgrade and refurbishment of PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Guided Missiles. In December 2007, the Taiwan legislature passed a 2008 defense budget of $10.5 billion, which officials said was a 12% increase over the 2007 budget. The new budget included an allocation for three sets of U.S. Patriot III missiles originally approved for sale by President Bush in 2001, as well as $61.5 million for a feasibility study for the purchase of U.S.-made diesel submarines. Members of the 110 th Congress remained engaged in the question of Taiwan's security and U.S. arms sales. Measures introduced included: H.Res. 676 : A resolution that the United States continue to sell defense articles and services to Taiwan \"based solely\" on Taiwan's defense needs. (The House passed the measure by voice vote on October 2, 2007.) H.R. 3912 /S. 1565 : The Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2007. Among other actions, the bill would have transferred to TECRO (the Taiwan office in the United States) the OSPREY class minehunter coastal ships ORIOLE (MHC-55) and FALCON (MHC-59). (Neither bill was considered by its full respective body.) H.R. 5916 : The Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Reform Act of 2008. The bill found that Taiwan's security would benefit from more intensive U.S.-EU dialogue on continuing the arms embargo against China. (The House passed the bill by voice vote on May 15, 2008, but it was never considered by the full Senate.) H.R. 6646 : The bill would have required the U.S. Government to provide detailed briefings to Congress on discussions with Taiwan about potential arms sales. (The House passed the bill by voice vote on September 23, 2008, but it was never considered by the full Senate.) The new Ma Administration also proved to be more moderate and flexible than its predecessor concerning Taiwan's annual United Nations (U.N.) bid, a bid that remained objectionable to Beijing. On August 14, 2008, Taiwan under the new Ma government submitted a proposal to the U.N. Secretariat via 17 countries with which it maintains diplomatic relationships, asking the U.N. to allow Taiwan to have \"meaningful participation\" in U.N. special organizations. In spite of the new milder tone to Taiwan's bid, the PRC raised objections on August 18, 2008, saying that Taiwan was not qualified to participate in U.N. activities. Because of these objections, on September 19, 2008, a U.N. subcommittee decided not to include Taiwan's request for \"meaningful participation\" in U.N. activities on the agenda for the 63 rd General Assembly. Prior to the bid in 2008, Taiwan had been unsuccessful in 15 previous attempts to gain either membership or non-member status in the U.N., particularly in the World Health Organization (WHO), a U.N. affiliate. Taiwan's efforts under the DPP Administration of President Chen had included an application both for full U.N. membership as well as for use of either the name \"Republic of China\" or \"Taiwan.\" As in past Congresses, there was support in the 110 th for Taiwan's U.N. membership. Resolutions introduced in support of Taiwan's U.N. bid included H.Con.Res. 73 and H.Con.Res. 250 . The House did not take up either measure. U.S. government officials are on record as supporting Taiwan's membership in organizations \"where statehood is not an issue,\" a qualification that seemingly would exclude the U.N. \u00a0During the 110 th Congress, PRC-Taiwan talks resumed for the first time in a decade. In the two months between his election and his inauguration on May 20, 2008, President Ma Ying-jeou spoke of his intentions to begin normalizing cross-strait ties in a \"cross-strait common market,\" to establish direct air links with the PRC, and to ease other restrictions on cross-strait contacts. He sought to ease tensions with China by pledging adherence to a \"three no's\" approach: no unification, no independence, and no use of force\u2014a pledge he repeated in his inaugural address. He called for a \"diplomatic truce\" with China and pledged to stop using \"dollar diplomacy\" to win foreign country recognition. After his inauguration, Ma moved quickly to implement his new cross-strait approach. In an unprecedented move, Taiwan in mid-May worked jointly with the PRC in providing disaster relief after the Sichuan earthquake. By late May, Taiwan had accepted a PRC invitation to resume official talks in Beijing for the first time since October 1998. The chairman of the KMT, Wu Poh-hsiung, met with PRC President Hu Jintao on May 28, 2008, the highest-level encounter between the two sides since 1949. Official talks reopened on June 12-13, 2008, resulting in groundbreaking new agreements to allow weekend direct charter flights and boost PRC tourism to Taiwan. Taiwan also undertook several unilateral initiatives, including: June 26\u2014Taiwan announced a number of financial liberalization measures, including: allowing conversion of the PRC yuan into Taiwan dollars; allowing Chinese companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange to have secondary listings on Taiwan's stock exchange; allowing PRC-backed mutual funds to invest in Taiwan's stock market; and allowing Taiwan brokerage houses to double their investments in PRC counterparts. June 30\u2014Taiwan's Government Information Office announced that two major PRC media outlets would be allowed to station reporters in Taiwan effective immediately. July 8\u2014Taiwan's Ministry of Economics announced it would ease investment restrictions with the PRC in three broad steps over the coming six months: raising the cap on Taiwan companies' investment in the PRC from 40% to 60%; lifting restrictions preventing Taiwan companies in certain sensitive sectors (such as advanced semiconductors) from investing in the PRC; and lifting restrictions preventing PRC companies from investing in Taiwan. Other Taiwan initiatives remained in the discussion stage. President Ma has suggested that Taiwan be more flexible on the names it uses in its international engagement efforts\u2014suggesting, for instance, that Taiwan's negotiation of Free Trade Agreements (FTA's) would be less divisive if Taiwan used the same name it used when applying to the WTO\u2014\"separate customs territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.\" And Taiwan's SEF chairman, Chiang Pin-kung, was reported as having said he wants to study and promote the creation of a cross-strait comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA) with the PRC. In spite of this progress, controversies continued to arise, such as an initial tussle, later smoothed over, about the name that the PRC would use to refer to Taiwan during the 2008 Olympic Games. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense also said that acquiring submarines\u2014a move directed at the PRC\u2014remained a top priority for Taiwan. Supporters of President Ma's new policies were critical that the June 2008 official talks did not go far enough in some instances. Opponents of the new policies, on the other hand, criticized them as proceeding too rapidly, and said that the PRC negotiators at the June 2008 talks were more experienced than their Taiwan counterparts.  China's robust international engagement since 2000 became a subject of increasing interest in the 110 th Congress and prompted growing debate over the PRC's motivations and objectives in its foreign policy. The fact that much of China's international engagement expanded while the United States was preoccupied with its military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan also caused a growing degree of American introspection. Part of the debate included an increasing focus on the implications that China's growing international engagement could have for its \"soft power\" projection around the world, and consequently what this would mean for U.S. economic and strategic interests.  Some fundamental objectives appeared to be motivating Beijing's foreign policy outreach during the 110 th Congress. These included an imperative to promote and enhance China's economic development, particularly its voracious need for energy resources and raw materials to sustain its double-digit annual growth; an effort to separate the island of Taiwan, over which the PRC claims sovereignty, from its 23 remaining official relationships; and a desire to increase China's international stature and compete more successfully with U.S. supremacy. To achieve these ends, China during the 110 th Congress continued to craft multiple bilateral agreements and partnerships; work to resolve outstanding boundary disputes with other countries; join and become more active in existing multilateral organizations; and to seek to create new multilateral institutions that tended to exclude the United States. Beijing resolved a decades-long boundary dispute with Russia. In pursuit of some of these interests in China's growing foreign engagements, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee requested the Congressional Research Service to prepare a study, \"China's Foreign Policy and 'Soft Power' in South America, Asia, and Africa.\"  China's economic development and need for greater energy resources also had a rapidly increasing impact on environmental issues during the 110 th Congress, both within China and for its regional and global neighbors. China's continued heavy dependence on coal made it second only to the United States as the largest contributor to global carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions by the beginning of the 110 th Congress, and Reuters reported on June 20, 2007, that China had surpassed the United States in CO2 emissions. PRC leaders in 2007-2008 continued to recognize that this trend is not sustainable and continued to expand on past efforts to address environmental quality, including adoption of further environmental laws and regulations and mandatory conversion of many government vehicles to non-polluting liquefied petroleum and natural gas. Despite this, Beijing's continued emphasis on economic development during the 110 th Congress adversely affected efforts to address China's extensive and worsening pollution problems. The United States and China engage in energy and environment-related dialogue through the Strategic Economic Dialogue, whose four rounds of meetings during the 110 th are discussed elsewhere in this report.  Although China continued its rapid economic advances and its expanded international influence in 2007-2008, its internal political and institutional development did not keep comparable pace. Increasing social and economic inequities led to growing strains in China's political and societal fabric during the 110 th Congress. These strains were evident between the central government in Beijing and the provincial and municipal governments in the interior; between the socialist left and the increasingly capitalist right; between those arguing for economic growth at all costs and those advocating more sustainable and equitable development; and between the few newly wealthy who have thrived under economic liberalism and the many desperately poor who have not. Leaders in Beijing were seen to be deeply concerned about the political and social implications of these internal strains, with increased debate on and maneuvering around these issues evident in 2007-2008.  In mid-October 2007, the Chinese Communist Party held its 17 th Party Congress\u2014an important Party conclave held every five years to set the policy direction and make leadership decisions for the coming five years. General Secretary Hu Jintao reported that the Party would continue to emphasize its overall goal of economic investment and export-oriented reform, although it would place more importance on encouraging domestic consumption. The Party Congress re-emphasized the current leadership's priority to strive for slightly slower and more balanced growth. The key catch-phrase in Party Secretary Hu's report was to adhere to the \"Scientific Development Concept\"\u2014a concept designed to focus on improvements in people's livelihood, employment, health, national education, renewable energy resources, and environmental quality.  The Party also chose its new leaders for the coming five years. As expected, Party Secretary Hu Jintao was reaffirmed to his leadership role, and he along with five other senior leaders remained on the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), the Party's most authoritative and important entity. Of the four new PSC members, two\u2014Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang\u2014have been tipped as frontrunners to be Hu Jintao's successor as Party Secretary at the 18 th Party Congress in 2012. The two are the only PSC members to have been born in the 1950s, making them the first of the \"fifth generation\" of China's potential leadership to rise to this level. If accepted retirement practices hold true (at age 68), only these two will be young enough to remain in the Politburo of the 18 th Party Congress. The far-reaching economic changes the PRC continued to undergo in 2007-2008 led to increasing disgruntlement among many social groups and to increasing pressure on the central government in Beijing and on provincial and local governments. Many problems during the 110 th Congress were regularly recurring\u2014such as protests by farmers whose land had been confiscated, often with little or no compensation, or the protests of workers whose factories closed without having paid back wages. There were also more unique circumstances, such as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, which provided an opportunity for public dissatisfaction with the PRC government focused on the issue of corruption and shoddy construction that led to more destruction and death than might have occurred with sturdier buildings; or the growing scandals involving tainted food and other consumer products.  Amidst various social upheavals, there also was growing evidence that citizens of the PRC were becoming more assertive about their rights. In mid-May 2007, news accounts reported violent public protests in Guangxi Province (Bobai County) over the \"savage implementation\" of family planning policies by local authorities, including the retroactive imposition of extraordinarily heavy fines and the confiscation or destruction of household goods and food. The \"one-child\" policy was also mentioned in connection with the Sichuan earthquake of May 12, 2008, where the widespread destruction of schools meant that many parents lost their only child.  Social pressure also increased on the government over the unfolding product safety scandals that began in 2007. In response to domestic and international criticism, PRC officials announced the suspension of licenses of factories and companies accused of violating product safety standards. In July 2007, the PRC executed the former head of the State Food and Drug Administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, for accepting bribes to approve sub-standard drugs. In early September 2008, reports began surfacing all over China of dangerously high levels of melamine in domestically produced milk and milk powder, which sickened close to 300,000 infants and children and killed some others. In October 2008, news accounts reported that some PRC families whose babies had been injured by milk laced with melamine had filed suit against one of the companies involved, Sanlu. The same month, Beijing announced the recall of all milk products produced before September 14, 2008, and set the first standards for permissible amounts of melamine in milk (1 milligram per kilogram of infant formula and 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of liquid milk). In late 2008, a series of rolling taxi strikes swept over parts of China, with drivers angry about new licensing fees and growing competition from unlicensed taxis.  Although the PRC government was forced to respond positively to some of this social pressure, it responded more harshly in other cases. For instance, PRC police arrested an activist, Huang Qi, who had advised parents who lost children in the Sichuan earthquake, charging him with \"illegally possessing state secrets.\" The government also maintained and increased its repressive crackdown against Tibetans in the wake of the March 2008 protests in Tibet\u2014in June 2008 effectively disbarring two attorneys, Jiang Tianyong and Teng Biao, who had offered to defend some of the Tibetans charged in the March demonstrations. Authorities also maintained a harsh crackdown against Muslim Uighur \"separatists\"\u2014those in favor of independence from China\u2014in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region in western China. In early January 2007, PRC officials claimed that the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), on the U.S. list of terrorist groups, was the target of a Chinese raid on a suspected terrorism camp in Xinjiang. No details were given, although PRC officials reportedly said that 18 were killed and 17 arrested. In 2008, Uighur groups claimed credit for a series of deadly attacks in China leading up to the Olympic Games, including a May bus bombing in Shanghai which killed three, bombings at a police station in Wenzhou and a plastics factory in Guangzhou on July 17, and bombings of buses in Yunnan on July 21. Although control of the press continued to be an important focus for Beijing, press freedom in China remained higher during the 110 th Congress than it had been in the past. Moreover, the explosive growth of the Internet, cell phones, and text messaging in China has helped make these electronic sources a more dominant source of information for many PRC citizens. Beijing has increasingly viewed these new information sources as potential threats to the central government's ability to control information flows, and in 2005 imposed new rules designed to further limit the type of electronic news and opinion pieces available to the Web-savvy in China. Among other things, the regulations prohibited major search engines from posting their own independent commentary on news stories, stipulating that only opinion pieces provided by state-controlled media may be posted; required Internet service providers to record the content, times, and Internet addresses of news information that is published and to provide this information to authorities upon inquiry; and in vague terms prohibited certain kinds of content from being posted, such as content that \"undermines state policy\" or \"disseminates rumors [and] disturbs social order.\" The regulations are backed by penalties, including fines, termination of Internet access, and possible imprisonment. Some Members of the 110 th Congress took action in a number of cases where U.S. companies appeared to have complied with Beijing's attempts to restrict and police the Internet. In November 2007, House Foreign Affairs Committee Members grilled Jerry Yang and Michael Callahan, executives with Yahoo, about the company's decision to reveal to the Chinese government the name of a journalist who was an e-mail account-holder; the journalist, Shi Tao, subsequently was sentenced to prison for ten years for subversive activities. In another example, on May 20, 2008, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Human Rights Subcommittee held hearings to review the actions of a U.S. company, Cisco, which reportedly had played a role in helping the PRC construct an Internet monitoring system. Judging from data in the 2007-2008 time frame, it may be that Internet and technology usage in China is growing fast enough eventually to outstrip the government's control mechanisms. The state-owned China Internet Network Information Center reported in January 2008 that the number of Internet users alone in China had expanded 53% in 2007 over the previous year, reaching 210 million users by year-end. The Bush Administration generally favored selective, intense pressure on individual human rights cases and on rule of law issues rather than the broader approach adopted by previous American administrations. There was little sign that the U.S. position on human rights has had much effect on PRC policies during the 110 th . There was growing evidence, however, that PRC policies were being forced to respond to increasing domestic social demands for greater accountability, transparency, and responsiveness in government, particularly in cases of official corruption and malfeasance. (Issues of social stability are dealt with elsewhere in this report.) The PRC continued to crack down on unauthorized religious groups in 2007-2008 and to restrict the freedoms of ethnic communities that sought greater religious autonomy. Apart from crackdowns on Tibetans and Muslims, much of this repression focused on what PRC officials classified as illegal religious \"cults\" such as the Falun Gong and the Three Grades of Servants Church.  The U.S. Department of State released congressionally mandated reports on International Religious Freedom in both years of the 110 th Congress. In the China section of its last submission, released September 19, 2008, the Department judged China's record on religious freedom to remain poor and substantially the same as during previous years. The State Administration for Religious Affairs, SARA, (formerly known as the Religious Affairs Bureau, or RAB) continued to require churches to register with the government. Churches that are unregistered, so-called house churches, continued to be technically illegal and often repressed by the government. As in the past, however, treatment of unregistered churches varied widely from locality to locality, with some local officials highly repressive and others surprisingly tolerant. Communist Party officials continued to stress that religious belief is incompatible with Party membership. Because of allegations of coercion in PRC family planning programs, direct and indirect U.S. funding for family planning practices in China remained prohibited during the 110 th Congress in provisions of several U.S. laws. These restrictions included U.S. funding for international and multilateral family planning programs, such as the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), that have programs in China. (Section 660(c) of the House-passed version of H.R. 2764 , the FY2008 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill for FY2008 Department, prohibited funds for a UNFPA country program in China and required a report on the UNFPA China program from the Secretary of State. The House passed the measure on June 21, 2007.)  While the PRC has maintained its restrictive and at times coercive \"one-child\" program for several decades, there have been indications that the government may be re-thinking this policy. Early in 2004, China's new leadership appointed a task force to study the country's demographic trends and their implications for economic development. In October 2004, reports surfaced that Beijing was considering at least one proposal to eventually scrap the one-child policy because of low PRC birth rates and the economic implications this had for supporting China's huge aging population. On January 6, 2005, the director of China's National Population and Family Planning Commission stated that the government intended to modify criminal law to make it illegal to selectively identify and abort female fetuses. There also was growing evidence during the 110 th Congress that citizens of the PRC have become more assertive about their reproductive rights. In mid-May 2007, news accounts reported violent public protests in Guangxi Province (Bobai County) over the \"savage implementation\" of family planning policies by local authorities, including the retroactive imposition of extraordinarily heavy fines and the confiscation or destruction of household goods and food. The \"one-child\" policy also was mentioned in connection with the Sichuan earthquake of May 12, 2008, where the widespread destruction of schools meant that many parents lost their only child. In early December 2008, 303 Chinese intellectuals signed and released a manifesto calling for the institution of broad political reforms, the establishment of real democratic freedoms, and the end of one-party rule in China. Dubbed \"Charter 08,\" (reminiscent of a similar Czechoslovakian manifesto, \"Charter 77\"), the document's release was linked to a number of important anniversaries, including the 60 th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the thirtieth anniversary of the appearance of the \"Democracy Wall\" in Beijing; and the tenth anniversary of China's signing of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In a translation of the forward to the document, the authors stated: ...The Chinese people, who have endured human rights disasters and uncountable struggles..., now include many who see clearly that freedom, equality, and human rights are universal values of humankind and that democracy and constitutional government are the fundamental framework for protecting these values.  By departing from these values, the Chinese government's approach to \"modernization\" has proven disastrous. It has stripped people of their rights, destroyed their dignity, and corrupted normal human intercourse. So we ask: Where is China headed in the twenty-first century? Will it continue with \"modernization\" under authoritarian rule, or will it embrace universal human values, join the mainstream of civilized nations, and build a democratic system? There can be no avoiding these questions. Although PRC police immediately began to interrogate, at times detain, and search the homes of the signatories, Charter 08 continued to attract hundreds of additional supporters who were willing to risk official consequences by signing it as 2008 closed. Its continued circulation and expanding list of signers was a further testament to the growing public pressure being placed on the PRC government for more responsive and representative government.  Introduced as H.R. 6 on January 12, 2007, P.L. 110-140 became the vehicle for omnibus energy legislation, including provisions concerning China contained in H.R. 3221 , introduced by Representative Pelosi. The final Act includes language that authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to take efforts to promote U.S. clean energy technology exports to India, China, and other countries that may benefit. (The legislative journey to the public law has a convoluted history, containing selected provisions from 14 bills, including H.R. 3221 , and three resolutions. The President signed the omnibus measure into law on December 19, 2007.) Introduced as H.R. 2764 by Representative Lowey. The final public law ( P.L. 110-161 ) included provisions requiring U.S. representatives at international financial institutions to support projects in Tibet if they do not provide incentives for non-Tibetan immigration into Tibet; and provided $5 million in ESF funds to NGOs supporting cultural traditions, sustainable development, and environmental protection in Tibet. Section 733 of the enacted bill prohibited a rule allowing poultry products to be imported from China. The final bill also required 15-day prior notification to both Appropriations Committees before processing licenses for the export to China of satellites of U.S. origin; and provided $15 million in democracy assistance funds for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, providing that monies for Taiwan be matched by non-U.S. government sources; and $150,000 for the U.S. Senate-China Interparliamentary Group, to remain available until September 2009. The final bill also prohibited funds for a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) program in China (Section 660(c)). After a complex series of procedural floor motions in December 2007, the bill was sent to the President, who signed it on December 26, 2007. Introduced as H.R. 4986 , Section 1263 of P.L. 110-181 adds a reporting requirement to the Annual Report on Military Power of the People's Republic of China (authorized in P.L. 106-65 ).
