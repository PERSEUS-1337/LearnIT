    "content": "In the first session of the 110 th Congress, the House and the Senate passed two markedly different versions of omnibus energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation. The Senate version of H.R. 6 , the proposed Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 , passed the Senate on June 21, 2007. The key provisions of the Senate-passed H.R. 6 are appliance efficiency standards, an increase of the renewable fuel standard (RFS) to 36 billion gallons by 2022, and an increase of the combined corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards to 35 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2020. Tax provisions and a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) were not included. The House passed H.R. 3221 on August 4, 2007. H.R. 3221 has two divisions. Division A contains the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act , which has nine titles An adopted floor amendment ( H.Amdt. 748 ) added a 15% renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Division B, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007 , contains the House-approved version of H.R. 2776 . It adds four titles to H.R. 3221 that include a four-year extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit and other efficiency and renewables incentives. This report compares the major provisions of the House version of H.R. 3221 , and the Senate version of H.R. 6 . (For more details on the provisions in these two bills, see the appendices to this report. For more details on the legislation that led to the omnibus bills, see CRS Report RL33831, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Legislation in the 110 th Congress . For more details on the tax provisions, see CRS Report RL33578, Energy Tax Policy: History and Current Issues .)

A summary of the Senate-passed version of H.R. 6 is presented in CRS Report RL33831, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Legislation in the 110 th Congress . That report also contains descriptions of all the bills that composed the Senate version of H.R. 6 . An RPS amendment ( S.Amdt. 1537 ) was introduced during Senate floor action on the proposed substitute ( S.Amdt. 1502 ) to H.R. 6 . The RPS amendment proposed setting a target of 15% by 2020. No action was taken on S.Amdt. 1537 before a successful cloture vote on the substitute. That cloture vote caused S.Amdt. 1537 to be ruled non-germane, and it fell from consideration. A package of tax provisions ( S.Amdt. 1704 ) was considered during Senate floor action on the proposed substitute to H.R. 6 . The proposed tax package amendment included oil and natural gas revenue offset provisions, as well as incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency. The proposed revenue offsets were similar to, but more extensive than, the offsets proposed in Title XIII, Subtitle A, of H.R. 3221 . However, S.Amdt. 1704 failed by a vote of 57-36 on a cloture motion to limit debate. (For more details, see CRS Report RL33578, Energy Tax Policy: History and Current Issues .) H.R. 3221 has two divisions. Division A contains the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act , which has nine titles that represent the integration of H.R. 364 , H.R. 2304 , H.R. 2313 , H.R. 2337 , H.R. 2389 , H.R. 2420 , H.R. 2635 , H.R. 2701 , H.R. 2773 , H.R. 2774 , H.R. 2847 , and a draft bill by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Division B, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007 , contains the House-approved version of H.R. 2776 , and adds four titles to H.R. 3221 . A summary of the bill is presented in CRS Report RL33831, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Legislation in the 110 th Congress . That report also contains descriptions of all the bills that composed the House-passed version of H.R. 3221 . One challenge involves key differences between the provisions of the two bills. There are several provisions where the two bills are very similar. One example is energy efficiency standards, where the House and Senate provisions have more similarities than differences. However, especially among the more controversial provisions, many either have major differences or the provision appears only in one bill. One key challenge will be to resolve such differences. A second challenge involves additional action that will be required to get a bill to conference committee. Because the House and Senate have passed different measures, constitutionally-required congressional procedures prevent the two bills ( H.R. 3221 and H.R. 6 ) from going to conference in their current form. Further action will be needed on at least one of the two bills in at least one of the two chambers. For example, one option could be that the Senate takes up H.R. 3221 , amends it however it wishes, and then pass the bill as the Senate version of H.R. 3221 . Then, a conference could be held to resolve any remaining differences between the two versions of H.R. 3221 . A third challenge involves opposition to the bills expressed by the Administration. In a June 12, 2007, Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 6 , the Administration expressed several points of opposition to the Senate bill. Its primary concerns involved issues related to oil and natural gas. The Administration stated that the bill \"does nothing to increase domestic supplies of oil and natural gas.\" Moreover, it threatened to veto the bill if it retained a price gouging provision, which it feels would lead to problematic gasoline price controls. Another veto threat was focused on the proposal to subject foreign oil cartels to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Additional concerns were identified. One concern focused on the explicit 35 mpg fuel economy target in the CAFE provision and the proposal to set standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. For the RFS provision, the Administration strongly urged expansion to include fossil-based alternative fuels. Regarding loan guarantees, the Administration stated opposition to loosening of controls over program size and \"special\" treatment that would allow guarantees for biofuels projects to be increased to from 80% to cover up to 100% of project costs. In an August 3, 2007, Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2776 and H.R. 3221 , the Administration expressed several points of opposition to the House bill. Its primary concerns were focused on oil and natural gas. It stated that because the two bills \"would lead to less domestic oil and gas production, higher energy costs, and higher taxes, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto these bills.\" Other concerns included the proposed repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for the oil and gas industry, the application of royalty requirements for certain offshore oil and gas leases issued in 1998 and 1999, increased authorization for clean renewable energy bonds, and expansion of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements. After the House completed action on H.R. 3221 , informal bipartisan negotiations over the omnibus energy bills began between the House and Senate. Key issues seem to include the RPS provision (Title IX, Subtitle H) in the H.R. 3221 , differences over proposals for increasing the renewable fuels standard (RFS), and a proposal to offset costs by repealing certain oil and natural gas subsidies. In November 2007, EIA issued a report on the impacts of the RPS and oil and gas provisions in H.R. 3221 . On December 1, 2007, the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources stated that the House Leadership's intent to include an RPS led him to cease negotiations. Further, on December 3, 2007, the White House announced that it may veto the negotiated bill, if it includes an RPS, oil tax increases, and certain other provisions. On December 4, 2007, United Press International reported that, in a press conference, DOE Secretary Bodman warned against the inclusion of \"a narrow, one-size-fits-all renewable portfolio standard,\" and said \"taxes should not be raised or tax breaks reversed for the oil and gas sector.\" This report compares the major provisions of the House-passed version of H.R. 3221 and the Senate-passed version of H.R. 6 . Table 1 shows a list of the major provisions that are reviewed in this report. Some provisions are contained wholly under one title or subtitle. For example, the RPS provision in the House bill is contained wholly under Subtitle H of Title IX. However, some provisions are scattered throughout several titles or subtitles. For example, in the House bill, the most extensive provision for loan guarantees is found in Title IX, Subtitle C, but additional provisions for loan guarantees appear under Titles IV (Subtitle E), V, IX (Subtitle A) and IX (Subtitle E). Similarly, Senate provisions for loan guarantees appear in both Title I (Subtitle B), and Title II (Subtitle C). Appendix A. House-Passed Version of H.R. 3221 , Division A: \"New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act\" The proposed New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act ( H.R. 3221 ) is an omnibus energy policy bill that consists mainly of provisions for energy efficiency and renewable energy. It was composed of several bills that were reported from various committees. In House floor action on August 4, 2007, several amendments to H.R. 3221 were adopted, including one that would establish a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS). The House approved the amended bill by a vote of 241-172. Minutes later, the tax provisions bill ( H.R. 2776 ) was approved and then incorporated into H.R. 3221 . A brief description of the provisions in H.R. 3221 and H.R. 2776 follows. Key Provisions Adopted and Absent A description of some key provisions and amendments follows: Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS). H.Amdt. 748 proposed an RPS target that would reach 15% by 2020. Up to 4% of the target could be met with certain energy efficiency measures. The amendment was approved by a vote of 220-190. Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Act ( H.R. 2776 ). This bill proposed extensions and additions of several tax incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency, including a four-year extension of the renewable energy electricity production tax credit. The bill was approved on a separate floor vote by a tally of 221-189. It was subsequently incorporated into H.R. 3221 . Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Proposed Amendment 81 would have increased RFS to 36 billion gallons by 2022. It was withdrawn. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards. Proposed amendments 62 and 95 offered different policies for increasing CAFE standards. Proposed Amendment 95 was withdrawn, and Proposed Amendment 62 was not included in the rule that prescribed floor action. Oil Savings Provisions. Proposed Amendment 36 would have set a goal to reduce imported oil to less than 25% of vehicle petroleum use by 2015. Proposed Amendment 72 would have called for development of a plan to cut U.S. oil use by 2.5 million barrels per day (mbd) by 2016, rising significantly by 2025. Neither Amendment 36 nor Amendment 72 was included in the rule that prescribed floor action. Title I\u2014Green Jobs This title assumes the provisions of H.R. 2947 . It would authorize up to $125 million in funding to establish national and state job training programs, administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, to help address job shortages that are impairing growth in green industries, such as energy efficient buildings and construction, renewable electric power, energy efficient vehicles, and biofuels development.

Subtitle B\u2014Marine Renewable Energy This subtitle assumes the provisions of H.R. 2313 . DOE would be directed to support wave, tidal, current, and ocean thermal energy technology R&D and commercial applications to help expand energy production. Further, DOE would be instructed to award grants to institutions of higher education (or consortia thereof) to establish National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers. On June 21, 2007, the House Committee on Science and Technology reported H.R. 2313 . Subtitle C\u2014Geothermal Energy This subtitle assumes the provisions of H.R. 2304 . DOE's program for geothermal energy R&D, demonstration, and commercial application would be expanded to cover certain advanced concepts. On June 21, 2007, the Committee reported H.R. 2304 . Subtitle D\u2014Solar Energy Part 1 assumes the provisions of H.R. 2774 . It aims to improve the cost and effectiveness of thermal energy storage technologies that could improve the operation of concentrating solar power electric generating plants. Also, it calls for improved integration of concentrating solar power into regional electricity transmission systems. On June 22, 2007, the House Committee on Science and Technology ordered reported H.R. 2774 by voice vote. Part 2 would require DOE to create a Solar Energy Industries Research and Promotion Board and a Solar Energy Research and Promotion Operating Committee. The Board and Committee would work with manufacturers and importers of solar energy products to improve consumer awareness of solar energy options and appropriate certifications. The solar program would be funded by a small portion of industry revenues. No appropriations are authorized. Subtitle E\u2014Biofuels This subtitle assumes the provisions of H.R. 2773 . It aims to improve information about federal biofuels research programs, focus research on infrastructure and biorefineries, study potential impacts of increased biofuels use, and increase authorized funding for DOE biofuels research. An authorization of $25 million would be created to provide grants for biofuels RD&D and commercial applications in states that have low rates of ethanol production. A university-based program would provide grants up to $2 million for R&D on renewable energy technologies. Priority would be given to universities in low income and rural communities with proximity to trees dying of disease or insect infestation. Subtitle F\u2014Carbon Capture and Storage This Subtitle assumes the provisions of H.R. 1933 . A program would be established at DOE for carbon capture and storage R&D and demonstration. DOE would be directed to engage the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a review of the program. EPA would be directed to assess potential impacts of such storage on public health and safety and the environment. DOE would be directed to work with NAS to establish graduate degree programs on geological sequestration at universities. Further, a university-based grant program would be created. Subtitle G\u2014Global Change Research Part 1 would direct the President to establish an interagency committee to coordinate research on global change. The committee would be responsible for developing a national global change research and assessment plan. Further, a U.S. global change research program would be established, with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) serving as the lead agency. A report to Congress would be required to accompany each annual budget request. Part 2 would establish an interagency working group charged with recommending ways to coordinate federal data management and archiving activities for climate data and other global change data. Subtitle H\u2014H-Prize DOE would be directed to conduct a competitive program to award cash prizes to advance R&D, demonstration, and commercial application of hydrogen energy technologies. The provisions of this Subtitle are identical to those of H.R. 632 , which passed the House on June 6, 2007. Title V\u2014Agriculture Energy This title assumes the provisions of H.R. 2419 . Agricultural-based energy programs established by the Farm Security Act of 2002 would be expanded and continued through FY2012. A total of about $3.2 billion in new funding is proposed including $1.4 billion for biofuels production incentives, $800 million to underwrite up to $2 billion in loan guarantees for biorefineries, $420 million for research on biomass feedstocks and production, and new mandatory funding for a cellulosic biomass feedstock reserve. Most new funding would be directed away from corn-based ethanol and toward cellulosic-based biofuels and other new technologies. USDA would be directed improve feedstock flexibility for bioenergy producers by purchasing eligible commodities and selling them to bioenergy producers in a way that ensures no cost to the federal government and avoids forfeitures to the Commodity Credit Corporation. Except for sections 5011 and 5012, all other provisions of Title V are included in H.R. 2419 , the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 , which passed the House on July 27, 2007. (For more background, see CRS Report RL34130, Renewable Energy Policy in the 2008 Farm Bill .) Title VI\u2014Carbon-Neutral Government Act This title assumes the provisions of H.R. 2635 . It would set a goal to make the federal government carbon-neutral by 2050. Several energy and fuel efficiency policies would be undertaken to meet this goal, including standards for federal fleet emissions, green buildings, and agency purchases of renewable energy. Subtitle A\u2014Federal Government Inventory and Management of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Each federal agency would be required to inventory and report on its GHG emissions annually. EPA would be required to review the each agency's inventory to see that it complied with guidance for data collection. EPA would be directed to set a collective annual emission reduction target for each year in the period from 2010 through 2050. The goal would be to achieve zero net annual emissions (carbon-neutrality) by 2050. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) would be required to issue a report on markets for GHG offsets. Federal agencies would be allowed to purchase offsets and renewable energy certificates in open market transactions. This subtitle would not preempt or limit any state actions to reduce emissions. Subtitle B\u2014Federal Government Energy Efficiency Federal agencies would be required to purchase \"low GHG\" vehicles and to procure energy-efficient (Energy Star) products or products designated by the federal energy management program (FEMP-designated). DOE would be directed to establish, by rule, revised federal building energy efficiency performance standards for new federal buildings and major federal building renovations. Relative to a comparable building's fuel use in 2003, buildings covered by the rule would be directed to reduce the share of fossil fuel use by 55% in 2010, reducing steadily to 100% (zero emissions) by 2030. Each federal agency would be required to ensure that a large capital investment in an existing building that is not a major renovation employs the most energy efficient designs, systems, equipment, and controls that are life-cycle cost effective. Federal agencies would be directed to avoid leasing buildings that are not Energy Star rated. Alternative fuels could not be procured if they have GHG emissions greater than those produced by conventional petroleum. Federal contracts for renewable energy could not exceed 30 years and could not include energy generated from municipal solid waste. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) would be required to report annually on progress under Title VI. Subtitle C\u2014Telework Enhancement Federal executive branch agencies would be directed to develop and implement a telework (work from home or close to home) policy for eligible employees. It would exclude those employees who handle secure materials or special equipment, are assigned to national security functions, or voluntarily decline the telework option. Title VII\u2014Natural Resources Committee Provisions This title assumes the provisions of H.R. 2337 . It includes provisions that would regulate wind impacts on wildlife, require a study of transmission capacity to help foster ocean wave, tidal, and current energy projects, create grants for studies of alternative energy development on the outer continental shelf, and establish pilot programs to use federal lands to harvest woody biomass and install concentrating solar power facilities. Subtitle A\u2014Energy Policy Act of 2005 Reforms Subtitle A would repeal subsections 365(g) and 365(i) of EPAct 2005 regarding recovery of permit processing costs. It would require the Secretary of the Interior to impose fees on the oil and gas industry to recover costs associated with the streamlining of permits during the pilot project established by EPAct to improve federal permit coordination. A new 45-day deadline would be imposed for the consideration of applications for permits under section 366 of EPAct 2005. Section 369 of EPAct would be amended by removing two deadlines related to oil shale research and development and the preparation of a final environmental impact statement for commercial oil shale and tar sands leasing on public lands. H.R. 3221 would limit section 390 of EPAct, which allows for a rebuttleable presumption regarding the application of categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for oil and gas exploration and development activities, and adhere to the regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality. And a Best Management Practices (BMP) provision would require BLM to allow for public comment and review before lease stipulation waivers are granted. (More details on Subtitle A can be found in CRS Report RL34111, Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act of 2007, Title VII of H.R. 3221: Summary and Discussion of Oil and Gas Provisions .) Subtitle B\u2014Federal Energy Public Accountability, Integrity, and Public Interest Chapters 1 through 3 would require a minimum of 550 audits annually, and increase fines for royalty payment violations under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA). Surface owner protection would be enhanced under split estates where the federal government owned and leased minerals. Onshore oil and gas reclamation and bonding requirements would become more stringent. Additional requirements for the protection of water resources are included and new fees would be assessed to lessees of federal lands as a disincentive to hold and not develop those lands. (More details on Chapters 1 through 3 of Subtitle B can be found in CRS Report RL34111, Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act of 2007, Title VII of H.R. 3221: Summary and Discussion of Oil and Gas Provisions .) Chapter 4 on Wind Energy would require the Department of the Interior to form a wind turbines guidelines advisory committee to study and recommend guidance for wind energy developers to mitigate the impact of turbines on birds and wildlife. State laws and regulations would not be preempted. Chapter 5 on Enhancing Energy Transmission would direct DOE to study transmission capacity in California, Oregon, and Washington to determine whether it could support new electricity generation from ocean wave, tidal, and current energy projects that could contribute up to 10% of total electricity use in those states. Subtitle C\u2014Alternative Energy and Efficiency A grant program would be created for studies of alternative energy development on the outer continental shelf. The Department of the Interior would be directed to assess and report to Congress on the potential for using leasing of federal lands and other means to help develop rights-of-way and infrastructure along Bureau of Reclamation canals to support solar and wind energy production. A program would be established to research methods for improving the energy efficiency of reverse osmosis technology that is used for water desalination, water recycling, and clean up of water contamination. A pilot program would be created to develop a strategic solar reserve, and would identify and assess potential sites on federal lands for concentrating solar power systems. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would be directed to issue regulations necessary to implement its authority to license offshore thermal energy conversion facilities. A program would be established to use biomass from federal forest lands. Subtitle D\u2014Carbon Capture and Climate Change Mitigation Chapter 1 would direct the Department of the Interior to develop a methodology for an assessment of the national potential for geological storage of carbon dioxide. Chapter 2 would direct the U.S. Geological Survey to estimate the potential for increasing carbon sequestration in natural systems through management measures or restoration activities in each ecosystem. A report to Congress would be required. Chapter 3 would direct the Bureau of Land Management to maintain records on, and an inventory of, the amount of carbon dioxide stored in geological structures on federal lands. A report to Congress would be required that estimates the potential capacity for such storage on federal lands. Chapter 4 would direct the Department of the Interior to establish an interagency National Resources Management Council on Climate Change to address the impacts of climate change on Federal lands, the ocean environment, and the federal water infrastructure. The Council would prepare a national plan that would be presented to Congress. Also, a national policy would be established that directs the federal government to cooperate with state, tribal, and affected local governments, other concerned public and private organizations, landowners, and citizens to use all practicable means and measures to assist wildlife populations and their habitats in adapting to and surviving the effects of global warming. A national strategy would be developed, an advisory board would be formed, and a state and tribal grants program would be established. Chapter 5 would direct the Department of Commerce to develop a national strategy to support coastal state and federal agency efforts to predict, plan for, and mitigate the impacts on ocean and coastal ecosystems from global warming, relative sea level rise, and ocean acidification. Further, it would be directed to develop a coastal climate change resiliency planning and response program to prepare for and reduce the negative consequences that may result from climate change in the coastal zone, and provide financial and technical assistance and training. Also, a National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System would be established to improve the Nation's capability to measure, track, explain, and predict events related directly and indirectly to weather and climate change. Subtitle E\u2014Royalties Under Offshore Oil and Gas Leases This Subtitle would require that the Secretary of the Interior accept a lessee's request to modify certain leases established in 1998 and 1999 without price thresholds (\"covered leases\") to include price thresholds. Lessees holding \"covered leases\" would not be eligible for new oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico unless the covered leases are modified to include price thresholds or the lessee would agree to pay a newly established \"conservation of resources fee.\" The Subtitle would repeal royalty relief provisions established by sections 344 and 345 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ). It would also \"reaffirm\" the Secretary's authority to impose a price threshold in certain leases. This Subtitle is nearly identical to Title II of the House-passed version of H.R. 6 . (More details on Subtitle E can be found in CRS Report RS22567, Royalty Relief for U.S. Deepwater Oil and Gas Leases .) Subtitle F\u2014Additional Provisions Subtitle F would establish an Oil Shale Community Impact Assistance Fund. Also, for certain existing federal leases, it would prohibit surface occupancy for oil and gas drilling on Colorado's Roan Plateau, which is federal land formerly designated as Naval Oil Shale Reserves. (More details on oil and natural gas provisions in Subtitle F can be found in CRS Report RL34111, Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act of 2007, Title VII of H.R. 3221: Summary and Discussion of Oil and Gas Provisions .) Also, the Minerals Management Service would be directed to report to Congress on the status of regulations required by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act with respect to wind energy production on the outer continental shelf. Title VIII\u2014Transportation and Infrastructure This title assumes the provisions of H.R. 2701 . It would promote energy efficient transportation and public buildings and create incentives for the use of alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy. On June 20, 2007, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ordered reported H.R. 2701 by voice vote. Subtitle A\u2014Department of Transportation (DOT) A Center for Climate Change and Environment would be established to plan, coordinate, and implement strategies to reduce transportation-related energy use, mitigate the effects of climate change, and address the impacts of climate change on transportation systems and infrastructure. Subtitle B\u2014Highways and Transit Part 1 provides support for public transportation systems. Federal grants up to 100% of costs would be made available to improve public transportation services that involve fare reductions. For projects that involve acquiring clean fuel or alternative fuel vehicle-related equipment or facilities for the purposes of complying with the Clean Air Act, federal grants would be made available that cover up to 100% of net costs. The Surface Transportation Board's mediation capacity would be expanded to assist public transportation agencies seeking track rights of way with rail carriers. DOT would be directed to create a pilot program to conduct vanpool demonstration projects in three urbanized areas and two non-urbanized areas to increase vanpool use and the number of vanpools in service. Part 2 provides support for federal-aid highways. The federal share for congestion mitigation and air quality (CMAQ) projects would be increased up to 100% of project or program cost. A sense of Congress would be established that in constructing new roadways or rehabilitating existing facilities, state and local governments should employ policies designed to accommodate all users, including motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders, and people of all ages and abilities. Subtitle C\u2014Railroad and Pipeline Transportation Part 1 would direct DOT, in coordination with EPA, to establish and conduct a pilot grant program to assist railroad carriers in purchasing hybrid locomotives, including hybrid switch locomotives, in order to demonstrate the extent to which such locomotives increase fuel economy, reduce emissions, and lower costs of operation.

Appendix B. Senate-Passed Version of H.R. 6 : \"Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act\" The proposed Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 ( H.R. 6 ) is an omnibus energy policy bill that consists mainly of provisions for energy efficiency and renewable energy. The House version of H.R. 6 was amended on the Senate floor. S.Amdt. 1502 , an amendment in the nature of a substitute, replaced the House version with the text of S. 1419 . Several second degree amendments to S.Amdt. 1502 were adopted. The Senate approved the amended bill by a vote of 65-27 on June 21, 2007. Key Provisions Adopted and Rejected A description of some key provisions and amendments follow: Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Section 111 would increase RFS to 8.5 billion gallons per year by 2008, rising to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards. The CAFE standard in Section 502 was modified by S.Amdt. 1792 . The adopted provision proposes increases to the combined average fuel economy standard for cars and light trucks that would reach 35 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2020. This would be an increase of about 10 mpg over current standards. The amendment (as modified by S.Amdt. 1843 ) was adopted by voice vote. Oil Savings Provision. S.Amdt. 1505 established this provision as Section 251. The provision calls for development of a plan to cut U.S. oil use by 2.5 million barrels per day (mbd) by 2016, rising to 10 mbd by 2031, about 35% of projected demand for that year. The amendment was adopted by a vote of 63-30. Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). S.Amdt. 1537 would have added a new title to create an RPS that would reach 15% by 2020. Certain energy efficiency measures would have also been allowed to help fulfill the RPS. The amendment was never considered for a vote and, after a successful cloture vote on S.Amdt. 1502 , the RPS amendment was ruled non-germane. Also, S.Amdt. 1538 would have amended S.Amdt. 1537 to create a 20% \"clean portfolio standard\" that included renewables, efficiency, coal, and nuclear energy. The amendment was tabled by a vote of 56-39. Tax Provisions. S.Amdt. 1704 would have added a new tax title that included some of the provisions for renewables and energy efficiency in S. 1531 . The proposed amendment included a five-year extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit. It also included many provisions for biofuels and some provisions for oil, coal, and vehicles. The amendment failed to achieve cloture by a vote of 57-36, and was subsequently ruled non-germane. A brief summary of each of these eight titles in the Senate-passed version of H.R. 6 follows.

Clean Renewable Energy Incentives Act ( S. 1531 ) The proposed Clean Renewable Energy and Economic Development Incentives Act of 2007 ( S. 1531 ) is an omnibus energy tax policy bill that consists mainly of provisions for renewable energy. It has two titles. Title I proposes Tax Incentives for Energy Conservation and Exploration. Title II proposes Investment Tax Credits with Respect to Solar Energy Property and Manufacturing . On the Senate floor, S.Amdt. 1704 would have added a new tax title that included some of the provisions for renewables and energy efficiency in S. 1531 . The amendment failed to achieve cloture by a vote of 57-36, and was subsequently ruled non-germane. Title I\u2014Tax Incentives for Energy Conservation and Exploration Title I of S. 1531 would extend three existing tax incentives and establish six new ones. Section 101 would extend the renewable energy electricity production tax credit (PTC) for 10 years, to the end of 2018. For certain large facilities, such as geothermal and biomass power plants, credit eligibility could be extended for up to two years after the placed-in-service deadline. Section 102 would extend the clean renewable energy bonds (CREBs) for 10 years. The national total bond limit would be $1.2 billion per year for 2007 through 2008 and $1.0 billion per year for 2009 through 2018. Section 103 would establish a tax credit bond for water conservation. Section 104 would create a 10% investment tax credit for geothermal exploration. For residential installations of small wind equipment, Section 105 would establish a 30% investment tax credit, with a limit of $1,000 per kilowatt (kw). Section 106 would extend for five years the investment tax credit for the construction of new energy efficient homes. Section 107 would create a 20% investment tax credit for manufacturing equipment used to produce advanced batteries. Section 108 would establish renewable school energy bonds, with a national bond limit of $50 million in 2008, $100 million in 2009, and $150 million in 2010. Under Section 109, bonds would be issued to finance new renewable energy facilities, including equipment that uses tidal, wave, current, and ocean thermal energy. Title II\u2014Investment Tax Credit with Respect to Solar Energy Property and Manufacturing Title II of S. 1531 would permanently extend two tax incentives for solar energy equipment and establish three new incentives for solar equipment. Subtitle A\u2014Solar Energy Property Section 201 would extend permanently the 30% value of the investment tax credit for business installations of solar equipment. In Section 202, the investment tax credit for solar (30%) and geothermal (10%) equipment would be made available to public utilities. Under Section 203, the 30% residential energy efficiency investment tax credit would be extended permanently. Further, the cap would be raised to $3,000/kw for solar electric equipment, $2,000 for solar heating and cooling equipment, and $500 for fuel cells. Section 204 would make certain solar equipment eligible for a three-year accelerated depreciation period. Subtitle B\u2014Promotion of Solar Manufacturing in the United States Section 211 would establish a 30% investment tax credit for facilities that manufacture solar energy equipment.
