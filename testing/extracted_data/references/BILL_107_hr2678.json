SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Tech Corps \nAct of 2001''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) unless action is taken soon, there will be a crisis in \n        government's ability to deliver essential services to the \n        American people;\n            (2) by 2006, over 50 percent of the Federal Government's \n        information technology workforce will be eligible to retire, \n        creating a huge demand in government for high-skill workers;\n            (3) despite a 44 percent decrease in the demand for \n        information technology workers in the private sector, the \n        Information Technology Association of America reports that \n        employers will need to fill over 900,000 new information \n        technology jobs and will be unable to find qualified workers \n        for 425,000 of those jobs;\n            (4) to highlight the urgency of this situation, in January \n        2001, the General Accounting Office added the Federal \n        Government's human capital management to its list of high-risk \n        problems for which an effective solution must be found;\n            (5) despite efforts to increase flexibility in Federal \n        agencies' employment practices, compensation issues continue to \n        severely restrain recruitment for Government agencies;\n            (6) failures in the Federal Government employment process \n        are accelerating efforts by agencies to implement outsourcing \n        as a short-term solution to skill gaps, further unbalancing \n        efforts to reach the proper government versus contractor mix of \n        management and skills; and\n            (7) an effective, efficient, and economical response to \n        this crisis would be to create a vibrant, ongoing exchange \n        effort designed to share talent, expertise, and advances in \n        management between leading-edge businesses and government \n        agencies engaged in best practices.\n\nSEC. 2.
