FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is statutorily \n        obligated to provide to individuals who served in the Armed \n        Forces and sustained an injury as a direct result of such \n        service with health care, disability compensation, and related \n        resources.\n            (2) Disability compensation payments are intended to \n        provide relief for some of the socioeconomic and other losses \n        veterans experience as a result of service-connected diseases \n        and injuries.\n            (3) A recent review by the Government Accountability Office \n        found that the backlog of disability claims at the Department \n        of Veterans Affairs has more than tripled since 2009 and the \n        average length of time to complete a claim has increased from \n        161 days in 2009 to 260 days in 2012.\n            (4) In August 2012, approximately 568,043 claims or two-\n        thirds of all compensation rating claims are backlogged.\n            (5) The Government Accountability Office found that delays \n        in obtaining service and medical records for veterans who \n        served in the National Guard or Reserve is a significant factor \n        in lengthening the claims process for these veterans even \n        though they make up 43 percent of veterans who served during \n        the Global War on Terrorism.\n            (6) The Government Accountability Office found that if a \n        veteran submits a disability claim and reports receiving \n        disability benefits from the Social Security Administration, \n        the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to help the \n        veteran obtain relevant Federal records, including medical \n        records from the Social Security Administration to process the \n        claim.\n            (7) There is an interagency agreement between the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security \n        Administration, but the protocols of the Department and the \n        response time of the Administration can take a year before the \n        Department has obtained the requested information.\n            (8) The Government Accountability Office found that \n        approximately 50 percent of claims processing staff have been \n        in their current role for less than two years and are not yet \n        proficient in their duties requiring supervision and review \n        from more experienced claims processing staff, diverting them \n        from their claims processing responsibilities.\n            (9) Veterans and their families have already selflessly and \n        willingly sacrificed for our nation and faced numerous \n        hardships; they should not have to continue to face undue and \n        avoidable hardships after their service as they seek the \n        benefits they earned.\n            (10) On March 24, 2013, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n        Eric K. Shinseki stated in an interview on State of the Union \n        television show, ``no veteran should have to wait for claims as \n        they are today. We have a fix for this. We're open for \n        business. And we will end the backlog in 2015.''.\n            (11) On April 15, 2013, the Secretary, in written testimony \n        before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate, again \n        stated that the ``VA remains focused on eliminating the \n        disability claims backlog in 2015 and processing all claims \n        within 125 days at a 98-percent accuracy level.''.\n            (12) On April 19, 2013, the Secretary again stated in a New \n        York Times article titled ``V.A. Aims to Reduce Its Backlog of \n        Claims'', that the Department will ``eliminate the backlog by \n        2015.''.\n            (13) Numerous congressional inquiries for progress reports \n        and detailed information regarding the disability claims \n        backlog remain unanswered, while the Secretary continues to \n        state the claims backlog will be eliminated by 2015, claims \n        processing accuracy will be increased to 98 percent, and claims \n        processing will take no longer than 125 days as a direct result \n        of the ``Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation Claims \n        Backlog'' of the Department.\n            (14) The Government Accountability Office found that the \n        ``Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation Claims Backlog'' \n        of the Department does not adequately articulate how the \n        Department will meet its goals, and planning documents that the \n        Department provided does not meet the established criteria of \n        the Government Accountability Office for sound planning, \n        potentially leading to concerns about the ability of the \n        Department to reduce claims backlogs.\n\nSEC. 3.
