    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Old Man of the Mountain \nCommemorative Coin Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds as follows:\n            (1) Formed by God and glaciers, five different ledges atop \n        a granite cliff created the Old Man of the Mountain whose \n        flinty visage has long represented the Granite State's \n        independence and proud traditions.\n            (2) For some 10,000 years, the Old Man of the Mountain, \n        from his lofty perch, did steadfastly defy the forces of \n        gravity and nature that bring all things down.\n            (3) The Old Man of the Mountain's rugged profile delighted \n        all who saw it, as it serves as a symbol of New Hampshire's \n        stony and unyielding independence and represents New \n        Hampshire's love of liberty and is deeply revered by all \n        Granite Staters.\n            (4) The rocky ledges that formed the Old Man of the \n        Mountain gave way and tumbled down the slopes of Cannon \n        Mountain under a veil of fog and cloud sometime in the first \n        few hours of May 3, 2003, forever changing the landscape that \n        has long served as a New Hampshire state symbol.\n            (5) The importance of the ``Great Stone Face'' as a symbol \n        of New Hampshire was eloquently noted by Statesman Daniel \n        Webster.\n            (6) A commemorative coin would immortalize the watchful \n        gaze of the Old Man, bringing both national and international \n        attention to the lasting legacy of the Old Man of the Mountain \n        as well as helping to ease the loss felt by all New Hampshire \n        residents.\n            (7) The proceeds from a surcharge on the sale of each \n        commemorative coin will assist the financing of a suitable \n        memorial to the oldest and proudest member of the New Hampshire \n        family, the Old Man of the Mountain.\n\nSEC. 3.
