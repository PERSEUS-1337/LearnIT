If appropriate, the Inspector General shall in \n                consultation with the Attorney General, issue a special \n                fraud alert in response to the request. All special \n                fraud alerts issued pursuant to this subparagraph shall \n                be published in the Federal Register.\n            (2) Criteria for special fraud alerts.--In determining \n        whether to issue a special fraud alert upon a request described \n        in paragraph (1), the Inspector General may consider--\n                    (A) whether and to what extent the practices that \n                would be identified in the special fraud alert may \n                result in any of the consequences described in \n                subsection (a)(2); and\n                    (B) the volume and frequency of the conduct that \n                would be identified in the special fraud alert."
