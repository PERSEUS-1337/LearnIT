FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Language in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Public \n        Law 112-29; 125 Stat. 284) and regulations and examination \n        guidelines issued by the United States Patent and Trademark \n        Office implementing provisions of that Act have created \n        uncertainty regarding the scope of the 1-year grace period \n        during which an inventor who discloses an invention to the \n        public may decide whether to file a patent application for the \n        invention (referred to in this Act as the ``grace period'').\n            (2) The regulatory reading of the Leahy-Smith America \n        Invents Act does not comport with the intent of the sponsors of \n        that Act.\n            (3) In performing more than 50 percent of all basic \n        research in the United States and pursuing the transfer of \n        research results to the private sector for the benefit of the \n        public under the auspices of chapter 18 of title 35, United \n        States Code (commonly known as the ``Bayh-Dole Act''), \n        institutions of higher education and government laboratories \n        face a difficult and expensive challenge in gaining and \n        utilizing the full scope of patent rights.\n            (4) The uncertainty relating to the grace period created by \n        the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act adds to the challenge faced \n        by institutions of higher education and government laboratories \n        in gaining and utilizing the full scope of patent rights.\n            (5) Job growth and the creation of start-up companies and \n        small businesses are thwarted by uncertainty as to the scope of \n        the grace period and by the difficulty and expense of gaining \n        and utilizing patent rights, which hinders the economy of the \n        United States and the technological leadership of the United \n        States in a competitive global economy.\n            (6) Ambiguity and uncertainty in statutory text and \n        government regulations breed abusive and expensive patent \n        litigation.\n            (7) Discouragement of scientific research publication--\n                    (A) delays the disclosure of scientific advances to \n                the public;\n                    (B) thwarts scientific advances;\n                    (C) chills collaborative research activities; and\n                    (D) delays, if not denies, the opportunity for the \n                public to realize the benefits of research results.\n            (8) Misappropriation by third parties of disclosed \n        inventions is likely to increase, especially in countries that \n        take advantage of the technological prowess of the United \n        States without appropriately compensating inventors.\n            (9) Secrecy is anathema to--\n                    (A) the maintenance of a viable United States \n                patent system;\n                    (B) the constitutional purpose of the United States \n                patent system; and\n                    (C) the goal of the United States patent system of \n                promoting scientific progress.\n            (10) In the words of David J. Kappos, who served as the \n        Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and \n        Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office \n        during the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, \n        the grace period before the enactment of the Leahy-Smith \n        America Invents Act was ``the gold standard of best \n        practices''.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to correct the drafting problem in the Leahy-Smith \n        America Invents Act relating to the grace period; and\n            (2) to maintain the position of leadership of the United \n        States in educational, technological, and scientific progress.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCLOSURES FOLLOWING A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF A CLAIMED \n              INVENTION BY AN INVENTOR.\n\n    Section 102(b) of title 35, United States Code, is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n            ``(3) Disclosures by any person after public disclosure of \n        a claimed invention by an inventor.--\n                    ``(A) Definitions.--In this paragraph--\n                            ``(i) the term `covered person', with \n                        respect to a claimed invention, means--\n                                    ``(I) the inventor;\n                                    ``(II) a joint inventor;
