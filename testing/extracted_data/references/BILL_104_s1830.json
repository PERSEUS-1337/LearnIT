FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n        security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and its \n        partners in the Alliance.\n            (2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, \n        purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any \n        nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as full \n        and equal members emerging democracies in Central and Eastern \n        Europe does not threaten any nation. America's security, \n        freedom, and prosperity remain linked to the security of the \n        countries of Europe.\n            (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n        NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic \n        transformation of Eastern Europe. Members of the Alliance can \n        and should play a critical role in addressing the security \n        challenges of the post-Cold War era and in creating the stable \n        environment needed for those emerging democracies in Central \n        and Eastern Europe to successfully complete political and \n        economic transformation.\n            (4) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different \n        occasions since 1949.\n            (5) Congress has sought to facilitate the further \n        enlargement of NATO at an early date by enacting the NATO \n        Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103-447; 22 \n        U.S.C. 1928 note) and the NATO Participation Act Amendments of \n        1995 (section 585 of Public Law 104-107).\n            (6) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of \n        Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in \n        Europe will be shared more widely. Facilitation of the \n        enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and \n        the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political \n        will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as the \n        Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making \n        available the resources necessary to supplement efforts \n        prospective new members are themselves undertaking.\n            (7) New members will be full members of the Alliance, \n        enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under the \n        Washington Treaty.\n            (8) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives involving \n        emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have \n        expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the Baltic \n        Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint \n        Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping \n        Force, can make an important contribution to European peace and \n        security and international peacekeeping efforts, assist those \n        countries preparing to assume the responsibilities of possible \nNATO membership, and accordingly should receive appropriate support \nfrom the United States.\n            (9) The United States continues to regard the political \n        independence and territorial integrity of all emerging \n        democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European \n        peace and security.\n            (10) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n        organization capable of conducting effective military \n        operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-\n        Atlantic region.\n            (11) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a \n        positive role in defusing tensions between members of the \n        Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred \n        between two Alliance member states since the inception of NATO \n        in 1949.\n            (12) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in \n        Central and Eastern Europe that meet specific criteria for NATO \n        membership would contribute to international peace and enhance \n        the security of the region.\n            (13) A number of Eastern European countries have expressed \n        interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps to \n        demonstrate this commitment; including their participation in \n        Partnership for Peace activities.\n            (14) In recognition that not all countries which have \n        requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n        same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n            (15) The eventual membership of Austria, Finland, and \n        Sweden is fully expected and is not precluded by this Act.\n            (16) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance \n        should include those emerging democracies most ready for closer \n        ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other countries \n        meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move forward \n        toward eventual NATO membership.\n            (17) The Congress of the United States finds that Poland, \n        Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made the most progress \n        toward achieving the stated criteria and should be eligible for \n        the additional assistance described in this bill.\n            (18) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n        emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be \n        based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for \n        NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's security \n        and the approval of all NATO members.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n    It should be the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n        redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n        world;\n            (2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central \n        and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries \n        may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n            (3) to work to define a constructive and cooperative \n        political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO \n        and the Russian Federation.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote economic \nstability and security in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, \nSlovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine--\n            (1) the United States should support the full and active \n        participation of these countries in activities appropriate for \n        qualifying for NATO membership;\n            (2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic \n        means available to press the European Union to admit as soon as \n        possible any country which qualifies for membership; and\n            (3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization should support military exercises and \n        peacekeeping initiatives between and among these nations, \n        nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Russia.\n\nSEC. 5.
