    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 14557 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n14557.\n\u201cProvisional registration\u201d means that under certain circumstances, a label for renewal on an auxiliary soil and plant substance, packaged agricultural mineral, packaged soil amendment, organic input material, or specialty fertilizer, alone or in any combination, may be registered for a limited period of time while labels are being corrected and reprinted or during registration renewal.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 14601 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n14601.\n(a) Each differing label, other than weight or package size, such as changes in the guaranteed analysis, derivation statement, or anything that implies a different product, for specialty fertilizer, packaged agricultural mineral, auxiliary soil and plant substance, organic input material, and packaged soil amendment shall be registered. The department may develop a schedule for all registrations to be submitted to the department for approval, and registrations shall be valid for two years. The registration fee shall not exceed two hundred dollars ($200) per product, except for organic input material.\n(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the registration fee for organic input material shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500) per product, as the registration of organic input material labels require additional departmental resources and review time to ensure that nutrient guarantees and claims are scientifically feasible and meet National Organic Program standards. Funds generated from the registration of organic input material shall be deposited into the Organic Input Materials Account in the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund and, notwithstanding Section 221, shall be available upon appropriation by the Legislature.\n(c) The secretary may, based on the findings and recommendations of the board, reduce the registration fees to a lower rate that provides sufficient revenue to carry out this chapter.\n(d) Registrations may not be issued without a current license.\n(e) The secretary may require proof of labeling statements and other claims made for any specialty fertilizer, agricultural mineral, packaged soil amendment, organic input material, or auxiliary soil and plant substance, before the secretary registers any such product. As evidence of proof, the secretary may rely on experimental data, evaluations, or advice furnished by scientists, including scientists affiliated with the University of California, and may accept or reject additional sources of proof in the evaluation of any fertilizing material. In all cases, experimental proof shall relate to conditions in California under which the product is intended for use.\n(f) The secretary may perform site inspections of organic input material manufacturing processes used to validate label nutrient guarantees, claims, and compliance with National Organic Program standards giving priority to inspecting high-risk products and manufacturers. The department may accept inspections performed by a third-party organization approved by the secretary for organic input material manufacturers. All inspection records obtained by a contracted third-party organization shall be made available to the secretary upon request. When a contracted third-party organization is conducting a site inspection, the organization shall notify the department of when the inspection is going to take place no less than 72 hours in advance of the inspection. Department representatives may be present at the inspection.\n(g) (1) The secretary, after hearing, may cancel the registration of, or refuse to register, any specialty fertilizer, packaged agricultural mineral, packaged soil amendment, organic input material, or auxiliary soil and plant substance, which the secretary determines is detrimental or injurious to plants, animals, public safety, or the environment when it is applied as directed, which is known to be of little or no value for the purpose for which it is intended, or for which any false or misleading claim is made or implied. The secretary may cancel the registration of any product of any person who violates this chapter.\n(2) The proceedings to determine whether to cancel or refuse registration of any of those products shall be conducted pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. The secretary shall have all the powers that are granted pursuant to Chapter 5.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 14603 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n14603.\nEach application for renewal shall be accompanied by a fee not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200) for each product label. If a registration is not renewed within one calendar month following expiration, a penalty of fifty dollars ($50) per product label shall be added to the fee.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 14604 is added to the Food and Agricultural Code, to read:\n14604.\nThe secretary may grant a provisional registration for a period not exceeding six months for a registered product undergoing renewal. All fees shall be paid before the issuance of any provisional registration.\nSEC. 5.\nSection 14681 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to read:\n14681.\nNo person shall distribute misbranded fertilizing materials. A fertilizing material shall be deemed to be misbranded under any of the following conditions:\n(a) If its labeling is false or misleading in any particular way.\n(b) If it is distributed under the name of another fertilizing material, as determined by the department.\n(c) If it is not labeled as required by regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter.\n(d) If it purports to be, or is represented as, a fertilizing material, or is represented as containing a primary or secondary plant nutrient or micronutrients, or both, unless the plant nutrients conform to the definition of identity, if any, prescribed by regulation. In adopting these regulations, due regard shall be given to commonly accepted definitions and official fertilizer terms such as those prescribed by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials."
