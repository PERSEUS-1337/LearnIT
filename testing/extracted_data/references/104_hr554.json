The court shall not \n        grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds \n        that such relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive \n        means to remedy the violation of the Federal right. In \n        determining the intrusiveness of the relief, the court shall \n        give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety \n        or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the \n        relief.\n            ``(2) Prison population reduction relief.--In any civil \n        action with respect to prison conditions, the court shall not \n        grant or approve any relief whose purpose or effect is to \n        reduce or limit the prison population, unless the plaintiff \n        proves that crowding is the primary cause of the deprivation of \n        the Federal right and no other relief will remedy that \n        deprivation.\n    ``(b) Termination of Relief.--\n            ``(1) Automatic termination of prospective relief after 2-\n        year period.--In any civil action with respect to prison \n        conditions, any prospective relief shall automatically \n        terminate 2 years after the later of--\n                    ``(A) the date the court found the violation of a \n                Federal right that was the basis for the relief; or\n                    ``(B) the date of the enactment of the Stop Turning \n                Out Prisoners Act.\n            ``(2) Immediate termination of prospective relief.--In any \n        civil action with respect to prison conditions, a defendant or \n        intervenor shall be entitled to the immediate termination of \n        any prospective relief, if that relief was approved or granted \n        in the absence of a finding by the court that prison conditions \n        violated a Federal right.\n    ``(c) Procedure for Motions Affecting Prospective Relief.--\n            ``(1) Generally.--The court shall promptly rule on any \n        motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil \n        action with respect to prison conditions.\n            ``(2) Automatic stay.--Any prospective relief subject to a \n        pending motion shall be automatically stayed during the \n        period--\n                    ``(A) beginning on the 30th day after such motion \n                is filed, in the case of a motion made under subsection \n                (b); and\n                    ``(B) beginning on the 180th day after such motion \n                is filed, in the case of a motion made under any other \n                law;\n        and ending on the date the court enters a final order ruling on \n        that motion.\n    ``(d) Standing.--Any Federal, State, or local official or unit of \ngovernment--\n            ``(1) whose jurisdiction or function includes the \n        prosecution or custody of persons in a prison subject to; or\n            ``(2) who otherwise is or may be affected by;\nany relief whose purpose or effect is to reduce or limit the prison \npopulation shall have standing to oppose the imposition or continuation \nin effect of that relief and may intervene in any proceeding relating \nto that relief.
