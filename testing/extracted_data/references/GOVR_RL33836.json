    "content": "During the 109 th Congress, 51 bills were introduced (43 in the House and 8 in the Senate) to change federal campaign finance law. Legislation relating to 527 organizations received the most prominent legislative and media attention during the 109 th Congress. Other bills receiving attention addressed regulation of Internet communications, party coordinated expenditures, contributions by Indian tribes, and leadership political action committees (PACs). All are discussed in more detail below. The 109 th Congress followed the 2004 elections, during which an estimated $435 million was spent by political organizations operating under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, but outside federal election law regulation. The role of 527 organizations in federal elections was the principal campaign finance issue examined by the 109 th Congress. On March 8, 2005, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee held a hearing on S. 271 (McCain-Feingold-Lott), the 527 Reform Act of 2005, to require that 527s involved in federal elections comply fully with federal election law. On April 27, 2005, it voted to report the bill, as amended in committee. Committee amendments largely added provisions to deregulate other aspects of FECA. On May 17, the bill was reported as an original bill\u2014 S. 1053 \u2014and placed on the Senate's legislative calendar. The Senate took no further action on the measure. The House Administration Committee held a hearing April 20, 2005, on regulation of 527 organizations. It focused on two measures: H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan), the 527 Reform Act of 2005 (the companion to S. 271 , later S. 1053 ); and H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn). In sharp contrast with the Shays-Meehan bill and the one reported in the Senate, H.R. 1316 sought to address the 527 issue indirectly, by loosening restrictions on funding sources within FECA. By so doing, proponents maintained that because more money could be directed to regulated sources, there would be fewer incentives for political money to flow to 527 groups operating outside the FECA framework. On June 9, 2005, House Administration voted to report H.R. 1316 favorably, as amended, and it was reported on June 22. On June 29, 2005, the committee held a markup of H.R. 513 and ordered it reported (as amended to reflect the sponsors' changes), without recommendation. This set the stage for a potential floor debate on the two contrasting measures ( H.R. 513 and H.R. 1316 ). Almost a year later, on April 5, 2006, the House passed H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan), as amended, by a 218-209 vote. The rule for its consideration\u2014 H.Res. 755 \u2014allowed one floor amendment, by Representative Dreier, to remove political party-coordinated expenditure limits in 2 U.S.C. 441a(d); this issue is discussed below. The amendment was added by voice vote before final passage. The text of H.R. 513 was also incorporated into the House Republican leadership's lobbying and ethics reform bill\u2014 H.R. 4975 (Dreier). As introduced, Title VI of the bill incorporated the language of H.R. 513 as reported by the House Administration Committee. In addition, it included the same provision as was included in the House-passed version of H.R. 513 , to remove the political party-coordinated expenditure limits. Prior to House passage of H.R. 4975 , another amendment unrelated to 527s was included in the bill by the House Rules Committee, to allow leadership PACs' funds to be transferred without limitation to national party committees (as is the case with funds in candidates' principal campaign committees). On May 3, 2006, the House passed (by a vote of 217-213) H.R. 4975 , the Lobbying Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which included the text of H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan), as well as the amendments on leadership PACs and party coordinated expenditures. After passing H.R. 4975 , the House substituted it for the text of S. 2349 , the Senate-passed version of the bill, to enable a conference with the Senate. The Senate-passed bill did not contain the 527 provisions, and disagreement between the two chambers on the 527 issue\u00a0reportedly contributed to the 109 th Congress enacting neither lobby reform nor 527 regulation legislation. \"Party coordinated expenditures\" refer to expenditures made by a political party in coordination with a candidate's campaign. They have been subject to limits since the 1974 FECA Amendments, codified in 2 U.S.C. \u00a7441a(d). The limits are relatively high compared with the $5,000 limit on contributions most party committees may give directly to candidate campaigns. In 2006, for example, parties could make up to $79,200 in coordinated expenditures in support of House candidates (in multi-district states). Limits for Senate candidates vary by state, ranging in 2006 from $158,400 in states with the smallest populations, to almost $4.2 million in California. Ever since the Supreme Court ruling in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (518 U.S. 604 (1996)), which permitted parties to make independent expenditures on behalf of their candidates, the importance of coordinated expenditures has been diminished. The prospect of unlimited independent expenditures has been increasingly appealing to the parties, and it has become common for parties to make both independent expenditures and coordinated expenditures for the same candidates, albeit from at least nominally different departments of a party committee. In 2004, Democratic party committees (federal, state, and local) made $33.1 million in coordinated expenditures and $176.5 million in independent expenditures to promote their federal candidates. By contrast, Republican party committees made $29.1 million in coordinated expenditures and $88.0 million in independent expenditures. As of this writing, data for the complete 2006 cycle were not yet available. As enacted, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) contained a provision to require a party to choose between making either independent expenditures or coordinated expenditures, but not both, for one of its nominees. This, however, was one of two BCRA provisions struck down by the Supreme Court in McConnell v. FEC (549 U.S. 93(2003)). Hence, although abolishing the limit on coordinated expenditures would appear to allow the parties to spend unlimited amounts on behalf of their candidates, through independent expenditures they already have that right, albeit through expenditures that are technically made without any coordination with the favored candidate. Supporters of removing the limits on coordinated expenditures assert that doing so would largely signal acceptance of campaign reality and allow parties to reinforce their direct ties with candidates. Opponents counter that abolishing coordinated expenditure limits would send the wrong message to an electorate cynical about the role of money in politics, and that the national parties are now playing a significant role, especially in light of increased hard money limits under BCRA. Party committees raised almost $1.5 billion in the 2004 election cycle (all hard money), more than ever had been raised in combined hard and soft money by the national parties. As of this writing, data for the complete 2006 cycle were not yet available. A provision allowing leadership PACs to transfer unlimited funds to national parties was added by the Senate Appropriations Committee to H.R. 3058 , the Transportation-Treasury-HUD-Judiciary-DC appropriations bill for FY2006. This was the same provision as was added by the Senate Rules and Administration to S. 271 (later S. 1053 ) and by the House to H.R. 4975 , the lobby reform bill. Following a move by BCRA sponsors, the Senate deleted the provision by unanimous consent on October 17, 2005. In response to large sums of money given in recent elections by Indian tribes and concerns over the application of federal campaign finance law to tribes, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee held a hearing February 8, 2006, to examine rules governing campaign contributions by Indian tribes. In its final report on its investigation of lobbying and political activities by Indian tribes, the committee recommended requiring Indian tribes making federal election contributions to register with the FEC and improving rules for disclosure of those contributions. Changes in technology have recently raised questions about the extent to which traditional campaign finance regulations should affect new media. Since BCRA passed in 2002, there has been particular debate about whether Internet communications should fall under the act's regulations governing \"public communications,\" such as outdoor advertising and broadcast advertisements. Internet communications were addressed at a House Administration Committee hearing September 22, 2005. On November 2, 2005, the House failed to pass a measure to exempt Internet communications from regulation under federal campaign finance laws; H.R. 1606 (Hensarling) was brought up under suspension of the rules but failed on a 225-182 vote. On March 9, 2006, the House Administration Committee ordered the bill favorably reported, and it was expected to be considered by the House on March 16, but that vote was postponed. On March 27, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) approved new regulations governing only paid advertisements placed on another's website, thus addressing much of the concern expressed about regulating blogs and similar communications under campaign finance law. On March 29, 2006, House Majority Leader Boehner announced that consideration of H.R. 1606 would be postponed indefinitely.  Table 1 on the following pages provides easy reference to types of provisions in each of the bills listed in this report. An \"X\" denotes features in a given bill. The nature of these categories is described in the introduction to the next section. As explained previously, campaign finance bills introduced in the 109 th Congress covered a wide range of topics. Although many of the bills at first appear to have had little in common, all the bills focused on major campaign finance issues. This section of the report is organized into 14 subsections, encompassing the 13 major areas of proposed changes in campaign finance regulation found in 109 th Congress bills; the 14 th subsection, \"miscellaneous,\" includes provisions outside that framework. These are the same categories listed in Table 1 . Each subsection contains a brief introductory statement about proposed changes, followed by a listing of bills containing those proposed changes. (Later in this report, bills are listed by number, followed by detailed summaries of all major provisions contained in each bill and any action taken on them.) In this section, bills are listed according to what appears to have been the primary nature and goal of a particular provision. Many provisions, however, had multiple purposes. For example, a bill that would have raised the limit on an individual's contributions to political parties would have empowered both the individual and the political party. Such a provision would be listed here under \"individual,\" because it would have most directly affected what an individual might do, although the parties would have benefitted as well. Categorization and ordering of bills in this report is solely for the purpose of organization and does not reflect any judgement by CRS as to the relative importance or merit of the bills themselves. The first six categories can be examined in the context of hard money , since they pertain to types of activity that are fully regulated under federal election law, which specifies prohibited sources, sets limits on permitted contributions, and requires disclosure. The six hard money categories are shown on the checklist in Table 1 under a larger heading \"hard money,\" with the first four\u2014individuals, PACs, parties, and candidates\u2014further grouped to reflect the principal sources of campaign receipts. The fifth category deals with in-state or in-district requirements for campaign receipts, while the sixth addresses independent expenditures. The eighth and ninth categories cover provisions that dealt with soft money , those activities largely or fully outside the framework of federal election law, which have been a major focus of reform efforts in recent years. The eighth category contains provisions relating to party soft money, which was largely addressed in BCRA but where some issues remain. The ninth category focuses on non-party soft money\u2014activities of unions, corporations, and tax-exempt organizations, particularly 527 organizations, in federal elections; it also deals with election-related issue advocacy, which is closely related to activities of 527s and other outside groups. (The seventh category\u2014coordination\u2014has applicability to both hard and soft money activities and is so designated.) Category 10 addresses proposals for public financing or benefits and spending limits in congressional elections. The 11 th category\u2014labeled \"FEC\"\u2014addresses proposals to improve enforcement and disclosure by the Federal Election Commission or a proposed successor agency. The 12 th deals with proposals on campaign advertising, including the Internet. The 13 th contains proposals to change the presidential public funding system. The 14 th \u2014\" Miscellaneous\"\u2014contains all other proposals. These bills would have changed limits and offered incentives to encourage a greater role for individual citizens in federal campaign financing. H.R. 4759 (Doolittle) H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn)\u2014to PACs, and would have indexed for inflation H.R. 4664 (Capuano)\u2014to candidates and PACs, but would have indexed PAC limits H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn)\u2014for contributions to state parties S. 1053 (Lott)\u2014for contributions to state parties H.R. 958 (Petri)\u2014credit and special deduction These bills would have restricted or empowered PACs in their funding roles. Most PACs are considered \"nonparty multicandidate committees,\" referring to the FECA status that most PACs have. PACs sponsored by organizations are called \"separate segregated funds,\" while those that are independent of other entities are labeled \"nonconnected.\" H.R. 4819 (Leach)\u2014if ban were held unconstitutional, would have lowered PAC contribution limit to $1,000 H.R. 4759 (Doolittle) H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn)\u2014and would have indexed for inflation S. 1053 (Lott)\u2014and would have indexed for inflation H.R. 4664 (Capuano)\u2014to candidates, and indexes for inflation H.R. 4819 (Leach)\u2014lesser of 10% of candidate receipts, or $5,000 H.R. 4819 (Leach)\u2014$500,000 per PAC H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn)\u2014would have allowed unlimited transfers to national parties H.R. 4655 (Jones, NC)\u2014would have required in FEC disclosures clear identification of federal candidates or officeholders associated with leadership PACs H.R. 4975 (Dreier)\u2014would have allowed unlimited transfers to national parties H.R. 5623 (Capuano)\u2014would have banned conversion of funds to personal use, and defined \"leadership PAC\" H.R. 5839 (Hefley)\u2014would have banned federal leadership PACs and established rules for disposing of existing funds S. 1053 (Lott)\u2014would have allowed unlimited transfers to national parties H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) S. 1053 (Lott) H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) S. 1053 (Lott) H.R. 4692 (Kaptur)\u2014would have banned PAC money from foreign-controlled corporations and foreign national involvement in PAC decisions. These bills would have restricted or empowered political parties in their funding roles. H.R. 4759 (Doolittle) H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan) H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) H.R. 4975 (Dreier) H.R. 3099 (Tierney)\u2014in \"clean money\" races H.R. 4664 (Capuano)\u2014by multicandidate committees, and would have indexed for inflation H.R. 5905 (Meehan-Shays)\u2014limit might have been removed if non-participant exceeded specified amount in receipts or expenditures S. 3740 (Feingold)\u2014limit might have removed if non-participant exceeded specified amount in receipts or expenditures These bills contained provisions that focused on spending and loans by candidates from personal or family wealth, including the issue of repayment of candidate loans from campaign funds after an election, and permissible use of campaign funds in general. H.R. 702 (English) H.R. 701 (English)\u2014for winning candidates, after taking office H.J.Res. 13 (Leach) This category includes a bill that would have required a minimum level of candidates' funds to come from residents of that state or district. H.R. 4819 (Leach)\u2014for House and Senate candidates Independent expenditures are communications with the public advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates made without any coordination, cooperation, or consultation with the candidate campaigns. Independent expenditures are not subject to limits on amounts spent, but the source restrictions and disclosure requirements of federal law apply. This hard money activity should not be confused with issue advocacy, which is largely outside federal election regulation and is addressed in the \"nonparty soft money\" category, below. H.R. 3099 (Tierney)\u2014for \"clean money\" candidates H.R. 4694 (Obey)\u2014in House elections, but would have allowed for fast-track consideration of constitutional amendment allowing reasonable limits if the ban were held unconstitutional These provisions address the issue of what constitutes coordination under FECA, which, in turn, triggers an activity's treatment as a contribution or expenditure , subject to relevant limits. This issue has come to include both issue and express advocacy, hence it contains both hard and soft money components. H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn)\u2014would have allowed federal candidates greater latitude in assisting state and local candidates H.R. 3099 (Tierney) H.R. 3099 (Tierney)\u2014but would have exempted party spending for \"clean money\" candidates The term \"soft money\" has traditionally referred to money that may indirectly influence federal elections, but that is raised and spent outside federal election law's purview and that would be illegal if spent directly in connection with a federal election. Prior to enactment of BCRA, national parties commonly raised money from sources and in amounts that were federally impermissible; these funds could then be transferred to state parties, where permitted under state election law, and used for grassroots and generic party activity. Party soft money was also used for a share of administrative and overhead expenses and issue advocacy. Since BCRA's prohibition on the raising of soft money by national parties and federal officials, the soft money issue has largely been moot. Those few bills that addressed it in the 109 th Congress generally sought to adjust existing restrictions. H.R. 5374 (Linder) H.R. 2753 (Andrews)\u2014would have allowed state parties to file copies of state reports with FEC, if substantially similar to what FEC requires H.R. 4759 (Doolittle)\u2014would have required copies of state party reports to be filed with FEC H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) H.R. 5374 (Linder)\u2014would have ended \"Levin fund\" provision H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn)\u2014appearances at state and local party fundraisers H.R. 4694 (Obey)\u2014in House elections, but would have allowed for fast-track consideration of constitutional amendment allowing reasonable limits if the ban were held unconstitutional H.R. 5374 (Linder) H.R. 5374 (Linder) H.R. 5374 (Linder) Non-party soft money pertains to direct spending by and activity of groups, as opposed to their donations to another entity (such as parties). The term long was used to refer to activities by corporations and labor unions, but in recent years has come to refer increasingly to activities by tax-exempt organizations, most notably 527s. It also has particular relevance to election-related issue advocacy, a practice in which some of 527s are prominently engaged. Traditionally, non-party soft money referred to permissible spending from union and corporate treasuries\u2014despite the long-standing ban on direct union and corporate spending in federal elections\u2014on three exempt activities aimed only at specified restricted classes (corporate executives and stockholders and families, and union members and their families). The three exempt activities are: setting up and raising money for a PAC, internal communications (including express advocacy), and voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. In more recent years, the activities of tax-exempt organizations have come under scrutiny for their election-related activities that may be permitted under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) but are not regulated under FECA. Observers have long noted the potential for 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations to affect elections indirectly by their permissible activities under the tax code. Since 2000, particular interest has been focused on \"political organizations\" defined by Section 527 of the IRC. Although Congress in 2000 required disclosure by 527 groups through the IRS, much debate has ensued since 2004 as to whether their election-related activities should require full regulation under federal election law. In large measure, what has been fueling the issue over 527s and other tax-exempt organizations has been the practice of election-related issue advocacy. Prior to BCRA's enactment, some observers became concerned about communications that promoted political issues in reference to candidates, but which, by avoiding specific election advocacy language (e.g., \"elect Jones\" or \"defeat Smith\"), were not subject to regulation under federal election law. These \"issue advocacy\" communications contrasted with those that explicitly promoted the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates\u2014a class of communications known as \"express advocacy.\" Since the courts had generally construed \"express advocacy\" communications in a narrow sense (i.e., using explicit phrases advocating election or defeat), communications that may have been perceived as constituting thinly veiled election activity could thus avoid federal disclosure and source regulations. BCRA addressed issue advocacy by creating a new term in federal election law, \"electioneering communication\"\u2014political advertisements that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate and are broadcast within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. The act prohibited unions and certain corporations from spending treasury funds for electioneering communications and required disclosure of disbursements of more than $10,000 and the identity of donors of $1,000 or more. In part because of BCRA's narrowly tailored response to issue advocacy, concerns remain. Some believe that BCRA went too far and favor the repeal of its electioneering communications provision. Others believe it did not go far enough and favor more regulation in this area. Some proposals address issue advocacy directly, while others address it through proposals aimed at the type of organization practicing issue advocacy. This section is organized accordingly.

Discussion of spending limits and benefits to candidates are grouped together because many bills embodied both concepts, largely because a voluntary system of limits with conditional benefits has been a major response to the Buckley v. Valeo ruling [424 U.S. 1 (1976)], which overturned mandatory limits. This grouping should not be construed as an inherent linkage between the two ideas; there are very distinct principles behind spending limits and public benefits (or financing). Options among spending limit bills included voluntary limits, in response to Buckley , with or without inducements to participation through public benefits; mandatory limits, through a constitutional amendment; or \"benefits only\" provisions without adherence to spending limits.
