    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Commercial Truck Highway Safety \nDemonstration Program Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Public safety on the highways of the United States is a \n        paramount concern of all who use the highways and all who \n        prescribe public policy for the use of those highways, \n        including public policy on the operation of heavy commercial \n        trucks on highways.\n            (2) Federal highway funding law effectively imposes a limit \n        of 80,000 pounds on the weight of vehicles permitted to use \n        Interstate System highways.\n            (3) The administration of this law in Maine has forced \n        heavy tractor-trailer and tractor-semitrailer combination \n        vehicles traveling into Maine from neighboring States and \n        Canada to divert onto small State and local roads where higher \n        vehicle weight limits apply under Maine law.\n            (4) The diversion of those vehicles onto such roads causes \n        significant economic hardships and safety challenges for small \n        communities located along those roads.\n            (5) Permitting heavy commercial vehicles, including tanker \n        trucks carrying hazardous material and fuel oil, to travel on \n        Interstate System highways in Maine--\n                    (A) would enhance public safety by reducing--\n                            (i) the number of heavy vehicles that use \n                        town and city streets in Maine; and\n                            (ii) as a result, the number of dangerous \n                        interactions between those heavy vehicles and \n                        such other vehicles as school buses and private \n                        vehicles; and\n                    (B) would reduce the net highway maintenance costs \n                in Maine because the Interstate System highways, unlike \n                the secondary roads of Maine, are built to accommodate \n                heavy vehicles and are, therefore, more durable.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Covered interstate system highway.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``covered Interstate \n                System highway'' means a highway within the State of \n                Maine that is designated as a route on the Interstate \n                System, except as provided in subparagraph (B).\n                    (B) Exception.--The term does not include any \n                portion of highway that, as of the date of the \n                enactment of this Act, is exempted from the \n                requirements of subsection (a) of section 127 of title \n                23, United States Code, by the last sentence of such \n                subsection.\n            (2) Interstate system.--The term ``Interstate System'' has \n        the meaning given that term in section 101(a) of title 23, \n        United States Code.\n\nSEC. 4. MAINE TRUCK SAFETY DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n    The Secretary of Transportation shall carry out a program, in the \nadministration of this Act, to demonstrate the effects on the safety of \nthe overall highway network in the State of Maine that would result \nfrom permitting vehicles described in section 5(b) to be operated on \nthe Interstate System highways within the State.\n\nSEC. 5. WAIVER OF HIGHWAY FUNDING REDUCTION RELATING TO WEIGHT OF \n              VEHICLES USING INTERSTATE SYSTEM HIGHWAYS.\n\n    (a) Prohibition Relating to Certain Vehicles.--Notwithstanding \nsection 127(a) of title 23, United States Code, the total amount of \nfunds apportioned to the State of Maine under section 104(b)(1) of such \ntitle for any period may not be reduced under such section 127(a) on \nthe basis that the State of Maine permits a vehicle described in \nsubsection (b) to use a covered Interstate System highway.\n    (b) Combination Vehicles in Excess of 80,000 Pounds.--A vehicle \nreferred to in subsection (a) is a vehicle having a weight in excess of \n80,000 pounds that--\n            (1) consists of a 3-axle tractor unit hauling a single \n        trailer or semitrailer; and\n            (2) does not exceed any vehicle weight limitation that is \n        applicable under the laws of the State of Maine to the \n        operation of such vehicle on highways in Maine not in the \nInterstate System, as such laws are in effect on the date of the \nenactment of this Act.\n    (c) Effective Date and Termination.--\n            (1) Effective date.--\n                    (A) Date of satisfaction of administrative \n                conditions by maine.--The prohibition in subsection (a) \n                shall take effect on the date on which the Secretary of \n                Transportation notifies the Commissioner of \n                Transportation of the State of Maine in writing that--\n                            (i) the Secretary has received the plan \n                        described in paragraph (1) of section 6; and\n                            (ii) the Commissioner has established a \n                        highway safety committee as described in \n                        paragraph (2) of such section and has \n                        promulgated rules and procedures for the \n                        collection of highway safety data as described \n                        in paragraph (3) of such section.\n                    (B) Permanent effect.--After taking effect, the \n                prohibition in subsection (a) shall remain in effect \n                unless terminated under paragraph (2).\n            (2) Contingent termination.--The prohibition in subsection \n        (a) shall terminate three years after the effective date \n        applicable under paragraph (1) if, before the end of such 3-\n        year period, the Secretary of Transportation--\n                    (A) determines that--\n                            (i) operation of vehicles described in \n                        subsection (b) on covered Interstate System \n                        highways in Maine has adversely affected safety \n                        on the overall highway network in Maine; or\n                            (ii) the Commissioner of Transportation of \n                        the State of Maine has failed faithfully to use \n                        the highway safety committee as described in \n                        paragraph (2)(A) of section 6 or to collect \n                        data as described in paragraph (3) of such \n                        section; and\n                    (B) publishes the determination, together with the \n                date of the termination of the prohibition, in the \n                Federal Register.\n    (d) Consultation Regarding Termination for Safety.--In making a \ndetermination under subsection (c)(2)(A)(i), the Secretary of \nTransportation shall consult with the highway safety committee \nestablished by the Commissioner in accordance with section 6.\n\nSEC. 6.
