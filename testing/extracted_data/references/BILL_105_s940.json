FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) September 2, 1997, marked the 52nd anniversary of the \n        United States victory over Japan in World War II.\n            (2) The Battle of Midway proved to be the turning point in \n        the war in the Pacific, as United States Navy forces inflicted \n        such severe losses on the Imperial Japanese Navy during the \n        battle that the Imperial Japanese Navy never again took the \n        offensive against the United States or the allied forces.\n            (3) During the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, an \n        outnumbered force of the United States Navy, consisting of 29 \n        ships and other units of the Armed Forces under the command of \n        Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Spruance, out-maneuvered and out-\n        fought 350 ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n            (4) It is in the public interest to study whether Midway \n        Atoll should be established as a national memorial to the \n        Battle of Midway to express the enduring gratitude of the \n        American people for victory in the battle and to inspire future \n        generations of Americans with the heroism and sacrifice of the \n        members of the Armed Forces who achieved that victory.\n            (5) The historic structures and facilities on Midway Atoll \n        should be protected and maintained.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to require a study of the feasibility \nand suitability of designating the Midway Atoll as a National Memorial \nto the Battle of Midway within the boundaries of the Midway Atoll \nNational Wildlife Refuge. The study of the Midway Atoll and its \nenvirons shall include, but not be limited to, identification of \ninterpretative opportunities for the educational and inspirational \nbenefit of present and future generations, and of the unique and \nsignificant circumstances involving the defense of the island by the \nUnited States in World War II and the Battle of Midway.\n\nSEC. 4.
