FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) Many small businesses lack the financial capacity to \n        support the training of high-skilled workers.\n            (2) Many high-tech companies concerned about worker \n        training consider recruiting employees from overseas because a \n        shortage of information technology workers remains a \n        significant problem.\n            (3) Too many highly educated workers in underserved \n        communities do not have the specialized skills needed to meet \n        the needs of local businesses.\n            (4) Regional skills alliances bring businesses and 4-year \n        colleges and universities and community colleges together to \n        help develop and implement effective programs to make sure \n        workers have the training needed to compete in the modern \n        workplace.\n\nSEC. 3.
