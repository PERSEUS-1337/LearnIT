FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) under section 503(a)(2) of the Department of the \n        Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public \n        Law 105-83; 111 Stat. 1617), the Secretary of the Interior has \n        conveyed mineral rights in certain very large tracts of coal to \n        the State of Montana, the tracts of which lie as near as 3 or 4 \n        miles east of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation;\n            (2) development of the coal tracts and other existing and \n        proposed major developments of Federal, State, and private \n        energy resources in areas surrounding the Northern Cheyenne \n        Indian Reservation yield substantial public revenues to the \n        State (including political subdivisions of the State), thereby \n        assisting the State (including political subdivisions of the \n        State) in addressing the impacts of the development;\n            (3) although the Northern Cheyenne tribal community \n        chronically suffers harsh economic conditions and severe \n        deficits in public services and facilities, the community does \n        not share in any significant portion of the public revenues \n        generated by surrounding energy development;\n            (4) the Northern Cheyenne Tribe has few, if any, sources of \n        revenue available to address development impacts;\n            (5) in 2002, the Tribe brought suit against the Secretary, \n        asserting that the proposed conveyances of the extensive \n        Federal coal tracts to the State under the Department of the \n        Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public \n        Law 105-83; 111 Stat. 1543) would violate--\n                    (A) several Federal laws (including regulations); \n                and\n                    (B) the Federal trust responsibility to the Tribe;\n            (6) subsequently, the Tribe withdrew the suit described in \n        paragraph (5) with prejudice, based in substantial part on \n        commitments that legislation substantially in the form of this \n        Act (and further legislation providing funding to the Tribe to \n        address the impacts of coal development in areas adjoining the \n        Reservation) would be introduced and pursued with support from \n        the State, Great Northern Properties, and others;\n            (7) the Tribe asserts that the Tribe retains claims against \n        the United States arising from the failure of the United States \n        to acquire mineral rights underlying approximately 5,000 acres \n        of Reservation land when the Reservation, at the direction of \n        Congress, was expanded eastward to the Tongue River in 1900, \n        the mineral rights of which, as of the date of enactment of \n        this Act, are owned by Great Northern Properties; and\n            (8) if the conveyances of mineral rights are carried out \n        under this Act, the Tribe will waive all legal claims against \n        the United States arising from the longstanding and continuing \n        loss of the Tribe of mineral rights relating to the Reservation \n        land.\n\nSEC. 3.
