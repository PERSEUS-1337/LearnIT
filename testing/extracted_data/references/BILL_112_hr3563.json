FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) numerous proven and tested technologies exist to enable \n        the Federal Government to enhance its dissemination of public \n        alerts and warnings;\n            (2) the expected benefits of these enhancements include--\n                    (A) greater security, reliability, and redundancy \n                of the Federal Government's alert and warning \n                capabilities;\n                    (B) rapid alert dissemination;\n                    (C) an improved ability to notify remote locations;\n                    (D) the ability to geographically target and \n                deliver alerts and warnings through multiple \n                communication modes; and\n                    (E) the ability to permit homeland security grants \n                to be utilized for the purposes of modernizing public \n                alert and warning systems;\n            (3) there is a need to test the viability of delivering \n        messages through diverse communications modes to effectively \n        alert and warn the public;\n            (4) there is a need to modernize and improve the ability of \n        the Federal Government to provide residents of the United \n        States with timely and effective warnings; and\n            (5) although significant Federal integration efforts are \n        underway, the aggregation, dissemination, and reporting system \n        necessary for effective public alert and warning will require \n        an integrated national network for reliable, secure, and \n        authentic dissemination of emergency alerts and warnings by \n        Federal, State, local, and tribal entities that are authorized \n        to issue alerts to the public.\n\nSEC. 3.
