    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Japan Currency Manipulation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Japanese yen is, by any measure, in fundamental \n        misalignment with every major currency and, according to the \n        Bank of Japan, is now trading at the lowest trade-weighted \n        average in the last 20 years.\n            (2) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n        reported, in a January 2004 working paper, ``Since the early \n        1990s, the monetary authorities of the major industrialized \n        countries, with one notable exception, have greatly curtailed \n        their foreign exchange interventions. That exception has been \n        Japan, where the Ministry of Finance has continued to intervene \n        frequently--and at times massively--in foreign exchange \n        markets.''.\n            (3) The fundamental cause of Japan's exchange-rate \n        misalignment is a set of deliberate policy decisions by the \n        Government of Japan designed to artificially suppress the world \n        market value of the yen in order to increase Japanese exports \n        substantially.\n            (4) Japan's $875,000,000,000 in foreign currency reserve \n        holdings are the second largest in the world, far exceeding any \n        reasonable economic justification and extremely \n        disproportionate to the foreign currency reserves held by other \n        industrialized nations.\n            (5) The United States trade deficit with Japan is the \n        second highest--$88,000,000,000 in 2006--and trade in \n        automobiles and automobile parts makes up two-thirds of the \n        trade deficit.\n            (6) Japan has maintained a massive and consistently large \n        current account trade deficit with the United States for more \n        than 25 years, with the majority of that deficit attributable \n        to automobiles and automobile parts.\n            (7) At the current average rate of exchange of 117 Japanese \n        yen to the United States dollar, Japan is providing a $3,600 \n        subsidy for a typical family 4-door sedan made in Japan, a \n        $9,700 subsidy for upper-end and luxury vehicles made in Japan, \n        and thousands of dollars in cost advantages for Japanese \n        automobiles made in the United States with imported Japanese \n        automobile parts.\n            (8) The exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with \n        respect to the United States dollar effectively provides a \n        subsidy to Japanese exporters and an unfair competitive \n        advantage for Japanese automobile manufacturers over United \n        States automobile manufacturers.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Currency intervention.--The term ``currency \n        intervention'' means--\n                    (A) direct currency intervention, such as purchases \n                of United States dollars and sales of Japanese yen that \n                are greater than such purchases and sales for the \n                preceding 3-year period with a correlating effect of \n                countering the appreciation of the Japanese yen; and\n                    (B) indirect currency intervention, such as \n                comments by officials of the Government of Japan on the \n                value of the Japanese yen that are accompanied by a \n                correlated change in the rate of exchange of the \n                Japanese yen with respect to the United States dollar \n                and other currencies.\n            (2) Exchange-rate misalignment.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``exchange-rate \n                misalignment'' means an undervaluation of the Japanese \n                yen as a result of protracted large-scale currency \n                intervention by or at the direction of the Government \n                of Japan in the exchange market. An undervaluation \n                exists if the observed exchange rate for the Japanese \n                yen is below the rate of exchange that could reasonably \n                be expected for the Japanese yen absent the \n                intervention.\n                    (B) Factors.--In determining whether exchange-rate \n                misalignment is occurring and a benefit thereby is \n                conferred, the Secretary in each case--\n                            (i) shall consider Japan's--\n                                    (I) bilateral balance-of-trade \n                                surplus or deficit with the United \n                                States;\n                                    (II) balance-of-trade surplus or \n                                deficit with its other trading partners \n                                individually and in the aggregate;\n                                    (III) foreign direct investment in \n                                its territory;\n                                    (IV) currency-specific and \n                                aggregate amounts of foreign currency \n                                reserve holdings; and\n                                    (V) mechanisms employed to maintain \n                                the Japanese yen at an undervalued rate \n                                of exchange with respect to the United \n                                States dollar and other currencies and, \n                                particularly, the nature, duration, and \n                                monetary expenditures of those \n                                mechanisms;\n                            (ii) may consider such other economic \n                        factors as are relevant; and\n                            (iii) shall measure the trade surpluses or \n                        deficits described in subclauses (I) and (II) \n                        of clause (i) with reference to the trade data \n                        reported by the United States and the other \n                        trading partners of Japan, unless such trade \n                        data are not available or are demonstrably \n                        inaccurate, in which case Japan's trade data \n                        may be relied upon if shown to be sufficiently \n                        accurate and trustworthy.\n                    (C) Computation.--In quantifying exchange-rate \n                misalignment, the Secretary shall develop and apply an \n                objective methodology that is consistent with widely \n                recognized macroeconomic theory and shall rely upon \n                governmentally published and other publicly available \n                and reliable data.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Treasury.\n\nSEC. 4.
