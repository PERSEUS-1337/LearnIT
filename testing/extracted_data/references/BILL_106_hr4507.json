FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) modern and efficient fixed guideway transportation is \n        important to the viability and well being of metropolitan areas \n        and to the energy conservation and self-sufficiency goals of \n        the United States;\n            (2) public convenience and necessity require the \n        development of fixed guideway transportation systems in \n        metropolitan areas presently without such service, and the \n        expansion of existing systems in metropolitan areas already \n        receiving such service;\n            (3) use of existing railroad trackage and rights-of-way in \n        and around metropolitan areas provides a unique and valuable \n        opportunity for the development and expansion of fixed guideway \n        transportation facilities with a minimum of disruption to the \n        environment and the surrounding community; and\n            (4) voluntary negotiations between mass transportation \n        authorities and rail carriers regarding shared use of existing \n        railroad trackage and rights-of-way have not been adequate to \n        ensure the development of sound and efficient fixed guideway \n        transportation systems.\n\nSEC. 3. RAIL TRANSIT ACCESS.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Part E of subtitle V of title 49, United States \nCode, is amended by adding at the end the following new chapter:\n\n                   ``CHAPTER 285--RAIL TRANSIT ACCESS\n\n``Sec.\n``28501. Definitions.\n``28502. Shared use of rail carrier trackage by mass transportation \n                            authorities.\n``28503. Shared use of rail rights-of-way by mass transportation \n                            authorities.\n``28504. Applicability of other laws.\n``28505. Standards for Board action.\n``Sec. 28501. Definitions\n    ``In this chapter--\n            ``(1) `Board' means the Surface Transportation Board;\n            ``(2) `fixed guideway transportation' means mass \n        transportation (as defined in section 5302(a)(7)) provided on, \n        by, or using a fixed guideway (as defined in section \n        5302(a)(4));\n            ``(3) `mass transportation authority' means a local \n        governmental authority (as defined in section 5302(a)(6)) \n        established to provide, or make a contract providing for, fixed \n        guideway transportation;\n            ``(4) `rail carrier' means a person providing common \n        carrier railroad transportation for compensation subject to the \n        jurisdiction of the Board under chapter 105;\n            ``(5) `segregated fixed guideway facility' means a fixed \n        guideway facility constructed within the railroad right-of-way \n        of a rail carrier but physically separate from trackage, \n        including relocated trackage, within the right-of-way used by a \n        rail carrier for freight transportation purposes; and\n            ``(6) `trackage' means a railroad line of a rail carrier, \n        including a spur, industrial, team, switching, side, yard, or \n        station track, and a facility of a rail carrier.\n``Sec. 28502. Shared use of rail carrier trackage by mass \n              transportation authorities\n    ``(a) Authority.--If, after negotiation, a mass transportation \nauthority cannot reach agreement with a rail carrier to use trackage \nof, and have related services provided by, the rail carrier for \npurposes of fixed guideway transportation, the Board shall, upon \napplication of the mass transportation authority or the rail carrier, \nand if the Board finds it necessary or useful to carry out this \nchapter--\n            ``(1) order that the trackage be made available and the \n        related services be provided to the mass transportation \n        authority; and\n            ``(2) prescribe reasonable terms and compensation for use \n        of the trackage and provision of the related services, based \n        upon the rail carrier's incremental cost of providing such \n        trackage and services.\n    ``(b) Quality of Service.--When prescribing reasonable compensation \nunder subsection (a)(2), the Board shall consider quality of service as \na major factor when determining whether, and the extent to which, the \namount of compensation shall be greater than the incremental costs of \nusing the trackage and providing the related services.\n    ``(c) Terms of Operation.--When prescribing reasonable terms under \nsubsection (a)(2), the Board may prescribe the number of trains that \nmay be operated by or for the mass transportation authority, the speeds \nat which such trains may be operated, and the trackage maintenance \nlevels to be provided by the rail carrier.\n    ``(d) Additional Trains.--When a rail carrier and a mass \ntransportation authority cannot agree to terms for the operation of \nadditional trains by or for a mass transportation authority over a rail \nline of the carrier, the mass transportation authority or the rail \ncarrier may apply to the Board for an order establishing such terms. If \nthe Board finds it reasonable to carry out this chapter, the Board \nshall order the rail carrier to allow operation of the requested \nadditional trains on such terms as the Board finds reasonable under the \ncircumstances.\n    ``(e) Trackage Maintenance.--If a mass transportation authority \nbelieves that maintenance on trackage operated by or for the mass \ntransportation authority has fallen below a safe or necessary level, \nthe mass transportation authority may, after notice to the rail carrier \nand a sufficient period for maintenance improvements, apply to the \nBoard for an order requiring the rail carrier to provide increased or \nimproved maintenance on the trackage. If the Board finds it reasonable \nto carry out this part, the Board shall order the rail carrier to \nprovide such increased or improved maintenance as the Board finds \nreasonable under the circumstances. The remedy available under this \nsubsection shall be in addition to any contract rights that a mass \ntransportation authority may possess with respect to trackage \nmaintenance.\n    ``(f) Accelerated Speeds.--If a rail carrier refuses to allow \naccelerated speeds for trains operated by or for a mass transportation \nauthority, the mass transportation authority may apply to the Board for \nan order requiring the rail carrier to allow the accelerated speeds and \nrelated improvements. The Board shall decide whether accelerated speeds \nare unsafe or impracticable and which improvements would be required to \nmake accelerated speeds safe and practicable. The Board shall establish \nthe maximum allowable speeds for trains operated by or for a mass \ntransportation authority on terms the Board decides are reasonable.\n    ``(g) Preference Over Freight Transportation.--Except in an \nemergency, fixed guideway transportation provided by or for a mass \ntransportation authority pursuant to an order issued under subsection \n(a) has preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, \njunction, or crossing unless the Board orders otherwise under this \nchapter. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may apply to the \nBoard for relief. If the Board decides that preference for fixed \nguideway transportation materially will lessen the quality of freight \ntransportation provided to shippers, the Board shall establish the \nrights of the rail carrier and the mass transportation authority on \nreasonable terms.\n    ``(h) Final Determination.--The Board shall make a determination \nunder this section not later than 120 days after a mass transportation \nauthority or a rail carrier submits an application to the Board.\n``Sec. 28503. Shared use of rail rights-of-way by mass transportation \n              authorities\n    ``(a) General Authority.--If, after negotiation, a mass \ntransportation authority cannot reach agreement with a rail carrier to \nacquire an interest in a railroad right-of-way for the construction and \noperation of a segregated fixed guideway facility, the mass \ntransportation authority may apply to the Board for an order requiring \nthe rail carrier to convey an interest to the authority. The Board, not \nlater than 120 days after receiving the application, shall order the \ninterest conveyed if--\n            ``(1) conveyance will not impair significantly the \n        efficient handling of rail freight traffic;\n            ``(2) the mass transportation authority assumes all \n        reasonable costs associated with any necessary relocation of a \n        rail carrier's trackage within the right-of-way; and\n            ``(3) the fixed guideway transportation purpose of the \n        proposed segregated fixed guideway facility cannot be met \n        adequately by acquiring an interest in other property.\n    ``(b) Compensation and Terms.--A conveyance ordered by the Board \nunder this section shall be subject to the payment of just compensation \nand to such other reasonable terms as the Board may prescribe.\n``Sec. 28504.
