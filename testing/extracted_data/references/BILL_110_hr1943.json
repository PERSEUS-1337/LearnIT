(Medical personnel need not provide routine \n                HIV testing to an inmate who is transferred to a \n                facility from another facility if the inmate's medical \n                records are transferred with the inmate and indicate \n                that the inmate has been tested previously.).\n                    (B) To all inmates admitted to a facility prior to \n                the effective date of this policy, medical personnel \n                shall provide routine HIV testing within no more than 6 \n                months. HIV testing for these inmates may be performed \n                in conjunction with other health services provided to \n                these inmates by medical personnel.\n                    (C) All HIV tests under this paragraph shall comply \n                with paragraph (9).\n            (2) Pre-test and post-test counseling.--Medical personnel \n        shall provide confidential pre-test and post-test counseling to \n        all inmates who are tested for HIV. Counseling may be included \n        with other general health counseling provided to inmates by \n        medical personnel.\n            (3) HIV/AIDS prevention education.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall improve HIV/AIDS \n                awareness through frequent educational programs for all \n                inmates. HIV/AIDS educational programs may be provided \n                by community based organizations, local health \n                departments, and inmate peer educators. These HIV/AIDS \n                educational programs shall include information on modes \n                of transmission, including transmission through \n                tattooing, sexual contact, and intravenous drug use; \n                prevention methods; treatment; and disease progression. \n                HIV/AIDS educational programs shall be culturally \n                sensitive, conducted in a variety of languages, and \n                present scientifically accurate information in a clear \n                and understandable manner.\n                    (B) HIV/AIDS educational materials shall be made \n                available to all inmates at orientation, at health care \n                clinics, at regular educational programs, and prior to \n                release. Both written and audio-visual materials shall \n                be made available to all inmates. These materials shall \n                be culturally sensitive, written for low literacy \n                levels, and available in a variety of languages.\n            (4) HIV testing upon request.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall allow inmates to obtain \n                HIV tests upon request once per year or whenever an \n                inmate has a reason to believe the inmate may have been \n                exposed to HIV. Medical personnel shall, both orally \n                and in writing, inform inmates, during orientation and \n                periodically throughout incarceration, of their right \n                to obtain HIV tests.\n                    (B) Medical personnel shall encourage inmates to \n                request HIV tests if the inmate is sexually active, has \n                been raped, uses intravenous drugs, receives a tattoo, \n                or if the inmate is concerned that the inmate may have \n                been exposed to HIV/AIDS.\n                    (C) An inmate's request for an HIV test shall not \n                be considered an indication that the inmate has put \n                him/herself at risk of infection and/or committed a \n                violation of prison rules.\n            (5) HIV testing of pregnant woman.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall provide routine HIV \n                testing to all inmates who become pregnant.\n                    (B) All HIV tests under this paragraph shall comply \n                with paragraph (9).\n            (6) Comprehensive treatment.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall provide all inmates who \n                test positive for HIV--\n                            (i) timely, comprehensive medical \n                        treatment;\n                            (ii) confidential counseling on managing \n                        their medical condition and preventing its \n                        transmission to other persons; and\n                            (iii) voluntary partner notification \n                        services.\n                    (B) Medical care provided under this paragraph \n                shall be consistent with current Department of Health \n                and Human Services guidelines and standard medical \n                practice. Medical personnel shall discuss treatment \n                options, the importance of adherence to antiretroviral \n                therapy, and the side effects of medications with \n                inmates receiving treatment.\n                    (C) Medical and pharmacy personnel shall ensure \n                that the facility formulary contains all Food and Drug \n                Administration-approved medications necessary to \n                provide comprehensive treatment for inmates living with \n                HIV/AIDS, and that the facility maintains adequate \n                supplies of such medications to meet inmates' medical \n                needs. Medical and pharmacy personnel shall also \n                develop and implement automatic renewal systems for \n                these medications to prevent interruptions in care.\n                    (D) Correctional staff and medical and pharmacy \n                personnel shall develop and implement distribution \n                procedures to ensure timely and confidential access to \n                medications.\n            (7) Protection of confidentiality.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall develop and implement \n                procedures to ensure the confidentiality of inmate \n                tests, diagnoses, and treatment. Medical personnel and \n                correctional staff shall receive regular training on \n                the implementation of these procedures. Penalties for \n                violations of inmate confidentiality by medical \n                personnel or correctional staff shall be specified and \n                strictly enforced.\n                    (B) HIV testing, counseling, and treatment shall be \n                provided in a confidential setting where other routine \n                health services are provided and in a manner that \n                allows the inmate to request and obtain these services \n                as routine medical services.\n            (8) Testing, counseling, and referral prior to reentry.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall provide routine HIV \n                testing to all inmates no more than 3 months prior to \n                their release and reentry into the community. (Inmates \n                who are already known to be infected need not be tested \n                again.). This requirement may be waived if an inmate's \n                release occurs without sufficient notice to the Bureau \n                to allow medical personnel to perform a routine HIV \n                test and notify the inmate of the results.\n                    (B) All HIV tests under this paragraph shall comply \n                with paragraph (9).\n                    (C) To all inmates who test positive for HIV and \n                all inmates who already are known to have HIV/AIDS, \n                medical personnel shall provide--\n                            (i) confidential prerelease counseling on \n                        managing their medical condition in the \n                        community, accessing appropriate treatment and \n                        services in the community, and preventing the \n                        transmission of their condition to family \n                        members and other persons in the community;\n                            (ii) referrals to appropriate health care \n                        providers and social service agencies in the \n                        community that meet the inmate's individual \n                        needs, including voluntary partner notification \n                        services and prevention counseling services for \n                        people living with HIV/AIDS; and\n                            (iii) a 30-day supply of any medically \n                        necessary medications the inmate is currently \n                        receiving.\n            (9) Opt-out provision.--Inmates shall have the right to \n        refuse routine HIV testing. Inmates shall be informed both \n        orally and in writing of this right. Oral and written \n        disclosure of this right may be included with other general \n        health information and counseling provided to inmates by \n        medical personnel. If an inmate refuses a routine test for HIV, \n        medical personnel shall make a note of the inmate's refusal in \n        the inmate's confidential medical records. However, the \n        inmate's refusal shall not be considered a violation of prison \n        rules or result in disciplinary action.\n            (10) Exposure incident testing.--The Bureau may perform HIV \n        testing of an inmate under section 4014 of title 18, United \n        States Code. HIV testing of an inmate who is involved in an \n        exposure incident is not ``routine HIV testing'' for the \n        purposes of paragraph (9) and does not require the inmate's \n        consent. Medical personnel shall document the reason for \n        exposure incident testing in the inmate's confidential medical \n        records.\n            (11) Timely notification of test results.--Medical \n        personnel shall provide timely notification to inmates of the \n        results of HIV tests.\n\nSEC. 4. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW.\n\n    (a) Screening in General.--Section 4014(a) of title 18, United \nStates Code, is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``for a period of 6 months or more'';\n            (2) by striking ``, as appropriate,''; and\n            (3) by striking ``if such individual is determined to be at \n        risk for infection with such virus in accordance with the \n        guidelines issued by the Bureau of Prisons relating to \n        infectious disease management'' and inserting ``unless the \n        individual declines. The Attorney General shall also cause such \n        individual to be so tested before release unless the individual \n        declines''.\n    (b) Inadmissibility of HIV Test Results in Civil and Criminal \nProceedings.--Section 4014(d) of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by inserting ``or under the Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2007'' \nafter ``under this section''.\n    (c) Screening as Part of Routine Screening.--Section 4014(e) of \ntitle 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing: ``Such rules shall also provide that the initial test under \nthis section be performed as part of the routine health screening \nconducted at intake.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
