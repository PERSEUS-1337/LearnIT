SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Christopher Bryski \nStudent Loan Protection Act'' and ``Christopher's Law''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is no requirement for Federal or private \n        educational lenders to provide information with respect to \n        creating a durable power of attorney for financial \n        decisionmaking in accordance with State law to be used in the \n        event of the death, incapacitation, or disability of the \n        borrower or such cosigner (if any).\n            (2) No requirement exists for private educational lenders' \n        master promissory notes to include a clear and conspicuous \n        description of the responsibilities of a borrower and cosigner \n        in the event the borrower or cosigner becomes disabled, \n        incapacitated, or dies.\n            (3) Of the 1,400,000 people who sustain a traumatic brain \n        injury each year in the United States, 50,000 die; 235,000 are \n        hospitalized; and 1,100,000 are treated and released from an \n        emergency department.\n            (4) It is estimated that the annual incidence of spinal \n        cord injury, not including those who die at the scene of an \n        accident, is approximately 40 cases per 1,000,000 people in the \n        United States or approximately 12,000 new cases each year. \n        Since there have not been any overall incidence studies of \n        spinal cord injuries in the United States since the 1970s, it \n        is not known if incidence has changed in recent years.\n            (5) In the 2007-2008 academic year, 13 percent of students \n        attending a 4-year public school, and 26.2 percent of students \n        attending a 4-year private school, borrowed monies from private \n        educational lenders.\n            (6) According to Sallie Mae, in 2009, the number of \n        cosigned private education loans increased from 66 percent to \n        84 percent of all private education loans.\n\nSEC. 2.
