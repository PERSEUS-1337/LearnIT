FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the ability of the United States to declare more \n        effective educational services to its citizens, especially \n        disadvantaged citizens and traditionally underserved citizens, \n        is of primary importance to the national security and to the \n        continued role of the United States as a world leader;\n            (2) the ability of local school authorities to effectively \n        administer and improve the public schools under their \n        leadership is impeded by the paperwork burden and regulatory \n        limitations imposed by numerous education programs administered \n        by the Federal Government and by the States;\n            (3) because American society and student needs are changing \n        quickly, schools and schooling must be flexible and innovative \n        in order to sustain relevance and vitality in an increasingly \n        challenging world;\n            (4) educational funding flexibility at the State and local \n        level has proven to be effective means toward educational \n        reform in States nationwide, and this flexibility should be \n        expanded to cover Federal requirements that may impede \n        educational achievement; and\n            (5) real and fundamental change in the structure of schools \n        and education will emerge from school reform initiatives and \n        such change should be based on professional knowledge and a \n        solid foundation of research.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to allow States, local educational \nagencies, and schools the flexibility to use and combine Federal, \nState, and local funds to improve the educational achievement of all \nelementary and secondary school students, including students with \ndisabilities, students who are disadvantaged, and students who are \nlimited English proficient, and to help schools and students meet the \nNational Education Goals by waiving certain statutory and regulatory \nrequirements (not including the appropriate protections with respect to \ncivil rights, discrimination, and safety).\n\nSEC. 4.
