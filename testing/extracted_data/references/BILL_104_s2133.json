FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The history of the United States is in large measure \n        the history of how the United States was populated.\n            (2) The evolution of the American population is broadly \n        termed the ``peopling of America'' and is characterized by the \n        movement of groups of people across external and internal \n        boundaries of the United States as well as by the interactions \n        of such groups with each other.\n            (3) Each of these groups has made unique, important \n        contributions to American history, culture, art, and life.\n            (4) The spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and \n        economic vitality of the United States is a result of the \n        pluralism and diversity of the population.\n            (5) The Smithsonian Institution operates 16 museums and \n        galleries, a zoological park, and 5 major research facilities. \n        None of these public entities is a national institution \n        dedicated to presenting the history of the peopling of the \n        United States as described in paragraph (2).\n            (6) The respective missions of the National Museum of \n        American History of the Smithsonian Institution and the Ellis \n        Island Immigration Museum of the National Park Service limit \n        the ability of such museums to present fully and adequately the \n        history of the diverse population and rich cultures of the \n        United States.\n            (7) The absence of a national facility dedicated solely to \n        presenting the history of the peopling of the United States \n        restricts the ability of the citizens of the United States to \n        fully understand the rich and varied heritage of the United \n        States derived from the unique histories of many peoples from \n        many lands.\n            (8) The establishment of a Center for American Cultural \n        Heritage to conduct educational and interpretive programs on \n        the history of the United States' multiethnic, multiracial \n        character will help to inspire and better inform the citizens \n        of the United States about the rich and diverse cultural \n        heritage of the citizens of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
