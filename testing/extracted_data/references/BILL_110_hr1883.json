ADMINISTRATIVE NATURALIZATION CEREMONIES.\n\n    Section 337 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1448) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(e)(1) The ceremonies described in subsection (d) shall, at a \nminimum, contain the following events:\n                    ``(A) The introduction will consist of preparatory \n                remarks to explain the nature and significance of the \n                ceremony as well as an introduction of the Department \n                of Homeland Security representative conducting the \n                ceremony and special guests, participants, or groups.\n                    ``(B) The introduction of the new citizens may be \n                accomplished either by Department of Homeland Security \n                personnel or by the individuals themselves. The name \n                and country of origin of each applicant should be \n                included. If it is not practical to include the name of \n                each applicant due to the size of the group being \n                naturalized, a brief statement setting forth the number \n                of persons to be administered the oath and their \n                countries of origin should be made.\n                    ``(C) The oath of allegiance is administered by a \n                Department of Homeland Security officer consistent with \n                this section.\n                    ``(D) The new citizens should be requested to \n                recite the pledge of allegiance to the flag of the \n                United States. Either Service personnel, a guest, or \n                one of the new citizens may lead the group.\n                    ``(E) A guest speaker (e.g., prominent civic \n                leader, naturalized citizen, judge, etc.) or a \n                Department of Homeland Security official will deliver \n                appropriate remarks. A prepared statement or \n                congratulatory message from the President, Attorney \n                General, or Commissioner may be used. The address \n                should focus on the form and distinctiveness of the \n                United States Government and the privileges and \n                responsibilities of citizenship.\n                    ``(F) Civic and patriotic groups (e.g., D.A.R., \n                League of Women Voters, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Boy \n                Scouts, etc.) should be introduced and allowed to \n                present brief congratulatory remarks or special \n                programs.\n                    ``(G) An individual commencement-style presentation \n                should be used if possible; or the certificate may be \n                delivered at the conclusion of the ceremony. Subsequent \n                delivery via mail should be avoided. The new citizens \n                are to be provided with appropriate commemorative \n                material, and the President's welcoming letter.\n    ``(2) Ceremonies may include activities in addition to those \nspecified in paragraph (1) if the activities are in keeping with the \ndignity of the occasion.\n    ``(3) Care should be taken to avoid associating ceremonies with \nsuch activities as partisan political functions, denominational \nreligious functions, sporting events, or functions designed to draw \ncrowds unrelated to the ceremony and which would not be in keeping with \nthe dignity of the naturalization process.\n    ``(f)(1) The ceremonies described in subsection (d) may be \nconducted at--\n            ``(A) Department of Homeland Security offices or \n        facilities;\n            ``(B) public sites such as city, county, state or Federal \n        buildings;\n            ``(C) school auditoriums, possibly as a part of civics \n        curricula;\n            ``(D) court facilities;\n            ``(E) historic sites (ideally as a part of special \n        commemorative events);\n            ``(F) Outreach locations, such as community agencies or \n        fraternal organizations; or\n            ``(G) other appropriate facilities in keeping with the \n        dignity of the occasion.\n    ``(2) The decor of the oath ceremony location must be in keeping \nwith the dignity and importance of the conferring of United States \ncitizenship. While the Department of Homeland Security office need not \ncopy doggedly the decor of a typical Federal court house, such type of \ndecor should be kept in mind when planning ceremonies. At a minimum, \nthe flag of the United States and the Department of Homeland Security \npennant will be prominently displayed. A dais or podium should be \nprovided for the use of the officiating employees and speakers. \nFacilities must be clean and neat. When planning space requirements, \nample provision must be made for the guests of new citizens.\n    ``(g) A separate calendar reflecting dates of administrative oath \nceremonies for the calendar year shall be completed for each Department \nof Homeland Security office conducting naturalization activities. It \nshall be completed by January 31 of each year. The calendar, in \naddition to the dates of the ceremonies, must reflect the location of \neach ceremony and the number of persons to be scheduled for the \nceremony. It must also indicate the total number of oath ceremonies \nactually held in the prior calendar year, and the number of abbreviated \nceremonies held pursuant to subsection (h).\n    ``(h)(1) When a district director or officer-in-charge determines \nthat it is in the national interest that an applicant not wait until a \nscheduled oath ceremony to be administered the oath, an abbreviated \noath ceremony may be held. In such case, only those items listed in \nsubparagraphs (C), (E), and (G) of subsection (e)(1) need be included \nin the ceremony.\n    ``(2) When it is determined that an abbreviated ceremony will be \nheld, the district director or officer-in-charge will place in the \napplicant's service file a memorandum explaining the need for the \nabbreviated ceremony.''."
