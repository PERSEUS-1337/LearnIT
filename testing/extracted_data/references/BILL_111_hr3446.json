FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the United States Census Bureau, United \n        States ports handled $3.95 trillion in international trade for \n        an all-encompassing range of goods and services in fiscal year \n        2007, with nearly 1.4 billion tons, valued at $1.4 trillion, in \n        waterborne imports and exports alone.\n            (2) According to the United States Census Bureau, United \n        States ports generated more than $23.2 billion in United States \n        Customs duty revenues in fiscal year 2007, representing 70 \n        percent of all Customs duties collected.\n            (3) According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n        transportation sector accounted for about 27 percent of the \n        total United States greenhouse gas emissions in 2003, up from \n        24.8 percent in 1990.\n            (4) According to the California Air Resources Board's \n        Diesel Particulate Matter Exposure Assessment, which includes \n        our Nation's largest port complex, marine emissions account for \n        30 percent of all diesel particulate matter in California.\n            (5) According to a 2009 report published in Environmental \n        Science and Technology, at least 2,000 to 5,000 premature \n        deaths per year in the continental United States are caused by \n        particulate pollution from oceangoing vessels.\n            (6) According to the Department of Energy, transportation \n        energy use is expected to increase 48 percent between 2003 and \n        2025, despite modest improvements in the efficiency of vehicle \n        engines.\n            (7) According to a recent study conducted by the National \n        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it is estimated that \n        0.9 teragrams, or about 2.2 million pounds, of particle \n        pollution are emitted each year from shipping vessels on a \n        global basis.\n            (8) Using on-dock clean technologies such as smoke stack \n        filtration, cold ironing, and low-emission port vehicles can \n        remove up to 95 percent of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and \n        particulate matter from the engines and boilers of vessels \n        while at berth.\n            (9) Using low-emission rail yard locomotives can cut air \n        emissions by up to 80 percent and reduce diesel fuel use by 16 \n        percent compared to conventional diesel-powered locomotives \n        used in switching service.\n            (10) In the past years, the Nation's busiest port complex, \n        the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, have achieved major \n        pollution reductions through the implementation of clean port \n        technologies. Examples include the percent of vessel calls that \n        switched to a cleaner fuel for auxiliary engines at berth, 100 \n        percent in 2007 as compared to 14 percent in 2005, and over 30 \n        percent reduction in particulate matter emissions in just two \n        years. Both ports are on target of cutting diesel-related \n        particulate matter (PM) pollution by more than 47 percent, \n        sulfur oxides (SOx) by more than 52 percent, and smog forming \n        nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by more than 45 percent within \n        the next five years.\n            (11) It is in the national interest of the United States to \n        encourage and facilitate the acquisition and use of fuel \n        efficient and low emission technologies and vehicles to reduce \n        fuel use and pollution at and near ports, and enact \n        environmentally friendly shipping regulations such as lowering \n        vessel speeds coming into and out of ports, which mitigate the \n        environmental damage to the air quality in and around America's \n        port communities.\n\nSEC. 3.
