    "content": "Beginning in early 2001, shortly after the presidential inaugurations at nearly identical times,the administrations of President George W. Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico have engagedregularly in a series of discussions and agreements on closely related migration and border securityissues. They launched these discussions in the context of past policies, and they have sustained thesediscussions despite less-than-expected progress in the period following the terrorist attacks upon theUnited States in 2001 and disagreements over U.S. involvement in Iraq in 2003. (2)  Presidents Bush and Fox began the bilateral discussions in the context of the immigrationand border security policies of the past, particularly the U.S. immigration reforms of 1986 and 1996,the initiatives of the administrations of President William Clinton and President Ernesto Zedillo ofMexico, and the enactment of the Legal Immigrant Family Equity (LIFE) Act of 2000 that will besummarized briefly. Immigration Reform Act of 1986. In 1986,during the Reagan presidency, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986( P.L. 99-603 ). Main provisions of the act include civil and criminal penalties for U.S. employerswho knowingly hire undocumented workers; increased border control and enforcement measures;anti-discrimination safeguards; provision for legalization of illegal aliens who resided continuouslyin the United States before 1982; and a special legalization for farm workers previously employedon American farms. The act sought to combine the sanctions for employers who knowingly hireundocumented workers and tougher border control and enforcement measures to discourage futureimmigration, with the provision of amnesty or legalization for undocumented migrants who alreadyhad long-established ties to the United States. The latter provision is often characterized as an\"amnesty\" because it permitted aliens living in the United States illegally to adjust their status tolegal permanent residents (LPRs) under certain procedures and with rights to obtain citizenship inthe future. (3)  Immigration Reform and Welfare Reform Acts of1996. In 1996, during the Clinton presidency, Congress passed two majorimmigration reform measures to control illegal immigration and to limit the eligibility of aliens forfederal programs. One was the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of1996 (IIRIRA), Division C of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY1997 ( P.L.104-208 ). The other was the 1996 welfare law entitled the Personal Responsibility and WorkOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-193 ). The first measure sought to control illegalimmigration through increased penalties for unlawful presence in the United States and increasedimmigration enforcement. Individuals who depart the United States after more than 180 days ofunlawful presence now face either a 3- or 10-year bar to admission to the United States, dependingon the total period of unlawful presence. IIRIRA provisions also added 1,000 Border Patrol agentsper year for five years (FY1997-FY2001), along with additional personnel, equipment, andprocedures. The second measure and to some extent the first sought to reduce the attractiveness ofimmigration by restricting the eligibility of aliens for federal programs. (4)  Clinton-Zedillo Initiatives. In the context of theU.S. legislation outlined above, the Administration of President William Clinton (1993-2001)pursued a number of initiatives on its own and with the Administration of President Ernesto Zedillo(1994-2000) in the migration, border security, and drug control areas. The countries formalizedregular bilateral consultations between consulates and border agencies through the Border LiaisonMechanisms, and they issued a Binational Study on Migration in 1997 that found that unauthorizedmigration carries costs for both countries. They also pursued a Border Safety Campaign to reduceviolence and deaths on the border through public information campaigns, and search and rescueprograms. In mid-May 2000, following expressions of concern over private ranchers detainingMexican migrants in Arizona, the governments announced that they would prosecute any unlawfulbehavior by private citizens, combat migrant smugglers, and expand regular consultationmechanisms. In the counter-narcotics area, the countries established the High Level Contact Group(HLCG) for cabinet-level anti-drug coordination twice a year. Acting through this and othermechanisms, the countries developed a joint anti-drug strategy in early February 1998, adoptedextensive anti-money laundering measures in 2000, and facilitated the vastly expanded U.S. trainingof law enforcement and military units involved in counter-narcotics activities. (5)  Legal Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act of2000. Beginning around the year 2000, the U.S. Congress began to shift thedirection of policy from the 1996 immigration legislation. In February 2000, the AFL-CIO calledfor amnesty for established illegal immigrants in the United States, a more lenient immigrationpolicy, and universal enforcement of workers rights, and this approach was generally supported bythe Clinton Administration. While some Members attempted to pass variations of the Latino andImmigrant Fairness Act (LIFA), embodied in S. 3095 (sponsored by Senator EdwardKennedy), in the end it was the Legal Immigrant Family Equity (LIFE) Act, incorporated in H.R. 4942 , supported by Representatives Henry Bonilla and Lamar Smith and bySenator Hatch that prevailed and was signed into law ( P.L. 106-553 ). As modified, this legislationcreated and expanded visa categories for persons with pending family unification applications, andallowed certain aliens involved in class action court cases to adjust to LPR status. It also reinstateduntil April 30, 2001, Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which permittedunauthorized aliens to adjust to LPR status upon a payment of a fee if they were otherwise eligiblefor visas, without being forced to return to their native countries. Congress also increased thenumber of temporary H-1B professional workers, and it considered, but did not approve, measuresto increase the number of H-2A agricultural workers. (6)  Within the context of the background sketched above, President Fox and President Bush,who came to office at nearly the same time (December 2000 and January 2001, respectively) haveengaged in extensive consultations on migration and border issues. Mexican cooperation onsecurity matters was fairly limited, however, until the dramatic change of the world environmentfollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  President Bush's February 2001 Visit to Guanajuato, MexicoLaunches Bilateral Migration Talks. When President Bush met with President Foxin mid-February 2001, migration issues were among the main topics, with Mexican officialsexpressing concern about the number of migrants who die each year while seeking entry into theUnited States. President Fox has been pressing proposals for legalizing undocumented Mexicanworkers in the United States through amnesty or guest worker arrangements as a way of protectingtheir human rights. In the Joint Communique following the Bush-Fox meeting, the two presidentsagreed to instruct appropriate officials \"to engage, at the earliest opportunity, in formal high levelnegotiations aimed at achieving short and long-term agreements that will allow us to constructivelyaddress migration and labor issues between our two countries.\" During the joint press conference,President Bush indicated that there was a movement in Congress to review the drug certificationrequirements, and he expressed confidence in President Fox's efforts to combat drug trafficking. Several months later, on May 25, 2001, President Bush telephoned President Fox to expresscondolences for the recent deaths of 14 Mexican migrants in the Arizona desert, and both leadersreaffirmed their commitment to enhance safety along the border and to continue to make progresson migration issues. Press reports suggested that proposals to regularize the status of Mexicanworkers in the United States were being considered by the Administration and by Congress, butPresident Bush indicated that blanket amnesty would not be proposed. President Fox's Early September 2001 Official Visit toWashington, D.C. Advances Migration Talks and Launches Partnership forProsperity. During the opening day of President Fox's official visit to Washington,D.C. in early September 2001, he recognized that the anticipated migration agreements had not beenreached, but he called for the two governments to reach agreement on migration proposals by the endof the year.  At the end of the meetings, the Joint Statement of September 6, 2001, summarized themeeting as follows: The Presidents reviewed the progress made by our jointworking group on migration chaired by Secretaries Powell, Casta\u00c3\u00b1eda, and Creel and AttorneyGeneral Ashcroft and noted this represented the most fruitful and frank dialogue we have ever hadon a subject so important to both nations. They praised implementation of the border safety initiative,and recognized that migration-related issues are deeply felt by our publics and vital to our prosperity,well-being, and the kind of societies we want to build. They renewed their commitment to forgingnew and realistic approaches to migration to ensure it is safe, orderly, legal and dignified, and agreedon the framework within which this ongoing effort is based. This includes matching willing workerswith willing employers; serving the social and economic needs of both countries; respecting thehuman dignity of all migrants, regardless of their status; recognizing the contribution migrants maketo enriching both societies; shared responsibility for ensuring migration takes place through safe andlegal channels. Both stressed their commitment to continue our discussions, instructing thehigh-level working group to reach mutually satisfactory results on border safety, a temporary workerprogram and the status of undocumented Mexicans in the United States. They requested that theworking group provide them proposals with respect to these issues as soon as possible. ThePresidents recognized that this is an extraordinarily challenging area of public policy, and that it iscritical to address the issue in a timely manner and with appropriate thoroughness anddepth. In a related area, the Presidents launched the Partnership for Prosperity, a public-privatealliance of Mexican and U.S. governmental and business organizations to promote economicdevelopment throughout Mexico, but particularly in regions where lagging economic growth hasfueled out-migration. The Presidents called for a concrete plan of action to be prepared by March2002.  U.S. Emphasis on Security Following September 2001 TerroristAttacks. Following the terrorist attacks upon the United States on September 11,2001, less than a week after President Fox's visit to Washington, D.C., most U.S. executive andlegislative action focused on strengthening border security and alien admission and trackingprocedures. Congress passed and the President signed into law the USA Patriot Act of 2001 ( P.L.107-56 ), and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-173 ). With a similar security focus, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ), was passed inNovember 2002, incorporating the INS/Border Patrol, Customs, and other agencies into the newDepartment of Homeland Security. In other immigration-related action during the 107th Congress,the Congress expanded non-citizen eligibility for food stamps, extended benefits for certain refugeecategories, and created new non-immigrant visa sub-categories for border commuter students. (7)  President Bush's March 2002 Visit to Monterrey, MexicoLaunches Border Partnership (\"Smart Border\") Agreement. On March 22, 2002,President Bush traveled to Monterrey, Mexico, where he attended the International Conference onFinancing for Development, participated in a NAFTA trilateral meeting, and discussed Mexico-U.S.issues with President Fox. In the bilateral meeting, Presidents Bush and Fox announced a number of initiatives,including (1) a U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Action Plan with greater cooperation andtechnological enhancements at the border; (2) a Partnership for Prosperity Action Plan withpublic-private initiatives to promote domestic and foreign investment in less developed areas ofMexico with high migration rates; (3) agreement to seek legislative support to expand the mandateof the North American Development Bank (NADBank) and the Border Environmental CooperationCommission (BECC) to finance environmental infrastructure along the border; and (4) agreementto continue the cabinet-level talks to achieve safe, legal, and orderly migration flows between thecountries. The Presidents also noted \"major successes achieved by Mexico in the fight againstnarco-trafficking\" and agreed on \"the importance of redoubling judicial cooperation\" With regard to the migration talks, the Presidents stated in a Joint Statement on March 22,2002, as follows: Slightly more than one year ago, in Guanajuato, wetalked about migration as one of the major ties that join our societies. We launched then the frankestand most productive dialogue our countries have ever had on this important and challenging subject.Those talks have continued over the past year, and have yielded a clearer assessment of the scopeand nature of this issue. This bond between our nations can render countless benefits to ourrespective economies and families. Over the past year, important progress has been made to enhancemigrant safety and particularly in saving lives by discouraging and reducing illegal crossings indangerous terrain. On September 7, 2001, during President Fox's historic State Visit to Washington,we issued a joint statement instructing our cabinet-level working group to provide us with specificproposals to forge a new and realistic framework that will ensure a safe, legal, orderly, and dignifiedmigration flow between our countries. We have today agreed that our Cabinet level migration groupshould continue the work we charged it with in Guanajuato andWashington. Binational Commission Meetings in Mexico City in November2002. During the cabinet-level Binational Commission (BNC) meetings in MexicoCity, on November 25-26, 2002, Secretary of State Powell and Foreign Secretary Casta\u00c3\u00b1edareaffirmed the intention to continue talks toward a migration agreement. Secretary of State Powell'spress conference was summarized by the State Department as follows: \"The BNC's migrationworking group 'affirmed our strong commitment to advancing our bilateral migration agenda,' hestressed, adding that 'there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that this is a priority for PresidentBush, just as it is a priority for [Mexican] President [Vicente] Fox.'\" Powell said that no schedulehad been established for a migration accord, but he confirmed that the United States and Mexicowant to come up with a series of migration initiatives \"over the course of the next six months to ayear.\" Bilateral Developments on Security Issues in Early 2003 inContext of Conflict in Iraq. On January 11, 2003, President Fox designatedEconomy Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez as Mexico's new Foreign Minister, replacing JorgeCasta\u00c3\u00b1eda, who reportedly resigned, in part, out of frustration with the lack of progress in negotiatinga migration accord with the United States. On March 17, 2003, President Vicente Fox, in a televised speech to the nation, reiterated Mexico's position (articulated in the U.N. Security Council), that Iraqshould be disarmed by peaceful means and through multilateral mechanisms, but he indicated thatMexico's close relationship with the United States would not change. On March 21, 2003, it wasannounced that Mexico was ordering 18,000 soldiers to secure airports, border posts, and otheraccess points to the United States. On April 23, 2003, Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridgeand Secretary of Government Santiago Creel issued a joint statement on enhanced bilateralcooperation to create a smart border that facilitates the transit of goods and people while protectingagainst crime and terrorism. On May 7, 2003, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez metwith Secretary of State Colin Powell in Washington, D.C., with the object of strengthening thebilateral relationship. The day before, Minister Derbez indicated in a speech at the Center forStrategic and International Studies that security was the number one priority for Mexico. Reactions to House Action on Migration Agreement in May2003. On May 16, 2003, the House International Relations Committee reported out H.R. 1950 ( H.Rept. 108-105 , Part 1), with a provision in Section 731 stating the senseof Congress regarding a possible migration accord between the United States and Mexico. Thisprovision began as an amendment by Representative Menendez to which Representative Ballengeroffered a substitute amendment that was further modified by Representative Gallegly. In sum,Section 731, as reported, stated the sense of Congress that the United States should as soon aspracticable commence negotiations to reach a migration accord with Mexico that addresses the keyissues of concern in both countries, opens the Mexican petroleum monopoly (PEMEX) to reformand investment by U.S. oil companies, and addresses extradition and law enforcement issues.  Mexican officials and commentators criticized the Committee-reported provisions relatedto PEMEX and extradition as an intrusion in the domestic affairs of Mexico. The Office of theMexican Presidency issued a statement on May 11, 2003, acknowledging that the negotiation of amigration agreement was a priority for the Fox Administration, but pointing out that \"negotiatingsuch an agreement in exchange for opening up Petr\u00c3\u00b3leos Mexicanos (the state oil industry - PEMEX)to foreign investment would be wholly unacceptable.\" (8)  Reactions to Deaths of Migrants in Texas in May2003. In mid-May 2003, 19 migrants from Mexico and Central America, includingwomen and a child, died from asphyxiation and heatstroke near Victoria, Texas, after being crammedwith 50-100 people in an insulated trailer truck Several of the smugglers were arrested in thefollowing days for involvement in what was reported to be the worst such tragedy recorded in theUnited States. On May 27, 2003, the Washington Post reported on an interview with President Foxin which the Mexican President appealed for U.S. action on the long-delayed immigration accordand emphasized the partnership with the United States, despite disagreement on policy toward Iraq. On May 29, 2003, under President Fox's direction, a strike force of some 600 Mexican federal police,soldiers, and other agents launched an offensive against cross-border human smuggling rings, seizingoperatives of at least six organizations. Joint Operations in the Arizona-Sonora Desert in June2003.

Initiatives under the Partnership for Prosperity in June2003. On June 10, 2003, the United States and Mexico announced severalinitiatives following the meeting of private and governmental officials from both countries in SanFrancisco under the auspices of the Partnership for Prosperity. These initiatives were designed tosupport growth in areas of Mexico with high rates of migration to the United States. They includedan historic agreement for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to provide financialand insurance services to U.S. firms, development of a Peace Corps program in Mexico, and effortsto facilitate and reduce the cost of transfers of remittances from the United States to ruralcommunities in Mexico. Mexican Secretary of Government Calls for Bilateral MigrationAgreement in July 2003. On July 10, 2003, Secretary of Government SantiagoCreel, speaking at a U.S. Catholic Bishop's Conference in Washington, D.C., called for a bilateralmigration agreement in part because Mexican security efforts had prevented terrorist attacks fromsouth of the border. He argued that such an agreement would enhance U.S. security because givinglegal status to undocumented Mexican migrants living in the United States would transform themfrom unknown and possibly dangerous threats to fully identifiable and legal persons.  President Bush Proposes Immigration Reform in January 2004Along with Congressional Proposals. In early 2004, President Bush seeking torevive the immigration discussion, proposed an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system on January7, 2004, to permit the matching of willing foreign workers with willing U.S. employers when noAmericans can be found to fill the jobs. Under the President's proposal, temporary legal status wouldbe available to new foreign workers who have work offers in the United States and to undocumentedworkers already employed in the United States for a term of three years that could be renewed butwould end at some point. The proposal includes some incentives to encourage workers to return totheir home countries, such as credit in the worker's national retirement system and tax-deferredsavings accounts that could be collected upon return. (9)  A few days after his proposal, President Bush met with President Fox in Monterrey, Mexico,for a Special Summit of the Americas, and President Fox welcomed the Bush proposal as a veryimportant step forward. On January 20, 2004, President Bush called for passage of his immigrationreform proposal in the State of the Union address. Congressional initiatives in this area in the 108th Congress included S. 1387 (Cornyn) that would establish new temporary foreign worker programs under agreements withforeign countries; and S. 1645 (Craig)/ H.R. 3142 (Cannon), the \"AgJobs\"Bill, that would streamline the H-2A agricultural worker program, with provision for adjusting tolegal permanent resident (LPR) status.

He stressed that immigration reform to regularize the status of Mexican workers in the United Stateswould be a high priority during President Bush's second term. At the same time, he noted theconclusion of educational agreements that would advance Mexican competitiveness, housingagreements to strengthen the local mortgage market, agricultural agreements to advance cooperationon rural development programs, and environmental agreements to promote environmentalconservation.  Turning to the accomplishments of the Partnership for Prosperity (P4P), Secretary Powellnoted that these programs had lowered the fees for transferring funds from the United States toMexico, brought together more than 1,400 business and government leaders from both countries, anddeveloped innovative methods to finance infrastructure projects.

(13)  Congress Strengthens Border Control and Identity Card Standardsin Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. After extendednegotiations, an agreed conference report ( H.Rept. 108-796 ) on S. 2845 was filed onDecember 7, 2004, to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, with an agreementthat some of the difficult issues would be addressed early in the 109th Congress.

The enacted legislation contains provisions requiring more lawenforcement personnel for enforcing immigration laws, closer monitoring of the entry and exit ofaliens, and standards for identification documents and drivers' licenses. Under a leadershipagreement with certain Representatives, it was agreed that three issues in the House bill that weredropped in the conference report would be addressed early in the 109th Congress. These were provisions that would have banned the acceptance of Mexican consular ID cards by Federal officials,that would have prohibited the issuance of drivers' licenses to undocumented aliens, and that wouldhave required the completion of a section of a fence along the border with Mexico in California. Mexican Officials Argue in Early January 2005 that the Guidesfor Mexican Migrants Are to Protect Migrants from Dangers Despite NumerousCriticisms. Mexican officials stated in early January 2005 that the Guides forMexican Migrants issued by the Mexican government were to provide warnings and survival tipsfor Mexican migrants in dangerous terrain in order to save lives, not to facilitate illegal migrationas many critics from the United States alleged. The Mexican officials argued that the Guides suggestentry into the United States at official Ports of Entry with the necessary documentation and that otherinterpretations were inconsistent with Mexico's efforts to dismantle smuggling operations. Theydeclared that \"the Mexican government remains committed to ensuring that migration into theUnited States is legal, safe, orderly and respectful of the fundamental rights of people.\" Diplomatic Exchanges Between the United States and Mexico onBorder Violence in Late January 2005. On January 26, 2005, the U.S. StateDepartment issued a Public Announcement \"to alert U.S. citizens to the current security situationalong the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border in the wake of increased violence among drugtraffickers.\" While noting that the majority of travelers visit without mishap and that theoverwhelming majority of the victims have been Mexican citizens, it stated that \"U.S. citizens shouldbe aware of the risk posed by the deteriorating security situation.\" In a letter of explanation toMexican officials, U.S. Ambassador Antonio O. Garza noted that \"the elevated level of violencegenerally has resulted in greater risks to the thousands of American citizens visiting and passingthrough the border region every day. Increased numbers of murdered and kidnapped Americans inrecent months bear this out.\" He added, \"I worry that the inability of local law enforcement to cometo grips with rising drug warfare, kidnappings and random street violence will have a chilling effecton the cross-border exchange, tourism, and commerce so vital to the region's prosperity. I applaudthe strong expressions of concern voiced by President Fox to date, and hope that commitment willmake a difference at the state and local levels.\" On the following day, the Office of the Presidencyof the Mexican Republic issued a statement saying that Mexico shares the concerns of the U.S.government and regrets the alarm that the warning might provoke among U.S. citizens; that Mexicois taking determined action against drug trafficking; that drug trafficking is an internationalphenomenon which requires shared responsibility for attacking supply, as well as demand; and thatthe two countries have built a solid relationship that requires continued cooperation. On January 29,2005, Ambassador Garza met with the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs and issued a jointstatement that concluded: \"Both officials underscored that the successes in jointly addressingcommon problems demonstrate the value of bilateral cooperation. They reaffirmed thedetermination of their governments to continue cooperating in the fight against organized crime anddrug trafficking.\" President Bush Urges Immigration Reform in the State of theUnion Address in Early February 2005. During President Bush's State of the UnionAddress on February 2, 2005, he stated that the United States' immigration system was outdated andunsuited to the economic needs and the values of the country. He concluded with the followingstatement:  We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers,and invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guestworkers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering andleaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers andterrorists.
