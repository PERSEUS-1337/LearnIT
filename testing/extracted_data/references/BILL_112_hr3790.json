Sense of Congress.\nSec. 202. NIH Research on cancer symptom management improvement.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many people with cancer experience side effects, \n        symptoms, and late complications associated with their disease \n        and their treatment, which can have a serious adverse impact on \n        their health, well-being, and quality of life.\n            (2) Many side effects and symptoms associated with cancer \n        and its treatment can be reduced or controlled by the provision \n        of timely symptom management and services and also by educating \n        people with cancer and their caregivers about the potential \n        effects before treatment begins.\n            (3) Studies have found that individualized educational \n        intervention for cancer pain management from a registered nurse \n        was effective for patients with cancer being treated in \n        outpatient and home-based settings. Similarly, the number of \n        caregivers who said they were well informed and confident about \n        caregiving after attending a family caregiver cancer education \n        program which increased after program attendance.\n            (4) People with cancer benefit from having an educational \n        session with oncology nurses in advance of the initiation of \n        treatment to learn how to reduce the risk of and manage adverse \n        effects and maximize well-being. Helping patients to manage \n        their side effects reduces adverse events and the need for \n        urgent or inpatient care.\n            (5) The Oncology Nursing Society has received reports from \n        its members that, because the Medicare program and other payers \n        do not cover the provision of patient treatment education, \n        patients and their caregivers often do not receive adequate \n        education before the onset of such patients' treatment for \n        cancer regarding the course of such treatment and the possible \n        side effects and symptoms such patients may experience. The \n        Oncology Nursing Society recommends that all patients being \n        treated for cancer have a one-on-one educational session with a \n        nurse in advance of the onset of such treatment so that such \n        patients and their caregivers receive the information they need \n        to help minimize adverse events related to such treatment and \n        maximize the well-being of such patients.\n            (6) Insufficient or non-existent Medicare payments coupled \n        with poor investment in symptom management research contribute \n        to the inadequate education of patients, poor management and \n        monitoring of cancer symptoms, and inadequate handling of late \n        effects of cancer and its treatment.\n            (7) People with cancer often do not have the symptoms \n        associated with their disease and the associated treatment \n        managed in a comprehensive or appropriate manner.\n            (8) People with cancer deserve to have access to \n        comprehensive care that includes appropriate treatment and \n        symptom management.\n            (9) Patients who receive infused chemotherapy likely obtain \n        some treatment education during the course of the \n        administration of their treatment; yet, many do not, and \n        individuals who may receive a different type of cancer care, \n        such as radiation or surgical interventions or oral \n        chemotherapy taken at home, likely do not receive treatment \n        education during their treatment.\n            (10) Comprehensive cancer care must include access to \n        services and management associated with nausea, vomiting, \n        fatigue, depression, pain, and other symptoms.\n            (11) The Institute of Medicine report, ``Ensuring Quality \n        Cancer Care'' asserts that ``much can be done to relieve the \n        symptoms, ease distress, provide comfort, and in other ways \n        improve the quality of life of someone with cancer. For a \n        person with cancer, maintenance of quality of life requires, at \n        a minimum, relief from pain and other distressing symptoms, \n        relief from anxiety and depressions, including the fear of \n        pain, and a sense of security that assistance with be readily \n        available if needed.''.\n            (12) The Institute of Medicine report, ``Cancer Care for \n        the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health Needs'' \n        recognizes that cancer patients' psychosocial needs include \n        information about their therapies and the potential side \n        effects.\n            (13) As more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur among \n        individuals age 65 and older, the challenges of managing cancer \n        symptoms are growing for patients enrolled in the Medicare \n        program.\n            (14) Provision of Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer \n        patient treatment education, coupled with expanded cancer \n        symptom management research, will help improve care and quality \n        of life for people with cancer from the time of diagnosis \n        through survivorship or end of life.\n\n  TITLE I--COMPREHENSIVE CANCER PATIENT TREATMENT EDUCATION UNDER THE \n                            MEDICARE PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101.
