    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Event Data Recorder Enhancement \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Event data recorders have the potential to greatly \n        improve motor vehicle safety by improving occupant protection \n        systems and improving the accuracy of crash reconstructions.\n            (2) Event data recorder technology has potential safety \n        applications for all classes of motor vehicles.\n            (3) A wide range of crash-related and other data elements \n        have been identified which can usefully be captured by event \n        data recorders.\n            (4) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \n        incorporated event data recorder data collection in its motor \n        vehicle research databases.\n            (5) Open access to event data recorder data will benefit \n        researchers, crash investigators, and manufacturers in \n        improving motor vehicle safety.\n            (6) Studies of event data recorder information in Europe \n        and the United States have shown that driver and employee \n        awareness of an on-board event data recorder reduces the number \n        and severity of crashes.\n            (7) Given the differing nature of cars, vans, SUVs, and \n        other lightweight vehicles, compared to heavy trucks, school \n        buses, and motor coaches, different event data recorder data \n        systems may be required to meet the needs of each vehicle \n        class.\n            (8) The degree of benefit from an event data recorder is \n        directly related to the number of vehicles operating with an \n        event data recorder and the current infrastructure's ability to \n        use and assimilate the data.\n            (9) Automatic crash notification systems integrate the on-\n        board crash sensing and event data recorder technology with \n        other electronic systems, such as global positioning systems \n        and cellular telephones, to provide early notification of the \n        occurrence, nature, and location of a serious collision.\n\nSEC. 3. EVENT DATA RECORDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 301 of title 49, United \nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 30129. Event data recorders\n    ``(a) Required Event Data Recorders.--Not later than 6 months after \nthe date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall modify \nthe motor vehicle safety standard contained in part 563 of title 49, \nCode of Federal Regulations, to require that passenger automobiles (as \ndefined in section 32901(a)(16)) be equipped with an event data \nrecorder that meets the requirements for event data recorders set forth \nin such part. The Secretary shall require manufacturers to include such \nevent data recorders in--\n            ``(1) not less than 25 percent of their fleet beginning in \n        model year 2013;\n            ``(2) not less than 65 percent of their fleet beginning in \n        model year 2014; and\n            ``(3) 100 percent of their fleet beginning in model year \n        2015.\n    ``(b) Compatible Data Retrieval Tools.--Not later than 12 months \nafter the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall modify \nthe requirements in section 563.12 of title 49, Code of Federal \nRegulations, to require a standardized port for accessing and \nretrieving data stored in any event data recorder and that is \ncompatible with all such event data recorders regardless of the \nmanufacturer or model of the motor vehicle.\n    ``(c) Disclosure.--The owner's manual of each new motor vehicle \nsold or leased in the United States that is equipped with a recording \ndevice shall clearly indicate the presence of the event data recorder \nrequired under this section, in accordance with section 563.11 of title \n49, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).\n    ``(d) Privacy Protections.--Information recorded or transmitted by \nevent data recorder required under this section may not be retrieved by \na person other than the owner of the motor vehicle in which the \nrecording device is installed unless--\n            ``(1) a court authorizes retrieval of such information in \n        furtherance of a legal proceeding;\n            ``(2) the owner consents to such retrieval for any purpose, \n        including diagnosing, servicing, or repairing the motor \n        vehicle; or\n            ``(3)(A) the information is retrieved by a government motor \n        vehicle safety agency for the purpose of improving motor \n        vehicle safety; and\n            ``(B) the personally identifiable information of the owner \n        or driver of the vehicle or the vehicle identification number \n        is not disclosed in connection with the retrieved information.\n    ``(e) Non-Application to Trailers.--The requirements promulgated \nunder this section shall apply to all motor vehicles except trailers, \nas such term is defined in section 571.3 of title 49, Code of Federal \nRegulations.\n    ``(f) Definition of Model Year.--For purposes of this section, the \nterm `model year' means the manufacturer's annual production period \nthat begins on September 1 of a given year which includes January 1 of \nthe calendar year for which it is named. If the manufacturer has no \nannual production period, the term `model year' for that manufacturer \nmeans the calendar year.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of \nsuch chapter is amended by inserting after the item relating to section \n30128 the following new item:\n\n30129.
