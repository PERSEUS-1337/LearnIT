FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Substantial Federal funding, including roughly $8 \n        billion through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \n        (Public Law 111-5), has been or will be awarded to various \n        States to make high-speed rail in the United States a reality. \n        Significant additional Federal funding for high-speed rail is \n        anticipated in the coming years.\n            (2) Design, engineering, construction, operation, and \n        maintenance of the rail lines, among other responsibilities, \n        will be provided by any number of entities following \n        competitive bidding processes at the various State levels.\n            (3) High-speed rail offers tremendous economic, \n        environmental, and other benefits. Specifically, high-speed \n        rail will reduce travel time between population centers, remove \n        millions of tons of carbon and other greenhouse gasses from the \n        atmosphere, and provide jobs in engineering, construction, \n        operations, maintenance, and other areas.\n            (4) Given the substantial amount of Federal funds involved, \n        it is critical that proper due diligence be performed on \n        prospective bidders and it is imperative that companies \n        receiving such Federal funds represent our shared commitment to \n        human rights, respect, decency, and corporate ethics and \n        responsibility.\n            (5) Certain entities that have expressed an interest in \n        competing for high-speed rail grants in a number of States have \n        engaged in conduct which requires public disclosures and \n        scrutiny.\n            (6) Between March 1942 and August 1944, 75,000 Jews and \n        thousands of other ``undesirables'' were deported from France \n        to extermination and death camps on trains operated for profit \n        by certain companies that have expressed an intent to compete \n        for contracts relating to high-speed rail projects. United \n        States airmen who were shot down over France were among the \n        persons deported on these trains to those extermination and \n        death camps such as Auschwitz and Buchenwald.\n            (7) Tragically, the victims who were on these trains, many \n        of whom now reside in the United States, and their families \n        have yet to receive any measure of justice. Nonetheless, these \n        victims and their families are facing the prospect that their \n        Federal tax dollars may be awarded to a company responsible for \n        transporting them and their loved ones to extermination and \n        death camps for profit.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Direct involvement.--The term ``direct involvement'' \n        means ownership or operation of the trains on which individuals \n        were deported to extermination camps, death camps, or any \n        facility used for the purpose of transiting individuals to \n        extermination or death camps, during the period beginning on \n        January 1, 1942, and ending on December 31, 1944.\n            (2) Entity.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``entity'' means any \n                corporation, affiliate, or other entity that controls, \n                is controlled by or is under common control with, or \n                that is a member of a partnership or a consortium with, \n                an entity that certifies that it had any direct \n                involvement described in section 4(a).\n                    (B) Presumption of control.--An entity shall be \n                presumed to be in control of another corporation or \n                entity if it directly or indirectly controls more than \n                50 percent of the voting securities of the other \n                corporation or entity.\n                    (C) Equity interest by foreign state.--Such term \n                shall apply irrespective of whether or not any equity \n                interest in the entity is or was owned by a foreign \n                state or government, and if an equity interest in the \n                entity is or was owned by such a foreign state, such \n                term shall refer to the corporate entity itself and not \n                to such foreign state.\n            (3) Property.--The term ``property'' means any personal \n        belongings owned or controlled by the victims of the \n        deportations which may have been taken or confiscated in \n        connection with the deportations, including jewelry, books, \n        artifacts, precious metals, and currency.\n            (4) Records.--The term ``records'' includes any documents, \n        correspondence, memoranda, receipts, invoices, presentations, \n        audits, and any other related materials.\n            (5) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n        States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, \n        territory, or possession of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
