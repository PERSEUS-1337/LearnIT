FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to recent figures, 14 percent of pregnant \n        mothers admit to smoking tobacco during pregnancy.\n            (2) Smoking tobacco during pregnancy significantly \n        increases maternal and fetal risk, and causes 20 percent to 30 \n        percent of the low birth weight rate and 10 percent of the \n        fetal and infant death rate in the United States.\n            (3) Mothers who smoke both during and after pregnancy have \n        nearly a 3 fold increase in the risk of Sudden Infant Death \n        Syndrome (SIDS), as compared to mothers who do not smoke.\n            (4) Smoking during pregnancy has been associated with \n        certain childhood cancers and birth defects, and it increases \n        the risk of spontaneous abortion, premature rupture of \n        membranes, and delivery of a stillborn infant.\n            (5) Smoking during pregnancy may impede the growth of the \n        fetus and increase the likelihood of mental retardation by 50 \n        percent.\n            (6) The proportion of women who quit smoking during \n        pregnancy but relapse at 6 months postpartum is nearly 63 \n        percent, thereby exposing their infants to passive smoke and \n        increasing their risk for SIDS and other health related \n        problems.\n            (7) Effective prenatal smoking cessation interventions \n        increase the rate of smoking cessation during pregnancy.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to establish, within the Department \nof Health and Human Services, a comprehensive program to help prevent \nprenatal and postnatal smoking. Such program shall--\n            (1) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State and \n        community-based public awareness, prevention, and education \n        programs on prenatal and postnatal smoking;\n            (2) support, coordinate, and conduct basic and applied \n        research concerning prenatal and postnatal smoking and its \n        effects; and\n            (3) foster coordination between all Federal agencies and \n        private voluntary organizations that conduct or support \n        prenatal and postnatal smoking research, prevention, and \n        surveillance programs.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n    Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n      ``PART M--PRENATAL AND POSTNATAL SMOKING PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n``SEC. 399N.
