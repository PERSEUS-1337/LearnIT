CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the \n        Pentagon of September 11, 2001, resulted in a large number of \n        deaths and injuries, the destruction and damage to buildings, \n        and interruption of business operations;\n            (2) the attacks have inflicted the largest losses for a \n        man-made event ever incurred by insurers and reinsurers;\n            (3) while the insurance and reinsurance industries have \n        committed to pay the losses arising from the September 11 \n        attacks, the resulting disruption has created widespread market \n        uncertainties with regard to the risk of losses arising from \n        possible future terrorist attacks;\n            (4) such uncertainty threatens the continued availability \n        of United States commercial property casualty insurance for \n        terrorism risk at meaningful coverage levels;\n            (5) the unavailability of affordable commercial property \n        and casualty insurance for terrorist acts threatens the growth \n        and stability of the United States economy, by, among other \n        things, impeding the ability of financial services providers to \n        finance commercial property acquisitions and new construction;\n            (6) in the past, the private insurance markets have shown a \n        remarkable resiliency in adapting to changed circumstances, \n        and, given time, the private markets will diversify and develop \n        risk spreading mechanisms to increase capacity and guard \n        against possible future losses incurred by terrorist attacks;\n            (7) it is necessary in the short-term, however, to provide \n        Federal assistance and to create a temporary industry risk \n        sharing program to ensure the continued availability of \n        commercial property and casualty insurance and reinsurance for \n        terrorism-related risks;\n            (8) such action is necessary to limit immediate market \n        disruptions, encourage economic stabilization, and facilitate a \n        transition to a viable market for private terrorism risk \n        insurance; and\n            (9) Federal involvement in the provision of commercial \n        terrorism insurance should be short-term and should provide \n        appropriate incentives for insurance companies and the \n        commercial property insurance industry to continue providing \n        terrorism insurance while minimizing terrorism risk and \n        protecting American taxpayers.\n\nSEC. 3. SUBMISSION OF PREMIUM INFORMATION TO THE SECRETARY.\n\n    To the extent such information is not otherwise available to the \nSecretary, the Secretary may require each insurer to submit, to the \nSecretary or to the NAIC, a statement specifying the aggregate premium \namount of coverage written by such insurer for properties and persons \nin the United States under each line of commercial property and \ncasualty insurance sold by such insurer during such periods as the \nSecretary may provide.\n\nSEC. 4.

FEDERAL COST-SHARING FOR COMMERCIAL INSURERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall provide financial assistance, \npursuant to a triggering determination, to commercial insurers in \naccordance with this section to cover insured losses resulting from \nacts of terrorism, which shall be repaid in accordance with subsection \n(e).\n    (b) Amount.--Subject to subsection (c), with respect to a \ntriggering determination, the amount of financial assistance made \navailable under this section to each commercial insurer shall be equal \nto 80 percent of the amount of the covered losses of the insurer as a \nresult of the acts of terrorism.\n    (c) Aggregate Limitation.--The aggregate amount of financial \nassistance provided pursuant to this section may not exceed \n$100,000,000,000.\n    (d) Limitations.--The Secretary may establish limitations to ensure \nthat payments under this section in connection with a triggering \ndetermination are made only to commercial insurers that are not in \ndefault of any obligation under section 6 to collect surcharges.\n    (e) Repayment.--Financial assistance made available under this \nsection shall be repaid through surcharges collected by commercial \ninsurers under section 6 and remitted to the Secretary.

STATE PREEMPTION.\n\n    (a) Covered Perils.--A commercial insurer shall be considered to \nhave complied with any State law that requires or regulates the \nprovision of insurance coverage for acts of terrorism if the insurer \nprovides coverage in accordance with the definitions regarding acts of \nterrorism under the regulations issued by the Secretary.\n    (b) File and Use.--With respect only to covered lines of insurance \ncovering acts of terrorism, any provision of State law that requires, \nas a condition precedent to the effectiveness of rates or policies for \nsuch insurance that is made available by an insurer licensed to \ntransact such business in the State, any action (including prior \napproval by the State insurance regulator for such State) other than \nfiling of such rates and policies and related information with such \nState insurance regulator is preempted to the extent such law requires \nsuch additional actions for such insurance coverage. This subsection \nshall not be considered to preempt a provision of State law solely \nbecause the law provides that rates and policies for such insurance \ncoverage are, upon such filing, subject to subsequent review and \naction, which may include actions to disapprove or discontinue use of \nsuch rates or policies, by the State insurance regulator.\n\nSEC. 9. CONSISTENT STATE GUIDELINES FOR COVERAGE FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress Regarding Covered Perils.--It is the sense of \nthe Congress that--\n            (1) the NAIC, in consultation with the Secretary, should \n        develop appropriate definitions for acts of terrorism and \n        appropriate standards for making determinations regarding \n        events or occurrences of acts of terrorism;\n            (2) each State should adopt the definitions and standards \n        developed by the NAIC for purposes of regulating insurance \n        coverage made available in that State;\n            (3) in consulting with the NAIC, the Secretary should \n        advocate and promote the development of definitions and \n        standards that are appropriate for purposes of this Act; and\n            (4) after consultation with the NAIC, the Secretary should \n        adopt definitions for acts of terrorism and standards for \n        determinations that are appropriate for this Act.\n    (b) Guidelines Regarding Disclosure of Pricing and Terms of \nCoverage.--\n            (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n        that the States should require, by laws or regulations \n        governing the provision of commercial property and casualty \n        insurance that includes coverage for acts of terrorism, that \n        the price of any such terrorism coverage, including the costs \n        of any terrorism related assessments or surcharges under this \n        Act, be separately disclosed.\n            (2) Adoption of national guidelines.--If the Secretary \n        determines that the States have not enacted laws or adopted \n        regulations adequately providing for the disclosures described \n        in paragraph (1) within a reasonable period of time after the \n        date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, after \n        consultation with the NAIC, adopt guidelines on a national \n        basis requiring such disclosure in a manner that supersedes any \n        State law regarding such disclosure.\n\nSEC. 10. CONSULTATION WITH STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS AND NAIC.\n\n    The Secretary shall consult with the State insurance regulators and \nthe NAIC in carrying out this Act. The Secretary may take such actions, \nincluding entering into such agreements and providing such technical \nand organizational assistance to insurers and State insurance \nregulators, as may be necessary to provide for the distribution of \nfinancial assistance under section 5 and the collection and remitting \nof surcharges under section 6.\n\nSEC. 11.
