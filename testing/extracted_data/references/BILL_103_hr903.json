FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Congress had high expectations for commercial \n        benefits from the Government Procurement Code (in this section \n        referred to as the ``Code'') enacted as part of the Trade \n        Agreements Act of 1979, with a potential opening of \n        $20,000,000,000 to $25,000,000,000 in trade opportunities for \n        United States export sales to foreign government procurement \n        entities.\n            (2) According to the Comptroller General of the United \n        States, in each year since implementation of the Code on \n        January 1, 1981, the United States has spent approximately \n        $18,000,000,000 in foreign source procurement while in each \n        such year United States suppliers took in only $4,000,000,000 \n        from sales to overseas governments, for a total imbalance in \n        each such year of an estimated $14,000,000,000.\n            (3) Federal Government agencies have confirmed that--\n                    (A) the Code has had less overall commercial value \n                than originally anticipated; and\n                    (B) of the markets opened, the benefits were \n                disproportionately in favor of foreign suppliers.\n            (4) The Congress has concerns about--\n                    (A) inadequate monitoring of foreign government \n                compliance with the Code;\n                    (B) inadequate efforts to enforce the rights of the \n                United States;\n                    (C) the lack of United States Government assistance \n                to firms wishing to take advantage of opened markets; \n                and\n                    (D) the continued lack of progress to open foreign \n                markets.\n            (5) The United States economy over the past months has been \n        in a condition of relative instability, with negative growth \n        resulting in lost jobs and lost sales for both small and large \n        businesses.\n            (6) After 13 years of limited opportunities for United \n        States companies overseas under the Code, the time has come to \n        address the matter of imbalance with respect to the government \n        procurement practices of the United States' trading partners \n        and to refocus United States Federal procurement policy during \n        this period of economic adjustment, in order to enhance \n        opportunities for small businesses and areas of high \n        unemployment.\n            (7) The use of United States Federal procurement dollars to \n        assist small businesses and preserve the jobs of workers who \n        traditionally have the fewest resources to withstand economic \n        recession is a sound practice and policy for the Government.\n            (8) The policy established by this Act will serve to reduce \n        the imbalance in government purchases and thereby put domestic \n        companies on an equitable basis and help alleviate the United \n        States balance of payments problem.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote fairness in \nFederal procurement by creating greater access to Federal procurement \nfunds for small businesses and areas of high unemployment during \neconomic downturns.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENT THAT FEDERAL AGENCIES INCREASE DOMESTIC PROCUREMENT \n              AND PROCUREMENT FROM SMALL-BUSINESS CONCERNS DURING \n              ECONOMIC RECESSIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title III of the Act of March 3, 1933, commonly \nknown as the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-10c), is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating sections 5 and 6 as sections 6 and 7, \n        respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 4 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 5.
