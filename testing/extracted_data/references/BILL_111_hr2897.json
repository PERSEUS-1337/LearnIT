FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The unprecedented Government intervention into the \n        financial markets in 2008 was required by a threat to our \n        Nation's economy from large, complex, and deeply inter-\n        connected financial institutions, many of which were on the \n        verge of failing.\n            (2) The necessary Government intervention in the financial \n        system placed hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars at risk.\n            (3) Many of the financial institutions involved in the \n        crisis were so large and their dealings so intertwined that \n        their failures could have led to the collapse of America's \n        financial system.\n            (4) The scale of the banking system crisis put severe \n        strains on the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit \n        Insurance Corporation.\n            (5) The depository institutions that present a systemic \n        risk to the financial system would overwhelm the resources of \n        the Deposit Insurance Fund if one or more of them were to fail.\n            (6) Without a substantial increase in the Deposit Insurance \n        Fund, depository institutions that are deemed ``too-big-to-\n        fail'' will remain potential threats to the health of the \n        entire financial system and possibly place U.S. taxpayer \n        dollars at risk.\n            (7) It is inherently unfair to require the financial \n        institutions that are too small to be systemic risks, or that \n        do not become involved in the most risky, questionable, and \n        harmful financial practices, to share the financial \n        responsibility for the failures of these ``too-big-to-fail'' \n        institutions.\n            (8) Large depository institutions whose failure may \n        threaten the safety and soundness of the entire financial \n        system should be assessed premiums based on their potential \n        risk to the system, not just on the deposits they hold.\n            (9) The Deposit Insurance Fund should be insulated against \n        potential financial crises, the financial institutions that \n        cause a crisis in the future must be held accountable, and U.S. \n        taxpayer dollars should not be placed at risk.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to maintain the safety and \nsoundness of the U.S. banking system by ensuring that the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporations' Deposit Insurance Fund is adequately \ncapitalized to respond to the failures of large depository institutions \nthat would otherwise threaten our financial system and to return a \nsense of fairness and accountability to the deposit insurance premium \nassessment process.\n\nSEC. 3. ACCOUNTING FOR ACTUAL RISK TO THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND.\n\n    (a) Section 7(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is \namended to read as follows:\n                    ``(C) `Risk-based assessment system' defined.--For \n                purposes of this paragraph, the term `risk-based \n                assessment system' means a system for calculating a \n                depository institution's assessment based on--\n                            ``(i) the probability that the Deposit \n                        Insurance Fund will incur a loss with respect \n                        to the institution;\n                            ``(ii) the likely amount of any such loss;\n                            ``(iii) the risks to the Deposit Insurance \n                        Fund attributable to such depository \n                        institution and its affiliates, taking into \n                        account--\n                                    ``(I) the amount, different \n                                categories, and concentrations of \n                                assets of the insured depository \n                                institution and its affiliates, \n                                including both on-balance sheet and \n                                off-balance sheet assets;\n                                    ``(II) the amount, different \n                                categories, and concentrations of \n                                liabilities, both insured and \n                                uninsured, contingent and \n                                noncontingent, including both on-\n                                balance sheet and off-balance sheet \n                                liabilities, of the insured depository \n                                institution and its affiliates;
