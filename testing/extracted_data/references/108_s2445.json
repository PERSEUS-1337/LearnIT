    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Direct to Consumer Prescription Drug \nAdvertising Act of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The pharmaceutical industry spent $2,700,000,000 on \n        direct to consumer advertising in 2001, nearly a 60 percent \n        increase since 1997.\n            (2) Direct to consumer prescription drug advertisements can \n        significantly increase the number of sales. In 2000, almost \n        $2,500,000,000 was spent on direct to consumer advertising to \n        promote 50 different drugs. The following year, retail sales \n        for these drugs skyrocketed by 21.4 percent.\n            (3) According to the Government Accounting Office, \n        pharmaceutical companies have increased spending on direct to \n        consumer advertising more rapidly than they have increased \n        spending on research and development.\n            (4) New prescription drugs that are introduced into the \n        market are generally more expensive than older drugs in the \n        same class. Consequently, direct to consumer advertising may \n        lead consumers to spend more money on new prescription drugs \n        than those of similar quality.\n            (5) Although direct to consumer prescription drug \n        advertisements aid consumer awareness, they are often \n        misleading as the benefits are more accessible than the risks.\n            (6) There has been a sharp increase in sales for direct to \n        consumer advertised prescription drugs, which is \n        disproportionate to the growth in the market.\n            (7) Due to a revision of procedure within the Department of \n        Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration is \n        often too late to act on misleading direct to consumer \n        advertisements by the pharmaceutical industry. By the time they \n        revoke an advertisement, many consumers have already viewed the \n        misleading information.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS.\n\n    (a) In General.--With respect to each prescription drug that is \ncovered under a plan offered under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, the \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health shall conduct research \nthat compares the effectiveness and safety of such prescription drug \nrelative to other prescription drugs used to treat the same condition \nor disease.\n    (b) Rule of Construction.--The results of the research conducted \nunder subsection (a) shall not be construed to be a condition of \napproval under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(21 U.S.C. 355).\n\nSEC. 4. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \npromulgate amended regulations governing prescription drug \nadvertisements.\n    (b) Contents.--In addition to any other requirements, the \nregulations under subsection (a) shall require that--\n            (1) any advertisement present a fair balance, comparable in \n        depth and detail, between--\n                    (A) information relating to effectiveness of the \n                drug (including, if available, effectiveness in \n                comparison to other drugs for substantially the same \n                condition or conditions); and\n                    (B) information relating to side effects and \n                contraindications;\n            (2) any advertisement present a fair balance, comparable in \n        depth, between--\n                    (A) aural and visual presentations relating to \n                effectiveness of the drug; and\n                    (B) aural and visual presentations relating to side \n                effects and contraindications, except that nothing in \n                this section shall require explicit images or sounds \n                depicting side effects and contraindications;\n            (3) prohibit false or misleading advertising that would \n        encourage a consumer to take the prescription drug for a use \n        other than a use for which the prescription drug is approved \n        under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n        (21 U.S.C. 355); and\n            (4) require that any prescription drug that is the subject \n        of a direct-to-consumer advertisement include in the package in \n        which the prescription drug is sold to consumers a medication \n        guide explaining the benefits and risks of use of the \n        prescription drug in terms designed to be understandable to the \n        general public.\n\nSEC. 5. CIVIL PENALTY.\n\n    Section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n333) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(g) Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Advertising.--\n            ``(1) In general.--A person that commits a violation of \n        section 301 involving the misbranding of a prescription drug \n        (within the meaning of section 502(n)) in a direct-to-consumer \n        advertisement shall be assessed a civil penalty if--\n                    ``(A) the Secretary provides the person written \n                notice of the violation; and\n                    ``(B) the person fails to correct or cease the \n                advertisement so as to eliminate the violation not \n                later than 180 days after the date of the notice.\n            ``(2) Amount.--The amount of a civil penalty under \n        paragraph (1)--\n                    ``(A) shall not exceed $500,000 in the case of an \n                individual and $5,000,000 in the case of any other \n                person; and\n                    ``(B) shall not exceed $10,000,000 for all such \n                violations adjudicated in a single proceeding.\n            ``(3) Procedure.--Paragraphs (3) through (5) of subsection \n        (f) shall apply with respect to a civil penalty under paragraph \n        (1) of this subsection to the same extent and in the same \n        manner as those paragraphs apply with respect to a civil \n        penalty under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (f).''.\n\nSEC. 6.
