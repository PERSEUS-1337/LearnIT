Purchase of insurance\n    ``(a) The Secretary may, without regard to section 3709 of the \nRevised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5), purchase from one or more life \ninsurance companies a policy or policies of mortgage protection life \ninsurance on a group basis to provide the benefits specified in this \nsubchapter.\n    ``(b) A veteran (other than a veteran eligible for insurance under \nsection 2106 of this title) who establishes to the satisfaction of the \nSecretary that the veteran is unable to obtain commercial life \ninsurance because of a service-connected disability shall, upon \napplication made in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, be \ngranted insurance under this subchapter.\n``Sec. 1992.

A veteran \ninsured under this subchapter who is not eligible for cash benefits \nfrom the Secretary may pay the amount of such premiums directly to the \ninsurer or insurers.\n``Sec. 1994. Payment of insurance\n    ``An amount of insurance in force under this subchapter on the date \nof death of a veteran insured under this subchapter shall be paid only \nto the holder of the mortgage loan, the payment of which such insurance \nwas granted, for credit on the loan indebtedness, and the liability of \nthe insurer under such insurance shall be satisfied when such payment \nis made. If the Secretary is the holder of the mortgage loan, the \ninsurance proceeds shall be credited to the loan indebtedness and, as \nappropriate, deposited in the direct loan or loan guaranty revolving \nfund established by section 3723 or 3724 of this title, respectively.\n``Sec. 1995. Insurance policy provisions\n    ``(a) Each policy purchased under section 1991 of this title shall \nprovide, in terms approved by the Secretary, for the following:\n            ``(1) Reinsurance, to the extent and in a manner to be \n        determined by the Secretary to be in the best interest of the \n        veterans or the Government, with such other insurers which meet \n        qualifying criteria established by the Secretary as may elect \n        to participate in such reinsurance.\n            ``(2) That at any time the Secretary determines such action \n        to be in the best interest of veterans or the Government, the \n        Secretary may (A) discontinue the entire policy, or (B) at the \n        Secretary's option, exclude from coverage under the policy \n        loans made after a date fixed by the Secretary for that \n        purpose. Any insurance previously issued to a veteran under \n        such policy may not be canceled by the insurer solely because \n        of termination of the policy by the Secretary with respect to \n        new loans. If the entire policy is discontinued, the Secretary \n        shall have the right to require the transfer, to the extent and \n        in a manner to be determined by the Secretary, to any new \n        company or companies with which the Secretary has negotiated a \n        new policy or policies, the amounts, as determined by the \n        existing insurer or insurers with the concurrence of the \n        Secretary, of any policy or contingency reserves with respect \n        to insurance previously in force.\n            ``(3) Issuance to each veteran insured under this \n        subchapter of a uniform type of certificate setting forth the \n        benefits to which the veteran is entitled under the insurance.\n            ``(4) Any other provisions which are reasonably necessary \n        or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.\n    ``(b)(1) Any such policy shall also provide that the insurer under \nthe policy shall provide to the Secretary an accounting not later than \n90 days after the end of each policy year which shall set forth, in a \nform approved by the Secretary, the following:\n            ``(A) The amount of premiums paid by veterans accrued under \n        the contract or agreement from its date of issue to the end of \n        such contract year.\n            ``(B) The total of all mortality and other claim charges \n        incurred for that period.\n            ``(C) The amount of the insurer's expense and risk charges, \n        if any, for that period.\n    ``(2) If the amount under paragraph (1)(A) is greater than the sum \nof the amounts under paragraph (1)(B) and (1)(C), the amount of the \ndifference shall be held by the insurer as a contingency reserve to be \nused by that insurer for charges under the contract or agreement only. \nThe contingency reserve shall bear interest at a rate to be determined \nin advance of each contract year by the insurer, which rate shall be \napproved by the Secretary if consistent with the rates generally used \nby the insurer for similar funds held under other plans of group life \ninsurance.\n    ``(3) If the Secretary determines that such contingency reserve has \nattained an amount estimated by the Secretary to make satisfactory \nprovision for adverse fluctuations in future charges under the \ncontract, the Secretary shall require the insurer to adjust the premium \nrates and contributions so as to prevent any further substantial \naccretions to the contingency reserve.\n    ``(4) If the contract or agreement is discontinued and if after all \ncharges have been made there is any positive balance remaining in the \ncontingency reserve, the insurer shall pay such balance to the \nSecretary. Any such payment shall be credited to the appropriation \n`Compensation and Pensions, Department of Veterans Affairs,'. The \ninsurer shall be allowed to make any such payment in equal monthly \ninstallments over a period of not more than two years.\n    ``(c) With respect to insurance contracted for under this \nsubchapter, the Secretary may adopt such regulations relating to \neligibility of the veteran for insurance, the maximum amount of \ninsurance, the maximum duration of insurance, and other pertinent \nfactors not specifically provided for in this subchapter, as in the \nSecretary's judgment are in the best interest of veterans or the \nGovernment.\n    ``(d) Insurance contracted for under this subchapter shall take \neffect as to any veteran on a date determined by the Secretary.\n    ``(e) The amount of the insurance at any time shall be the amount \nnecessary to pay the mortgage indebtedness in full, except as otherwise \nlimited by the policy.\n``Sec. 1996. Termination of insurance\n    ``(a) Insurance contracted for under this subchapter shall \nterminate upon whichever of the following first occurs:\n            ``(1) Satisfaction of the veteran's indebtedness under the \n        loan upon which the insurance is based.\n            ``(2) The veteran's 70th birthday.\n            ``(3) Termination of the veteran's ownership of the \n        property securing the loan.\n            ``(4) Discontinuance of payment of premiums by the veteran.\n            ``(5) Discontinuance of the entire contract or agreement.\n    ``(b) Termination of insurance under this subchapter shall not \naffect the guaranty or insurance of the loan by the Secretary under any \nother provision of this chapter.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of \nsuch chapter is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n\n  ``Subchapter V--Supplemental Mortgage Protection Life Insurance for \n                            Certain Veterans\n\n``Sec.\n``1991.
