FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On September 11, 2001, nineteen terrorists, who \n        underwent airport security screening prior to boarding domestic \n        flights, were able to commandeer four airplanes and use those \n        airplanes to perpetrate the most deadly terrorist attack ever \n        to be executed on United States soil.\n            (2) In the aftermath of those attacks, Congress passed the \n        Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), enacted by \n        President George W. Bush on November 19, 2001 (Public Law 107-\n        71), to enhance the level of security screening throughout our \n        aviation system and transfer responsibility for such screening \n        from the private sector to a new Federal agency, the \n        Transportation Security Administration (TSA).\n            (3) By establishing TSA, Congress and the American public \n        recognized that the highest level of screener performance was \n        directly linked to employment and training standards, pay and \n        benefits, and the creation of an experienced, committed \n        screening workforce.\n            (4) The Aviation and Transportation Security Act included a \n        statutory footnote allowing the TSA Administrator to ``employ, \n        appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation'', \n        including the ``terms, and conditions of employment of Federal \n        Service for such a number of individuals as the Under Secretary \n        determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions \n        of the Under Secretary under section 44901 of title 49, United \n        States Code''.\n            (5) TSA has interpreted the ATSA footnote as applying to \n        the majority of the Transportation Security Officer workforce \n        performing screening functions, while all other Transportation \n        Security Administration employees, including managers, are \n        subject to title 5, United States Code, as incorporated in \n        title 49 of such Code.\n            (6) In November 2006, the International Labor Organization \n        ruled that the Bush Administration violated international labor \n        law when it prohibited Transportation Security Officers from \n        engaging in collective bargaining.\n            (7) After the Federal Labor Relations Board approved a \n        petition for the election of an exclusive representative, on \n        February 4, 2011, then-TSA Administrator John Pistole issued a \n        binding determination stating in part ``it is critical that \n        every TSA employee feels that he or she has a voice and feels \n        safe raising issues and concerns of all kinds. This is \n        important not just for morale; engagement of every employee is \n        critically important for security''.\n            (8) The February 4, 2011, determination was superseded by a \n        second Determination issued on December 29, 2014, changing the \n        previous guideline for collective bargaining and resulting in \n        limitations in the subjects that can be bargained, issues in \n        dispute that may be raised to an independent, third-party \n        neutral decisionmaker (such as an arbitrator or the Merit \n        Systems Protection Board), and barriers to union representation \n        of the Transportation Security Officer workforce.\n            (9) Both the 2011 and 2014 determinations cited TSA's \n        authority under section 44935 note of title 59, United States \n        Code, to create a personnel system that denies the \n        Transportation Security Officer workforce the same title 5 \n        rights as other Federal workers, including the right to appeal \n        adverse personnel decisions to the Merit Systems Protection \n        Board, fair pay under the General Services wage system, 2011, \n        fair pay and raises under the General Services wage system, \n        including overtime guidelines, access to earned leave, \n        application of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, fair \n        performance appraisals under chapter 73 of title 5, United \n        States Code, and direct protections against employment \n        discrimination found in title 7, United States Code.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \npersonnel system utilized by the Transportation Security Administration \npursuant to the authority of section 44935 note of title 49, United \nStates Code, provides insufficient workplace protections for the \nTransportation Security Officer workforce, the frontline personnel who \nsecure our Nation's aviation system and that such personnel should be \nprovided protections under title 5, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 3.
