FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Identification Friend or Foe equipment and accessories \n        are used by the Armed Forces to maintain the superior ability \n        of members of the Armed Forces to operate under the cover of \n        darkness and in inclement conditions, while providing for \n        identification of fellow members.\n            (2) Glo-patches and other Identification Friend or Foe \n        equipment and accessories are assigned a demilitarization code \n        of ``D'', which requires the total destruction of the property \n        and components by melting, cutting, tearing, scratching, \n        crushing, breaking, punching, or neutralizing, so as to \n        preclude restoration or repair to a usable condition.\n            (3) Under current regulations, Identification Friend or Foe \n        equipment and accessories may not be exported outside of the \n        United States without express permission by the Department of \n        Defense or the Department of State.\n            (4) However, between August and October of 2006, 4,800 \n        surplus combat uniforms bearing glo-tape patches were \n        inadvertently sold despite a determination by the Department of \n        Defense in July 2006 that the patches had to be removed and \n        destroyed before the uniforms could be sold.\n            (5) Subsequent investigation in June 2007 determined that \n        Identification Friend or Foe equipment and accessories were \n        easily obtained at retailers in several areas of the United \n        States.\n            (6) On January 20, 2007, between nine and twelve Iraqi \n        insurgents successfully masqueraded as members of the United \n        States Armed Forces while dressed in United States military \n        combat fatigues, and were able to kill one soldier and abduct \n        four other soldiers, highlighting the dangers faced by members \n        of the Armed Forces when the enemy is able to disguise itself \n        as members of the United States Armed Forces.\n\nSEC. 2.
