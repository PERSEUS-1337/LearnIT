SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Osteoporosis Early \nDetection and Prevention Act of 1997''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nature of osteoporosis.--\n                    (A) Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low \n                bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue \n                leading to bone fragility and increased susceptibility \n                to fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist.\n                    (B) Osteoporosis has no symptoms and typically \n                remains undiagnosed until a fracture occurs.\n                    (C) Once a fracture occurs, the condition has \n                usually advanced to the stage where the likelihood is \n                high that another fracture will occur.\n                    (D) There is no cure for osteoporosis, but drug \n                therapy has been shown to reduce new hip and spine \n                fractures by 50 percent and other treatments, such as \n                nutrition therapy, have also proven effective.\n            (2) Incidence of osteoporosis.--Osteoporosis is a common \n        condition:\n                    (A) Of the 28 million Americans who have (or are at \n                risk for) osteoporosis, 80 percent are women.\n                    (B) Annually there are 1.5 million bone fractures \n                attributable to osteoporosis.\n                    (C) Half of all women, and one-eighth of all men, \n                age 50 or older will have a bone fracture due to \n                osteoporosis.\n            (3) Impact of osteoporosis.--The cost of treating \n        osteoporosis is significant:\n                    (A) The annual cost of osteoporosis in the United \n                States is $13.8 billion.\n                    (B) The average cost in the United States of \n                repairing a hip fracture due to osteoporosis is \n                $32,000.\n                    (C) Fractures due to osteoporosis frequently result \n                in disability and institutionalization of individuals.\n                    (D) Because osteoporosis is a progressive condition \n                and affects primarily aging individuals, reductions in \n                the incidence or severity of osteoporosis, particularly \n                for post menopausal women before they become eligible \n                for Medicare, has a significant potential of reducing \n                osteoporosis-related costs under the Medicare program.\n            (4) Use of bone mass measurement.--\n                    (A) Bone mass measurement is a non-invasive, \n                painless, and reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis \n                before costly fractures occur.\n                    (B) Low bone mass is as predictive of future \n                fractures as is high cholesterol or high blood pressure \n                of heart disease or stroke.\n                    (C) Bone mass measurement is the only reliable \n                method of detecting osteoporosis at an early stage.\n                    (D) Under section 4106 of the Balanced Budget Act \n                of 1997, Medicare will provide coverage, effective July \n                1, 1998, for bone mass measurement for qualified \n                individuals who are at risk of developing osteoporosis.\n\nSEC. 2. REQUIRING COVERAGE OF BONE MASS MEASUREMENT UNDER HEALTH PLANS.\n\n    (a) Group Health Plans.--\n            (1) Public health service act amendments.--(A) Subpart 2 of \n        part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act, as \n        amended by section 703(a) of Public Law 104-204, is amended by \n        adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 2706.
