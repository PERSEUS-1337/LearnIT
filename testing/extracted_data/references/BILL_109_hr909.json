FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are more than 1,000,000 shipments per day in the \n        United States of materials identified as hazardous by the \n        United States Department of Transportation. These shipments are \n        estimated to total 2,100,000,000 tons of hazardous cargo per \n        year and to comprise more than 18 percent of the total freight \n        tonnage moved in the United States annually.\n            (2) Hazardous materials are shipped by all transportation \n        modes and it is estimated that there are currently 400,000 \n        large trucks, 115,000 railroad tank cars, and 3,000 tank barges \n        dedicated to the shipment of hazardous materials.\n            (3) More than a dozen Federal agencies have regulatory, \n        enforcement, and operational responsibilities for ensuring the \n        safety and security of hazardous materials shipments. In \n        addition, a variety of State and local agencies have \n        responsibility for developing and enforcing State-level \n        regulations and for responding to incidents involving hazardous \n        materials.\n            (4) Decisions regarding the packaging and routing of \n        hazardous materials shipments, the development and \n        implementation of procedures to ensure both the safety and \n        security of such shipments, and the regulation of hazardous \n        materials shipments are made by industry groups and government \n        entities at a variety of levels and in all modal \n        administrations of the Department of Transportation on a daily \n        basis.\n            (5) The Federal agencies involved in the regulation and \n        oversight of hazardous materials shipments as well as State and \n        local governments, carriers, shippers, and other groups conduct \n        on-going research on the transportation of hazardous materials. \n        However, much of this research is program or mode-specific and \n        as such is focused on addressing only the regulatory, \n        inspection, enforcement, or operational needs of the group \n        undertaking the research.\n            (6) There is a documented need for the establishment of a \n        cooperative research program that will engage all modes and \n        actors, both public and private, involved in the transportation \n        of hazardous materials in conducting cross-cutting assessments \n        of hazardous materials transportation issues that are national \n        and multi-modal in scope and application.\n\nSEC. 3.
