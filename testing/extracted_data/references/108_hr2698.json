The issuance of such certificates for any fiscal year is \nlimited to the amount appropriated under subsection (f) for such fiscal \nyear.\n    (b) Eligibility.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of this Act, the terms \n        ``eligible individual'' and ``qualified family member'' mean, \n        with respect to a month, an adult or family member, \n        respectively, who--\n                    (A) is a citizen or national of the United States \n                or an alien permanently residing lawfully in the United \n                States as of the first day of the month;\n                    (B) is under 65 years of age as of the last day of \n                the month; and\n                    (C) is not eligible to be covered under public \n                coverage described in paragraph (3) as of the first day \n                of the month.\n            (2) No certificate for covered family members.--\n                    (A) In general.--No certificate shall be issued \n                under this section to a member of the family of a \n                principal eligible individual if the family member is \n                covered under the qualified health insurance coverage \n                covering the principal eligible individual.\n                    (B) Member of family.--For purposes of this Act, \n                the term ``member of family'' has the meaning given \n                such term under section 8901(5) of title 5, United \n                States Code.\n                    (C) Spouse.--For purposes of this Act, the term \n                ``married'' and ``spouse'' shall have the meaning given \n                such term for purposes of chapter 89 of title 5, United \n                States Code.\n                    (D) No duplication.--In no case may the certificate \n                value of more than one certificate take into account \n                any member of a family and, with respect to an eligible \n                individual, no more than 2 member of the individual's \n                family (other than the spouse of the individual) shall \n                be taken into account.\n            (3) Exclusion for those eligible for coverage under public \n        program.--Subject to paragraph (4), an individual is not an \n        eligible individual as of the first day of a month if such \n        individual is eligible to be covered as of such day under any \n        medical care program described in--\n                    (A) title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security \n                Act;\n                    (B) chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code;\n                    (C) chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code;\n                    (D) chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code; or\n                    (E) the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n            (4) Treatment of cobra continuation coverage.--In the case \n        of continuation coverage under a group health plan which is \n        required to be provided by Federal law for an individual during \n        the period specified in section 602(2) of the Employee \n        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, section 4980B(f)(2)(B) \n        of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or section 2202(2) of the \n        Public Health Service Act, or coverage under chapter 89 of \n        title 5, United States Code which is required to be provided \n        under section 8905a of title 5, United States Code, paragraph \n        (3) shall not apply with respect to such continuation coverage \nand the coverage shall be treated as qualified health insurance \ncoverage.\n    (c) Health Insurance Certificates.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall design health \n        insurance certificates to be in a form so that, when presented \n        to the issuer of a qualified health insurance coverage, the \n        issuer may secure directly from the Secretary the value \n        specified in the certificate towards the cost of purchasing \n        such coverage. Once paid, the Secretary may not seek \n        reimbursement from the issuer if there is a finding that any \n        relevant information provided by an individual was incorrect. A \n        certificate is issued with respect to the costs of obtaining \n        health insurance coverage in a year for a specified eligible \n        individual (and family members) and may not be used for such \n        coverage in any other period.\n            (2) Limitation.--In no case shall the value of the \n        certificate, as applied with respect to health insurance \n        coverage, be applied towards an amount that exceeds--\n                    (A) 70 percent of the premium for coverage for the \n                period involved, or\n                    (B) in the case of a certificate described in \n                subsection (d)(2), 70 percent of the employee's premium \n                for coverage under the group health plan involved.\n            (3) Form of certificate.--A health insurance certificate \n        for a year shall be valued and paid as follows:\n                    (A) Value.--The value of the certificate for a year \n                shall be determined based upon a methodology for \n                determining income specified by the Secretary that is \n                similar to that applied for purposes of determining \n                eligibility on the basis of income under needs-based \n                Federal programs and that may be based on the standards \n                used under section 1612 for purposes of the \n                supplemental security income program. Such methodology \n                under this section may allow for use of both a Federal \n                methodology and alternate State methodologies where the \n                Secretary deems appropriate for ease of administration \n                and coordination of programs. The Secretary may provide \n                for self-certification of information by individuals \n                where the Secretary deems appropriate for \n                administration of the program.\n                    (B) Availability of group health plan coverage.--If \n                an individual is (for the individual or for the \n                individual's family members) eligible for coverage \n                under a group health plan and the premium charged the \n                individual for such coverage does not exceed 50 percent \n                of the cost of coverage, such an individual is eligible \n                only for a certificate under section (d)(2) and not \n                under subsection (d)(1).\n                    (C) Minimum threshold for issuance of \n                certificate.--No health insurance certificate shall be \n                issued under this section where the annualized value of \n                the certificate is less than $200.\n    (d) Value of Certificate.--\n            (1) In general.--The annualized value of a health insurance \n        certificate for an eligible individual shall be determined as \n        follows (and applied on a monthly basis based on \\1/12\\ of such \n        annualized value):\n                    (A) Unmarried individual with no dependent family \n                members.--Subject to subparagraph (C)(i), in the case \n                of an eligible individual who is not married, who has \n                no dependent family members, who has qualified health \n                insurance coverage, and whose income--\n                            (i) is $13,000 or less, the annualized \n                        value of the certificate is $1,000;
