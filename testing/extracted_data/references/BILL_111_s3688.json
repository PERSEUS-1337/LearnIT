FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the National Research Council's 2007 \n        report titled ``International Education and Foreign Languages: \n        Keys to Securing America's Future'', ``knowledge of foreign \n        languages and cultures is increasingly critical for the \n        nation's security and its ability to compete in the global \n        marketplace. Language skills and cultural expertise are needed \n        for federal service, for business, for such professions as law, \n        health care, and social work, and for an informed citizenry.''.\n            (2) Exchange programs play an important role in learning \n        about foreign cultures and languages and building bridges \n        between societies. Our Nation benefits from having people from \n        all over the world study, work, and travel in the United \n        States.\n            (3) The Fulbright Programs are widely recognized and \n        prestigious international exchange programs, with approximately \n        294,000 ``Fulbrighters'' from more than 155 countries \n        participating in the academic exchange program since its \n        inception more than 60 years ago.\n            (4) In his June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, President \n        Barack Obama stated--\n                    (A) ``I have come here to seek a new beginning \n                between the United States and Muslims around the world; \n                one based on mutual interest and mutual respect.'';\n                    (B) in discussing economic development and \n                opportunity, ``we will expand exchange programs'' and \n                ``we will create a new corps of business volunteers to \n                partner with counterparts in Muslim-majority \n                countries''; and\n                    (C) ``Indeed, faith should bring us together. That \n                is why we are forging service projects in America that \n                bring together Christians, Muslims, and Jews.'' and \n                ``Around the world, we can turn dialogue into \n                Interfaith service, so bridges between peoples lead to \n                action.''.\n            (5) During the 2010 Presidential Summit on \n        Entrepreneurship, President Obama emphasized the importance of \n        partnering with global Muslim communities ``to expand economic \n        prosperity . . . and to deepen ties between business leaders, \n        foundations, and entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim \n        communities around the world.''.\n            (6) In her November 2009 speech at the ``Forum for the \n        Future'' in Marrakech, Morocco, Secretary of State Clinton \n        stated ``It is results, not rhetoric, that matter in the end. \n        Economic empowerment, education, healthcare, access to energy \n        and to credit, these are the basics that all communities need \n        to thrive. . . . We know that true progress comes from within a \n        society and cannot be imposed from the outside, and we know \n        that change does not happen overnight. So we will not focus our \n        energies on one-time projects, but we will seek to work with \n        all of you in government and in civil society to try to build \n        local capacity and empower local organizations and individuals \n        to create sustainable change.''.\n            (7) On January 28, 2010, Farah Pandith, Special \n        Representative to Muslim Communities for the Department of \n        State, stated, ``by working together in true partnership with \n        Muslims around the world, we can build new relationships and \n        partnerships that inspire and promote peace, prosperity, \n        dignity, and hope.''.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a pilot program--\n            (1) to help build professional capacity and contribute \n        professional skills to local communities through a two-way \n        exchange of fellows;\n            (2) to address some of the long-term economic challenges \n        facing the global economy by sharing and building professional \n        expertise and building civil society capacity in the United \n        States and in Muslim-majority countries, including minority \n        populations in those countries;\n            (3) to promote cross-cultural understanding between the \n        people of the United States and the people in Muslim-majority \n        countries, including minority populations in those countries;\n            (4) to improve mutual understanding, change perceptions, \n        and strengthen the people-to-people ties which unite Americans \n        with people in Muslim-majority countries, including minority \n        populations in those countries; and\n            (5) to promote international cooperation and peace.\n\nSEC. 4.
