FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n        the least-developed countries to promote stable and sustainable \n        economic growth and development.\n            (2) Trade and investment are powerful economic tools and a \n        country may use trade and investment to reduce poverty and \n        raise the standard of living in that country.\n            (3) A country that is open to trade may increase its \n        economic growth.\n            (4) Twenty-five percent of the world's population survives \n        on less than one dollar per day.\n            (5) Unemployment rates in least-developed countries are \n        extremely high, including unemployment rates in some countries \n        of up to 70 percent.\n            (6) Trade and investment often lead to employment \n        opportunities and often help alleviate poverty.\n            (7) Least-developed countries have a particular challenge \n        in meeting the economic requirements and competitiveness of \n        globalization and international markets.\n            (8) The United States has recognized the benefits of trade \n        to least-developed countries by enacting the Generalized System \n        of Preferences and trade benefits for developing countries in \n        the Caribbean, Andean, and sub-Saharan African regions of the \n        world.\n            (9) The challenges of the global trading environment for \n        least-developed countries are even greater given the end of the \n        Multi-Fiber Arrangement in 2005, and certain least-developed \n        countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Nepal, are \n        particularly vulnerable to the changes that will result from \n        the end of that Arrangement.\n            (10) Responding to the needs of least-developed countries \n        would be consistent with other United States trade objectives, \n        including encouraging forward progress on the WTO Doha \n        Development Round.\n            (11) Enhanced trade with the Muslim least-developed \n        countries, including Yemen, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, is \n        consistent with other United States objectives of encouraging a \n        strong private sector and individual economic empowerment in \n        those countries.\n            (12) Offering least-developed countries enhanced trade \n        preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and \n        direct investment in support of positive economic and political \n        developments throughout the region and the world.\n            (13) Encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n        investment barriers will enhance the benefits of trade and \n        investment as well as enhance commercial and political ties \n        between the United States and the beneficiary countries.\n            (14) Economic opportunity and engagement in the global \n        trading system together with support for democratic \n        institutions and a respect for human rights are mutually-\n        reinforcing objectives and key elements of a policy to confront \n        and defeat global terrorism.\n            (15) A powerful earthquake and tsunami struck in the Indian \n        Ocean on December 26, 2004.\n            (16) The destruction caused by the tsunami in Sri Lanka was \n        devastating and included the loss of an estimated 30,000 people \n        and physical damage that will cost an amount equal to 6.5 \n        percent of annual economy of Sri Lanka to repair.\n            (17) The effects of lost businesses and reconstruction \n        costs caused by the tsunami damage will result in a drop in the \n        economic growth of Sri Lanka.\n            (18) Senate Resolution 4, 109th Congress, agreed to January \n        4, 2005, expressed the support of the Senate for the long-term \n        commitment and engagement of the United States to provide \n        financial aid and other forms of direct and indirect assistance \n        to the countries and peoples of the region impacted by the \n        earthquake and the tsunami.\n            (19) Duty preferences that assist Sri Lanka in the United \n        States market will help Sri Lanka rebuild and overcome the \n        economic destruction caused by the tsunami.\n\nSEC. 3.
