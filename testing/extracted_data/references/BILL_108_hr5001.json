FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States is vital \n        to the Nation's homeland security, transportation, trade, \n        environmental and human health, recreation and tourism, food \n        production, scientific research and education, historical and \n        cultural heritage, and energy production.\n            (2) More than half of the Nation's population lives and \n        works in coastal communities that together make up 11 percent \n        of its land and its most ecologically and economically \n        important regions. These regions support approximately 190 \n        seaports, contain most of the Nation's largest cities, and \n        provide access to coastal waters rich in natural resources.\n            (3) The Nation's coastal waters and Great Lakes provide \n        tremendous value to the Nation's economy. The Nation's ports \n        handle goods valued at more than $700,000,000,000 annually and \n        nearly half of the goods, including energy products, contain \n        hazardous materials; the value of the fishing industry exceeds \n        $28,000,000,000 annually; the value of the recreational fishing \n        industry is estimated at $20,000,000,000 annually; and the \n        value of the offshore oil and gas industry is between \n        $25,000,000,000 and $40,000,000,000 annually.\n            (4) The rich biodiversity of marine organisms provides \n        society with essential food resources, a promising source of \n        marine products with commercial and medical potential, and an \n        important contribution to the national economy.\n            (5) The oceans and the Great Lakes drive climate and \n        weather factors causing severe weather events and threatening \n        the health of coastal ecosystems and communities by creating or \n        affecting both natural and manmade coastal hazards such as \n        hurricanes, tsunamis, erosion, oil spills, harmful algal \n        blooms, and pollution, which can each pose threats to human \n        health and safety.\n            (6) Each year, the Coast Guard relies on ocean information \n        to save 4,380 people, conducts over 65,000 rescue missions, and \n        carries out more than 11,680 environmental cleanups and \n        responses to pollution.\n            (7) Safeguarding homeland security requires improved \n        monitoring of the Nation's ports and coastline, including the \n        ability to track vessels and to provide rapid response teams \n        with real-time environmental conditions necessary for their \n        work.\n            (8) Advances in sensing technologies and scientific \n        understanding have made possible long-term and continuous \n        observation from shore, space, and in situ of ocean and coastal \n        characteristics and conditions.\n            (9) Many elements of an ocean and coastal observing system \n        are in place but require Federal investment to consolidate, \n        complete, sustain, and integrate.\n            (10) National investment in a sustained and integrated \n        ocean and coastal observing system and in coordinated programs \n        of research would assist the Nation and the world in \n        understanding the oceans and the global climate system, \n        strengthen homeland security, improve weather and climate \n        forecasts, strengthen management of marine resources, improve \n        the safety and efficiency of maritime operations, and mitigate \n        coastal hazards.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide for--\n            (1) the development of an integrated ocean observing system \n        that provides the data and information required to ensure \n        national security and the quality of life, sustains economic \n        development, sustains and restores healthy marine ecosystems \n        and the resources they support, enables advances in scientific \n        understanding of the oceans, and strengthens science education \n        and communication;\n            (2) implementation of a research and development program to \n        better understand the oceans and achieve the goals of an \n        integrated ocean observing system;\n            (3) implementation of a data and information management \n        system required by all components of an integrated ocean and \n        coastal observing system and related research; and\n            (4) establishment of a system of regional ocean and coastal \n        observing systems to address local needs for ocean information.\n\nSEC. 3.
