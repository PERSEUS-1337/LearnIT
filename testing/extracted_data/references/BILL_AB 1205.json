In selecting projects for funding, the Natural Resources Agency, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, shall consider the extent to which a project reduces emissions of greenhouse gases.\n(c)In evaluating grant applications for funding, the Natural Resources Agency shall, in addition to prioritizing projects pursuant to subdivision (b), consider the extent to which a project provides the greatest level of the following cobenefits:\n(1)Recreational access to and improved human interaction with a river or riparian corridor, especially in urban corridors and park-starved communities.\n(2)Improved transportation mobility, especially pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit.\n(3)Economic viability of the surrounding community by promoting appropriate development, especially in an urban setting.\n(4)Development of visitor-serving and interpretive facilities.\n(5)Access and development of pocket parks, community gardens, demonstration gardens, and other urban greening.\n(6)Species protections and the protection of habitat strongholds, including improved wildlife corridors.\n(7)Improved resiliency in the face of unavoidable impacts from climate change.\n(8)Improved water supply, flood protection, and water quality, including the water quality of impaired water bodies through river restoration.\n(9)Job training and workforce development, especially projects that involve disadvantaged youth and veterans.\n(10)Improved stormwater retention.\n(d)Projects receiving funding pursuant to this chapter shall also be consistent with both of the following:\n(1)The California Water Action Plan published by the Governor.\n(2)The Safeguarding California Plan published by the Natural Resources Agency.\n(e)Projects receiving funding pursuant to this chapter for flood protection shall be consistent, as applicable, with Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 8400) of Part 2 of Division 5, Part 6 (commencing with Section 9600) of Division 5, and Part 9 (commencing with Section 12980) of Division 6, of the Water Code.\n(f)The Natural Resources Agency shall also prioritize funding pursuant to this chapter for projects with the following characteristics:\n(1)Are consistent with a parkway, greenway, or urban greening plan.\n(2)Leverage moneys from the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election.\n(3)Provide recreational access and opportunities to major metropolitan areas of the state, including those that are relatively underserved by parks.\n5848.\nThe CalRIVER fund is hereby created in the State Treasury to be administered by the Natural Resources Agency. The moneys in the CalRIVER Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, shall be expended by the Natural Resources Agency in accordance with this chapter. The Legislature may transfer moneys to the fund from bond proceeds and special funds, including, but not limited to, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created by Section 16428.8 of the Government Code.\n5849.\nThe secretary shall develop regulations, criteria, or procedural guidelines for the implementation of this chapter."
