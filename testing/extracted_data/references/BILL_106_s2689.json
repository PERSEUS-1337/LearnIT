FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Andrew Jackson Higgins was born on August 28, 1886, in \n        Columbus, Nebraska, moved to New Orleans in 1910, and formed \n        Higgins Industries on September 26, 1930.\n            (2) Andrew Jackson Higgins designed, engineered, and \n        produced the ``Eureka'', a unique shallow draft boat the design \n        of which evolved during World War II into 2 basic classes of \n        military craft: high speed PT boats, and types of Higgins \n        landing craft (LCPs, LCPLs, LCVPs, LCMs and LCSs).\n            (3) Andrew Jackson Higgins designed, engineered, and \n        constructed 4 major assembly line plants in New Orleans for \n        mass production of Higgins landing craft and other vessels \n        vital to the Allied Forces' conduct of World War II.\n            (4) Andrew Jackson Higgins bought the entire 1940 \n        Philippine mahogany crop and other material purely at risk \n        without a government contract, anticipating that America would \n        join World War II and that Higgins Industries would need the \n        wood to build landing craft. Higgins also bought steel, \n        engines, and other material necessary to construct landing \n        craft.\n            (5) Andrew Jackson Higgins, through Higgins Industries, \n        employed a fully integrated assembly line work force, black and \n        white, male and female, of up to 30,000 during World War II, \n        with equal pay for equal work.\n            (6) In 1939, the United States Navy had a total of 18 \n        landing craft in the fleet.\n            (7) From November 18, 1940, when Higgins Industries was \n        awarded its first contract for Higgins landing craft until the \n        conclusion of the war, the employees of Higgins Industries \n        produced 12,300 Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel (LCVP's) and \n        nearly 8,000 other landing craft of all types.\n            (8) During World War II, Higgins Industries employees \n        produced 20,094 boats, including landing craft and Patrol \n        Torpedo boats, and trained 30,000 Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard \n        personnel on the safe operation of landing craft at the \n        Higgins' Boat Operators School.\n            (9) On Thanksgiving Day 1944, General Dwight D. Eisenhower \n        stated in an address to the Nation: ``Let us thank God for \n        Higgins Industries, management, and labor which has given us \n        the landing boats with which to conduct our campaign.''.\n            (10) Higgins landing craft, constructed of wood and steel, \n        transported fully armed troops, light tanks, field artillery, \n        and other mechanized equipment essential to amphibious \n        operations.\n            (11) Higgins landing craft made the amphibious assault on \n        D-day and the landings at Leyte, North Africa, Guadalcanal, \n        Sicily, Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Guam, and thousands of less well-\n        known assaults possible.\n            (12) Captain R.R.M. Emmett, a commander at the North Africa \n        amphibious landing, and later commandant of the Great Lakes \n        Training Station, wrote during the war: ``When the history of \n        this war is finally written by historians, far enough removed \n        from its present turmoil and clamor to be cool and impartial, I \n        predict that they will place Mr. (Andrew Jackson) Higgins very \n        high on the list of those who deserve the commendation and \n        gratitude of all citizens.''.\n            (13) In 1964, President Dwight D. Eisenhower told historian \n        Steven Ambrose: ``He (Higgins) is the man who won the war for \n        us. If Higgins had not developed and produced those landing \n        craft, we never could have gone in over an open beach. We would \n        have had to change the entire strategy of the war.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
