    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``World War II War Crimes \nAccountability Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Surviving Nazi war criminals are becoming increasingly \n        rare.\n            (2) The identities of many of the remaining criminals were \n        made known only after the end of the Cold War and the collapse \n        of Communist governments throughout eastern Europe.\n            (3) In most of these formerly communist countries, the \n        volume of available information is enormous, and the available \n        resources to study it and identify war crimes suspects is \n        comparatively small.\n            (4) In the United States, the Office of Special \n        Investigations (OSI) of the Department of Justice is \n        responsible for detecting, investigating and taking legal \n        action to denaturalize or deport persons who took part in Nazi-\n        sponsored acts of persecution committed abroad between 1933 and \n        1945.\n            (5) As of April 2008, OSI had successfully prosecuted more \n        than 100 people involved in Nazi war crimes who were residing \n        in the United States.\n            (6) As a government office with limited resources, OSI is \n        under enormous strain to identify and prosecute those criminals \n        identified by newly-released records before it is too late.\n            (7) Some foreign governments hinder the efforts of OSI, \n        Congress, and the United States Government to extradite or \n        deport convicted Nazi war criminals from the United States to \n        their country of origin or other relevant jurisdiction.\n            (8) Certain nongovernmental organizations have been \n        instrumental in the search for wanted Nazi war crimes suspects \n        for over 60 years.\n            (9) In 2002, the Simon Wiesenthal Center launched \n        Operation: Last Chance to maximize the identification and help \n        facilitate the prosecution of the remaining unprosecuted Nazi \n        war criminals, helping to achieve justice for the victims of \n        the Holocaust.\n            (10) Simon Wiesenthal, a survivor of the Nazi death camps \n        whose work stands as a reminder and a warning for future \n        generations, dedicated his life to--\n                    (A) documenting the crimes of the Holocaust; and\n                    (B) hunting down the perpetrators still at large.\n            (11) As founder and head of the Jewish Documentation Center \n        in Vienna, Simon Wiesenthal successfully brought to justice \n        wanted Nazi war criminals, including--\n                    (A) Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Treblinka \n                death camp;\n                    (B) Franz Murer, ``The Butcher of Wilno''; and\n                    (C) Erich Rajakowitsch, who was in charge of the \n                ``death transports'' in Holland.\n            (12) Mr. Wiesenthal's work, which contributed enormously to \n        the modern understanding of justice, war crimes, and crimes \n        against humanity, should be continued.\n            (13) Of the most guilty Nazis and Nazi collaborators still \n        at large, Operation: Last Chance has identified the following \n        suspects:\n                    (A) Dr. Aribert Heim, who served as a medical \n                doctor at the Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald, and Mauthausen \n                concentration camps, is the most wanted ex-Nazi still \n                at large. His most terrible crimes were committed at \n                Mauthausen, where he murdered hundreds of inmates by \n                administering lethal injections of phenol to their \n                hearts or by other torturous killing methods during the \n                fall of 1941. His whereabouts are unknown.\n                    (B) Dr. Sandor Kepiro, who served as an officer in \n                the Hungarian gendarmerie, was 1 of several Hungarian \n                officers convicted in 1944 for the mass murder of \n                several thousand civilians (mostly Jews) in the city of \n                Novi Sad on January 23, 1942. In the wake of the \n                occupation of Hungary in March 1944, he was pardoned, \n                promoted, and returned to active service. He escaped to \n                Austria in 1945, fled to Argentina in 1948, and \n                returned to Hungary in 1996.\n                    (C) Milivoj Asner, who served as the police chief \n                of the city of Slavonska Pozega. During 1941 and 1942, \n                Mr. Asner orchestrated the robbery, persecution and \n                destruction of the local Serb, Jewish and Gypsy \n                communities, which culminated in the deportation of \n                hundreds of civilians to Ustasha concentration camps, \n                where most of the deportees were murdered. After his \n                exposure in Operation: Last Chance, the former police \n                chief later escaped once again to Klagenfurt, Austria \n                where he currently resides.\n                    (D) Charles Zentai is accused of murdering 18-year-\n                old Peter Balazs, a Jewish boy he caught riding a \n                Budapest tram without the requisite yellow star on \n                November 8, 1944. After Hungarian requests for his \n                extradition went unanswered, Zentai was able to \n                immigrate to Australia in February 1950, where he \n                currently lives.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n    It is the sense of the Senate that--\n            (1) the United States should actively encourage extradition \n        and prosecution of the remaining Nazi war criminals (as \n        described by 8 U.S.C. 1182 (a)(3)(e));\n            (2) the Simon Wiesenthal Center should be commended for its \n        historic work in bringing to light the atrocities of the \n        Holocaust and in advancing justice for Nazi war criminals \n        through Operation: Last Chance; and\n            (3) the Office of Special Investigation of the Department \n        of Justice is advancing the declared foreign policy of the \n        United States by bringing wanted World War II criminals to \n        justice and should be commended for its actions.\n\nSEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF VISA WAIVER PROGRAM COUNTRIES.\n\n    (a) Cooperation.--After a country is initially designated as a visa \nwaiver program country under section 217(c) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187(c)), the Attorney General, in evaluating \nthe effect that such designation would have on the law enforcement and \nsecurity interests of the United States under paragraph (2)(C) of such \nsection, shall consider the extent to which such country is cooperating \nin--\n            (1) extraditing or prosecuting wanted or indicted Nazi war \n        criminals to the relevant jurisdiction; and\n            (2) admitting into their territory aliens described in \n        section 212(a)(3)(E)(i) and ordered removed from the United \n        States by a United States immigration judge, the Board of \n        Immigration Appeals, or a Federal court.\n    (b) Presidential Discretion.--\n            (1) In general.--If the President determines that it would \n        not be in the national interest of the United States to \n        terminate a country's designation as a visa waiver program \n        country based on the evaluation under subsection (a), the \n        President may decline to terminate such designation after \n        providing advance written notification to--\n                    (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n                Senate;\n                    (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n                    (C) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House \n                of Representatives; and\n                    (D) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n                Representatives.\n            (2) Contents.--In providing notification under paragraph \n        (1), the President shall--\n                    (A) identify each crime suspect described in \n                subsection (a)(2) whose admission has not been \n                effected; and\n                    (B) submit copies of all decisions rendered by \n                United States immigration judges, the Board of \n                Immigration Appeals, and Federal courts that relate to \n                such crime suspects.\n\nSEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT.\n\n    In each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the President shall \nsubmit an annual report to the committees listed in section 4(b)(1), \nwhich describes, for each country that has a pending application for \nentry into or renewal of the visa waiver program, whether such country \nis--\n            (1) cooperating satisfactorily in extraditing or deporting \n        wanted Nazi war crimes suspects to the jurisdiction in which \n        they have been indicted or convicted;\n            (2) prosecuting wanted Nazi war crimes suspects effectively \n        within such country's jurisdiction; and\n            (3) cooperating satisfactorily in admitting to the \n        territory of such country aliens described in section \n        212(a)(3)(E)(i) and ordered removed from the United States \n        territory by a United States immigration judge, the Board of \n        Immigration Appeals, or a Federal court."
