FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Citizens have a right, under the Second Amendment to \n        the United States Constitution, to keep and bear arms.\n            (2) Lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers, \n        distributors, dealers, and importers of nondefective firearms, \n        which seek money damages and other relief for the harm caused \n        by the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \n        criminals.\n            (3) The manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use \n        of firearms and ammunition in the United States is heavily \n        regulated by Federal, State, and local laws. Such Federal laws \n        include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National Firearms Act, \n        and the Arms Export Control Act.\n            (4) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in \n        interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n        marketing, distribution, manufacture, importation, or sale to \n        the public of firearms or ammunition that have been shipped or \n        transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and \n        should not be, liable or otherwise legally responsible for the \n        harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \n        firearm products or ammunition products.\n            (5) The possibility of imposing liability or other legal \n        restrictions on an entire industry as a result of harm that is \n        the sole responsibility of others is an abuse of the legal \n        system, erodes public confidence in our Nation's laws, \n        threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional right, \n        invites the disassembly and destabilization of other industries \n        and economic sectors lawfully competing in America's free \n        enterprise system, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on \n        interstate and foreign commerce.\n            (6) The liability and equitable actions commenced or \n        contemplated by municipalities, cities, and other entities are \n        based on theories without foundation in hundreds of years of \n        the common law and American jurisprudence. The possible \n        sustaining of these actions by a maverick judicial officer \n        would expand civil liability in a manner never contemplated by \n        the Framers of the Constitution. The Congress further finds \n        that such an expansion of liability would constitute a \n        deprivation of the rights, privileges, and immunities \n        guaranteed to a citizen of the United States under the \n        Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To prohibit causes of action against law-abiding \n        manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms \n        or ammunition products for the harm caused by the criminal or \n        unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products by \n        others.\n            (2) To preserve a citizen's constitutional access to a \n        supply of firearms and ammunition for all lawful purposes, \n        including hunting, self-defense, collecting, and competitive or \n        recreational shooting.\n            (3) To protect a citizen's right to privacy concerning the \n        lawful purchase and ownership of firearms.\n            (4) To guarantee a citizen's rights, privileges, and \n        immunities, as applied to the States, under the Fourteenth \n        Amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to \n        section five of that Amendment.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON BRINGING OF QUALIFIED CIVIL ACTIONS IN FEDERAL \n              OR STATE COURT.\n\n    (a) In General.--A qualified civil action may not be brought in any \nFederal or State court.\n    (b) Dismissal of Pending Actions.--A qualified civil action that is \npending on the date of the enactment of this Act shall be dismissed \nimmediately by the court in which the action was brought.\n\nSEC. 4.
