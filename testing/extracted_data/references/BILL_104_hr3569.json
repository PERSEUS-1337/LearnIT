FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the purpose of the World Trade Organization (hereafter \n        in this Act referred to as the ``WTO'') is to enable member \n        countries to conduct trade based upon free market principles, \n        by limiting government intervention in the form of state \n        subsidies, by limiting nontariff barriers, and by encouraging \n        reciprocal reductions in tariffs among members;\n            (2) the WTO is based on the assumption that the import and \n        export of goods are conducted by independent enterprises \n        responding to profit incentives and market forces;\n            (3) the WTO requires that countries with nonmarket \n        economies implement significant reforms to change centralized \n        and planned economic systems before they may be considered for \n        WTO membership, and the existence of a decentralized and a free \n        market economy is considered a precondition to fair trade among \n        WTO members;\n            (4) pursuant to its charter and rules, membership in the \n        WTO is not limited to nations nor indicative of sovereignty, a \n        policy illustrated by the fact that Hong Kong will remain a \n        full member of the WTO as a separate customs territory after \n        becoming part of the People's Republic of China on July 1, \n        1997;\n            (5) the Republic of China on Taiwan (hereafter in this Act \n        referred to as ``Taiwan'') has applied for membership in the \n        WTO as the separate customs territory of Taiwan, Penghu, \n        Kinmen, and Matsu, and its application is under review by a \n        Working Party appointed under Article XXXIII of the GATT 1994 \n        (as defined in section 2 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act \n        (19 U.S.C. 3501));\n            (6) Taiwan has a free market economy that has existed for \n        more than 3 decades, and is currently the 14th largest trading \n        nation in the world;\n            (7) Taiwan has a gross national product that is the world's \n        20th largest, its foreign exchange reserves are among the \n        largest in the world, and it has become the world's 7th largest \n        foreign investor;\n            (8) Taiwan is the 7th largest trading partner of the United \n        States and its purchases of United States exports are more than \n        50 percent greater than those of the People's Republic of \n        China;\n            (9) Taiwan has already agreed to reduce the tariff level of \n        many products, and to eliminate other nontariff barriers;\n            (10) the United States and Taiwan have enjoyed a \n        longstanding and uninterrupted friendship, which has only \n        increased in light of the remarkable economic development and \n        political liberalization in Taiwan in recent years;\n            (11) Taiwan reached an historic turning point in the \n        development of Chinese democracy on March 23, 1996, when it \n        conducted the first competitive, free, fair, direct, and \n        popular election of a head of state in over 4,000 years of \n        recorded Chinese history, leading to Lee Teng-hui's \n        inauguration as President on May 20, 1996;\n            (12) for the past century the United States has promoted \n        democracy and economic freedom throughout the world, and the \n        evolution of Taiwan is an outstanding example of the success of \n        that policy;\n            (13) Taiwan's accession to the WTO is important to the \n        United States because it is the largest importer of United \n        States goods that is not already a member of the WTO, and \n        because Taiwan's entry into the WTO would promote significant \n        new market opportunities for United States exporters and \n        investors;\n            (14) notwithstanding these circumstances, the People's \n        Republic of China has sought to block the admission of Taiwan \n        to the WTO until its own accession to membership;\n            (15) notwithstanding this opposition, Taiwan is ready for, \n        and meets the criteria for, admission to the WTO;\n            (16) the People's Republic of China, in contrast to Taiwan, \n        has applied for membership in the WTO not as a developed \n        nation, but rather as a developing nation, so that it would be \n        relieved of the obligations to reduce its tariffs and eliminate \n        its subsidies for government-controlled industries, even after \n        its admission to the WTO;\n            (17) in contrast to Taiwan, the Communist government of the \n        People's Republic of China maintains strict government controls \n        over most trade within its territory, restricts and often \n        outlaws free market competition, and denies legal and \n        regulatory protections for property rights, all in ways that \n        are incompatible with WTO principles;\n            (18) the Communist government of the People's Republic of \n        China maintains an intricate system of restrictive and punitive \n        tariff and nontariff administrative controls to implement its \n        centrally-planned industrial and trade policies, with tariffs \n        on foreign goods, such as automobiles, as high as 150 percent, \n        even though the People's Republic of China has made commitments \n        in the Memorandum of Understanding on market access it signed \n        with the United States on October 10, 1992, and reaffirmed in \n        March of 1995, to reform significant parts of its import \n        regime;\n            (19) the People's Republic of China's failure to implement \n        its March 11, 1995, agreement with the United States to curtail \n        piracy of products protected by intellectual property rights, \n        including music, videos, books, software, has prompted a United \n        States threat to impose trade sanctions proportionate to an \n        estimated loss of $2,300,000,000 to the United States economy \n        in 1995 that the piracy has caused;\n            (20) representatives of the People's Republic of China's \n        two leading state-owned arms exporting companies, Poly \n        Technologies and Norinco, were arrested by Federal law \n        enforcement officers for smuggling into the United States 2,000 \n        AK-47 rifles intended for sale to gangs;\n            (21) illegal activities such as these should be taken into \n        account in formulating trade policy with respect to any \n        country;\n            (22) the Communist government of the People's Republic of \n        China continues to use direct and indirect government subsidies \n        to unfairly advantage its own exports in contravention of \n        market principles;\n            (23) as a consequence of these practices, the People's \n        Republic China is not ready for, and does not meet the criteria \n        for, admission to the WTO either as a developed nation or a \n        developing nation; and\n            (24) inasmuch as Taiwan can easily meet and exceed all of \n        the requirements for admission to the WTO, while the People's \n        Republic of China has long enjoyed most-favored-nation trading \n        status with the United States notwithstanding its failure to \n        meet the criteria for WTO membership, the People's Republic of \n        China should continue to enjoy most-favored-nation trading \n        status with the United States only if Taiwan is admitted to the \n        WTO at the earliest practicable date.\n\nSEC. 2. CONTINGENT EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TRADE TREATMENT TO \n              THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (most-favored-nation treatment) may apply to the products of \nthe People's Republic of China after March 1, 1997, if and only if, as \nof that date, Taiwan has been admitted to the WTO as a separate customs \nterritory and the People's Republic of China has not been admitted to \nthe WTO, whether as a developing or a developed nation."
