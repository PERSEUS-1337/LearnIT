FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) More than 2,500,000 grandparents in the United States are \n    the primary caretaker of their grandchildren, and experts report \n    that such numbers are increasing as the opioid epidemic expands.\n        (2) Between 2009 and 2016, the incidence of parental alcohol or \n    other drug use as a contributing factor for children's out-of-home \n    placement rose from 25.4 to 37.4 percent.\n        (3) When children cannot remain safely with their parents, \n    placement with relatives is preferred over placement in foster care \n    with nonrelatives because placement with relatives provides \n    stability for children and helps them maintain family connections.\n        (4) The number of foster children placed with a grandparent or \n    other relative increased from 24 percent in 2006 to 32 percent in \n    2016, according to data from the Department of Health and Human \n    Services.\n        (5) Grandparents' lives are enhanced by caring for their \n    grandchildren; the overwhelming majority of grandparents report \n    experiencing significant benefits in serving as their \n    grandchildren's primary caregivers.\n        (6) Providing full-time care to their grandchildren may \n    decrease grandparents' ability to address their own physical and \n    mental health needs and personal well-being.\n        (7) Grandparents would benefit from better coordination and \n    dissemination of information and resources available to support \n    them in their caregiving responsibilities.\nSEC. 3.
