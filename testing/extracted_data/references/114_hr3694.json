    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ \nTrafficking Act'' or the ``STOP Organ Trafficking Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that \n        approximately 10 percent of all transplanted kidneys worldwide \n        are illegally obtained, often bought from vulnerable \n        impoverished persons or forcibly harvested from prisoners.\n            (2) In 2004, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution \n        urging its member-states to take measures to protect the \n        poorest as well as vulnerable groups from exploitation by organ \n        traffickers.\n            (3) On February 13, 2008, the United Nations Global \n        Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UNGIFT) hosted the \n        ``Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking'', and subsequently \n        reported that a lack of adequate illicit organ trafficking laws \n        has provided opportunity for the illegal trade to grow.\n            (4) On March 21, 2011, the Council of the European Union \n        adopted rules supplementing the definition of criminal offenses \n        and the level of sanctions in order to strengthen the \n        prevention of organ trafficking and the protection of those \n        victims.\n            (5) In 2005, the United States ratified the Protocol to \n        Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially \n        Women and Children, a supplement to the United Nations \n        Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which \n        includes the removal of organs as a form of exploitation under \n        the definition of ``trafficking in persons''.\n            (6) According to a 2013 United Nations report from the \n        Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women \n        and children, the economic and social divisions within and \n        among countries is notably reflected in the illicit organ \n        trafficking market, in which the victims are commonly poor, \n        unemployed, and more susceptible to deceit and extortion.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the kidnapping or coercion of individuals for the \n        purpose of extracting their organs for profit is in \n        contradiction of the ideals and standards for ethical behavior \n        upon which the United States has based its laws;\n            (2) the illegal harvesting of organs from children is a \n        violation of the human rights of the child and is a breach of \n        internationally accepted medical ethical standards described in \n        WHO Assembly Resolution 57.18 (May 22, 2004);\n            (3) the illegal harvesting and trafficking of organs \n        violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in Article \n        3 which states that ``Everyone has the right to life, liberty \n        and security of person.'', and in Article 4 which states that \n        ``No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.''; and\n            (4) establishing efficient voluntary organ donation systems \n        with strong enforcement mechanisms is the most effective way to \n        combat trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) combat the international trafficking of persons for the \n        removal of their organs;\n            (2) promote the establishment of voluntary organ donation \n        systems with effective enforcement mechanisms in bilateral \n        diplomatic meetings, as well as in international health forums; \n        and\n            (3) promote the dignity and security of human life in \n        accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nSEC. 5. REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF PASSPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ORGAN \n              TRAFFICKERS.\n\n    The Act entitled ``An Act to regulate the issue and validity of \npassports, and for other purposes'', approved July 3, 1926 (22 U.S.C. \n211a et seq.), which is commonly known as the ``Passport Act of 1926'', \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO DENY OR REVOKE PASSPORT.\n\n    ``(a) Issuance.--The Secretary of State may refuse to issue a \npassport to any individual who has been convicted of an offense under \nsection 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act (42 U.S.C. 274e) if \nsuch individual used a passport or otherwise crossed an international \nborder in the commission of such an offence.\n    ``(b) Revocation.--The Secretary of State may revoke a passport \npreviously issued to any individual described in paragraph (1).''.\n\nSEC. 6.
