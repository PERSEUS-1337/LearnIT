FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the power to dispose of and make all necessary rules \n        governing property belonging to the United States is vested in \n        Congress under section 3 of article IV of the Constitution;\n            (2) some Federal property designations under international \n        agreements concern land use policies and regulations for \n        property belonging to the United States that, under section 3 \n        of article IV of the Constitution, can be implemented only by \n        an Act of Congress;\n            (3) some international property designations, such as those \n        under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man \n        and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, \n        Educational, and Cultural Organization, operate under \n        independent national committees, such as the United States \n        National Man and Biosphere Committee, that have no legislative \n        directive or authorization from Congress;\n            (4) actions by the United States in making such \n        designations may affect the use and value of nearby non-Federal \n        property;\n            (5) the sovereignty of the States is a critical component \n        of our Federal system of government and a bulwark against the \n        unwise concentration of power;\n            (6) private property rights are essential for the \n        protection of freedom;\n            (7) actions by the United States to designate property \n        belonging to the United States under international agreements \n        in some cases conflict with congressional constitutional \n        responsibilities and the sovereign powers of the States; and\n            (8) actions by the President in applying certain \n        international agreements to property owned by the United States \n        diminish the authority of Congress to make rules respecting the \n        property.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to reaffirm the power of Congress under section 3 of \n        article IV of the Constitution over international agreements \n        that concern disposal, management, and use of property \n        belonging to the United States;\n            (2) to protect State powers not reserved to the Federal \n        Government under the Constitution from Federal actions \n        designating property under international agreements;\n            (3) to ensure that no United States citizen suffers any \n        diminishment or loss of individual rights as a result of \n        Federal action designating property under an international \n        agreement for the purpose of imposing restrictions on use of \n        the property;\n            (4) to protect private interests in property from \n        diminishment as a result of Federal action designating property \n        under international agreements; and\n            (5) to provide a process under which the United States may, \n        when it is desirable to do so, designate property under an \n        international agreement.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN WORLD HERITAGE SITE \n              LISTING.\n\n    Section 401 of the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of \n1980 (16 U.S.C. 470a-1) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``Sec. 401.
