FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The ability of the Federal Government to obtain \n        information on threats and risks to the critical infrastructure \n        of the United States, whether operated by the public sector or \n        private sector and whether domestic or foreign, is vital to the \n        maintenance of United States security and the economic well-\n        being of the United States.\n            (2) Persons in the private sector and non-Federal \n        governmental agencies have expressed a willingness to \n        voluntarily provide sensitive information on critical \n        infrastructure threats and vulnerabilities to the Federal \n        Government contingent on the ability of the Federal Government \n        to protect such information from unrestricted disclosure.\n            (3) The Federal Government needs critical infrastructure \n        information from persons in the private sector and non-Federal \n        governmental agencies in order to protect critical \n        infrastructure from intentional acts of significant harm.\n            (4) The public interest is best served by preserving the \n        confidentiality of critical infrastructure information that is \n        submitted to the Federal Government to the extent necessary to \n        encourage the submittal of such information to the Federal \n        Government.\n            (5) Current Federal law does not provide persons in the \n        private sector and non-Federal governmental agencies with clear \n        assurance that information submitted to the Federal Government \n        on threats and risks to critical infrastructure will be \n        protected from disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United \n        States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information \n        Act).\n            (6) There are currently more than 100 exemptions from \n        disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information Act \n        that have been approved by law for other purposes.\n            (7) President Clinton has acknowledged the national \n        security issues that result from the cyber vulnerabilities of \n        the United States in stating that ``[w]e must be ready . . . \n        ready if our adversaries try to use computers to disable our \n        power grids, banking, communications and transportation \n        networks, police, fire and health services, or military \n        assets''.\n            (8) Information sharing among private sector organizations \n        is critical to help identify vulnerabilities and threats to \n        information networks. Many companies are wary of participating \n        in cyber security information sharing activities with one \n        another due to concerns about antitrust penalties.\n            (9) Currently, the maximum penalties for Federal computer \n        crimes are inadequate to punish and deter the most serious \n        computer crimes.\n            (10) In order to catch cyber criminals, a cyber attack must \n        be swiftly traced to its source.\n            (11) A lack of standardization among law enforcement \n        agencies has hindered effective information gathering from \n        industry during investigation of cyber crimes.\n            (12) Many cyber attacks are complicated by the criminal's \n        use of a false Internet protocol (IP) address, thus masking the \n        origin of the attack. There is no legitimate use for a false IP \n        address.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION UNDER \n              THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.\n\n    (a) Limitation.--Critical infrastructure information, records \nrelating to critical infrastructure information, and information on \ncritical infrastructure protection derived from such information or \nrecords that is submitted voluntarily by a non-Federal source to a \ncritical infrastructure protection office or program shall not be made \navailable under section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \nreferred to as the Freedom of Information Act), if the person \nsubmitting such information or records expressly requests that such \ninformation or records, or information derived therefrom, not be made \navailable under that section.\n    (b) Designation of Office or Program.--\n            (1) Designation.--The President or the head of a Federal \n        agency may designate an element in the agency as a critical \n        infrastructure office or program for purposes of subsection \n        (a).
