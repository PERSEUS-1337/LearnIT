FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many independent workers, constituting a growing \n        percentage of the workforce in the United States, do not have \n        access to benefits and protections typically provided through \n        traditional full-time employment.\n            (2) These independent workers are independent contractors, \n        temporary workers, self-employed, or work pursuant to other \n        contingent or alternative work arrangements.\n            (3) According to a 2015 study by the Comptroller General of \n        the United States, the size of the contingent workforce grew \n        from 35 percent of employed workers in 2006 to 40 percent of \n        employed workers in 2010.\n            (4) According to a 2016 study by economists Lawrence Katz \n        and Alan Krueger, 94 percent of net employment growth in the \n        United States economy from 2005 to 2015 occurred in alternative \n        work arrangements.\n            (5) As the population of independent workers grows, it is \n        increasingly important that workers are provided portable \n        benefits.\n\nSEC. 3.
