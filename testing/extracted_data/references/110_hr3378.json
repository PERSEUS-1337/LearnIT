FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Approximately 2,660,000 students attend institutions on \n        a less than half-time basis.\n            (2) The average age of college students has risen and \n        enrollment among older students is rising faster than among \n        those in their late teens.\n            (3) Less than half-time enrollment allows students to \n        balance the demands of school, work, and family.\n            (4) Only approximately 30 percent of American workers today \n        have a college degree, but more Americans are recognizing how \n        important it is to earn a degree or acquire new skills.\n            (5) Job security and success in a global economy requires \n        training and education beyond high school.\n            (6) Students who attend school less than half-time are not \n        eligible for Federal subsidized student loans, the largest \n        source of Federal student financial aid.\n            (7) A range of financial options exist for less than half-\n        time students, yet these options are limited and poorly \n        utilized.\n\nSEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION LOAN PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    Part G of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended \nby inserting after section 486 (20 U.S.C. 1093) the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 496A.
