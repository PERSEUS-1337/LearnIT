TAX CREDIT FOR CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to business credits) is \namended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 45Q. CREDIT FOR CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION.\n\n    ``(a) General Rule.--For purposes of section 38, the carbon dioxide \nsequestration credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to the sum \nof--\n            ``(1) $20 per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide which \n        is--\n                    ``(A) captured by the taxpayer at a qualified \n                facility, and\n                    ``(B) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure \n                geological storage, and\n            ``(2) $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide which \n        is--\n                    ``(A) captured by the taxpayer at a qualified \n                facility, and\n                    ``(B) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant \n                in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery \n                project.\n    ``(b) Qualified Carbon Dioxide.--For purposes of this section--\n            ``(1) In general.--The term `qualified carbon dioxide' \n        means carbon dioxide captured from an industrial source which--\n                    ``(A) would otherwise be released into the \n                atmosphere as industrial emission of greenhouse gas, \n                and\n                    ``(B) is measured at the source of capture and \n                verified at the point of disposal or injection.\n            ``(2) Recycled carbon dioxide.--The term `qualified carbon \n        dioxide' includes the initial deposit of captured carbon \n        dioxide used as a tertiary injectant. Such term does not \n        include carbon dioxide that is re-captured, recycled, and re-\n        injected as part of the enhanced oil and natural gas recovery \n        process.\n    ``(c) Qualified Facility.--For purposes of this section, the term \n`qualified facility' means any industrial facility--\n            ``(1) which is owned by the taxpayer,\n            ``(2) at which carbon capture equipment is placed in \n        service, and\n            ``(3) which captures not less than 500,000 metric tons of \n        carbon dioxide during the taxable year.\n    ``(d) Special Rules and Other Definitions.--For purposes of this \nsection--\n            ``(1) Only carbon dioxide captured and stored or used \n        within the united states taken into account.--The credit under \n        this section shall apply only with respect to qualified carbon \n        dioxide--\n                    ``(A) the capture of which is within the United \n                States (within the meaning of section 638(1)) or a \n                possession of the United States (within the meaning of \n                section 638(2)), and\n                    ``(B) which is stored in secure geological storage, \n                or used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced \n                oil or natural gas recovery project, located within the \n                United States (as so defined) or a possession of the \n                United States (as so defined).\n            ``(2) Secure geological storage.--The Secretary, in \n        consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency, shall establish regulations for determining \n        adequate security measures for the geological storage of carbon \n        dioxide under subsection (a)(1)(B) such that the carbon dioxide \n        does not escape into the atmosphere.
