FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) availability of low-income housing rental units has \n        declined nationwide in the last several years;\n            (2) as rents for low-income housing increase and the \n        development of new units of affordable housing decreases, there \n        are fewer privately owned, federally assisted affordable \n        housing units available to low-income individuals in need;\n            (3) the demand for affordable housing far exceeds the \n        supply of such housing, as evidenced by recent studies; and\n            (4) the efforts of nonprofit organizations have \n        significantly preserved and expanded access to low-income \n        housing.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to continue the partnerships among the Federal \n        Government, State and local governments, nonprofit \n        organizations, and the private sector in operating and \n        assisting housing that is affordable to low-income persons and \n        families;\n            (2) to promote the preservation of affordable housing units \n        by providing matching grants to States that have developed and \n        funded programs for the preservation of privately owned housing \n        that is affordable to low-income families and persons; and\n            (3) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants who \n        are currently residing in such housing, many of whom are \n        elderly or disabled persons and families with children.\n\nSEC. 3.
