FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the national interest and national security \n        interest of the United States to help foster greater economic \n        security and stability in the Americas;\n            (2) the Americas are a distinct geographical region with \n        political and cultural identities that are linked in important \n        ways;\n            (3) many of the social, economic, and security issues in \n        the Americas transcend national borders, and addressing these \n        issues requires a coordinated, long-term approach;\n            (4) over the last few decades, there has been notable \n        progress on democracy and economic stability in the Region, and \n        it is now largely made up of democracies with shared democratic \n        values;\n            (5) for progress in the Region to be sustained, governments \n        will need to continue to develop effective and transparent \n        civilian institutions, and maintain a system of checks and \n        balances among those institutions;\n            (6) the United States is committed to promoting democracy, \n        human rights, and social and economic development throughout \n        the Americas, while respecting the heritage, culture, and \n        sovereignty of all nations;\n            (7) poverty and inequality remain persistent problems in \n        the Americas, spawning street crime, criminal cartels, and \n        undermining the authority of government institutions;\n            (8) the poverty rate in the Region is nearly 40 percent, \n        with little significant improvement since the 1980s, and the \n        countries in the Region, on average, have the most unequal \n        distribution of wealth in the world;\n            (9) greater citizen engagement and closer connections \n        between the institutions of civil society and local and \n        national governments are critical to political stability and \n        economic growth in the Americas;\n            (10) development assistance to promote micro, small, and \n        medium enterprise growth, improve the investment climate, and \n        create a competitive workforce in the countries of the Region \n        can help foster economic security and stability;\n            (11) an expanding middle class in the Region will result in \n        increased demand for exports from the United States;\n            (12) in partnering with the countries of the Region, the \n        United States can play a positive role in addressing the \n        challenges of poverty and inequality, and achieving greater \n        energy security;\n            (13) an increased United States commitment to economic and \n        social development in the Region can benefit workers and \n        businesses in the United States; and\n            (14) as President Obama said to the leaders of the Region \n        at the Fifth Summit of the Americas, the United States is \n        ``committed to combating inequality and creating prosperity \n        from the bottom up . . . This is by no means charity. Together, \n        we can create a broader foundation for prosperity that builds \n        new markets and powers new growth for all peoples in the \n        hemisphere''.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to minimize the negative economic impact on the \n        countries in the Region of the global recession, and to seek a \n        broad-based regional recovery;\n            (2) to promote democracy and the rule of law in the Region;\n            (3) to promote and strengthen human rights in the Region \n        by--\n                    (A) participating in the Inter-American Commission \n                on Human Rights and in the Inter-American Court of \n                Human Rights;\n                    (B) concluding negotiations on the draft Inter-\n                American Convention against Racism and All Forms of \n                Discrimination and Intolerance; and\n                    (C) supporting the full rights of indigenous \n                peoples and Afro-descendents in the Americas, including \n                the right to participate in the political and economic \n                life of a nation;\n            (4) to improve living conditions for all citizens in the \n        Americas by--\n                    (A) protecting all people in the Americas, \n                especially women, children, and adolescents, from all \n                forms of trafficking in persons and sexual and economic \n                exploitation;\n                    (B) coordinating national strategies within the \n                Americas to eradicate forced labor before 2010, and the \n                worst forms of child labor by 2020; and\n                    (C) supporting programs that create opportunities \n                for work in the formal sector, and programs providing \n                workers with the technical skills needed to meet the \n                demands of labor markets;\n            (5) to improve public health in the countries of the \n        Americas by--\n                    (A) implementing the World Health Organization's \n                International Health Regulations to prevent pandemics \n                and reduce the likelihood of public health emergencies; \n                and\n                    (B) implementing the Joint United Nations Program \n                on HIV/AIDS;\n            (6) to improve public education in the Americas by--\n                    (A) supporting programs which seek to increase \n                enrollments in secondary and vocational-technical \n                education;\n                    (B) reaffirming the commitment of the United States \n                to the 2008 Declaration of Medellin: Youth and \n                Democratic Values; and\n                    (C) supporting the Inter-American Social Protection \n                Network;\n            (7) to improve the capacity of government institutions by--\n                    (A) supporting the Inter-American Network on \n                Decentralization, Local Government and Citizen \n                Participation (RIAD);\n                    (B) supporting the Inter-American Convention \n                against Corruption, adopted at Caracas, Venezuela, \n                March 29, 1996, in the fight against all forms of \n                corruption, fraudulent practices and unethical \n                behaviors.\n\nSEC. 5.
