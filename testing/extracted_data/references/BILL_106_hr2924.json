FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Hedge funds currently operate largely outside the \n        framework of substantive United States banking, securities, and \n        futures laws and regulations.\n            (2) The recent crisis of a large hedge fund demonstrated \n        several ways in which the condition of major financial \n        institutions in the United States, including many banks with \n        federally insured deposits, reflects the success or failure of \n        various hedge funds.\n            (3) Among other things, financial institutions often invest \n        in hedge funds, lend to hedge funds, act as counterparties in \n        securities and derivatives transactions with hedge funds, and \n        conduct proprietary trading activities that mirror the \n        investment strategies of leading hedge funds.\n            (4) In several cases, hedge funds utilize financial \n        leveraging practices to a greater degree than do many regulated \n        financial institutions and this high degree of leverage \n        exacerbates the extent to which such hedge funds potentially \n        pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the United States \n        and international financial systems.\n            (5) Given that most of the institutions and wealthy \n        individuals that invest in hedge funds are highly \n        sophisticated, market forces, rather than government \n        regulations, are the best tools for constraining hedge funds \n        from engaging in excessive leverage.\n            (6) Market forces are similarly the most effective means of \n        disciplining financial institutions that have allowed hedge \n        fund dealings to threaten their stability.\n            (7) The United States Government must insure that the \n        failure of 1 or more hedge funds never causes a severe burden \n        on the United States financial system or the United States \n        payments system and that Federal resources are not squandered \n        in efforts to salvage collapsed hedge funds.\n            (8) Market forces cannot properly function with respect to \n        hedge fund risks without a minimum of reliable information \n        about hedge funds activities.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n            (1) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Board of Governors \n        of the Federal Reserve System.\n            (2) Federal banking agencies.--The term ``Federal banking \n        agency'' has the meaning given to such term in section 3(z) of \n        the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n            (3) Unregulated hedge fund.--The term ``unregulated hedge \n        fund'' means--\n                    (A) any pooled investment vehicle that--\n                            (i) has capital of $3,000,000,000 or more;\n                            (ii) is privately organized, administered \n                        by professional investment managers, and not \n                        widely available to the public; and\n                            (iii) is not registered as an investment \n                        company under the Investment Company Act of \n                        1940; and\n                    (B) any group or family of pooled investment \n                vehicles described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of \n                subparagraph (A) that has total assets under management \n                of $20,000,000,000 or more.\n\nSEC. 4.
