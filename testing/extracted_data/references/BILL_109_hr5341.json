EXCEPTION FROM CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORTS FOR SEASONED \n              CUSTOMERS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The completion of and filing of currency transaction \n        reports under section 5313 of title 31, United States Code, \n        poses a compliance burden on the financial industry.\n            (2) Due to the nature of the transactions or the persons \n        and entities conducting such transactions, some reports as \n        currently filed may not be relevant to the detection, \n        deterrence, or investigation of financial crimes, including \n        money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n            (3) However, the data contained in such reports can provide \n        valuable context for the analysis of other data derived \n        pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United \n        States Code, as well as investigative data, which provide \n        invaluable and indispensable information supporting efforts to \n        combat money laundering and other financial crimes.\n            (4) An appropriate exemption process from the reporting \n        requirements for certain currency transactions that are of \n        little or no value to ongoing efforts of law enforcement \n        agencies, financial regulatory agencies, and the financial \n        services industry to investigate, detect, or deter financial \n        crimes would continue to fulfill the compelling need to produce \n        and provide meaningful information to policy-makers, financial \n        regulators, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies, while \n        potentially lowering the compliance burden placed on financial \n        institutions by the need to file such reports.\n            (5) The Secretary of the Treasury has by regulation, and in \n        accordance with section 5313 of title 31, United States Code, \n        implemented a process by which institutions may seek exemptions \n        from filing certain currency transaction reports based on \n        appropriate circumstances; however, the financial industry has \n        not taken full advantage of these provisions and has contended \n        that they are unduly burdensome.\n            (6) The act of providing notice to the Secretary of the \n        Treasury of designations of exemption--\n                    (A) provides meaningful information to law \n                enforcement officials on exempt customers and enables \n                law enforcement to obtain account information through \n                appropriate legal process; and\n                    (B) complements other sections of title 31, United \n                States Code, whereby law enforcement can locate \n                financial institutions with relevant records relating \n                to a person of investigative interest, such as \n                information requests made pursuant to regulations \n                implementing section 314(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act of \n                2001.\n            (7) A designation of exemption has no effect on \n        requirements for depository institutions to apply the full \n        range of anti-money laundering controls required under \n        subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, \n        and related provisions of law, including the requirement to \n        apply the customer identification program pursuant to section \n        5326 of such title, and the requirement to identify, monitor, \n        and, if appropriate, report suspicious activity in accordance \n        with section 5318(g) of such title.\n            (8) The Federal banking agencies and the Financial Crimes \n        Enforcement Network have recently provided guidance through the \n        Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Bank Secrecy \n        Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual on applying \n        appropriate levels of due diligence and identifying suspicious \n        activity by the types of cash-intensive businesses that \n        generally will be subject to exemption.\n    (b) Seasoned Customer Exemption.--Section 5313(e) of title 31, \nUnited States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(e) Qualified Customer Exemption.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Before the end of the 270-day period \n        beginning on the date of the enactment of the Seasoned Customer \n        CTR Exemption Act of 2006, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n        prescribe regulations that exempt any depository institution \n        from filing a report pursuant to this section in a transaction \n        for the payment, receipt, or transfer of United States coins or \n        currency (or other monetary instruments the Secretary of the \n        Treasury prescribes) with a qualified customer of the \n        depository institution.\n            ``(2) Qualified customer defined.--For purposes of this \n        section, the term `qualified customer', with respect to a \n        depository institution, has such meaning as the Secretary of \n        the Treasury shall prescribe, which shall include any person \n        that--\n                    ``(A) is incorporated or organized under the laws \n                of the United States or any State, including a sole \n                proprietorship (as defined in 31 C.F.R. \n                103.22(d)(6)(vii), as in effect on May 10, 2006), or is \n                registered as and eligible to do business within the \n                United States or a State;\n                    ``(B) has maintained a deposit account with the \n                depository institution for at least 12 months;
