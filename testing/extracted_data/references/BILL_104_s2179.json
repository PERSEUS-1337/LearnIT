ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN.\n\n    The Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n            ``TITLE V--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN\n\n``SEC. 501. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            ``(1) public health and safety depends on citizens and \n        local officials knowing the toxic dangers that exist in their \n        communities and neighborhoods;\n            ``(2) children and other vulnerable subpopulations are more \n        at risk from environmental pollutants than adults and therefore \n        face unique health threats that need special attention;\n            ``(3) a study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences \n        on the effects of pesticides in the diets of infants and \n        children concluded that current approaches to risk assessment \n        typically do not consider risks to children and, as a result, \n        current standards and tolerances often fail to adequately \n        protect infants and children;\n            ``(4) risk assessments of pesticides and other \n        environmental pollutants conducted by the Environmental \n        Protection Agency do not clearly differentiate between the \n        risks to children and the risks to adults;\n            ``(5) data are lacking that would allow adequate \n        quantification and evaluation of child-specific and other-\n        vulnerable-subpopulation-specific susceptibility and exposure \n        to environmental pollutants; and\n            ``(6) the absence of data precludes effective government \n        regulation of environmental pollutants, and denies individuals \n        the ability to exercise a right to know and make informed \n        decisions to protect their families.\n    ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--\n            ``(1) all environmental and public health standards set by \n        the Environmental Protection Agency must be adequate to protect \n        children and other vulnerable subpopulations that are at \n        greater risk from exposure to environmental pollutants;\n            ``(2) adequate hazard data should be developed with respect \n        to the special vulnerability and exposure to environmental \n        pollutants of children and other vulnerable subpopulations to \n        better assess where, and at what levels, children and other \n        vulnerable subpopulations are being exposed;\n            ``(3) scientific research opportunities should be \n        identified by the Environmental Protection Agency to study the \n        health effects of cumulative and simultaneous exposures of \n        children and other vulnerable subpopulations to environmental \n        pollutants;\n            ``(4) information should be made readily available by the \n        Environmental Protection Agency to the general public to \n        advance the public's right-to-know, and allow the public to \n        avoid unnecessary and involuntary exposure; and\n            ``(5) a family right-to-know initiative should be developed \n        by the Environmental Protection Agency to provide parents with \n        basic information so the parents can make informed choices to \n        protect their children from environmental health threats in \n        their homes, schools, and communities.\n\n``SEC. 502.
