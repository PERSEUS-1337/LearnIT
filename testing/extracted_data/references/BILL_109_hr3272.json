FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the current system of compensation for Federal law \n        enforcement officers (hereinafter in this section referred to \n        as ``FLEOs'') must be reformed in order to deal with \n        recruitment, retention, and morale problems associated with \n        assignments to high-cost areas;\n            (2) as the Office of Personnel Management has confirmed, \n        limitations on premium pay are contributing to the pay \n        compression problem which, in turn, may be undermining the \n        efficacy of incentives designed to encourage FLEOs to assume \n        greater supervisory and managerial duties;\n            (3) the security of the Nation, as the 9-11 Commission \n        Report confirmed, depends on effective Federal law enforcement; \n        this is particularly true of large metropolitan areas, which \n        should be staffed with FLEOs who are fairly compensated for \n        their services;\n            (4) the combination of rising living costs and lagging \n        compensation threatens to worsen the significant recruitment \n        and retention problems already facing Federal law enforcement \n        agencies;\n            (5) the problems described in paragraph (4) are especially \n        serious among law enforcement officers of the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation, who are recruited and subject to assignment \n        nationwide, and, upon assignment, are expected to adjust \n        rapidly; but who, particularly in the case of those assigned to \n        high-cost areas, often experience significant difficulties in \n        finding adequate and affordable housing; and\n            (6) the Office of Personnel Management should experiment \n        with innovative approaches to addressing compensation problems \n        in the Federal workforce and, in the case of FLEOs, should look \n        to the Department of Defense as a model for providing a \n        reasonable housing allowance to assist those assigned to high-\n        cost areas.\n\nSEC. 3. HOUSING ALLOWANCE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Office of Personnel Management shall provide \nfor a demonstration project under which eligible employees will be paid \na basic housing allowance.\n    (b) Eligible Employees.--For purposes of this Act, the term \n``eligible employee'' means an employee who holds a position that--\n            (1) is in or under the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n            (2)(A) is classified under chapter 51 of title 5, United \n        States Code, as a GS-1811 position; or\n            (B) if the GS-1811 classification is redesignated or \n        abolished or the qualification requirements for the GS-1811 \n        classification are modified after the date of enactment of this \n        Act, meets the qualification requirements for the GS-1811 \n        classification either as then currently in effect or as in \n        effect on such date of enactment; and\n            (3) is within a high-cost area.\nSuch term does not include an employee who is serving on a temporary \nbasis or a part-time career employment basis (within the meaning of \nsection 3401 of such title 5) or who is a reemployed annuitant (within \nthe meaning of section 8344 or 8468 of such title 5).\n    (c) Identification of High-Cost Areas.--\n            (1) Criteria.--\n                    (A) In general.--An area shall, with respect to any \n                calendar year, be considered to be a high-cost area for \n                purposes of this Act if, with respect to the calendar \n                year last ending before the start of such fiscal year--\n                            (i) the average monthly housing costs for \n                        that area exceeded the average monthly housing \n                        costs for the continental United States by at \n                        least 10 percent (the dollar amount of that \n                        difference hereinafter in this Act referred to \n                        as the ``housing cost differential''); or\n                            (ii) such area was one of the 10 areas \n                        within the continental United States having the \n                        highest cost of living (identified in such \n                        manner as the Office of Personnel Management \n                        shall determine) and for which average monthly \n                        housing costs exceeded the average monthly \n                        housing costs for the continental United \n                        States.\n                    (B) Same differential computation rule applies.--\n                The housing cost differential for any area identified \n                under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be determined in the \n                same manner as described in subparagraph (A)(i), but \n                disregarding the 10-percent requirement.\n            (2) Annual determinations.--In order to carry out this \n        subsection, the Office of Personnel Management shall (for each \n        fiscal year during which the demonstration project remains in \n        operation) identify which areas satisfy paragraph (1).\n            (3) Costs of adequate housing.--Determinations of monthly \n        housing costs under this subsection shall be based on the costs \n        of renting adequate housing typically borne by individuals \n        residing within the area involved who have income levels \n        comparable to those of eligible employees within the same area \n        (taking into account, with respect to eligible employees, only \n        amounts payable to such employees under title 5, United States \n        Code).\n            (4) Definition of an area.--For purposes of this section, \n        the term ``area'' means a metropolitan statistical area within \n        the continental United States.\n    (d) Basic Housing Allowance.--\n            (1) In general.--The Office of Personnel Management shall \n        prescribe the basic housing allowance payable to eligible \n        employees within each area that has been identified under \n        subsection (c) as a high-cost area for purposes of the fiscal \n        year involved.\n            (2) Amount.--The amount of the basic housing allowance for \n        each high-cost area shall be equal to such amount as the Office \n        of Personnel Management shall determine, except that--\n                    (A) determinations under this paragraph shall be \n                made in a manner based on section 403(b) of title 37, \n                United States Code (relating to basic allowance for \n                housing for members of the uniformed services); and\n                    (B) in no event may any such amount be less than \n                the housing cost differential determined under \n                subsection (c) for the area and fiscal year involved.\n            (3) Manner of payment.--A basic housing allowance shall be \n        payable at the same time and in the same manner as basic pay.\n            (4) Nonreduction rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n        of this Act, the basic housing allowance payable to an \n        individual who continuously remains an eligible employee within \n        the same high-cost area may not be reduced by reason of any \n        fluctuations in housing costs.\n            (5) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n        considered to permit or require any reduction in basic pay by \n        reason of an individual's eligibility for or receipt of a basic \n        housing allowance.\n    (e) Applicability of Provisions Governing Demonstration Projects \nGenerally.--The demonstration project shall be conducted in accordance \nwith section 4703 of title 5, United States Code, except that such \nproject shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection (d)(1) \nthereof and shall not be taken into account for purposes of applying \nthe numerical limitation under subsection (d)(2) thereof.\n    (f) Duration.--The demonstration project--\n            (1) shall be conducted over the 5-year period beginning on \n        the first day of the first fiscal year beginning at least 30 \n        days after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n            (2) may, subject to the availability of appropriations, be \n        extended for one or more additional 12-month periods after the \n        end of the 5-year period referred to in paragraph (1).\n    (g) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the date \non which the demonstration project terminates, the Office of Personnel \nManagement shall submit to Congress a report on such project, together \nwith recommendations for any legislation that the Office considers \nappropriate.
