    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``California New River Restoration Act \nof 2016''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the New River was born out of the Colorado River's \n        occasional flows into the Salton Sink and the erosion of the \n        New River channel which formed the deep river canyon between \n        1905 and 1907;\n            (2) the New River starts in Mexicali, Mexico, flows north \n        into the United States through Calexico, passes through the \n        Imperial Valley and drains into the Salton Sea, roughly 66 \n        miles north of the international boundary, and the sub-\n        watershed covers approximately 750 square miles, with 63 \n        percent of that in Mexico and 37 percent in the United States;\n            (3) the New River has been widely recognized for its \n        significant water pollution problems, primarily because of \n        agricultural runoff, raw sewage, pesticides, and discharges of \n        wastes from domestic, agricultural, and industrial sources in \n        Mexico and the Imperial Valley;\n            (4) by the 1980s, the New River acquired the reputation of \n        being one of the most polluted rivers in the United States, \n        with many of the pollutants posing serious human health hazards \n        to local populations, particularly those in Calexico and \n        Mexicali;\n            (5) in 1992, the International Boundary Water Commission's \n        Treaty Minute No. 288 established a sanitation strategy for the \n        New River water quality problems at the international boundary \n        and divided the sanitation projects into two immediate repairs \n        projects, the Mexicali I and the Mexicali II, which totaled \n        about $50 million dollars and were funded by both countries \n        through the North American Development Bank;\n            (6) in 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency provided \n        funds to the California Regional Water Quality Control Board to \n        monitor and document the water quality at the international \n        boundary on a monthly basis;\n            (7) in the late 1990s, the United States and Mexico spent \n        $100 million (45 percent paid by Mexico and 55 percent paid by \n        the United States) to build the Las Arenitas and Zaragoza \n        Wastewater Treatment plants, and untreated New River water \n        passing through four microbial treatment cells at Las Arenitas \n        was then chlorinated and fed into a re-forestation project \n        along the desiccated Rio Hardy which stretches to the Sea of \n        Cortez;\n            (8) a 10-year effort by community groups, lawyers, \n        regulatory agencies, and politicians addressed the problem at \n        the source by federally funding a new sewage treatment plant in \n        Mexicali and developing a site plan for the river on the United \n        States side;\n            (9) in 2009, the State of California required the \n        California-Mexico Border Relations Council to create a \n        strategic plan to study, monitor, remediate, and enhance the \n        New River's water quality to protect human health and develop a \n        river parkway suitable for public use;\n            (10) flows in the New River at the International Boundary \n        with Mexico have been reduced by as much as 40 percent during \n        the last 10 years due to a number of factors which include \n        reduction of agricultural runoff and municipal wastewater \n        discharged into the New River and its tributaries in Mexico; \n        and\n            (11) the existing and ongoing voluntary conservation \n        efforts at the New River necessitate improved efficiency and \n        cost effectiveness, as well as increased private-sector \n        investments and coordination of Federal and non-Federal \n        resources, including through installation of a large trash \n        screen, a new pump station, aeration devices, a disinfection \n        facility, and managed wetlands.\n\nSEC. 3.
