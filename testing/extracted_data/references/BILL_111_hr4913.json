FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal regulators have forbidden--\n                    (A) cherry growers and food producers to cite \n                independent and respected scientific research on their \n                produce that references health benefits; and\n                    (B) a variety of dietary supplement makers to cite \n                independent scientific research on health benefits from \n                supplements from respected, peer-reviewed scientific \n                journals.\n            (2) Americans want access and have a right to access \n        legitimate scientific information about foods and dietary \n        supplements to ensure informed decisions about diet and health \n        care. While the American public is inundated daily with \n        advertisements about prescription drugs for health conditions, \n        many of which could be prevented through lifestyle changes, \n        proper nutrition, and informed use of dietary supplements, \n        Americans are denied access to the very information that \n        assists in making informed lifestyle and health care decisions.\n            (3) Providing access to scientific information promotes \n        self-responsibility, thereby empowering Americans to exercise \n        independent judgment in caring for themselves and ultimately \n        reducing health care costs and improving quality of life.\n            (4) The United States has a long commitment to the free \n        dissemination of scientific research with the exception of \n        limited extreme situations for national security. This \n        commitment goes back to the First Amendment to the Constitution \n        and has contributed vitally to the Nation's economic progress.\n\nSEC. 3. MISBRANDED FOOD AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS.\n\n    Section 403(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \nU.S.C. 343(r)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (3)--\n                    (A) by redesignating clause (D) as clause (E);\n                    (B) by inserting after clause (C) the following:\n    ``(D) Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (A)(i) and (B), a \nclaim of the type described in subparagraph (1)(B) which is not \nauthorized by the Secretary in a regulation promulgated in accordance \nwith clause (B) shall be authorized and may be made with respect to a \nfood if--\n            ``(i) the claim is based on legitimate scientific research;\n            ``(ii) the claim and the food for which the claim is made \n        are in compliance with clause (A)(ii) and are otherwise in \n        compliance with paragraph (a) and section 201(n);\n            ``(iii) the claim is stated in a manner so that the claim--\n                    ``(I) is an accurate balanced summary of such \n                research; and\n                    ``(II) enables the public to comprehend the \n                information provided in the claim and the relative \n                significance of such information in the context of a \n                total daily diet;\n            ``(iv) the claim includes a citation to such research; and\n            ``(v) the claim identifies each party that funded such \n        research.'';\n                    (C) in clause (E), as so redesignated, by striking \n                ``clause (C)'' each place it appears and inserting \n                ``clause (C) or (D)''; and\n                    (D) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(F) In this subparagraph, the term `legitimate scientific \nresearch' means scientific research, whether performed in vitro, in \nvivo, in animals, or in humans, that--\n            ``(i) is conducted in accordance with sound scientific \n        principles;\n            ``(ii) has been evaluated and accepted by a scientific or \n        medical panel; and\n            ``(iii) has been published in its entirety, or as an \n        accurate, balanced summary or scientific review including a \n        citation to the research in its entirety, in--\n                    ``(I) a peer-reviewed article or book;\n                    ``(II) a recognized textbook;\n                    ``(III) a peer-reviewed scientific publication; or\n                    ``(IV) any publication of the United States \n                Government (including ones published by or at the \n                request of a Federal department, agency, institute, \n                center, or academy).'';\n            (2) by amending subparagraph (6) to read as follows:\n    ``(6)(A) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(B), a statement for a \ndietary supplement may be made if--\n            ``(i) the statement claims a benefit related to a classical \n        nutrient deficiency condition and discloses the prevalence of \n        such condition in the United States, describes the role of a \n        nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure \n        or function in humans, characterizes the documented mechanism \n        by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such \n        structure or function, or describes general well-being from \n        consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient;\n            ``(ii) the manufacturer of the dietary supplement has \n        substantiation that such statement is truthful and not \n        misleading;\n            ``(iii) the statement contains, prominently displayed and \n        in boldface type, the following: `This statement has not been \n        evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
