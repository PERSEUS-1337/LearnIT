FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Agricultural, grassland, and forestry practices play an \n        essential role in capturing atmospheric carbon and sequestering \n        it as soil organic matter.\n            (2) Released carbon can be captured through improved \n        grassland management, tree planting, forest preservation, and \n        enhanced agronomic and irrigation practices.\n            (3) Promoting increased natural carbon sinks could have a \n        significant impact on the world's projected carbon emissions \n        from the burning of fossil fuels.\n            (4) Certain agricultural and forestry practices can reduce \n        greenhouse gases: (A) avoiding emissions by maintaining \n        existing carbon storage in trees and soils; (B) increasing \n        carbon storage by, e.g., tree planting, conversion from \n        conventional to conservation tillage practices on agricultural \n        lands;\n            (5) The large potentials exist through known cropping and \n        land management practices such as adoption of no-till, reduced \n        fallow and use of cover crops, and conservation set-asides with \n        perennial grasses and trees.\n\nSEC. 3.
