The prima facie limit shall also apply when approaching, at a distance of less than\n500\n1,320\nfeet from, or passing, school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 15 miles per hour.\n(B) A 25 miles per hour prima facie limit in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, when approaching, at a distance of 500 to\n1,000\n1,320\nfeet from, a school building or the grounds thereof, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 25 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period. The prima facie limit shall also apply when approaching, at a distance of 500 to\n1,000\n1,320\nfeet from, school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 25 miles per hour.\n(2) The prima facie limits established under paragraph (1) apply only to highways that meet all of the following conditions:\n(A) A maximum of two traffic lanes.\n(B) A maximum posted 30 miles per hour prima facie speed limit immediately prior to and after the school zone.\n(3) The prima facie limits established under paragraph (1) apply to all lanes of an affected highway, in both directions of travel.\n(4) When determining the need to lower the prima facie speed limit, the local authority shall take the provisions of Section 627 into consideration.\n(5) (A) An ordinance or resolution adopted under paragraph (1) shall not be effective until appropriate signs giving notice of the speed limit are erected upon the highway and, in the case of a state highway, until the ordinance is approved by the Department of Transportation and the appropriate signs are erected upon the highway.\n(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), school warning signs indicating a speed limit of 15 miles per hour may be placed at a distance up to\n500\n1,320\nfeet away from school grounds.\n(C) For purposes of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), school warning signs indicating a speed limit of 25 miles per hour may be placed at any distance between 500 and\n1,000\n1,320\nfeet away from the school grounds.\n(D) A local authority shall reimburse the Department of Transportation for all costs incurred by the department under this subdivision.\n(E) Notwithstanding the maximum distance established in this section, a local authority may, upon the basis of an engineering and travel survey documenting school attendance boundaries or travel patterns to and from a school, or both, extend the maximum distance up to one mile to establish a prima facie speed limit and school warnings signs, as defined in this section, to a distance or specific locations, or both, consistent with the findings of the travel survey.\nSEC. 2.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
