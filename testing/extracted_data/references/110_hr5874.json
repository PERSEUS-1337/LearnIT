FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Multiple sclerosis (referred to in this section as \n        ``MS'') is a progressive, disabling disease that affects the \n        brain and the spinal cord causing loss of myelin, damage to \n        axons, and cerebral atrophy.\n            (2) MS is a prime-of-life disease with an average age of \n        onset at 30 to 35 years of age.\n            (3) The causes of MS are not well understood.\n            (4) There is no known cure for MS.\n            (5) There are several drugs currently approved by the Food \n        and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, which have \n        shown modest success in reducing relapses, slowing progression \n        of disability, and limiting the accumulation of brain lesions.\n            (6) More than 10,000 individuals in the United States are \n        diagnosed with MS annually, and it is thought that more than \n        400,000 individuals in the United States have MS.\n            (7) Studies have found relationships between MS and \n        environmental and genetic factors, but those relationships are \n        not well understood.\n            (8) Several small and uncoordinated MS registries and \n        databases exist in the United States and throughout the world.\n            (9) A single national system to collect and store \n        information on the incidence and prevalence of MS in the United \n        States does not exist.\n            (10) The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \n        has established a series of small pilot studies, beginning in \n        fiscal year 2006, to evaluate the feasibility of various \n        methodologies that might be used to create a MS surveillance \n        system at the national level.\n            (11) The establishment of a national surveillance system \n        will help--\n                    (A) to identify the incidence and prevalence of MS \n                in the United States;\n                    (B) to collect data important to the study of MS;\n                    (C) to produce epidemiologically sound data that \n                can be used to compare with MS cluster information, \n                data sets of the Department of Veterans Affairs data \n                sets, and other information;\n                    (D) to promote a better understanding of MS;\n                    (E) to better understand public and private \n                resource impact;\n                    (F) to collect information that is important for \n                research into genetic and environmental risk factors \n                for MS;\n                    (G) to enhance biomedical and clinical research by \n                providing a basis for population comparisons; and\n                    (H) to enhance efforts to find treatments and a \n                cure for MS.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399R.
