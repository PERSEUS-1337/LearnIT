Applicable laws and other requirements.\nSec. 5. Availability of funds for the self-determination process.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On November 30, 1992, President George H.W. Bush issued \n        a Memorandum to Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies \n        recognizing that ``As long as Puerto Rico is a territory . . . \n        the will of its people regarding their political status should \n        be ascertained periodically by means of a general right of \n        referendum . . .''.\n            (2) Consistent with this policy, on December 23, 2000, \n        President William J. Clinton issued Executive Order 13183, \n        establishing the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status \n        for purposes that included identifying the options for the \n        territory's future political status ``. . . that are not \n        incompatible with the Constitution and basic laws and policies \n        of the United States . . .'', as well as the process for \n        realizing such options.\n            (3) President George W. Bush adopted Executive Order 13183 \n        and, on December 3, 2003, amended it to require that the \n        President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status issue a report \n        ``. . . no less frequently than once every 2 years, on progress \n        made in the determination of Puerto Rico's ultimate status.''.\n            (4) On December 22, 2005, the Task Force appointed by \n        President George W. Bush issued a report recommending that:\n                    (A) The Congress provide within a year for a \n                federally sanctioned plebiscite in which the people of \n                Puerto Rico would be asked to vote on whether they wish \n                to remain a United States territory or pursue a \n                constitutionally viable path toward a permanent \n                nonterritorial status.\n                    (B) If the people of Puerto Rico elect to pursue a \n                permanent nonterritorial status, Congress should \n                provide for a subsequent plebiscite allowing the people \n                of Puerto Rico to choose between one of the two \n                permanent nonterritorial status options. Once a \n                majority of the people has selected one of the two \n                options, Congress is encouraged to begin a process of \n                transition toward that option.\n                    (C) If the people of Puerto Rico elect to remain as \n                a United States territory, further plebiscites should \n                occur periodically, as long as a territorial status \n                continues, to keep Congress informed of the people's \n                wishes.\n\nSEC. 3.
