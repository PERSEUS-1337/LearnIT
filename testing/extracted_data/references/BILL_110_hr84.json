ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDING GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Energy Efficient Building Pilot Grant Program.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy (in this Act \n        referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a pilot \n        program to award grants to businesses and organizations for new \n        construction of energy efficient buildings, or major \n        renovations of buildings that will result in energy efficient \n        buildings, to demonstrate innovative energy efficiency \n        technologies, especially those sponsored by the Department of \n        Energy.\n            (2) Awards.--The Secretary shall award grants under this \n        subsection competitively to those applicants whose proposals--\n                    (A) best demonstrate--\n                            (i) likelihood to meet or exceed the \n                        standards referred to in subsection (b)(2);\n                            (ii) likelihood to maximize cost-effective \n                        energy efficiency opportunities; and\n                            (iii) advanced energy efficiency \n                        technologies; and\n                    (B) maximize the leverage of private investment for \n                costs related to increasing the energy efficiency of \n                the building.\n            (3) Consideration.--The Secretary shall give due \n        consideration to proposals for buildings that are likely to \n        serve low and moderate income populations.\n            (4) Amount of grants.--Grants under this subsection shall \n        be for up to 50 percent of design and energy modeling costs, \n        not to exceed $50,000 per building. No single grantee may be \n        eligible for more than 3 grants per year under this program.\n            (5) Grant payments.--\n                    (A) Initial payment.--The Secretary shall pay 50 \n                percent of the total amount of the grant to grant \n                recipients upon selection.\n                    (B) Remainder of payment.--The Secretary shall pay \n                the remaining 50 percent of the grant only after \n                independent certification, by a professional engineer \n                or other qualified professional, that operational \n                buildings are energy efficient buildings as defined in \n                subsection (b).\n                    (C) Failure to comply.--The Secretary shall not \n                provide the remainder of the payment unless the \n                building is certified within 6 months after operation \n                of the completed building to meet the requirements \n                described in subparagraph (B), or in the case of major \n                renovations the building is certified within 6 months \n                of the completion of the renovations.\n            (6) Report to congress.--Not later than 3 years after \n        awarding the first grant under this subsection, the Secretary \n        shall transmit to Congress a report containing--\n                    (A) the total number and dollar amount of grants \n                awarded under this subsection; and\n                    (B) an estimate of aggregate cost and energy \n                savings enabled by the pilot program under this \n                subsection.\n            (7) Administrative expenses.--Administrative expenses for \n        the program under this subsection shall not exceed 10 percent \n        of appropriated funds.\n    (b) Definition of Energy Efficient Building.--For purposes of this \nsection the term ``energy efficient building'' means a building that--\n            (1) achieves a reduction in energy consumption of--\n                    (A) at least 30 percent for new construction, \n                compared to the energy standards set by the 2004 \n                International Energy Conservation Code (in the case of \n                residential buildings) or ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004; or\n                    (B) at least 20 percent for major renovations, \n                compared to energy consumption before renovations are \n                begun;\n            (2) is constructed or renovated in accordance with the most \n        current, appropriate, and applicable voluntary consensus \n        standards, as determined by the Secretary, such as those listed \n        in the assessment under section 914(b), or revised or developed \n        under section 914(c), of the Energy Policy Act of 2005; and\n            (3) after construction or renovation--\n                    (A) uses heating, ventilating, and air conditioning \n                systems that perform at no less than Energy Star \n                standards; or\n                    (B) if Energy Star standards are not applicable, \n                uses Federal Energy Management Program recommended \n                heating, ventilating, and air conditioning products.\n    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary for carrying out this section $10,000,000 \nfor each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2012."
