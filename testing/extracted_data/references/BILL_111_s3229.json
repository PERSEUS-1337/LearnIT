FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 51 percent of the world's population \n        lives in cities of various sizes and produce the majority of \n        the world's economic output.\n            (2) It is estimated that by 2030--\n                    (A) almost 4,000,000,000 people will live in cities \n                in the developing world;\n                    (B) urban populations in Africa and Asia will \n                double; and\n                    (C) the number of people living in slums will \n                double.\n            (3) Of the approximately 1,000,000,000 people worldwide who \n        live in slums, more than 50 percent are younger than 25 years \n        of age.\n            (4) In most countries, the largest urban areas account for \n        significant shares of gross domestic product and, due to the \n        economic advantages of large integrated markets for skills, \n        inputs and outputs are often drivers of national economic \n        growth.\n            (5) More than 1,100,000,000 people lack adequate access to \n        safe water and nearly 2,500,000,000 lack access to sanitation \n        services. These problems may become more severe with rapid \n        urbanization.\n            (6) The costs of diseases and productivity losses linked to \n        water and sanitation amount to--\n                    (A) 2 percent of gross domestic product in less \n                developed countries; and\n                    (B) up to 5 percent of gross domestic product in \n                sub-Saharan Africa.\n            (7) Insecure lease and real property ownership tenure often \n        subject slum dwellers to arbitrary, often supra-market rents, \n        forced evictions, threats, and harassment, particularly \n        affecting women who are often heads of households.\n            (8) Insecurity of tenure--\n                    (A) severely inhibits economic development by \n                undermining investment incentives and constraining the \n                growth of credit markets;\n                    (B) imperils the ability of families to achieve \n                sustainable livelihoods and assured access to shelter; \n                and\n                    (C) often contributes to conflict over property \n                rights.\n            (9) Although women constitute 66 percent of the world's \n        work force, they own less than 15 percent of the world's \n        private property. This disparity is particularly damaging in \n        cities and towns in which women are disproportionately affected \n        by forced evictions and insecure tenure as a result of \n        discrimination, gender-biased laws, and customs that--\n                    (A) define women as legal minors or otherwise \n                prevent women from acquiring and securing property, \n                housing leases, or ownership rights; and\n                    (B) increase the vulnerability of women to poverty, \n                violence, and sexual abuse.\n            (10) Cities can play an important role in economic growth \n        only if--\n                    (A) there is appropriate infrastructure, \n                institutions, and policies; and\n                    (B) basic services are extended to everyone.\n            (11) Connective infrastructure, such as roads and \n        telecommunications--\n                    (A) plays a critical role linking cities and their \n                markets to rural production, to hinterlands, and to the \n                global economy;\n                    (B) reduces economic distances; and\n                    (C) strengthens the ability of cities to take \n                advantage of the resulting market opportunities and \n                ensures that urban and rural development policies are \n                integrated into a holistic approach that promotes \n                economic growth throughout the country.\n            (12) The 2006 National Security Strategy states, \n        ``America's national interests and moral values drive us in the \n        same direction: to assist the world's poor citizens and least \n        developed nations and help integrate them into the global \n        economy.''.\n            (13) In his October 2009 remarks for World Habitat Day, \n        President Obama stated, ``My administration is committed to . . \n        . bolstering our metropolitan areas, the cities, suburban and \n        rural areas that are the engines of our economic growth. We are \n        investing in a clean energy sector that will generate new green \n        jobs, building affordable, energy efficient homes and promoting \n        more sustainable development so that we can meet the needs of \n        the present, for securing the future for our children and \n        grandchildren . . . That is why we are committed to working \n        with the United Nations and our partners around the world to \n        help more families find a safe and secure place to live.''.\n            (14) Target 11 of Goal 7 of the Millennium Development \n        Goals states, ``By 2020, to have achieved a significant \n        improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-\n        dwellers.''.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n            (10) develop a plan for providing long-term United States \n        support for sustainable urban growth and development \n        initiatives in developing countries that--\n                    (A) includes regular coordination between United \n                States Government agencies that have relevant technical \n                expertise or policy responsibilities, as appropriate, \n                including--\n                            (i) the United States Agency for \n                        International Development;\n                            (ii) the Department of State;\n                            (iii) the Millennium Challenge Corporation;\n                            (iv) the Department of Housing and Urban \n                        Development;\n                            (v) the Department of the Treasury;
