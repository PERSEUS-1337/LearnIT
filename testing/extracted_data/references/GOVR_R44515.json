    "content": "The first section of this report provides an overview of the consideration of FY2017 legislative branch appropriations, with subsections covering each action, including the initial submission of the request on February 9, 2016; hearings held by the House and Senate Legislative Branch Subcommittees in March; the House subcommittee markup on April 20, 2016; the House full committee markup on May 17, 2016; the Senate full committee markup on May 19, 2016; House consideration of a special rule on June 8, 2016; House floor consideration on June 9 and 10, 2016; the enactment of three continuing resolutions ( P.L. 114-223 , through December 9, 2016; P.L. 114-254 , through April 28, 2017; and P.L. 115-30 , through May 5, 2017); and the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 on May 5, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ), which provides $4.440 billion for legislative branch activities. It is followed by a section on prior year actions and funding, which contains historical tables.  The report then addresses the FY2017 budget requests, requested administrative language, and selected funding issues for individual legislative branch agencies and entities.  Finally, Table 5 through Table 9 list enacted funding levels for FY2016 and FY2017, while the Appendix lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports; public law numbers; and enactment dates since FY1998. The Budget for Fiscal Year 2017 was submitted on February 9, 2016. It contains a request for $4.659 billion in new budget authority for legislative branch activities.  By law, the legislative branch request is submitted to the President and included in the budget without change.   Table 2 lists the dates of hearings of the legislative branch subcommittees in 2016. Prepared statements of witnesses were posted on the subcommittee websites. On April 20, 2016, the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Legislative Branch held a markup of the FY2017 bill. The subcommittee recommended $3.482 billion (+2.1%), not including Senate items, which are historically considered by the Senate. No amendments were offered. During the markup, the subcommittee held a lengthy discussion regarding then-draft committee report language regarding the usage of the phrase \"illegal alien\" as a Library of Congress Subject Heading (LCSH). In March 2016, the Library announced its plan to cancel this heading and replace it with two headings, \"noncitizens\" and \"unauthorized immigration.\" The decision by the Policy and Standards Division of the Library of Congress, which maintains the LCSH, followed a previous proposal considered but not adopted in 2014 and a resolution adopted by the American Library Association in January 2016. Separate legislation directing the Library of Congress to retain the headings \"Aliens\" and \"Illegal aliens,\" H.R. 4926 , also was introduced and referred to the Committee on House Administration, and no further action was taken.  On May 17, 2016, the House Appropriations Committee met to mark up the FY2017 bill reported from its legislative branch subcommittee.  A number of amendments were considered: A manager's amendment offered by subcommittee Chairman Graves was agreed to by voice vote. The amendment increased funding for the Architect of the Capitol House Historic Buildings Revitalization Trust Fund by $7.0 million, offset by reducing funding from the Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Police Buildings, Grounds, and Security account. The manager's amendment also added language to the committee report regarding the security of House garages, addressing the donation of computer equipment, and directing the Library to conduct a \"survey of ethnic collections of populations displaced as a result of World War II conflict found throughout the United States ... \" An amendment was offered by Representative Wasserman Schultz to delete the committee report language related to the LCSH. As discussed above, this language was the subject of extended debate during the subcommittee markup. The report language states that \"To the extent practicable, the Committee instructs the Library to maintain certain subject headings that reflect terminology used in title 8, United States Code.\" The amendment was not agreed to by a roll call vote of 24-25. An amendment was offered by Representative Farr to increase the funding for the Members' Representational Allowance by $8.3 million, offset by a reduction to the Architect of the Capitol's Capital Construction and Operations account, and was agreed to by voice vote. An amendment was offered by Representative Quigley to require the publication of certain Congressional Research Service products on the website of the Government Publishing Office, and was not agreed to by a roll call vote of 18-31. An amendment was offered and withdrawn by Representative Kaptur to increase the funding of the Open World Leadership Center. An amendment was offered by Representative Quigley to require the publication of a list of the titles of certain Congressional Research Service products, and was not agreed to by voice vote. An amendment was offered by Representative McCollum providing that no funding provided by the act be used to fund the Select Investigative Panel of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which was established by H.Res. 461 , and was not agreed to by a roll call vote of 20-28. The bill was reported out of committee by voice vote ( H.R. 5325 , H.Rept. 114-594 ). On May 19, 2016, the Senate Appropriations Committee met to mark up its version of the FY2017 bill. The subcommittee recommended $3.021 billion, a $23.5 million increase from the FY2016 enacted level (+0.8%). This total does not include funding for House items, which are historically considered by the House. No amendments were offered, and the bill was ordered reported by a vote of 30-0 ( S. 2955 , S.Rept. 114-258 ). The FY2017 legislative branch appropriations bill was considered in the context of statutory and procedural budget constraints. The statutory constraints are provided through the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 , as amended), which imposes separate limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending each fiscal year. Separately, the congressional budget process also provides a means of procedural budget enforcement through the adoption of a budget resolution. The budget resolution provides an overall limit on spending allocated to the House and the Senate appropriations committees (referred to as a \"302(a) allocation\"). The appropriations committees subsequently divide the 302(a) allocation among each of their 12 subcommittees, effectively establishing limits on each of the annual appropriations bills (commonly referred to as \"302(b) suballocations\"). These subcommittee levels may be revised throughout the appropriations process to reflect changing priorities and other budgetary actions. The House and the Senate did not adopt a budget resolution for FY2017. In its absence, the Senate Budget Committee chair filed budgetary levels in the Congressional Record that are enforceable in the Senate as if they had been included in a budget resolution for FY2017. Based on these levels, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported their initial 302(b) suballocations on April 18, 2016. These include $4.399 billion for the legislative branch, or 0.4% of total discretionary budget authority. In the absence of a budget resolution in the House, the House Appropriations Committee chose to adopt \"interim 302(b) suballocations\" for the appropriations bills as they were marked up in full committee. 11 The interim allocation for the legislative branch was $4.436 billion. These interim suballocations are not procedurally enforceable.  The House- and Senate-proposed suballocations for the legislative branch differ by $37.0 million. As in past years, the House Rules Committee met to consider a structured rule for consideration of the legislative branch bill.  In a June 1, 2016, \"Dear Colleague\" letter, Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions announced a deadline of 3:00 p.m. on Monday, June 6, 2016, for Members wishing to offer amendments to the legislative branch bill. A total of 41 amendments were submitted, including 14 submitted after the deadline and two that were withdrawn.  During its meeting to discuss this rule on June 8, 2016, the committee held two related roll call votes: 1. Rules Committee Record Vote No. 183; This motion would have provided appropriate waivers for an amendment to be offered by Representative Wasserman Schultz providing for the restatement of the Library of Congress's existing policy regarding certain Subject Headings; and an amendment to be offered by Representatives Maloney (NY), Peters (CA), and Hanna (NY), prohibiting funds from being used to contravene the President's executive order pertaining to equal employment in federal government contracting. The motion was defeated 2-8. 2. Rules Committee Record Vote No. 184; The motion to report the rule was adopted 9-2. The committee reported a rule, H.Res. 771 , which made in order 13 amendments. It was agreed to in the House on June 9 (237\u2013182, Roll no. 286). During consideration of H.R. 5325 , which began on June 9, 2016, and continued the next day, 10 amendments were offered. Six were agreed to (all voice votes), and four were not (all recorded votes).  Three of the adopted amendments expand current restrictions on the delivery of certain printed documents to include additional publications. The current restrictions were added and continued in previous legislative branch appropriations bills, including the FY2017 House-reported bill. The amendments considered include 1. H.Amdt. 1164 , to reprogram funds to create an Office of Good Jobs for the House of Representatives within the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, which failed by recorded vote (157-241, Roll no. 289); 2. H.Amdt. 1165 , to require the Architect of the Capitol to conduct a feasibility study regarding the installation and operation of Capital Bikeshare stations on Capitol Grounds, which was agreed to by voice vote; 3. H.Amdt. 1166 , to transfer $500,000 from the Architect of the Capitol's Capital Construction and Operations account to the Architect of the Capitol's Capitol Building and House Office Buildings accounts, appropriating $250,000 to each, to bring the Capitol and the House office buildings into compliance with General Services Administration requirements for federal buildings regarding lactation stations for breastfeeding mothers, which was agreed to by voice vote; 4. H.Amdt. 1167 , to provide for a 1% across-the-board reduction in the bill's spending levels, with exceptions for the Capitol Police, the Architect of the Capitol's Capitol Police Buildings, Grounds and Security account, and the House Sergeant at Arms account, which failed by recorded vote (165-237, Roll no. 290); 5. H.Amdt. 1168 , to prohibit the use of funds for delivering printed copies of the United States House of Representatives Telephone Directory to the office of any Member of the House of Representatives, which was agreed to by voice vote; 6. H.Amdt. 1169 , to prohibit the use of funds for delivering printed copies of the Budget of the United States Government ; Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government ; or the Appendix, Budget of the United States Government , to the office of any Member of the House of Representatives, which was agreed to by voice vote; 7. H.Amdt. 1170 , to expand the list of parties with whom the federal government is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on the part of the contractors, which was agreed to by voice vote; 8. H.Amdt. 1171 , to appropriate $2.5 million to reinstitute the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), offset from funds from the Architect of the Capitol's Capital Construction and Operations Account, which failed by recorded vote (179-223, Roll no. 291); 9. H.Amdt. 1172 , to prohibit the use of funds for delivering a printed copy of the Federal Register to a Member of the House of Representatives, which was agreed to by voice vote; and 10. H.Amdt. 1173 , to reduce the Office of Congressional Ethics budget to the FY2016 levels ($1.467 million in FY2016, compared to $1.658 million in the House-reported bill, a difference of $191,000) and transfer remaining funds to the deficit reduction account, which failed by recorded vote (137-270, Roll no. 292); A motion to recommit with instructions failed by recorded vote (170-237, Roll no. 293). H.R. 5325 , as amended, was agreed to on June 10, with a vote of 233-175 (Roll no. 294). As stated above, a separate legislative branch appropriations bill was not enacted prior to the start of FY2017 on October 1, 2016.  Funding for legislative branch activities was initially provided through three CRs:  P.L. 114-223 , through December 9, 2016; P.L. 114-254 , through April 28, 2017; and P.L. 115-30 , through May 5, 2017.  The CRs included a few provisions related to the legislative branch, although they did not alter funding levels. These CR provisions  continued the pay freeze for Members of Congress for one additional year; provided for the transfer of the O'Neill Building (located on 2 nd Street, SW, between C and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC, and previously known as Federal Office Building 8) to the House of Representatives; clarified that funding during the 115 th Congress for the Office of the Assistant Minority Leader of the Senate shall be available from funds otherwise available for the Office of the Secretary of the Conference of the Minority; continued the Senate National Security Working Group for the 115 th Congress; and provided for a gratuity payment to the widow of a deceased Member of the House. P.L. 115-31 was enacted on May 5, 2017, and provides $4.440 billion for legislative branch activities (Division I). This funding represents a $77.0 million increase (+1.7%) from the FY2016 enacted level.  The percentage of total discretionary budget authority provided to the legislative branch has remained relatively stable at approximately 0.4% since at least FY1976. The highest maximum level, 0.48%, was in FY1995, and the minimum, 0.31%, was in FY2009.  FY2016 funding was provided in Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), which was enacted on December 18, 2015. The $4.363 billion provided by the act represents an increase of 1.5% from the FY2015 level and is $165.7 million (-3.7%) less than the request.  FY2015 funding was provided in Division H of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ), which was enacted on December 16, 2014. The $4.300 billion provided by the act represented an increase of $41.7 million (1.0%) from FY2014 and was $164.9 million (-3.7%) less than the request.  Neither a legislative branch appropriations bill, nor a continuing appropriations resolution (CR), containing FY2014 funding was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. A funding gap, which resulted in a partial government shutdown, ensued for 16 days. The funding gap was terminated by the enactment of a CR ( P.L. 113-46 ) on October 17, 2013. The CR provided funding through January 15, 2014. Following enactment of a temporary continuing resolution on January 15, 2014 ( P.L. 113-73 ), a consolidated appropriations bill was enacted on January 17 ( P.L. 113-76 ), providing $4.259 billion for the legislative branch for FY2014. FY2013 funding of approximately $4.061 billion was provided by P.L. 113-6 , which was signed into law on March 26, 2013. The act funded legislative branch accounts at the FY2012 enacted level, with some exceptions (also known as \"anomalies\"), and not including across-the-board rescissions required by Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 . Section 3004 was intended to eliminate any amount by which the new budget authority provided in the act exceeded the FY2013 discretionary spending limits in Section 251(c)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent to the enactment of P.L. 113-6 , OMB calculated that additional rescissions of 0.032% of security budget authority and 0.2% of nonsecurity budget authority would be required. The act did not alter the sequestration reductions implemented on March 1, which reduced most legislative branch accounts by 5.0%. The accompanying OMB report indicated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled in each account containing nonexempt funds.  Division G of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ) provided $4.307 billion for the legislative branch. This level was $236.9 million (-5.2%) below the FY2011 enacted level. P.L. 112-10 provided $4.543 billion for legislative branch operations in FY2011. This level represented a $125.1 million decrease from the $4.668 billion provided in the FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-68 ) and the FY2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-212 ). The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $4.402 billion. In FY2009, an additional $25.0 million was provided for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. P.L. 111-32 , the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, also contained funding for a new Capitol Police radio system ($71.6 million) and additional funding for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) ($2.0 million).  As seen in Table 3 , the FY2016 legislative branch budget in constant dollars remained below the FY2004 level. Figure 1 shows the same information graphically, while also demonstrating the division of budget authority across the legislative branch in FY2016. The FY2017 level (not included in the table and figure) of $4.440 billion remains nearly 5% below the FY2010 level (not adjusted for inflation), which was the peak of legislative branch funding.  Figure 2 shows the timing of legislative branch appropriations actions, including the issuance of House and Senate reports, bill passage, and enactment, from FY1996 through FY2016. It shows that fiscal year funding for the legislative branch has been determined on or before October 1 five times during this period (FY1997, FY2000, FY2004, FY2006, and FY2010), with another two bills enacted during the first month of the fiscal year (FY1998 and FY1999), two in November (FY1996 and FY2002), six in December (FY2001, FY2005, FY2008, FY2012, FY2015, and FY2016), and six in the next calendar year (FY2003, FY2007, FY2009, FY2011, FY2013, and FY2014). FY2017 (not shown in the figure) represented the seventh time that funding was enacted in the next calendar year, and at May 5, the latest date of enactment during this period.  The following sections discuss the various legislative branch accounts.  During consideration of the legislative branch bills, the House and Senate conform to a \"longstanding practice under which each body of Congress determines its own housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without intervention.\" The Senate requested $935.5 million for FY2017, a 7.5% increase over the $870.2 million provided in FY2016. The bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee ( S. 2955 ) recommended, and the FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides, $871.2 million, an increase of $1.0 million (+0.1%).  Additional information on the Senate account is presented in Table 6 . Appropriations for Senate committees are contained in two accounts. The inquiries and investigations account contains funds for all Senate committees except Appropriations. The Senate-reported bill recommended, and the FY2017 act provides, $133.3 million, the same as provided in FY2015 and FY2016. The Senate had requested $135.8 million, a 1.9% increase. The Committee on Appropriations account contains funds for the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate-reported bill recommended, and the FY2017 act provides, $15.1 million, equivalent to the FY2017 request and the FY2015 and FY2016 enacted level.  The Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account (SOPOEA) provides each Senator with funds to administer an office. It consists of an administrative and clerical assistance allowance, a legislative assistance allowance, and an official office expense allowance. The funds may be used for any category of expenses, subject to limitations on official mail.  The Senate-reported FY2017 bill recommended, and the FY2017 act provides, $390.0 million. This is the same level provided in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. The Senate had requested $445.9 million for FY2017, an increase of $55.9 million (+14.3%).  The Senate-reported bill contained three administrative provisions, all of which were enacted in FY2017: 1. One provision, which was first included in FY2016, requires amounts remaining in the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account (SOPOEA) to be used for deficit reduction or to reduce the federal debt. 2. One provision provides authority to transfer funds between the Senate Commission on Art and the Architect of the Capitol. 3. One provision prohibited a pay adjustment for Members of Congress during FY2017. Members of Congress last received a pay adjustment in January 2009. Absent either a statutory prohibition for a Member pay adjustment or automatic limitations related to the General Schedule (GS), Members of Congress are scheduled to receive a maximum pay increase of 1.6%, or $2,800, in January 2017. Member salaries are funded in a permanent appropriations account, and the legislative branch bill does not contain language funding or increasing Member pay. A provision prohibiting the automatic Member pay adjustments could be included in any bill, and this prohibition was included in P.L. 114-254 (the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which was enacted on December 10, 2016).  The House requested $1.187 billion for FY2017, a 0.5% increase from the FY2016 enacted level of $1.181 billion. The House Appropriations Committee Legislative Branch Subcommittee recommended a continuation of the FY2016 level. An amendment agreed to during the full committee markup increased this level by $8.3 million, offset by a reduction to the Architect of the Capitol's account, to a total of $1.189 billion (an increase of $8.3 million, or 0.7%, from the FY2016 enacted level) in the bill reported by the House Appropriations Committee (hereinafter House-reported bill). This level was continued in the House-passed bill and in the FY2017 act.  Additional information on headings in the House of Representatives account is presented in Table 7 . Funding for House committees is contained in the appropriation heading \"committee employees,\" which comprises two subheadings. The first subheading contains funds for personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of House committees, except the Appropriations Committee, as authorized by the House in a committee expense resolution. The House Appropriations Committee recommended, and the House-passed bill and the FY2017 act contained, $127.1 million. This level represented an increase of $3.2 million (+2.5%) from the $123.9 million provided in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016.  The second subheading contained funds for the personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of the Committee on Appropriations. The House-passed bill and the FY2017 act contained $23.3 million, the same level provided in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. The Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) is available to support Members in their official and representational duties.  The House Appropriations Committee Legislative Branch Subcommittee recommended $554.3 million, the same level provided in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. An amendment offered and agreed to at the full committee markup increased this level to $562.6 million (+1.5%). This level was contained in the House-passed bill and the FY2017 act. The House requested the continuation of administrative provisions from prior years related to 1. unexpended balances from the MRA; 2. limiting amounts available from the MRA for leased vehicles; and 3. limiting or prohibiting the delivery of copies of bills and resolutions, the Congressional Record , the U.S. Code , the Statement of Disbursements , the Daily Calendar , and the Congressional Pictorial Directory .  The bill, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee, also contained a provision which would have authorized members of the Capitol Police to travel outside of the United States with Members of the House leadership on official business on a reimbursable basis. Additional provisions related to the delivery of printed copies of various documents were added during consideration of the House bill on the floor ( H.Amdt. 1168 , for the United States House of Representatives Telephone Directory ; H.Amdt. 1169 , for the annual budget documents; and H.Amdt. 1172 , for the Federal Register ).  These provisions, as well as a new provision relating to cybersecurity assistance for the House from other federal entities, were all included in the FY2017 act. The FY2017 bill, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee and passed by the House, also contained a provision which would have frozen Member salaries at the 2009 level. As stated above, Member salaries are funded in a permanent appropriations account, and the legislative branch bill does not contain language funding or increasing Member pay. A provision prohibiting the automatic Member pay adjustments could be included in any bill, or be introduced as a separate bill. As stated above, this prohibition was included in P.L. 114-254 , the second continuing appropriations resolution.  The U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are responsible for the security of the Capitol Complex, including, for example, the U.S. Capitol, the House and Senate office buildings, the U.S. Botanic Garden, and the Library of Congress buildings and adjacent grounds.  The USCP requested $409.6 million for FY2017, an increase of $34.6 million (+9.2%) from the $375.0 million the USCP received for FY2016.  H.R. 5325 , as reported by the House Appropriations Committee and passed by the House, would have provided $391.3 million (+4.3%).  The Senate-reported bill would have provided $387.0 million (+3.2%). The FY2017 act provides $393.3 million, an increase of $18.3 million (+4.9%). Additional information on the USCP is presented in Table 8 . Appropriations for the police are contained in two accounts\u2014a salaries account and a general expenses account. The salaries account contains funds for the salaries of employees; overtime pay; hazardous duty pay differential; and government contributions for employee health, retirement, Social Security, professional liability insurance, and other benefit programs. The general expenses account contains funds for expenses of vehicles; communications equipment; security equipment and its installation; dignitary protection; intelligence analysis; hazardous material response; uniforms; weapons; training programs; medical, forensic, and communications services; travel; relocation of instructors for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; and other administrative and technical support, among other expenses.  Salaries\u2014the Capitol Police requested $333.1 million for salaries, an increase of $24.1 million (+7.8%) from the $309.0 million provided in FY2016. The House-passed bill would have provided $325.3 million (+5.3%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $320.0 million (+3.6%). The FY2017 act provides $325.3 million (+5.3%). General Expenses\u2014the Capitol Police requested $76.5 million for general expenses, an increase of $10.5 million (+15.8%) from the $66.0 million provided in FY2016. The House-passed bill would have continued the FY2016 level. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $67.0 million (+1.5%). The FY2017 act provides $68.0 million (+3.0%). Another appropriation relating to the Capitol Police appears within the Architect of the Capitol account for Capitol Police buildings and grounds. USCP requested $37.5 million, an increase of $12.1 million (+47.5%) from the $25.4 million provided in FY2016.  The House Appropriations Committee Legislative Branch Subcommittee recommended $33.7 million (+32.5%). An amendment agreed to at the full committee markup decreased this level by $7.0 million and increased the House Historic Buildings Revitalization Trust Fund by the same amount. The House-passed bill would have provided $26.7 million (+5.0%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $29.6 million (+16.6%). The FY2017 act provides $20.0 million (-21.2%). The Capitol Police requested one administrative provision, which would have expanded authority to dispose of and receive surplus or obsolete property. The House- and Senate-reported versions of this bill, as well as the FY2017 act, all included this provision.  The Office of Compliance is an independent and nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch. It was established to administer and enforce the Congressional Accountability Act, which was enacted in 1995. The act applies various employment and workplace safety laws to Congress and certain legislative branch entities. The Office of Compliance requested $4.3 million for FY2017, an increase of $356,000 (+9.0%). The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill, as well as the FY2017 act, all contain $3.96 million, a continuation of the FY2015 and FY2016 level. CBO is a nonpartisan congressional agency created to provide objective economic and budgetary analysis to Congress. CBO cost estimates are required for any measure reported by a regular or conference committee that may vary revenues or expenditures. CBO requested $47.6 million, an increase of $1.1 million (+2.4%), from the $46.5 million provided in FY2016. The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill, as well as the FY2017 act, all continue the FY2016 level. CBO requested two administrative provisions: 1. One provision would have made FY2017 funds available for the compensation of employees in specialty occupations with nonimmigrant visas. Similar authority has been requested, but not provided, since FY2012. The provision was not included in the House-passed or Senate-reported bill or the FY2017 act. 2. One provision would have authorized the Director of CBO to establish senior positions. The House-passed bill included this provision, while the Senate-reported bill did not. It was included in the FY2017 act. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the U.S. Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol and its grounds, House and Senate office buildings, Library of Congress buildings and grounds, Capitol Power Plant, Botanic Garden, Capitol Visitor Center, and Capitol Police buildings and grounds. The Architect is responsible for the Supreme Court buildings and grounds, but appropriations for their expenses are not contained in the legislative branch appropriations bill. Operations of the Architect are funded in the following 10 accounts: capital construction and operations, Capitol building, Capitol grounds, Senate office buildings, House office buildings, Capitol Power Plant, Library buildings and grounds, Capitol Police buildings and grounds, Capitol Visitor Center, and Botanic Garden.  The Architect requested $694.3 million for FY2017, an increase of $81.4 million (+13.3%) from the FY2016 level of $612.9 million.  The House Appropriations Committee Legislative Branch Subcommittee recommended $560.1 million, not including funding for the Senate office buildings. An amendment adopted at the full committee markup decreased this amount by $8.3 million. Another amendment adopted at the full committee markup increased funding for the House Historic Buildings Revitalization Trust Fund by $7.0 million, offset by funding from the Capitol Police Buildings, Grounds, and Security account. During consideration of H.R. 5325 in the House, two amendments affecting AOC were agreed to by voice vote, although they did not alter its overall funding level. One amendment ( H.Amdt. 1166 ) transferred $500,000 from the AOC's Capital Construction and Operations account to the AOC's Capitol Building and House Office Buildings accounts, providing $250,000 to each to bring the Capitol and House office buildings into compliance with General Services Administration requirements for federal buildings regarding lactation stations for breastfeeding mothers.  Another amendment provided that funding in the Capital Construction and Operations account be used to conduct a feasibility study regarding the installation and operation of Capital Bikeshare stations on Capitol Grounds ( H.Amdt. 1165 ). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $419.6 million, not including funding for the House office buildings, a decrease of $8.7 million (-2.0%) from the FY2016 enacted level. The FY2017 act provides $617.9 million (+0.8%). Additional funding information on the individual AOC accounts is presented in Table 9 . The AOC also requested a number of administrative provisions: 1. a provision prohibiting the use of funds for bonuses for contractors behind schedule or over budget, first included in FY2015; 2. a provision prohibiting scrims containing photographs of building facades during restoration or construction projects performed by the Architect of the Capitol, first included in FY2015; 3. a new provision establishing a working capital fund; 4. a new provision providing authority for a House office building shuttle; and 5. a new provision allowing the use of expired funds for unemployment compensation payments.  The House Appropriations Committee included these provisions, with the exception of that relating to the shuttle. It also included a new provision establishing a flag office revolving fund. The Senate Appropriations Committee included provisions related to contractors, scrims, and unemployment compensation payments. It also included a new provision establishing a flag office revolving fund and a new provision directing the AOC to \"establish, document, and follow policies and procedures for suspension and debarment of firms or individuals the Architect has determined should be excluded from future contracts.\"  The provisions related to bonuses for contractors, scrims, flag office revolving fund, unemployment compensation payments, contracting, and the House office building shuttle were included in the FY2017 act. The Library of Congress serves simultaneously as Congress's parliamentary library and the de facto national library of the United States. Its broader services to the nation include the acquisition, maintenance, and preservation of a collection of more than 160.7 million analog items; service to the general public and scholarly and library communities; administration of U.S. copyright laws by its Copyright Office; and administration of a national program to provide reading material to the blind and physically handicapped. Its direct services to Congress include the provision of legal research and law-related services by the Law Library of Congress, and a broad range of activities by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), including in-depth and nonpartisan public policy research, analysis, and legislative assistance for Members and committees and their staff; congressional staff training; information and statistics retrieval; and continuing legal education for Members of both chambers and congressional staff. The Library requested $667.2 million for FY2017, an increase of $67.3 million (+11.2%) from the $599.9 million provided in FY2016. These figures do not include additional authority to spend receipts.  The House-passed bill would have provided $628.9 million, an increase of $29.0 million (+4.8%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $608.9 million, an increase of nearly $9.0 million (+1.5%). The FY2017 act provides $631.96 million, an increase of $32.0 million (+5.3%). The FY2017 budget contains the following headings: Salaries and expenses\u2014The Library requested $472.9 million, an increase of $53.3 million (+12.7%) from the $419.6 million provided for FY2016. The House-passed bill would have provided $443.6 million (5.7%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $428.6 million (+2.1%). The FY2017 act provides $450.7 million (+7.4%).These figures do not include $6.35 million in authority to spend receipts. Copyright Office\u2014The Library requested $28.3 million, an increase of $5.2 million (+22.7%) from the $23.1 million provided for FY2016. The House-passed bill would have provided $27.1 million (+17.3%). The Senate-reported bill recommended, and the FY2017 provides, $23.1 million. These levels do not include authority to spend receipts ($35.8 million in FY2016; $45.7 million in the request; $41.7 million in the House-reported bill; $45.7 million in the Senate-reported bill; $45.7 million in the FY2017 act). Total budget authority including the authority to spend receipts, is $68.8 million ($9.95 million, or 16.9%, above the FY2016 enacted level). Congressional Research Service\u2014The Library requested $114.4 million for FY2017, an increase of $7.5 million (+7.0%) from the FY2016 level of $106.9 million. The House-passed bill would have provided $107.9 million (+0.9%). The Senate-reported bill would have continued the FY2016 level. The FY2017 act provides $107.9 million (+0.9%). Books for the Blind and Physically Handicapped\u2014The Library requested $51.6 million, a $1.3 million (+2.7) increase from the $50.2 million provided for FY2016. The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill, as well as the FY2017 act, all continue the FY2016 level. The Architect's budget also contains funds for the Library buildings and grounds. For FY2017, $65.95 million was requested, an increase of $25.3 million (+62.1%) from the $40.7 million provided for FY2016. The House-passed bill would have provided $47.1 million (+15.7%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $42.2 million (+3.7%). The FY2017 act provides $47.1 million (+15.7%). The Library requested authority to obligate funds for reimbursable and revolving fund activities ($188.2 million in FY2016). The House Appropriations Committee included this provision, as well as (1) a provision establishing the Library of Congress National Collection Stewardship Fund; (2) a provision extending film preservation programs; and (3) a provision extending sound recording preservation programs. Separate legislation ( H.R. 4092 , H.R. 5227 , and S. 2893 ) was also introduced addressing these funds and programs. S. 2893 , which reauthorized sound recording and film preservation programs, was enacted on July 29, 2016 ( P.L. 114-217 ). The Senate Appropriations Committee included the reimbursable and revolving fund activities provision. The reimbursable and revolving fund activities provision and the Library of Congress National Collection Stewardship Fund provision were both included in the FY2017 act. The FY2017 act provides $117.1 million, the same level as provided in FY2016 and contained in GPO's budget request and the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill. GPO's budget authority is contained in three accounts.  1. Congressional publishing\u2014 The FY2017 act provides $79.7 million. This level has remained unchanged since FY2014. 2. Public Information Programs of the Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses)\u2014 The FY2017 act provides $29.5 million, $1.0 million (-3.3%) less than the FY2016 enacted level. This is the same level contained in GPO's budget request and the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill. 3. Government Publishing Office Business Operations Revolving Fund\u2014the revolving fund supports the operation and maintenance of the Government Publishing Office. The FY2017 act provides $7.8 million, an increase of $1.0 million (+14.6%) from the FY2016 enacted level. This is the same level contained in GPO's budget request and the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill. GAO responds to requests for studies of federal government programs and expenditures. GAO may also initiate its own work.  The FY2017 act provides $544.5 million, an increase of $13.5 million (+2.5%).  GAO had requested $567.8 million, an increase of $36.8 million (+6.9%) from the $531.0 million provided for FY2016. The House-passed bill would have provided $533.1 million (+0.4%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $542.4 million (+2.1%).  These levels do not include offsetting collections ($25.5 million in FY2016; $23.4 million in FY2017). The Open World Leadership Center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries by inviting their leaders to observe democracy and free enterprise in the United States. The first program was authorized by Congress in 1999 to support the relationship between Russia and the United States. The program encouraged young federal and local Russian leaders to visit the United States and observe its government and society. Established at the Library of Congress as the Center for Russian Leadership Development in 2000, the center was renamed the Open World Leadership Center in 2003, when the program was expanded to include specified additional countries. In 2004, Congress further extended the program's eligibility to other countries designated by the center's board of trustees, subject to congressional consideration. The center is housed in the Library and receives services from the Library through an interagency agreement. Open World requested $5.8 million for FY2017, an increase of $200,000 (+3.6%) from the FY2016 enacted level.  The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.0 million (-82.1%) for expenses associated with shutting down the program. During full committee consideration, an amendment was offered and withdrawn to increase funding for this program. The committee report stated, For many years the Committee has had concern with the placement of the Open World Leadership Center (OWLC) in the Legislative Branch with it mirroring numerous similar or nearly identical programs administered by other Federal agencies. In this fiscal environment where our national debt exceeds $19 trillion, it is important to eliminate duplicative programs. The Committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the OWLC. The Committee directs the Director to retain any necessary prior year funds in the Trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill to be utilized for the orderly shutdown. The Director is further directed that the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2017 appropriation bill. The Senate-reported bill would have continued funding at the FY2016 level, and this level was continued in the FY2017 act. Additionally, a budget amendment submitted by Open World on April 5, 2016, would have added \"language inadvertently omitted\" in the budget request, which would \"add senior immediately before 'officials'.\" Neither the FY2017 act, nor the House-passed and Senate-reported bills, included this change.  The location and future of Open World, attempts to assess its effectiveness, and its inclusion in the legislative branch budget, have been discussed at appropriations hearings and in report language for more than a decade. The funding level for Open World has also varied greatly during this period, although it has decreased each year since FY2009. For FY2016, the House subcommittee mark proposed $1.0 million for an orderly shutdown of Open World. Language in the full committee print, released prior to the markup of the FY2016 bill, stated,  The Committee believes given our current fiscal environment, and in light of both the lack of quantifiable results from the Open World Leadership Center and its duplication of programs more appropriately offered by the State Department, the program has long outlived its short-term intent. The Committee has provided an allocation to be used for the orderly shutdown during fiscal year 2016 of the Open World Leadership Center. An amendment offered by Representative Fortenberry at the FY2016 full committee markup proposed to add $4.7 million for Open World, offset from funding for the \"Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Power Plant\" budget. The operations of Open World, including assessments of its impact, were discussed prior to the adoption (by voice vote) of the amendment. An amendment made in order by the House Rules Committee proposed the elimination of the $5.7 million included in the House-reported bill for Open World and would have applied the savings to the spending reduction account. The amendment, H.Amdt. 239 , was agreed to (224-199). Open World was also the subject of two amendments proposed but not made in order by the House Rules Committee: (1) one amendment submitted would have redirected the $4.7 million added to Open World during the full committee markup back to the \"Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Power Plant\"; and (2) one amendment would have redirected $2.5 million from Open World to reinstitute the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). The Senate-reported FY2016 bill would have provided $5.7 million, equivalent to the FY2015 level, and the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $5.6 million. For FY2015, the House committee recommended $3.4 million, while the Senate committee recommended $5.7 million. Both reports discussed the conflict in Ukraine and Open World's activities in the region. The FY2015 act provided $5.7 million.  For FY2014, the House subcommittee mark would have provided $1.0 million. An amendment to restore funding for Open World to the FY2013 post-sequester level was debated and withdrawn during the full committee markup. The House committee report stated, For many years the Committee has had concern with the placement of the Open World Leadership Center (OWLC) in the Legislative Branch. The Committee understands the program has some strong champions on the Committee. However, with further reductions being made to every program within the Legislative Branch, the Committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the OWLC. The Committee directs the Executive Director of the OWLC to retain any necessary prior year funds in the Trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill be utilized for the orderly shutdown. The Executive Director is further directed that the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2014 appropriation bill. The FY2014 Senate-reported bill would have provided $4.0 million, as well as a provision allowing the Librarian of Congress to transfer up to $6.0 million in nonappropriated funds to Open World. The final enacted FY2014 level was $6.0 million. The FY2013 House-reported bill would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of $9.0 million (-90.0%), from the $10.0 million provided in FY2012 and requested for FY2013. The House report stated that this funding level would \"cover the cost associated with the shutdown\" and directed that \"the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill.\" H.Amdt. 1281 , agreed to by recorded vote (204-203, Roll no. 373), eliminated this funding. At the Senate FY2013 budget request hearing on March 1, 2012, the subcommittee discussed potential options for increasing private funding, including the hire of a development professional. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $10.0 million. The FY2013 act provided $8.0 million, not including sequestration or the across-the-board rescission.  The House-passed FY2012 bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of 91.2% from FY2011. The House report stated, \"The program has some strong champions on the Committee, but with reductions being made to most every program within the Federal budget the Committee has elected to shut down the program and recommends $1,000,000 for shutdown expenses.\" The Senate-reported bill, in contrast, would have provided $10.0 million (-12.1%). The Senate report stated that \"despite the fiscal constraints of the budget this program is necessary for the promotion of democratic principles in countries with historically oppressive rule.\" The FY2012 act contained the Senate-reported level.  The FY2011 level of $11.4 million represented a decrease of $623,000 (-5.2%) from the $12.0 million provided for FY2010.  The FY2010 level represented a decrease of $1.9 million (-13.7%) from FY2009. Additionally, the FY2010 House Appropriations Committee report stated that \"the Legislative Branch Subcommittee has been clear that it expects the Open World program to become financially independent of funding in this bill as soon as possible.\" This sentiment was also expressed in the conference report, which stated,  The conferees are fully supportive of expanded efforts of the Open World Center to raise private funding and expect this effort to reduce the requirements for funding from the Legislative Branch appropriations bill in future years. The Committees look forward to a report of progress being made by the Center's fundraising program prior to hearings on its fiscal year 2011 budget request. The FY2009 level of $13.9 million was a $4.92 million increase (+54.8%) from FY2008. The location within the legislative branch was discussed during a hearing on the FY2009 budget. Ambassador John O'Keefe, the executive director of Open World, testified that the program may attract different participants if associated with the executive branch rather than the Library of Congress, which may be seen as more neutral and nonpartisan. The FY2009 explanatory statement directed the Open World Leadership Center Board of Trustees to work with the State Department and the judiciary to establish a shared funding mechanism.  The $8.98 million provided in FY2008 represented a decrease of $4.88 million (-35.2%) from the $13.86 million provided in FY2007 and FY2006. The location of Open World was also discussed during the FY2008 appropriations cycle, and language was included in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act requiring Open World to prepare a report by March 31, 2008, on \"potential options for transfer of the Open World Leadership Center to a department or agency in the executive branch, establishment of the Center as an independent agency in the executive branch, or other appropriate options.\"  In 2004, GAO issued a report on the Open World program, examining program participation, purpose, and accountability.  The center was created by Congress in 1988 to encourage public service by congressional staff through training and development programs. The FY2017 act, budget request, and the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the FY2017 bill all contained $430,000, the same level provided in the FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016 acts.  As in past years, Congress is considering a number of general provisions related to the legislative branch. Table 4 lists the provisions considered, the stage originally proposed, and final disposition.  Table 5 through Table 9 provide information on funding levels for the legislative branch overall, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Capitol Police, and the Architect of the Capitol.  The tables are followed by an Appendix , which lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports; public law numbers; and enactment dates since FY1998."
