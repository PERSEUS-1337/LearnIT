    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Aboveground Petroleum Storage Tank \nConsolidation and Regulatory Improvement Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) improvement of Federal regulation of aboveground \n        storage tanks will lead to greater prevention and containment \n        of releases from aboveground storage tanks and improvement of \n        the environment;\n            (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency has not fully implemented any of the 7 recommendations \n        made in the 1989 report of the General Accounting Office on \n        inland oil spills;\n            (3) consolidation of Federal aboveground storage tank \n        provisions will lead to simplification of the regulatory \n        program and will allow the Administrator to eliminate \n        duplication and conflicting aboveground storage tank \n        regulations; and\n            (4) in order to promote environmental protection, \n        aboveground petroleum storage tank secondary containment \n        structures should meet a minimum permeability standard.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote protection of the environment;\n            (2) to streamline the offices in the Environmental \n        Protection Agency and other departments and agencies that \n        administer laws governing aboveground storage tanks and \n        underground storage tanks;\n            (3) to consolidate the laws governing aboveground storage \n        tanks and eliminate duplicative regulations; and\n            (4) to encourage release prevention and fire protection \n        measures in the operation of aboveground storage tanks.\n\nSEC. 4.
