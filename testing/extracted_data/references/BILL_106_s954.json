FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) a number of State and local governments have commenced \n        civil actions, or are considering commencing civil actions, \n        against manufacturers, importers, and dealers of firearms based \n        on the unlawful use of the firearms by a purchaser or other \n        person;\n            (2) in at least some cases, the intent in bringing the \n        action is to subject manufacturers, importers, and dealers to \n        legal costs that are so onerous that the manufacturers, \n        importers, and dealers may not be able to defend themselves, or \n        indeed be able to remain in business;\n            (3) a majority of manufacturers, importers, and dealers of \n        firearms are small, privately owned businesses that cannot \n        afford to bear the legal costs of defending themselves in a \n        large number of judicial forums;\n            (4) compared to most manufacturers, importers, and dealers \n        of firearms, States and local governments are large and \n        relatively wealthy entities that are able to spend large \n        amounts of taxpayers' dollars on a war of attrition with small \n        businesses;\n            (5) fairness requires that--\n                    (A) a unit of government that undertakes an \n                unsuccessful ``fishing expedition'' against a firearm \n                manufacturer, importer, or dealer bear the cost of \n                defending against its frivolous and unwarranted civil \n                action; and\n                    (B) taxpayers not be required to pay millions of \n                dollars to wealthy attorneys, out of awards that are \n                intended, at least in part, to benefit the victims of \n                crime;\n            (6) the Second Amendment to the Constitution requires that \n        Congress respond to actions that are intended to, and that \n        would have the effect of, nullifying that provision of the Bill \n        of Rights;\n            (7) Congress has power under the Second Amendment and under \n        the Commerce Clause to take appropriate action to protect the \n        right of citizens to obtain and own firearms; and\n            (8) one appropriate action that Congress may take is to \n        provide protection from excessive and unwarranted legal fees.\n\nSEC. 3.
