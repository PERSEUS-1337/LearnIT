FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n        (1) telephone records can be of great use to criminals because \n    the information contained in call logs may include a wealth of \n    personal data;\n        (2) call logs may reveal the names of telephone users' doctors, \n    public and private relationships, business associates, and more;\n        (3) call logs are typically maintained for the exclusive use of \n    phone companies, their authorized agents, and authorized consumers;\n        (4) telephone records have been obtained without the knowledge \n    or consent of consumers through the use of a number of fraudulent \n    methods and devices that include--\n            (A) telephone company employees selling data to \n        unauthorized data brokers;\n            (B) ``pretexting'', whereby a data broker or other person \n        represents that they are an authorized consumer and convinces \n        an agent of the telephone company to release the data; or\n            (C) gaining unauthorized Internet access to account data by \n        improperly activating a consumer's account management features \n        on a phone company's webpage or contracting with an Internet-\n        based data broker who trafficks in such records; and\n        (5) the unauthorized disclosure of telephone records not only \n    assaults individual privacy but, in some instances, may further \n    acts of domestic violence or stalking, compromise the personal \n    safety of law enforcement officers, their families, victims of \n    crime, witnesses, or confidential informants, and undermine the \n    integrity of law enforcement investigations.\n\nSEC. 3.
