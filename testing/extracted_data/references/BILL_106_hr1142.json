FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) The Secretary of the Interior, through the United \n        States Fish and Wildlife Service, recently demanded and \n        received compensation for the loss of use of federally owned \n        property resulting from constructive use of the property for \n        other public purposes, in an amount of approximately \n        $26,000,000.\n            (2) The Secretary of Transportation has promulgated a \n        regulation allowing for compensation of Federal agencies for \n        the lost use of agency property for public purposes, through a \n        definition of the term ``constructive use'' that includes off-\n        site impacts of Federal agency actions on federally owned \n        property.\n            (3) The Federal Government enjoys no right under the \n        Constitution to compensation for use of Federal agency property \n        for other public purposes, while the rights of private persons \n        to be compensated for the taking of their property by the \n        Government for a public purpose is a fundamental right \n        protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n        Constitution.\n            (4) Private property owners should be compensated in a \n        manner that is at least as equitable as the compensation \n        afforded to Federal agencies when their property is used or \n        constructively used for other public purposes.\n            (5) Fair and equitable treatment of private property owners \n        will increase the willingness of private property owners to \n        provide habitat for wildlife and plants protected under the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to increase the efforts of \nprivate property owners to protect and restore habitat for wildlife, by \nensuring that their constitutional and legal property rights will be \nhonored, respected, and protected in the implementation of the \nEndangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nSEC. 3. MINIMIZING IMPACTS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.\n\n    The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n                ``minimizing impacts on private property\n\n    ``Sec. 19. (a) In General.--In implementing this Act, the head of \nan agency shall make every possible effort to avoid, minimize, or \nmitigate impacts on non-Federal property that result in Federal use of \nthe property as a direct result of the action of the agency head under \nthis Act or in furtherance of the purposes of this Act. An agency shall \nnot take action that results in a Federal use of non-Federal property \nunder this Act unless the agency--\n            ``(1) obtains the written permission of its owner;\n            ``(2) negotiates a voluntary agreement authorizing that \n        use; or\n            ``(3) pays compensation in accordance with this section.\n    ``(b) Compensation for Federal Use of Non-Federal Property.--An \nagency that takes action under this Act or in furtherance of the \npurposes of this Act that results in a Federal use of non-Federal \nproperty or any portion of non-Federal property without the written \nconsent of the owner of the property shall compensate the owner for the \nfair market value of the Federal use of the property or portion. \nCompensation paid shall reflect the duration of the Federal use as \nnecessary to achieve the purposes of this Act.\n    ``(c) Request of Owner.--An owner of non-Federal property seeking \ncompensation under this section shall make a written request for \ncompensation to the agency implementing the agency action resulting in \nthe Federal use of property. The request shall, at a minimum, identify \nthe affected portion of the property, the nature of the Federal use of \nnon-Federal property for which the compensation is sought, and the \namount of compensation sought.\n    ``(d) Negotiations.--The agency may negotiate with the owner to \nreach agreement on the amount of the compensation under this section, \nthe terms of any agreement for payment, and the terms of any Federal \nuse of non-Federal property for which compensation is paid. If such an \nagreement is reached, the agency shall within 6 months pay the owner \nthe amount agreed upon. An agreement under this section may include a \ntransfer of title or an agreement to limit the period of time of the \nFederal use of non-Federal property.\n    ``(e) Choice of Remedies.--If, not later than 180 days after the \nwritten request is made, the parties have not reached an agreement on \ncompensation, the owner of the property may elect binding arbitration \nor seek compensation due under this section in a civil action.\n    ``(f) Arbitration.--The procedures that govern the arbitration \nshall, as nearly as practicable, be those established under title 9, \nUnited States Code, for arbitration proceedings to which that title \napplies. An award made in such arbitration shall include a reasonable \nattorney's fee and other arbitration costs, including appraisal fees. \nThe agency shall promptly pay any award made to the owner.\n    ``(g) Civil Actions.--A civil action to enforce this section may be \nfiled under section 11(g). An owner who prevails in a civil action \nagainst the agency pursuant to this section shall be entitled to, and \nthe agency shall be liable for, the amount of compensation awarded plus \nreasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs, including \nappraisal fees. The court shall award interest on the amount of any \ncompensation from the time of the Federal use of non-Federal property.\n    ``(h) Source of Payments.--Any payment made under this section to \nan owner of property and any judgment obtained by an owner of property \nin a civil action under this section shall, notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, be made from the annual appropriation of the agency \nthat took the agency action giving rise to the payment or civil action. \nIf the agency action resulted from a requirement imposed by another \nagency, then the agency making the payment or satisfying the judgment \nmay seek partial or complete reimbursement from the appropriated funds \nof the other agency. For this purpose, the head of the agency concerned \nmay transfer or reprogram any appropriated funds available to the \nagency. If insufficient funds exist for the payment or to satisfy the \njudgment, it shall be the duty of the head of the agency to seek the \nappropriation of such funds for the next fiscal year.\n    ``(i) Availability of Appropriations.--Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, any obligation of the United States to make any \npayment under this section shall be subject to the availability of \nappropriations.\n    ``(j) Duty of Notice to Owners.--An agency may not take any action \nthat is a Federal use of non-Federal property unless the agency has \ngiven 30 days notice to each owner of the property directly affected \nexplaining their rights under this section and either obtaining their \npermission for the Federal use or providing the procedures for \nobtaining any compensation that may be available under this section.\n    ``(k) Rules of Construction.--The following rules of construction \nshall apply to this Act:\n            ``(1) Other rights preserved.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n        construed to limit any right to compensation that exists under \n        the Constitution or under other laws.\n            ``(2) Extent of federal authority.--Payment of compensation \n        under this section (other than when property is bought by the \n        Federal Government at the option of the owner) shall not confer \n        any rights on the Federal Government other than the Federal use \n        of non-Federal property agreed to so that the agency action may \n        achieve the species conservation purposes of this Act.\n    ``(l) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n            ``(1) Agency.--The term `agency' has the meaning given that \n        term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.\n            ``(2) Federal use.--(A) The term `Federal use' means--\n                    ``(i) any action under this Act to--\n                            ``(I) permanently incorporate non-Federal \n                        property into a Federal facility;\n                            ``(II) place non-Federal property under the \n                        control of the Secretary;
