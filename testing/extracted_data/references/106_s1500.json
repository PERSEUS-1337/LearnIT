FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Beneficiaries under the Medicare Program under title \n        XVIII of the Social Security Act are experiencing decreased \n        access to skilled nursing facility services due to inadequate \n        reimbursement under the prospective payment system for such \n        services under section 1888(e) of such Act.\n            (2) Such inadequate reimbursement may force skilled nursing \n        facilities to file for bankruptcy and close their doors, \n        resulting in reduced access to skilled nursing facility \n        services for Medicare beneficiaries.\n            (3) The methodology under the prospective payment system \n        for skilled nursing facility services has made it more \n        difficult for Medicare beneficiaries to find nursing home care. \n        Some beneficiaries are remaining in hospitals for extended \n        stays due to reduced access to nursing homes. Others are placed \n        in nursing homes that are hours away from family and friends.\n            (4) The Health Care Financing Administration has indicated \n        that the prospective payment system for skilled nursing \n        facility services does not accurately account for the costs \n        associated with providing medically complex care (non-therapy \n        ancillary services and supplies). Due to Year 2000 problems, \n        the Health Care Financing Administration claims that it will be \n        unable to properly account for such costs under such system.\n            (5) The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has \n        indicated that payments to skilled nursing facilities under the \n        Medicare Program may not be adequate for beneficiaries who need \n        relatively high levels of non-therapy ancillary services and \n        supplies. According to MedPAC, such inadequate funding could \n        result in access problems for beneficiaries with medically \n        complex conditions.\n            (6) In order to provide adequate payment under the \n        prospective payment system for skilled nursing facility \n        services, such system must take into account the costs \n        associated with providing 1 or more of the following services:\n                    (A) Ventilator care.\n                    (B) Tracheostomy care.\n                    (C) Care for pressure ulcers.\n                    (D) Care associated with individuals that have \n                experienced a stroke or a hip fracture.\n                    (E) Care for non-vent, non-trach pneumonia.\n                    (F) Dialysis.\n                    (G) Infusion therapy.\n                    (H) Deep vein thrombosis.\n                    (I) Care associated with individuals with transient \n                peripheral neuropathy, a chronic obstructive pulmonary \n                disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, a wound \n                infection, a respiratory infection, sepsis, \n                tuberculosis, HIV, or cancer.\n            (7) A temporary legislative solution is necessary in order \n        to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries with complex conditions \n        continue to receive access to appropriate skilled nursing \n        facility services.\n            (8) The skilled nursing facility market basket increase \n        over the last 3 years evidences a critical payment gap that \n        exists between the actual cost of providing services to \n        Medicare beneficiaries residing in a skilled nursing facility \n        and the reimbursement levels for such services under the \n        prospective payment system. In addition, the Health Care \n        Financing Administration, in establishing the skilled nursing \n        facility market basket index under section 1888(e)(5)(A) of the \n        Social Security Act only accounted for the cost of goods, but \n        not for the cost of services, as such section requires.\n\nSEC. 3.
