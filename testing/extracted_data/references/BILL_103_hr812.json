FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) although many sports may have higher death and injury \n        rates, the injuries are coincidental to the purpose of the \n        sport; the object of professional boxing is to inflict pain and \n        physical damage to the extent of rendering the opponent \n        senseless, defenseless, and unconscious;\n            (2) head blows and knockouts, which eventually result in \n        brain damage, are the most prevalent and direct means for a \n        professional boxer to attain victory;\n            (3) existing medical and safety controls are inadequate to \n        prevent chronic brain damage in professional boxers;\n            (4) the longer the boxing career of an individual, the \n        greater the likelihood of brain damage to the individual; and\n            (5) cumulative brain damage in professional boxers is not \n        usually identified until its later stages, when it is generally \n        considered irreversible.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to make unlawful the \nparticipation in or promotion of professional boxing in order to save \nlives, protect the health of prospective professional boxers, and \nprevent exploitation of prospective participants in professional \nboxing.\n\nSEC. 203. PROHIBITION OF PARTICIPATION IN OR PROMOTION OF PROFESSIONAL \n              BOXING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 89 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by inserting after section 1821 the following new section:\n``Sec. 1822.
