and\n            ``(ii) an election under subsection (d)(3) on behalf of \n        such individual is made in timely fashion.\n    ``(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), any reduction required \nunder paragraph (2) shall be made if--\n            ``(i) the additional optional insurance is not in fact paid \n        in accordance with the designation under section 8705, as in \n        effect at the time of retirement;\n            ``(ii) the Office finds that adequate arrangements have not \n        been made to ensure that the insurance provided under this \n        section will be used only for the care and support of the \n        individual so designated; or\n            ``(iii) the election referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) \n        terminates at any time before the death of the individual who \n        made such election.\n    ``(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `permanently \ndisabled' shall have the meaning given such term under regulations \nwhich the Office shall prescribe based on subparagraphs (A) and (C) of \nsection 1614(a)(3) of the Social Security Act, except that, in applying \nsubparagraph (A) of such section for purposes of this subparagraph, \n`which can be expected to last permanently' shall be substituted for \n`which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of \nnot less than twelve months'.''.\n    (b) Continued Withholdings.--Subsection (d) of such section 8714b \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(3)(A) To be eligible for unreduced additional optional insurance \nunder subsection (c)(3), the insured individual shall be required to \nelect, at such time and in such manner as the Office by regulation \nrequires (including procedures for demonstrating compliance with the \nrequirements of subsection (c)(3)), to have the full cost thereof \ncontinue to be withheld from the former employee's annuity or \ncompensation, as the case may be, beginning as of when such \nwithholdings would otherwise cease under the second sentence of \nparagraph (1).\n    ``(B) An election made by an insured individual under subparagraph \n(A) (and withholdings pursuant thereto) shall terminate in the event \nthat--\n            ``(i) the insured individual--\n                    ``(I) revokes such election; or\n                    ``(II) makes any redesignation or other change in \n                the designation under section 8705 (as in effect at the \n                time of retirement); or\n            ``(ii) the Office finds, upon the application of the \n        insured individual or on its own initiative, that any of the \n        requirements or conditions for unreduced additional optional \n        insurance under subsection (c)(3) are, at any time, no longer \n        met.''.\n    (c) Effective Date.--\n            (1) In general.--The amendments made by this section shall \n        take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Election for certain individuals not otherwise \n        eligible.--The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe \n        regulations under which an election under section \n        8714b(d)(3)(A) of title 5, United States Code (as amended by \n        this Act) may be made, within 1 year after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, by any individual not otherwise eligible \n        to make such an election, but only if such individual--\n                    (A) separated from service on or after the first \n                day of the 50-month period ending on the date of \n                enactment of this Act; and\n                    (B) would have been so eligible had the amendments \n                made by this Act (and implementing regulations) been in \n                effect as of the individual's separation date (or, if \n                earlier, the last day for making such an election based \n                on that separation).\n            (3) Withholdings.--\n                    (A) Prospective effect.--If an individual makes an \n                election under paragraph (2), withholdings under \n                section 8714b(d)(3)(A) of such title 5 shall thereafter \n                be made from such individual's annuity or compensation, \n                as the case may be.\n                    (B) Earlier amounts.--If, pursuant to such \n                election, benefits are in fact paid in accordance with \n                section 8714b(c)(3) of such title 5 upon the death of \n                the insured individual, an appropriate reduction \n                (computed under regulations prescribed by the Office) \n                shall be made in such benefits to reflect the \n                withholdings that--\n                            (i) were not made (before the commencement \n                        of withholdings under subparagraph (A)) by \n                        reason of the cessation of withholdings under \n                        the second sentence of section 8714b(d)(1) of \n                        such title; but\n                            (ii) would have been made had the \n                        amendments made by this Act (and implementing \n                        regulations) been in effect as of the time \n                        described in paragraph (2)(B).\n            (4) Notice.--The Office shall, by publication in the \n        Federal Register and such other methods as it considers \n        appropriate, notify current and former Federal employees as to \n        the enactment of this Act and any benefits for which they might \n        be eligible pursuant thereto. Included as part of such \n        notification shall be a brief description of the procedures for \n        making an election under paragraph (2) and any other \n        information that the Office considers appropriate."
