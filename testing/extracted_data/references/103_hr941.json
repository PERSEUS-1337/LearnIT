FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) farmers, ranchers, and foresters have a sound \n        understanding of protecting the Nation's rich natural \n        resources;\n            (2) soil and water damage and contamination have occurred \n        and may occur in the future;\n            (3) energy shortages have occurred and may occur in the \n        future;\n            (4) farmers, ranchers, and foresters are energy driven \n        enterprises in conjunction with substantial soil and water \n        usage;\n            (5) farmers, ranchers and foresters can substantially make \n        more efficient energy expenditures using energy saving \n        management techniques;\n            (6) practices such as fertility management, conservation \n        tillage, and integrated pest management will provide future \n        generations the enjoyment of improved environmental conditions \n        such as better ground and surface water quality and soil \n        fertility;\n            (7) saving and conserving energy will benefit the public \n        land; and\n            (8) Federal agricultural policies and programs influence \n        sound energy conservation and environmental objectives.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through \nthe Soil Conservation Service, shall establish a Federal energy \nconservation program.\n    (b) Criteria.--The Federal energy conservation program shall target \nand promote more efficient energy use in, and the conservation of \nenergy with respect to, tillage practices, chemical and fertilizer \nmanagement, irrigation management, livestock facility management, \nhorticulture, and wood utilization. The Secretary shall provide grants \nand technical and educational assistance for projects in eligible \nStates including (but not limited to) projects for--\n            (1) demonstrating the advantages of conservation tillage \n        practices that promote energy efficiency and conservation;\n            (2) training, pest scouting, and soil sampling in order to \n        promote education concerning prescription application of animal \n        manures, fertilizers, lime, soil conditioners and pesticide \n        usage;\n            (3) improving the efficient use of irrigation systems to \n        reduce energy consumption;\n            (4) managing livestock facilities for energy conservation;\n            (5) managing horticultural facilities for energy \n        conservation; and\n            (6) improving efficiency in utilization of wood, including \n        milling of forest products and the use of wood for production \n        of energy.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL GRANTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary, through the Soil Conservation \nService, shall make grants to individuals or institutions that present \nto the Secretary an application and a plan for the energy conservation \nproject--\n            (1) which was developed in consultation with an individual \n        recognized by the Secretary to have expertise in energy \n        conservation; and\n            (2) that is within an eligible State which has an energy \n        conservation program.\n    (b) Advice From State Agriculture Energy Conservation Review \nPanel.--In making grants under this section, the Secretary shall take \ninto consideration the advice received from the State agriculture \nenergy conservation review panel pursuant to section 6(c)(2).\n    (c) Limitations.--(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \nFederal grant under this section for a project may not exceed $5,000.\n    (2) In the case of a project in which a school, hospital, or other \nsimilar institution that is improving its energy efficiency by \nconverting its heating system to a wood burning system, the Federal \ngrant may not exceed $150,000.\n    (3) Funds made available under this Act may not be used to pay for \nlabor costs associated with a project.\n    (4) Grants for a project may not be made until after receipts have \nbeen provided to the Secretary for the actual cost incurred for the \nproject.\n\nSEC. 5. ALLOCATION AMONG ELIGIBLE STATES.\n\n    The Secretary shall allocate funds made available to carry out this \nAct for a fiscal year to each State which is eligible for assistance. \nThe allocation among States shall be equitable, based on the following:\n            (1) The number and size of farms.\n            (2) The potential for energy conservation.\n            (3) The number and size of forest industries.\n    The Secretary may allocate up to 25 percent of the funds allocated \nto any State with substantial forest industry to forest energy \nconservation projects.\n\nSEC. 6. STATE PARTICIPATION AND ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) Eligible State.--The Secretary may provide assistance under \nthis Act in a fiscal year for projects in a State which, before the \nbeginning of that fiscal year--\n            (1) submits to the Secretary a plan describing in detail \n        how the State will cooperate with the United States in carrying \n        out this Act, including providing for--\n                    (A) encouragement to persons to participate in the \n                energy conservation program;\n                    (B) criteria to be used for recommending projects \n                to be funded by the program; and\n                    (C) individuals with expertise in energy efficiency \n                to advise program participants on energy conservation \n                matters; and\n            (2) has established an agriculture energy conservation \n        review panel in accordance with subsection (c).\n    (b) Cost Share.--The State may offer assistance and services in \ncooperation with the Secretary to enhance energy conservation efforts \nunder this Act.\n    (c) State Agriculture Energy Conservation Review Panel.--(1) An \neligible State, together with the United States, shall establish an \nenergy conservation review panel comprised of 6 members as follows:\n            (A) The head of the State agricultural agency, or his \n        designee.\n            (B) The State forester or equivalent State official, or his \n        designee.\n            (C) The president of that State's Association of \n        Conservation Districts, or his designee.\n            (D) The State conservationist of the Soil Conservation \n        Service for that State, or his designee.\n            (E) The Cooperative Research Service Director for that \n        State, or his designee.\n            (F) The Cooperative Extension Director for the State, or \n        his designee.\n    (2) The State agriculture energy conservation review panel shall \nadvise and recommend to the Secretary those projects that meet the \nrequirements of this Act.
