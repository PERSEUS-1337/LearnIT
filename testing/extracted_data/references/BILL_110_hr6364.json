FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Puget Sound, as the Nation's second largest estuary, is \n        a cornerstone of the Pacific Northwest's regional identity and \n        at the heart of the region's prosperity, supporting a thriving \n        natural resource and marine industry.\n            (2) The water quality of Puget Sound is in decline, with \n        areas of deadly low oxygen and increasing toxic pollutants. \n        Resident species such as salmon and orcas are endangered.\n            (3) The declining health of Puget Sound threatens the \n        economic and environmental vitality of the Pacific Northwest.\n            (4) The Governor of the State of Washington has taken steps \n        to combat the decline of Puget Sound at the State government \n        level.\n            (5) The Federal Government should now match the efforts of \n        the State of Washington. The Environmental Protection Agency \n        should take the lead at the Federal level to create a \n        comprehensive recovery package for Puget Sound, in coordination \n        with the comprehensive conservation and management plan for \n        Puget Sound, and should establish a Puget Sound office in the \n        State of Washington. Other Federal agencies to be involved \n        should include the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the \n        National Park Service, the United States Geological Survey, the \n        Forest Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the \n        Corps of Engineers, and the Departments of Commerce, Homeland \n        Security, Defense, and Transportation.\n            (6) The Puget Sound recovery plan efforts should be listed \n        in the President's annual budget and should serve as a model of \n        the use of science and efficient coordination between Federal, \n        tribal, State, regional, and local efforts with an emphasis on \n        monitoring, assessment, and reaching demonstrable goals.\n            (7) Canada should join in this enhanced effort, given that \n        Puget Sound and the Georgia Straits are the same waterway.\n\nSEC. 3. PUGET SOUND.\n\n    Title I of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 123.
