FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience \n        and encompasses physical, mental, and cognitive impairments. \n        The term ``learning disability'' refers to a number of specific \n        learning disabilities, such as dyslexia. These disorders may \n        manifest themselves in an imperfect ability to listen, think, \n        speak, read, write, spell, reason, or perform mathematical \n        calculations. Learning disabilities tend to endure from \n        childhood into adulthood.\n            (2) 2,600,000 of the 5,100,000 children with disabilities \n        served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in \n        elementary and secondary education are children with learning \n        disabilities.\n            (3) About 2 percent of all undergraduate students \n        nationwide report having a learning disability. Different \n        teaching strategies are needed to enable them to develop their \n        talents and perform up to their capacity.\n            (4) A greater number of individuals with learning \n        disabilities can benefit from postsecondary education, and \n        contribute more fully to society and the economy, with adequate \n        and appropriate programs, services, adaptations, and \n        accommodations.\n            (5) Civil rights laws protect individuals with \n        disabilities, including individuals with learning disabilities, \n        in postsecondary education, and institutions of higher \n        education require assistance to comply with these laws.\n            (6) Exemplary institutions of higher education dedicated to \n        meeting the needs of individuals with learning disabilities \n        exist and can serve as a national resource for other \n        institutions in educating these students.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To assist model institutions of higher education with \n        demonstrated prior experience in serving individuals with \n        learning disabilities.\n            (2) To demonstrate and disseminate programs, services, \n        adaptations, accommodations, strategies, and approaches to \n        teaching individuals with disabilities in postsecondary \n        education.\n\nSEC. 3.
