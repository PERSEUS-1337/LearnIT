FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) According to the Bureau of the Census, approximately 1 \n        in 5 people in the United States lives with some sort of \n        physical disability.\n            (2) More than 54,000,000 individuals in the United States \n        report some level of disability and approximately 34,000,000 of \n        such individuals are classified as having a severe disability.\n            (3) An estimated 11,000,000 individuals aged 6 and older \n        need personal assistance with everyday activities, including \n        taking a bath or shower, preparing meals, and getting around \n        the home.\n            (4) Five percent of the United States population over age \n        15 uses a wheelchair or similar device, cane, crutches, or \n        walker.\n            (5) The number of individuals with physical disabilities \n        continues to increase, and the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention recently announced that the agency was revising its \n        estimate of the number of individuals with spina bifida, the \n        most common permanently disabling birth defect in the United \n        States, from an estimated 70,000 to an estimated 166,000.\n            (6) Studies have found that individuals with disabilities \n        have significant difficulty in accessing routine and \n        specialized health care and that numerous barriers to acquiring \n        health care exist for such individuals.\n            (7) Approximately 1 in 3 women with a disability reports \n        being denied services at a physician's office solely because of \n        her disability.\n            (8) Research shows that women with disabilities are less \n        likely to have pap smears and mammograms, are more likely to be \n        diagnosed with breast cancer at later stages of the disease, \n        are less likely to receive standard treatments, and are more \n        likely to have worse outcomes.\n            (9) Individuals with disabilities report that one of the \n        top barriers to accessing necessary health care is the \n        inability to find an accessible health care provider or \n        identify providers who understand how to treat individuals with \n        disabilities and who are willing to have such individuals as \n        patients.\n            (10) The Spina Bifida Association recently announced that \n        one of its volunteers, Debbie Blanchard, a woman who lived with \n        spina bifida for 55 years, died from a late stage diagnosis of \n        cervical cancer stemming from her inability to find a health \n        care provider in her community who had an examination table \n        that would lower to the level necessary for her to comfortably \n        and safely transfer from her wheelchair to the examination \n        table so she could be screened for cervical cancer.\n            (11) Organizations representing individuals with \n        disabilities report that such individuals need more and better \n        information regarding accessible health care providers in their \n        communities and additional support and resources to help ensure \n        that such individuals receive the care they need and deserve.\n\nSEC. 3.
