FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Life-long food preferences, eating habits, and activity \n        levels develop early in childhood.\n            (2) Preschool years are a critical time for determining \n        whether or not an individual will develop obesity later in \n        life.\n            (3) Aerobic fitness and healthy eating patterns support \n        enhanced behavioral, emotional, and academic performance in \n        school.\n            (4) Recent studies indicate that children who are \n        overweight at age 5 are more likely to be more overweight at \n        age 9.\n            (5) Obese preschool children already exhibit signs of \n        cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n            (6) According to a 2007 Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention study, 12.4 percent of children in the United States \n        ages 2 through 6 are obese.\n            (7) The 2001 National Household Education Survey found that \n        74 percent of children in the United States ages 3 through 6 \n        are in some form of non-parental child care, and 56 percent are \n        in center-based child care.\n            (8) According to a 2009 analysis of child care center \n        licensing regulations, only 12 States have a policy prohibiting \n        or limiting foods of low nutritional value in child care \n        centers, only 8 States require vigorous or moderate physical \n        activity, only one of which has a policy quantifying a required \n        number of minutes of physical activity by day or week, and only \n        7 States quantify a maximum amount of time for media \n        (television and electronic) each day or week.\n            (9) In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        released recommended community strategies and measures to \n        prevent obesity in the United States that includes child care \n        specific policy and environmental initiatives to achieve \n        healthy eating and active living among children from birth to 5 \n        years of age.\n            (10) In 2009, The Institute of Medicine released findings \n        supporting local governments' ability to play a crucial role in \n        creating environments that make it easier for children to eat \n        healthy diets and remain active.\n            (11) States should strive to adopt nutrition standards, \n        practices, and policies for child care centers that are \n        consistent with the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n            (12) Child care centers and family child care homes should \n        serve as settings where children adopt healthy eating habits, \n        have opportunities for age appropriate physical activity, and \n        set screen time limits.\n            (13) Rates of obesity are higher for Black and Latino \n        children than the overall population of children in the United \n        States.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) establish a 3-year pilot program in 5 States that will \n        focus on reducing the increasing prevalence of overweight/\n        obesity among children between birth and 5 years of age in \n        child care settings;\n            (2) enhance the focus of child care centers and family \n        child care homes serving the birth to 5 years of age population \n        on children's healthy development through evidence-based or \n        data-informed practices to improve healthy eating, physical \n        activity, and screen time limits; and\n            (3) identify emerging and expand existing evidence-based \n        practices and understanding of healthy eating, physical \n        activity, and screen time limits, as appropriate, as well as \n        replicate curricula, interventions, practices, and policy \n        changes that are most effective in promoting nutrition and \n        physical activity among the birth to 5 years of age population \n        in the child care setting.\n\nSEC. 3.
