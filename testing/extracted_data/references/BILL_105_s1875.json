FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading known cause of \n        mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;\n            (2) each year, up to 12,000 infants are born in the United \n        States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering irreversible \n        physical and mental damage;\n            (3) thousands more infants are born each year with Fetal \n        Alcohol Effect, also known as Alcohol Related Neurobehavioral \n        Disorder (ARND), a related and equally tragic syndrome;\n            (4) children of women who use alcohol while pregnant have a \n        significantly higher infant mortality rate (13.3 per 1000) than \n        children of those women who do not use alcohol (8.6 per 1000);\n            (5) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect are \n        national problems which can impact any child, family, or \n        community, but their threat to American Indians and Alaska \n        Natives is especially alarming;\n            (6) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol \n        dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a \n        newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol \n        Effect are up to 30 times greater than national averages;\n            (7) in addition to the immeasurable toll on children and \n        their families, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect \n        pose extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, including the \n        costs of health care, education, foster care, job training, and \n        general support services for affected individuals;\n            (8) the total cost to the economy of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n        was approximately $2,500,000,000 in 1995, and over a lifetime, \n        health care costs for one Fetal Alcohol Syndrome child are \n        estimated to be at least $1,400,000;\n            (9) researchers have determined that the possibility of \n        giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n        Alcohol Effect increases in proportion to the amount and \n        frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that \n        stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy \n        reduces the emotional, physical, and mental consequences of \n        alcohol exposure to the baby; and\n            (10) though approximately 1 out of every 5 pregnant women \n        drink alcohol during their pregnancy, we know of no safe dose \n        of alcohol during pregnancy, or of any safe time to drink \n        during pregnancy, thus, it is in the best interest of the \n        Nation for the Federal Government to take an active role \nin encouraging all women to abstain from alcohol consumption during \npregnancy.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to establish, within the Department \nof Health and Human Services, a comprehensive program to help prevent \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect nationwide and to \nprovide effective intervention programs and services for children, \nadolescents and adults already affected by these conditions. Such \nprogram shall--\n            (1) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State, and \n        community-based public awareness, prevention, and education \n        programs on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect;\n            (2) coordinate, support, and conduct prevention and \n        intervention studies as well as epidemiologic research \n        concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect;\n            (3) coordinate, support and conduct research and \n        demonstration projects to develop effective developmental and \n        behavioral interventions and programs that foster effective \n        advocacy, educational and vocational training, appropriate \n        therapies, counseling, medical and mental health, and other \n        supportive services, as well as models that integrate or \n        coordinate such services, aimed at the unique challenges facing \n        individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect \n        and their families; and\n            (4) foster coordination among all Federal, State and local \n        agencies, and promote partnerships between research \n        institutions and communities that conduct or support Fetal \n        Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect research, programs, \n        surveillance, prevention, and interventions and otherwise meet \n        the general needs of populations already affected or at risk of \n        being impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n        Effect.\n\nSEC. 4.
