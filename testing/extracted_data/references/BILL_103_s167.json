This Act may be cited as the ``Protection and Reduction \nof Government Secrecy Act''.\n\n   TITLE II--COMMISSION ON PROTECTING AND REDUCING GOVERNMENT SECRECY\n\n                                purpose\n\n    Sec. 201. It is the purpose of this title to establish a study \ncommission which will examine the implications of the systematic \noverclassification of information and to make recommendations to reduce \nthe volume of information classified and to strengthen the protection \nof legitimately classified information.\n\n                                findings\n\n    Sec. 202. (a) Following World War II the United States and the \nSoviet Union engaged in a global conflict known as the Cold War;\n    (b) During the Cold War a secrecy system developed to enormous \nproportions, thereby limiting the public's access to vital information \nand reducing the ability of the public to participate with full \nknowledge in the process of governmental decision-making;\n    (c) In 1990 6,797,720 documents were classified and approximately \nthree million persons held some form of security clearance;\n    (d) The burden of managing nearly 7 million newly classified \ndocuments every year has led to reduced communication within the \ngovernment and within the scientific community, reduced communication \nbetween the government and the people of the United States, tremendous \nadministrative expense and the selective and unauthorized public \ndisclosure of classified information;\n    (e) The requirement that approximately three million persons obtain \nsecurity clearances represents a substantial loss of individual privacy \nwhich is inconsistent with American traditions;\n    (f) If a smaller amount of truly sensitive information was \nclassified expense, lost privacy and inhibitions on public discussion \nwould be reduced and the remaining classified information could be held \nmore securely;\n    (g) In 1970 a Task Force organized by the Defense Science Board and \nheaded by Dr. Frederick Seitz concluded that ``more might be gained \nthan lost if our Nation were to adopt--unilaterally, if necessary--a \npolicy of complete openness in all areas of information;'' and,\n    (h) A bipartisan study commission specially constituted for the \npurpose of examining the consequences of the secrecy system will be \nable to offer comprehensive proposals for reform.\n\n                       function of the commission\n\n    Sec. 203. (a) The function of the Commission shall be--\n            (1) to conduct an investigation into all matters in any way \n        related to any legislation, executive order, regulation, \n        practice or procedure relating to the access to or the \n        classification of information or involving security clearances, \n        including without limitation access to classified information \n        under the Freedom of Information Act;\n            (2) to make such recommendations concerning the \n        classification of national security information as the \n        Commission shall see fit, including proposing new legislation.\n\n                     composition of the commission\n\n    Sec. 204.
