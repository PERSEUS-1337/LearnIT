FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Men and women who serve in the Armed Forces make great \n        sacrifices for the Nation and for freedom.\n            (2) The Nation takes great pride in the integrity of \n        members of the Armed Forces and places full faith and \n        confidence in these men and women serving in the Armed Forces.\n            (3) The Nation should extend such full faith to the \n        integrity of those men and women when they make claims for \n        disability compensation related to their service.\n            (4) In the spirit of the Armed Forces' pledge never to \n        leave a man behind, the Nation should never leave a veteran \n        behind.\n            (5) Military service is inherently dangerous and stressful \n        whether during peacetime or during war.\n            (6) Post-traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this \n        section as ``PTSD'') is a debilitating mental health condition \n        linked to military service that the Secretary of Veterans \n        Affairs should make every effort to diagnose and effectively \n        treat.\n            (7) It is recognized in the medical community that PTSD can \n        onset at anytime after a traumatic event, and the course of the \n        disorder can contain periods of both relapse and remission.\n            (8) Denial by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of claims \n        for disability compensation for PTSD due to incomplete military \n        records does a disservice to those who have honorably served \n        the country.\n            (9) Military records that would validate such claims may \n        have been lost due to no fault of the veteran.\n            (10) Due to the dangerous and fast-paced environment in \n        which the members of the Armed Forces operate, not every \n        significant and possibly traumatic incident in the life and \n        service of each member is chronicled accurately or completely.\n            (11) Evaluations for disability compensation for PTSD often \n        place veterans under the additional hardship of reliving \n        traumatic events by describing them to unfamiliar medical \n        professionals.\n            (12) According to the Institute of Medicine and \n        representatives of certain veterans' service organizations, \n        evaluations for pension and disability compensation for PTSD \n        are sometimes completed in as little as 20 minutes, despite \n        recommendations of the mental health community that evaluations \n        should take place over a period of one hour or more.\n            (13) The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, \n        established pursuant to title XV of the National Defense \n        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, issued recommendations \n        to improve the care, compensation, and treatment of veterans \n        diagnosed with PTSD, including updating the schedule for rating \n        disabilities under section 1155 of title 38, United States \n        Code, establishing new criteria for the diagnosis and treatment \n        of PTSD, and using a holistic approach to treat veterans with \n        PTSD that incorporates treatment, compensation, and vocational \n        assessment.\n\nSEC. 3. STANDARD OF PROOF FOR SERVICE-CONNECTION OF POST-TRAUMATIC \n              STRESS DISORDER.\n\n    (a) Standard of Proof.--Section 1154 of title 38, United States \nCode, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) The Secretary shall accept as sufficient proof of service-\nconnection of post-traumatic stress disorder alleged to have been \nincurred in or aggravated by service in the active military, naval, or \nair service a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder by a mental \nhealth professional together with a written determination by the \nprofessional that such disorder is related to the veteran's service, if \nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such \nservice, notwithstanding the fact that there is no official record of \nsuch incurrence or aggravation in such service, and, to that end, shall \nresolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran. Service-\nconnection of post-traumatic stress disorder may be rebutted by clear \nand convincing evidence to the contrary. In the case of such a \nrebuttal, the Secretary shall make all documents related to the \nservice-connection of the veteran's disability available to the \nveteran.''.\n    (b) Applicability.--Subsection (c) of section 1154 of title 38, \nUnited States Code, shall apply with respect to any claim for \ndisability compensation under laws administered by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs for which no final decision has been made before the \ndate of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.
