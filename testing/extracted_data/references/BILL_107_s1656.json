FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Veterans Benefits Administration of the Department \n        of Veterans Affairs is responsible for the timely and accurate \n        processing of claims for veterans compensation and pension.\n            (2) The accuracy of claims processing within the Veterans \n        Benefits Administration has been a subject of concern to \n        veterans, Congress, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (3) While the Veterans Benefits Administration has reported \n        in the past a 95 percent accuracy rate in processing claims, a \n        new accuracy measurement system known as the Systematic \n        Technical Accuracy Review found that, in 1998 and again in \n        2000, initial reviews of veterans claims were accurate only 64 \n        percent of the time.\n            (4) The Veterans Benefits Administration could lose up to \n        30 percent of its workforce to retirement by 2003, making \n        adequate training for claims adjudicators even more necessary \n        to ensure veterans claims are processed efficiently.\n            (5) The Veterans Benefits Administration needs to take more \n        aggressive steps to ensure that veterans claims are processed \n        in an accurate and timely fashion so as to avoid unnecessary \n        delays in providing veterans with compensation and pension \n        benefits.\n            (6) In 2001 the expected appeals processing time for a \n        claim from notice of disagreement to final decision is 621 \n        days.\n            (7) As of September 2001, the Veterans Benefits \n        Administration backlog of pending work was 533,029 claims.\n\nSEC. 3.
