PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to achieve the intention of Congress set forth in \n        section 2 by requiring the President to develop a plan--\n                    (A) for the sale of the power generating and \n                transmission facilities and equipment of the Tennessee \n                Valley Authority to the private sector in groupings \n                that will introduce competition into the generation and \n                sale of electric power;\n                    (B) for the transfer of the National Fertilizer and \n                Environmental Research Center to a public or private \n                entity which will carry out the functions of such \n                Center;\n                    (C) for the transfer to other governmental entities \n                of all property of the Tennessee Valley Authority \n                remaining after the sales and transfers described in \n                subparagraphs (A) and (B); and\n                    (D) for the orderly termination of the Tennessee \n                Valley Authority after the completion of such sales and \n                transfers; and\n            (2) to provide a method for reducing the national debt \n        through the use of the income derived from such sales and \n        transfers.\n\nSEC. 4. TVA PRIVATIZATION PLAN.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than September 30, 1994, the President \nshall develop and transmit to Congress a plan for transferring, by sale \nor otherwise, of all real property, facilities, and equipment of the \nTennessee Valley Authority to appropriate public and private entities.\n    (b) Contents.--The plan to be developed under subsection (a) shall \ninclude, at a minimum, recommendations (including legislative \nrecommendations) of the President concerning each of the following:\n            (1) Transfer of power facilities and equipment.--Transfer \n        by sale of the power generation and transmission facilities and \n        equipment of the Tennessee Valley Authority, including real \n        property used in connection with such facilities and equipment, \n        for the purpose of maximizing proceeds from such sales. Such \n        transfers may provide for the sale of generating equipment and \n        facilities to persons other than the persons to whom \n        transmission facilities are sold. Such transfers shall be \n        subject to the following conditions: Former customers of power \n        from the Tennessee Valley Authority will continue to be served \n        and reliability of service will be ensured by establishing \n        control areas in cooperation with surrounding control areas. \n        Such transfers may provide, to the extent practicable, for the \n        grouping of facilities utilizing different sources of power \n        (including coal-fired, nuclear, and hydroelectric generating \n        facilities) and provide for access to the transmission grids of \n        the Tennessee Valley Authority by such groupings to ensure \n        availability of power from different sources and to enhance \n        competition. All outstanding loans associated with such \n        facilities and equipment shall be assumed by the purchasers.\n            (2) Transfer of national fertilizer and environmental \n        research center facilities and equipment.--Transfer by sale of \n        real property, facilities, and equipment used by the National \n        Fertilizer and Environmental Research Center of the Tennessee \n        Valley Authority to a public or private entity which agrees to \n        continue to carry out the functions of the Center for at least \n        5 years after assuming ownership. If such sale cannot be \n        arranged, such transfer may be by donation to an appropriate \n        entity subject to agreement that the functions of the Center \n        will be continued for at least 10 years.\n            (3) Transfer of jurisdictional authority over real \n        property.--Transfer to appropriate governmental departments and \n        agencies, including the National Park Service, of \n        jurisdictional authority over real property which is controlled \n        by the Tennessee Valley Authority and which is not transferred \n        under paragraphs (1) and (2).\n            (4) Transfer of certain functions.--Transfer to appropriate \n        Federal departments and agencies of functions of the Tennessee \n        Valley Authority which are not related to power generation.\n            (5) Termination of tva.--Termination of the Tennessee \n        Valley Authority after the transfers under paragraphs (1), (2), \n        (3), and (4) have been made.\n    (c) Additional Requirements.--The plan developed under subsection \n(a) shall include--\n            (1) a step-by-step procedure to carry out the sales and \n        transfers described in subsection (b);\n            (2) a timetable for implementation of each step of the \n        plan;\n            (3) an estimate of the amount of anticipated net proceeds \n        from the sale of assets of the Tennessee Valley Authority; and\n            (4) an estimate of the cost of implementing the plan."
