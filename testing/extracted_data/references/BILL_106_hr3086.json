FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) American taxpayers should receive equal Medicare \n        services regardless of place of residence.\n            (2) Medicare managed care plans play a fundamental role in \n        the health of our Nation's seniors, often providing coordinated \n        care and access to pharmaceuticals. The loss of Medicare \n        managed care plans and their services can be devastating to our \n        Nation's Medicare-eligible seniors.\n            (3) For the second consecutive year, Medicare managed care \n        plans are abandoning hundreds of thousands of medicare \n        beneficiaries. The most recent announcement of plan \n        cancellations means that within the past two years, 734,000 of \n        the Nation's 6,200,000 Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in \n        managed care plans will have been dropped from those plans.\n            (4) In 1999, Medicare managed care plan withdrawals \n        affected nearly 407,000 Medicare beneficiaries, and 51,276 \n        beneficiaries in 79 counties were left with no other Medicare \n        managed care option.\n            (5) Beginning January 2000, another 327,000 enrollees will \n        need to find alternative coverage, and 79,000 of these Medicare \n        managed care participants will have no other Medicare+Choice \n        plan available.\n            (6) Medicare beneficiaries who have lost their managed care \n        option can enroll in Medicare fee-for-service; however, \n        Medicare fee-for-service does not currently provide \n        comprehensive outpatient pharmaceutical coverage.\n            (7) While all beneficiaries pay the same medicare part B \n        premium as other program participants, Medicare beneficiaries \n        regularly pay managed care plans varied amounts and receive \n        very unequal services and benefits.\n            (8) A growing body of data suggests that medical practice \n        and Medicare spending vary substantially among the Nation's \n        hospital referral regions, even after adjustments for \n        differences in regional prices and illness rates, but there is \n        little evidence that greater spending brings better health.\n            (9) By adjusting Medicare reimbursement payment rates \n        (adjusted for age, sex, severity of illness, etc.,) and \n        lowering Medicare reimbursement payment to providers and \n        regions where there are more costly patterns of practice \n        without better health outcomes, Congress can provide more \n        equitable and efficient health care for our Nation's 39,000,000 \n        Medicare beneficiaries.\n            (10) Such a strategy will encourage a more responsible \n        practice of medicine at the lowest cost to the taxpayer and \n        Medicare beneficiary, and will free resources for improvements \n        to the medicare program.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE CLINICAL PRACTICE AND PAYMENT PATTERN ADJUSTMENT.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Practice Profiles.--\n            (1) In general.--By not later than January 1, 2002, the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish clinical \n        profiles of the practice and payment patterns of health care \n        providers (including both institutional providers and health \n        care professionals) furnishing items and services under the \n        medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n        in order to determine how their practice and payment patterns \n        compare to each other on a local, State, and national basis. In \n        establishing such profiles, the Secretary shall take into \n        account differences in the case mix and severity of patients \n        served by such providers and shall take into account, to the \n        extent practicable, the medical outcomes resulting from such \n        practices.\n            (2) Dissemination of information.--The Secretary shall \n        establish a method for disseminating summary information to the \n        public on the clinical profiles established under paragraph \n        (1). No information that identifies (or permits the \n        identification of) an individual patient shall be disseminated.\n    (b) Authority To Make Payment Adjustments.--For items and services \nfurnished on or after January 1, 2003, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services may adjust the amount of the payments made under the \nmedicare program to such health care providers in order to encourage \ntheir provision of services in a medically appropriate manner and to \ndiscourage significant deviations in underservice or overservice from \ngenerally accepted norms of medical practice. Such adjustments shall be \nmade on the basis of provider profiles established under subsection (a) \nand shall be made only after--\n            (1) taking into account variations among providers in the \n        case mix and severity of patients served; and\n            (2) the Secretary determines that discouraging particular \n        patterns of overservice will not adversely affect outcomes or \n        quality of care.\n    (c) Schedule To Reduce Overpayments.--\n            (1) In general.--For items and services furnished on or \n        after January 1, 2004, the Secretary shall annually reduce \n        overpayments to providers by five percent of the overpayment \n        amount (as defined in paragraph (2)). Such reduction shall be \n        administered through a percentage reduction in the providers' \n        applicable payment methodology.\n            (2) Overpayment amount defined.--In this subsection, the \n        term ``overpayment amount'' means a health care provider's \n        payment profile minus the median national payment profiles for \n        similar health care providers, adjusted for variations in case \n        mix and severity of patients served.\n\nSEC. 4. ADJUSTMENT IN MEDICARE+CHOICE PAYMENT RATES TO OVERPAID \n              COUNTIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1853(c)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act \n(42 U.S.C. 1395w-23(c)(1)(C)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (ii), by striking ``For a subsequent year,'' \n        and inserting ``Subject to clause (iii), for a subsequent \n        year,''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new clause:\n                            ``(iii) In the case of a year beginning \n                        after 1999 for which the Secretary determines \n                        there is an overpaid payment area (as defined \n                        in paragraph (8)), the following:\n                                    ``(I) In the case of such overpaid \n                                payment area, 100.5 percent of the \n                                annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate \n                                under this paragraph for the area for \n                                the previous year.\n                                    ``(II) In the case of a payment \n                                area that is not an overpaid payment \n                                area, 102 percent of the annual \n                                Medicare+Choice capitation rate under \n                                this paragraph for the area for the \n                                previous year.''.\n    (b) Overpaid Payment Area Defined.--Section 1853(c) of such Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395w-23(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nparagraph:\n            ``(8) Overpaid payment area defined.--For purposes of \n        paragraph (1)(C)(iii), the term `overpaid payment area' means a \n        Medicare+Choice payment area for a year for which the annual \n        per capita rate of payment for such area exceeds the mean of \n        the annual per capita rates of payments for all Medicare+Choice \n        payment areas for that year by more than two standard \n        deviations, such mean determined without regard to the number \n        of Medicare beneficiaries in such payment areas.''.\n    (c) Allocation of Savings to Underpaid Counties.--For a contract \nyear consisting of a calendar year beginning on or after January 1, \n2000, for which the Secretary of Health and Human Services has \ndetermined there is an overpaid payment area (as defined in section \n1853(c)(8)), as added by subsection (b), the Secretary shall adjust the \nannual per capita rate of payment for Medicare+Choice payment areas \ndescribed in section 1853(c)(1)(C)(iii)(II), as added by subsection \n(a), to increase the blended capitation rate applicable to such areas \nunder section 1853(c)(1)(A) (in such pro rata manner as the Secretary \ndetermines appropriate) by an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate \namount of reductions in payments attributable to section \n1853(c)(1)(C)(iii)(I), as added by subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5.
