FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) disturbing increases have occurred in recent years in \n        the number of children who are abused by persons who have \n        previously committed crimes of child abuse;\n            (2) many children who run away from home, who fall prey to \n        pornography and prostitution, who suffer from a dependency on \n        alcohol and drugs, and who become juvenile offenders, have been \n        victims of child abuse;\n            (3) research has shown that child abuse tends to repeat \n        itself, and many parents who abuse their children were once \n        victims themselves;\n            (4) in recognition of the increased cases of child abuse, \n        several States have established agencies to receive and \n        maintain data relating to cases of child abuse;\n            (5) currently there exists no centralized national source \n        through which a law enforcement agency can obtain data relating \n        to persons who have committed crimes of child abuse;\n            (6) partly because of the lack of available and accurate \n        information at the national level, persons who have committed \n        acts of child abuse in one State have been able to go to \n        another State to commit the crime again, in many cases in a \n        position of authority over children; and\n            (7) the Nation cannot afford to ignore the importance of \n        preventing child abuse.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish a national system through which current, \n        accurate information concerning persons who commit crimes of \n        child abuse can be obtained from a centralized source;\n            (2) to assist in the prevention of second incidents of \n        child abuse by providing information about persons who have \n        been convicted of a crime of child abuse to organizations whose \n        primary concern is that of child welfare and care; and\n            (3) to understand the problem of child abuse in the United \n        States by providing statistical and informational data to the \n        Department of Justice, the National Center on Child Abuse and \n        Neglect, the Congress, and other interested parties.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORTING BY THE STATES.\n\n    (a) In General.--A State which reports the convictions of named \nindividuals to the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall include all \nconvictions for child abuse as defined under this Act.\n    (b) Guidelines.--The Attorney General shall establish guidelines \nfor the reporting of child abuser information, including procedures for \ncarrying out the purposes of this Act.\n    (c) Annual Summary.--The Attorney General shall publish an annual \nstatistical summary of the child abuser information reported under this \nAct.\n\nSEC. 6. STATE COMPLIANCE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each State shall have 3 years from the date of the \nenactment of this section in which to implement the provisions of \nsection 5.\n    (b) Ineligibility for Funds.--The allocations of funds under \nsection 506 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3756) received by a State not complying with the \nprovisions of section 5, 3 years after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act shall be reduced by 25 percent and the unallocated funds shall \nbe reallocated to the States in compliance with this section."
