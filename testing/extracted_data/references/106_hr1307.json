FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Children's activities outside of school have a critical \n        and long lasting impact on school achievement and future \n        success.\n            (2) Approximately 24,000,000 school-age children are in \n        need of adult supervision while their parents are at work.\n            (3) Experts estimate that almost 5,000,000 school-age \n        children spend time without adult supervision during a typical \n        week and that these children are more likely to engage in risky \n        behavior such as drug and alcohol abuse, sexual activity, \n        loitering on street corners, and truancy.\n            (4) The prosperity of the Nation depends upon maximizing \n        and fulfilling the potential of its young people.\n            (5) Many parents report that they would like to enroll \n        their children in after-school enrichment activities but that \n        they are prevented from doing so by prohibitive costs, \n        transportation difficulties, worries about neighborhood safety, \n        and a shortage of available options.\n            (6) While there are gaps in the availability of after-\n        school programs, there are many outstanding programs for the \n        Nation's youth, including programs sponsored by the Boys and \n        Girls Clubs of America, the Boy Scouts of America, the Girl \n        Scouts of America, YMCAs, mentoring programs, and athletic and \n        other programs operated by public schools, churches, day care \n        centers, parks, recreation centers, family day care, community \n        organizations, law enforcement agencies, service providers, and \n        for-profit and nonprofit organizations.\n            (7) Before the United States can meaningfully expand the \n        supply of after-school programs, accurate information must be \n        available regarding the number, type, and appropriateness of \n        after-school programs available, significant areas of unmet \n        need in the quality and availability of after-school programs, \n        barriers which prevent or deter the participation of children \n        in after-school programs, and barriers to improving the quality \n        and availability of after-school programs.\n\nSEC. 3. AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM GRANTS.\n\n    The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n9858 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in section 657A(b)(3), by inserting ``, including \n        after-school programs'' after ``child care'';\n            (2) in section 657B, by striking ``$1,000,000,000'' and \n        inserting ``$1,010,000,000''; and\n            (3) by inserting after section 658G the following new \n        section:\n\n``SEC. 658H. AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM GRANTS.\n\n    ``A State that receives funds to carry out this Act for a fiscal \nyear shall use not less than 1 percent of the amount of such funds, in \ncoordination with child care resource and referral centers to the \nextent practicable for activities that are designed to improve the \nquality and availability of after-school programs, including one or \nmore of the following:\n            ``(1) Informational assistance, including assistance to \n        kindergartens, elementary schools, and high schools within the \n        State, for placement of children in kindergarten through high \n        school in age-appropriate, enriching after-school programs.\n            ``(2) Coordination of after-school programs, including \n        those funded with Federal or State funds.\n            ``(3) Development of innovative, age-appropriate, age-\n        appealing, and enriching after-school programs.\n            ``(4) Development of creative funding strategies to help \n        make after-school programs affordable for all parents.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
