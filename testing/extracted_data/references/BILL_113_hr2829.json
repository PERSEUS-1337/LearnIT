FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Congress enacted the National Voter Registration Act of \n        1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.) to promote the rights of \n        citizens of the United States to exercise the fundamental right \n        to vote, as set forth in the findings of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n        1973gg(a)).\n            (2) While the purposes of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1973gg(b)) \n        include increasing voter registration and voter participation \n        in elections for Federal office, the language does not refer to \n        individuals in general but refers exclusively to ``eligible \n        citizens of the United States''.\n            (3) An additional purpose of such Act is to ``protect the \n        integrity of the electoral process'' (42 U.S.C. 1973gg(b)(3)).\n            (4) Individuals who do not meet the eligibility \n        requirements for voting in elections for Federal office, \n        including individuals who are not citizens of the United \n        States, have been permitted to register to vote in such \n        elections and are presumably casting ballots in such elections.\n            (5) The participation of ineligible voters in elections for \n        Federal office is in direct conflict with the intent of \n        Congress in enacting the National Voter Registration Act of \n        1993 and with the purpose of such Act.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that the \nprocedures for registering individuals to vote in elections for Federal \noffice are consistent with the purposes of the National Voter \nRegistration Act of 1993.\n\nSEC. 3.
