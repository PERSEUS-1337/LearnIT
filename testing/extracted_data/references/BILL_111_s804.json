FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the National Center for Education \n        Statistics the length of the average school year steadily \n        increased from 144 to 178 days between 1869 and 1949. In 2008, \n        the average number of school days per year remains at 178.5.\n            (2) In 1983, a recommendation in the Nation at Risk report \n        was to increase students' instructional time by lengthening the \n        school day or the school year, as a means to strengthen our \n        Nation's grip on global competitiveness. Since then, no \n        systematic school day or school year increase has occurred.\n            (3) In 2008, 42 States mandate a school year of 180 or \n        fewer days per year, or the equivalent thereof. Across States, \n        the number of school days per year ranges from 173 to 182.\n            (4) Researchers have demonstrated that--\n                    (A) when class material is covered in a \n                streamlined, shortened unit, students' conceptual \n                mastery of the content suffers; and\n                    (B) significant learning requires investment of \n                time.\n            (5) Research has demonstrated that all students are at risk \n        for losing educational gains during extended summer breaks in \n        the typical school calendar, particularly children from low \n        income households. The continued lack of out-of-school learning \n        opportunities contributes to a growing achievement gap. Even \n        more so than achievement gaps present at kindergarten, \n        differences in out-of-school learning opportunities experienced \n        by economically advantaged versus disadvantaged youth \n        contribute to the cumulative achievement difference registered \n        by 9th grade, which affects high school placements, high school \n        exit, and postsecondary school attendance.\n            (6) Since 1991, over 300 expanded learning initiatives have \n        occurred, across 30 States, aimed primarily at schools with \n        high-poverty and high-minority student populations. Outcomes of \n        these initiatives include enhanced student achievement, lower \n        student and teacher absenteeism, and satisfaction of parents, \n        teachers, and students.\n            (7) Research demonstrates that the increased school time is \n        beneficial not only for students, but also for teachers. \n        Teachers gain planning time, more opportunities for cooperative \n        planning, professional development opportunities, and \n        additional time to individualize instruction. Teacher \n        employment increases from part-year to up to full year, \n        depending on the calendar conversion adopted.\n            (8) Regarding the costs of expanded learning initiatives, \n        the cost per hour of instruction decreases with the addition of \n        more learning time.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to ensure that all children have \nsufficient time to achieve in school, that all children have access to \na high quality and well-rounded education, and that teachers have \nsufficient time to deliver quality instruction. Such purposes can be \nachieved by--\n            (1) encouraging States to expand the minimum number of days \n        in their school year, to 200 full days, by 2014, without \n        reducing the length of the school day;\n            (2) modifying the allocations under subpart 2 of part A of \n        title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n        (20 U.S.C. 6331 et seq.) regarding basic, concentration, \n        targeted, and education finance incentive grants, so that each \n        of the formulas used to determine allocations includes a factor \n        that reflects all of the following:\n                    (A) the minimum number of school days in the State-\n                mandated school year length;\n                    (B) the most recent increase in the number of \n                school days in the State-mandated academic year; and\n                    (C) whether the number of school days in an \n                academic year meets, exceeds, or falls short of the \n                base level school year length described in the \n                amendment made by this Act; and\n            (3) encouraging States to increase the length of the school \n        day.\n\nSEC. 4.
