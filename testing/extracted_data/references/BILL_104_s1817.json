FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a variety of effective and appropriate judicial \n        remedies are available under existing law for the full redress \n        of legal or constitutional violations;\n            (2) the imposition, increase, levying, or assessment of \n        taxes by courts is not necessary or appropriate for the full \n        and effective exercise of remedies imposed by Federal courts \n        with appropriate jurisdiction;\n            (3) the imposition, increase, levying, or assessment of \n        taxes by judicial order is--\n                    (A) not an appropriate exercise of the judicial \n                power under the Constitution; and\n                    (B) incompatible with--\n                            (i) the traditional principles of the laws \n                        and Government of the United States; and\n                            (ii) the basic American principle that \n                        taxation without representation is tyrannical \n                        (because Federal courts are composed of \n                        unelected officials who are not answerable to \n                        the popular will);\n            (4) when a Federal court issues an order that requires or \n        results in the imposition, increase, levying, or assessment of \n        any tax, the court--\n                    (A) exceeds the proper boundaries of the limited \n                jurisdiction and authority of Federal courts under the \n                Constitution; and\n                    (B) impermissibly intrudes on the legislative \n                functions of the democratic system of government of the \n                United States;\n            (5) no court should enter an order or approve any \n        settlement--\n                    (A) remedying a legal or constitutional violation \n                by imposing, creating, increasing, levying, or \n                assessing any tax; or\n                    (B) that has the effect of imposing, creating, \n                increasing, levying, or assessing any tax;\n            (6) a settlement agreement or order entered by a Federal \n        court should be fashioned within the framework of the budgetary \n        restraints of any affected State or political subdivision \n        thereof; and\n            (7) the Congress has the authority under sections 1 and 2 \n        of Article III of the United States Constitution to limit and \n        regulate the jurisdiction of the inferior Federal courts, and \n        such authority includes the power to limit the remedial \n        authority of such courts.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON FEDERAL COURT REMEDIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 1369. Limitation on Federal court remedies\n    ``(a)(1) No district court may enter any order or approve any \nsettlement that requires any State, or political subdivision of a \nState, to impose, increase, levy, or assess any tax for the purpose of \nenforcing any Federal or State common law, statutory, or constitutional \nright or law, unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence, \nthat--\n            ``(A)(i) there are no other means available to remedy the \n        deprivation of rights or laws; and\n            ``(ii) the proposed imposition, increase, levying, or \n        assessment is narrowly tailored to remedy the specific \n        deprivation at issue;\n            ``(B) the tax will not contribute to or exacerbate the \n        deprivation intended to be remedied;\n            ``(C) the proposed tax will not result in a loss of revenue \n        for the political subdivision in which it is assessed, levied, \n        or collected;\n            ``(D) the proposed tax will not result in the loss or \n        depreciation of property values of the taxpayer so affected;\n            ``(E) the proposed tax will not conflict with the \n        applicable laws with respect to the maximum rate of taxation as \n        determined by the appropriate State or political subdivision \n        thereof; and\n            ``(F) plans submitted to the court by State and local \n        authorities will not effectively redress the deprivations at \n        issue.\n    ``(2) A finding under paragraph (1) shall--\n            ``(A) be subject to immediate interlocutory de novo review; \n        and\n            ``(B) be reviewed by the court making the finding at least \n        annually with respect to the issues related to the finding, \n        whether or not a related order or settlement agreement \n        continues to apply.\n    ``(3)(A) Notwithstanding any law or rule of procedure, any \naggrieved corporation, or unincorporated association or other person \nresiding or present in the political subdivision in which a tax is \nimposed in accordance with paragraph (1) or other entity located within \nthat political subdivision shall have the right to intervene in any \nproceeding concerning the imposition of the tax.\n    ``(B) A person or entity that intervenes pursuant to subparagraph \n(A) shall have the right to--\n            ``(i) present evidence and appear before the court to \n        present oral and written testimony; and\n            ``(ii) appeal any finding required to be made by this \n        section, or any other related action taken to impose, increase, \n        levy, or assess the tax that is the subject of the \n        intervention.\n    ``(b) Notwithstanding any law or rule of procedure, any order of a \ndistrict court requiring the imposition, increase, levy, or assessment \nof a tax imposed pursuant to subsection (a)(1) shall automatically \nterminate or expire on the date that is 1 year after the later of--\n            ``(1) the date of the imposition of the tax;\n            ``(2) the date of the enactment of the Fairness in Judicial \n        Taxation Act of 1996; or\n            ``(3) an earlier date, if the court determines that the \n        deprivation of rights that is addressed by the order has been \n        cured to the extent practicable.\n    ``(c) This section may not be construed to preempt any law of a \nState or political subdivision thereof that imposes limitations on, or \notherwise restricts the imposition of a tax, levy, or assessment that \nis imposed in response to a court order referred to in subsection (b).\n    ``(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), nothing in this \nsection may be construed to allow a Federal court to, for the purpose \nof funding the administration of an order referred to in subsection \n(b), use funds acquired by a State or political subdivision thereof \nfrom a tax imposed by the State or political subdivision thereof.\n    ``(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to any tax, levy, or assessment \nthat, before the date of enactment of the Fairness in Judicial Taxation \nAct of 1996, has, in accordance with applicable State or local law, \nbeen used to fund the actions of a State or political subdivision \nthereof in meeting the requirements of an order referred to in \nsubsection (b).\n    ``(e) The court shall provide written notification to a State or \npolitical subdivision thereof subject to an order referred to in \nsubsection (b) with respect to any finding required to be made by the \ncourt under subsection (a) before the beginning of the fiscal year of \nthat State or political subdivision.\n    ``(f) There shall be a presumption that the imposition, increase, \nlevying, or assessment of taxes is not a narrowly tailored means of \nremedying deprivations of Federal or State rights.\n    ``(h) For purposes of this section--\n            ``(1) the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a \n        State; and\n            ``(2) any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the \n        District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the \n        District of Columbia.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter 85 of \ntitle 28, United States Code, is amended by adding after the item \nrelating to section 1368 the following new item:\n\n``1369. Limitation on Federal court remedies.''.\n    (c) Statutory Construction.--Nothing contained in this Act and the \namendments made by this Act shall be construed to, beyond the scope of \napplicable law, make legal, validate, or approve the use of a judicial \ntax, levy, or assessment by a district court."
