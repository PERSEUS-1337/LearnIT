SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fundamentally Understanding The \nUsability and Realistic Evolution of Artificial Intelligence Act of \n2017'' or the ``FUTURE of Artificial Intelligence Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) understanding and preparing for the ongoing development \n        of artificial intelligence is critical to the economic \n        prosperity and social stability of the United States;\n            (2) as artificial intelligence evolves, it can greatly \n        benefit society by powering the information economy, fostering \n        better informed decisions and helping unlock answers to \n        questions that, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, \n        are unanswerable;\n            (3) for the reasons set forth in paragraph (2) it's \n        beneficial to better understand artificial intelligence and \n        foster the development of artificial intelligence in a manner \n        that maximizes its benefit to society; and\n            (4) it is critical that the priorities of the advisory \n        committee established under section 4(a)(1) include developing \n        guidance or recommendations--\n                    (A) to promote a climate of investment and \n                innovation to ensure the global competitiveness of the \n                United States;\n                    (B) to optimize the development of artificial \n                intelligence to address the potential growth, \n                restructuring, or other changes in the United States \n                workforce that results from the development of \n                artificial intelligence;\n                    (C) to promote and support the unbiased development \n                and application of artificial intelligence; and\n                    (D) to protect the privacy rights of individuals.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in this Act:\n            (1) Artificial intelligence.--The term ``artificial \n        intelligence'' includes the following:\n                    (A) Any artificial systems that perform tasks under \n                varying and unpredictable circumstances, without \n                significant human oversight, or that can learn from \n                their experience and improve their performance. Such \n                systems may be developed in computer software, physical \n                hardware, or other contexts not yet contemplated. They \n                may solve tasks requiring human-like perception, \n                cognition, planning, learning, communication, or \n                physical action. In general, the more human-like the \n                system within the context of its tasks, the more it can \n                be said to use artificial intelligence.\n                    (B) Systems that think like humans, such as \n                cognitive architectures and neural networks.\n                    (C) Systems that act like humans, such as systems \n                that can pass the Turing test or other comparable test \n                via natural language processing, knowledge \n                representation, automated reasoning, and learning.\n                    (D) A set of techniques, including machine \n                learning, that seek to approximate some cognitive task.\n                    (E) Systems that act rationally, such as \n                intelligent software agents and embodied robots that \n                achieve goals via perception, planning, reasoning, \n                learning, communicating, decision making, and acting.\n            (2) Artificial general intelligence.--The term ``artificial \n        general intelligence'' means a notional future artificial \n        intelligence system that exhibits apparently intelligent \n        behavior at least as advanced as a person across the range of \n        cognitive, emotional, and social behaviors.\n            (3) Narrow artificial intelligence.--The term ``narrow \n        artificial intelligence'' means an artificial intelligence \n        system that addresses specific application areas such as \n        playing strategic games, language translation, self-driving \n        vehicles, and image recognition.\n    (b) Modifications.--The Federal Advisory Committee on the \nDevelopment and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence established \nunder section 4(a) may revise such definitions under subsection (a) of \nthis section as the advisory committee considers appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4.

(B) The possible benefits and effects that the \n                development of artificial intelligence may have on the \n                economy, workforce, and competitiveness of the United \n                States.\n                    (C) Whether and how networked, automated, \n                artificial intelligence applications and robotic \n                devices will displace or create
