FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) at least 30 million Americans lack access to even the \n        most basic health services;\n            (2) access to health care is especially difficult for those \n        Americans who--\n                    (A) live in medically underserved rural communities \n                or inner city neighborhoods;\n                    (B) lack public or private health insurance \n                coverage and the ability to pay directly for care;\n                    (C) must move for work purposes, such as migrant \n                farmworkers;\n                    (D) are members of minority groups, or who speak \n                limited English; or\n                    (E) are members of other vulnerable groups, \n                including persons who are homeless or are high-risk \n                pregnant women, infants and children;\n            (3) the consequences of poor access to health care is \n        evidenced in elevated infant and childhood mortality rates, \n        dangerously low childhood immunization rates, overutilization \n        of hospital emergency rooms or other inappropriate providers of \n        primary care services, and hospitalization rates for \n        preventable conditions that are significantly higher than the \n        national average;\n            (4) efforts to provide access to essential health care \n        services for medically underserved Americans will not only \n        contribute to improved health status, but will also result in \n        less unnecessary care and reduced overall costs of health care; \n        and\n            (5) the federally qualified health centers, including the \n        community and migrant health centers which serve more than 6 \n        million needy Americans, provide an effective and proven model \n        for extending access to all medically underserved Americans.\n\nSEC. 2.
