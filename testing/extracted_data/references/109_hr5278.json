    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``UNRWA Integrity Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \n        Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) was established in \n        1949 as a temporary agency to provide relief services to \n        Palestinian refugees and is the only United Nations agency \n        dedicated to one specific group of refugees.\n            (2) Unlike the United Nations High Commissioner for \n        Refugees which seeks to find ``lasting solutions'' to the \n        plight of refugees, UNRWA makes no effort to resettle \n        Palestinian refugees.\n            (3) Since 1950, the United States has contributed more than \n        $2 billion to UNRWA.\n            (4) In 2005, the United States contributed $108 million to \n        UNRWA, constituting approximately one-fourth of UNRWA's 2005 \n        budget.\n            (5) UNRWA has never permitted an independent third party \n        audit by an internationally-recognized auditing firm.\n            (6) The last audit conducted by UNRWA's own Board of \n        Auditors and certified by the United Nations Board of Auditors \n        provided only summary totals which were vague and in addition \n        left at least $43 million in expenditures completely undefined.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON UNITED STATES VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNRWA.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Section 301 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n(22 U.S.C. 2221) is amended by inserting after subsection (a) the \nfollowing new subsection:\n    ``(b) Voluntary Contributions to UNRWA.--\n            ``(1) Limitation.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), \n                voluntary contributions by the United States to the \n                regular budget of the United Nations Relief and Works \n                Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), \n                or to any successor or related entity, may be provided \n                only during a period for which a certification \n                described in paragraph (2) is in effect.\n                    ``(B) Waiver.--The President may waive the \n                limitation requirement of subparagraph (A) for a period \n                not to exceed 180 days if the President determines that \n                it is the national security interests of the United \n                States to do so and notifies Congress of such \n                determination.\n            ``(2) Certification.--A certification described in this \n        paragraph is a certification transmitted by the President to \n        Congress that contains a determination of the President that \n        UNRWA--\n                    ``(A) is not an impediment to achieving a lasting \n                solution for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and \n                Gaza and moving such refugees to post-refugee status;\n                    ``(B) is subject to comprehensive financial audits \n                by an internationally-recognized third party \n                independent auditing firm;\n                    ``(C) does not knowingly provide employment, \n                refuge, freedom of movement, cash assistance, food \n                assistance, housing rehabilitation assistance, or any \n                other type of social services assistance to members of \n                foreign terrorist organizations; and\n                    ``(D) does not promote anti-Semitism or the denial \n                of the right of Israel to exist.\n            ``(3) Recertifications.--Not later than 180 days after the \n        date on which the President transmits to Congress an initial \n        certification under paragraph (2), and every 180 days \n        thereafter--\n                    ``(A) the President shall transmit to Congress a \n                recertification that the requirements contained in \n                paragraph (2) are continuing to be met; or\n                    ``(B) if the President is unable to make such a \n                recertification, the President shall transmit to \n                Congress a report that contains the reasons therefor.\n            ``(4) Congressional notification.--Voluntary contributions \n        by the United States to the regular budget of UNRWA, or to any \n        successor or related entity, may not be provided until 15 days \n        after the date on which the President has provided notice \n        thereof to the Committee on International Relations and the \n        Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and \n        to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n        Appropriations of the Senate in accordance with the procedures \n        applicable to reprogramming notifications under section 634A(a) \n        of this Act.\n            ``(5) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `foreign \n        terrorist organization' means an organization designated as a \n        foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State in \n        accordance with section 219(a) of the Immigration and \n        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189(a)).''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The requirements of subsection (b) of section \n301 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as added by subsection (a) \nof this section, apply with respect to voluntary contributions by the \nUnited States to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), or to any successor or \nrelated entity, for fiscal year 2007 and each subsequent fiscal year.\n\nSEC. 4.
