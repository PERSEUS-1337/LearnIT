FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Each year, many people in the United States are injured \n        by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign \n        entities and imported into the United States.\n            (2) Both consumers and businesses in the United States have \n        been harmed by injuries to people in the United States caused \n        by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign \n        entities.\n            (3) People in the United States injured by defective \n        products manufactured or produced by foreign entities often \n        have difficulty recovering damages from the foreign \n        manufacturers and producers responsible for such injuries.\n            (4) The difficulty described in paragraph (3) is caused by \n        the obstacles in bringing a foreign manufacturer or producer \n        into a United States court and subsequently enforcing a \n        judgment against that manufacturer or producer.\n            (5) Obstacles to holding a responsible foreign manufacturer \n        or producer liable for an injury to a person in the United \n        States undermine the purpose of the tort laws of the United \n        States.\n            (6) The difficulty of applying the tort laws of the United \n        States to foreign manufacturers and producers puts United \n        States manufacturers and producers at a competitive \n        disadvantage because United States manufacturers and producers \n        must--\n                    (A) abide by common law and statutory safety \n                standards; and\n                    (B) invest substantial resources to ensure that \n                they do so.\n            (7) Foreign manufacturers and producers can avoid the \n        expenses necessary to make their products safe if they know \n        that they will not be held liable for violations of United \n        States product safety laws.\n            (8) Businesses in the United States undertake numerous \n        commercial relationships with foreign manufacturers, exposing \n        the businesses to additional tort liability when foreign \n        manufactures or producers evade United States courts.\n            (9) Businesses in the United States engaged in commercial \n        relationships with foreign manufacturers or producers often \n        cannot vindicate their contractual rights if such manufacturers \n        or producers seek to avoid responsibility in United States \n        courts.\n            (10) One of the major obstacles facing businesses and \n        individuals in the United States who are injured and who seek \n        compensation for economic or personal injuries caused by \n        foreign manufacturers and producers is the challenge of serving \n        process on such manufacturers and producers.\n            (11) An individual or business injured in the United States \n        by a foreign company must rely on a foreign government to serve \n        process when that company is located in a country that is a \n        signatory to the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial \n        and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters done \n        at The Hague November 15, 1965 (20 UST 361; TIAS 6638).\n            (12) An injured person in the United States must rely on \n        the cumbersome system of letters rogatory to effect service in \n        a country that did not sign the Convention on the Service \n        Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or \n        Commercial Matters. These countries do not have an enforceable \n        obligation to serve process as requested.\n            (13) The procedures described in paragraphs (11) and (12) \n        add time and expense to litigation in the United States, \n        thereby discouraging or frustrating meritorious lawsuits \n        brought by persons injured in the United States against foreign \n        manufacturers and producers.\n            (14) Foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to \n        avoid judicial consideration of their actions by asserting that \n        United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over them.\n            (15) The due process clauses of the fifth amendment to and \n        section 1 of the 14th amendment to the Constitution govern \n        United States court assertions of personal jurisdiction over \n        defendants.\n            (16) The due process clauses described in paragraph (15) \n        are satisfied when a defendant consents to the jurisdiction of \n        a court.\n            (17) United States markets present many opportunities for \n        foreign manufacturers.\n            (18) Creating a competitive advantage for either foreign or \n        domestic manufacturers violates the principles of United States \n        trade agreements with other countries.\n            (19) In choosing to import products into the United States, \n        a foreign manufacturer or producer subjects itself to the laws \n        of the United States. Such a foreign manufacturer or producer \n        thereby acknowledges that it is subject to the personal \n        jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in at least one \n        State.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) foreign manufacturers and producers whose products are \n        sold in the United States should not be able to avoid liability \n        simply because of difficulties relating to serving process upon \n        them;\n            (2) to avoid such lack of accountability, foreign \n        manufacturers and producers of foreign products distributed in \n        the United States should be required, by regulation, to \n        register an agent in the United States who is authorized to \n        accept service of process for such manufacturer or producer;\n            (3) it is unfair to United States consumers and businesses \n        that foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to avoid \n        judicial consideration of their actions by asserting that \n        United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over them;\n            (4) those who benefit from importing products into United \n        States markets should expect to be subject to the jurisdiction \n        of at least one court within the United States;\n            (5) importing products into the United States should be \n        understood as consent to the accountability that the legal \n        system of the United States ensures for all manufacturers and \n        producers, foreign, and domestic;\n            (6) importers recognize the scope of opportunities \n        presented to them by United States markets but also should \n        recognize that products imported into the United States must \n        satisfy Federal and State safety standards established by \n        statute, regulation, and common law;\n            (7) foreign manufacturers should recognize that they are \n        responsible for the contracts they enter into with United \n        States companies;\n            (8) foreign manufacturers should act responsibly and \n        recognize that they operate within the constraints of the \n        United States legal system when they import products into the \n        United States;\n            (9) foreign manufacturers who are unwilling to act and \n        recognize as described in paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) should \n        not have access to United States markets;\n            (10) United States laws and the laws of United States \n        trading partners should not put burdens on foreign \n        manufacturers and importers that do not apply to domestic \n        companies;\n            (11) it is fair to ensure that foreign manufacturers, whose \n        products are distributed in commerce in the United States, are \n        subject to the jurisdiction of State and Federal courts in at \n        least one State because all United States manufacturers are \n        subject to the jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in \n        at least one State; and\n            (12) it should be understood that, by registering an agent \n        for service of process in the United States, the foreign \n        manufacturer or producer acknowledges consent to the \n        jurisdiction of the State in which the registered agent is \n        located.\n\nSEC. 4.
