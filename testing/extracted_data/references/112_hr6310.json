    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Restoring Confidence in Our \nDemocracy Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Free and open elections are a founding principle of our \n        republican form of government.\n            (2) It is incumbent upon Congress to ensure that elections \n        in the United States are free of corruption and the appearance \n        of corruption.\n            (3) The free flow of money in politics, as exemplified by \n        the current state of affairs, is corrupting and will distort \n        and disfigure our democracy.\n            (4) Excessively high levels of spending on elections is \n        fundamentally damaging to the public perception of our \n        government, and threatens the fairness and integrity of our \n        democracy.\n            (5) Congress has a constitutional duty to guarantee a \n        republican form of government for the States.\n            (6) Spending record sums of money on our elections \n        threatens the continued existence of our republican form of \n        government.\n            (7) Allowing unlimited spending on elections means the \n        wealthy can crowd out other important voices in our political \n        debates, thereby giving American citizens fewer sources of \n        information.\n            (8) Congress has the inherent power to ensure elections for \n        the government are conducted in a fair, honorable, and proper \n        way to preserve our democracy and ensure the people have \n        confidence in our elections and system of government.\n            (9) Congress has the authority to regulate campaign \n        expenditures to promote integrity, prevent corruption, and \n        ensure the public has trust in our election system, going back \n        to the Tillman Act of 1907, which prohibits corporations from \n        making direct contributions to political campaigns.\n            (10) In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which \n        first prohibited corporations and labor unions from making \n        independent expenditures in support or opposition to candidates \n        for Federal office.\n            (11) The Watergate scandal, and the outrageous expenditure \n        of campaign funds in that scandal, did great damage to public \n        confidence in government and demanded a legislative response to \n        restore this confidence.\n            (12) Congress enacted the Federal Elections Campaign Act \n        (FECA) in 1974 as a response to Watergate and public calls for \n        increased regulation of our campaign system. This law \n        established the Federal Elections Commission and instituted \n        limits on campaign contributions which remain law to this day.\n            (13) In 1976, the Supreme Court issued a decision in the \n        case of Buckley v. Valeo which first established the principle \n        that money equals speech, in addition to overturning FECA \n        limitations on independent expenditures.\n            (14) The Buckley decision also stated that ``The \n        constitutional power of Congress to regulate federal elections \n        is well established and is not questioned by any of the parties \n        in this case.''.\n            (15) Equating money with speech can result in the wealthy \n        having an undue influence on our elections at the expense of \n        the great majority of the American people.\n            (16) In 1990, the Supreme Court issued a decision in the \n        case of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce which upheld a \n        Michigan law banning corporations from making independent \n        expenditures in elections.\n            (17) In Austin, the Court found that ``Corporate wealth can \n        unfairly influence elections when it is deployed in the form of \n        independent expenditures.''.\n            (18) Austin also established that the government has an \n        antidistortion interest in regulating political speech. The \n        Court held that there is a compelling government interest in \n        preventing ``the corrosive and distorting effects of immense \n        aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of \n        the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to \n        the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.''.\n            (19) In 2002, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign \n        Reform Act of 2002, which banned political parties from raising \n        ``soft money'', among other things.\n            (20) Spending in presidential elections has risen to \n        excessive levels over the last decade, which threatens not only \n        our government, but the integrity of our elections.\n            (21) In the 2000 presidential election, both candidates \n        spent $343.1 million combined. This number climbed to $717.9 \n        million in the 2004 presidential election.\n            (22) In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama's \n        campaign spent $740.6 million, more than both major party \n        candidates combined in the previous election.\n            (23) Following the Supreme Court's decision in the case of \n        Citizens United v. FEC, there was a massive increase in outside \n        political spending, which threatens to undermine the legitimacy \n        of our political system.\n            (24) In the 2010 elections, Super PACs spent approximately \n        $90.4 million, of which $60 million was spent explicitly \n        advocating for or against a candidate.\n            (25) Spending among Super PACs in 2010 was concentrated at \n        the top. Ten Super PACs accounted for nearly 75 percent of all \n        Super PAC spending in 2010. Additionally, American Crossroads \n        spent $25.8 million in 2010 alone, accounting for 28.7 percent \n        of Super PAC spending in 2010.\n            (26) According to the Wall Street Journal, Super PACs have \n        spent $152,528,662 on the 2012 election to date.\n            (27) Super PACs spent $8.93 million during the week of June \n        18, 2012 alone.\n            (28) Super PACs are allowed to conceal the source of their \n        donations, thereby avoiding transparency and greater public \n        scrutiny of their actions and motivations.\n            (29) Six and four-tenths percent of itemized funds raised \n        by Super PACs since 2010 were not able to be traced to their \n        original sources, which decreases accountability and \n        transparency, threatens public confidence in our elected \n        officials and our elections, and has a distorting effect on our \n        elections.\n            (30) Corporations, now freed to spend as much as they like \n        to influence elections, contributed $31 million to Super PACs \n        from 2010-2011, thereby helping give corporate interests a \n        greater voice in our political system than average Americans.\n            (31) A January 2012 poll by Rasmussen says that 58 percent \n        of Americans believe the United States needs new campaign \n        finance laws.\n            (32) A January 2012 poll by Democracy Corps found that 55 \n        percent of Americans oppose the Citizens United decision. \n        Eighty percent of voters also believe there should be limits on \n        the money spent in campaigns.\n            (33) After considering these findings, Congress is \n        concerned by the unfairness of unlimited spending in elections \n        and is taking this action to protect our democracy and our \n        electoral system.\n            (34) Reinstating the ban on corporate political \n        expenditures and placing a limit on the amount of donations to \n        Super PACs will help restore faith and trust in our democracy \n        and will respond to calls by the American people for vigorous \n        campaign finance reform and effective laws to protect our free \n        democratic system of elections.\n\nSEC. 3.
