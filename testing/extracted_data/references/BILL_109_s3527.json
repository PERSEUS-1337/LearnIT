FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Computational science, the use of advanced computing \n        capabilities to understand and solve complex problems, \n        including the development of new products and processes, is now \n        critical to scientific leadership, economic competitiveness, \n        and national security.\n            (2) Advances in computational science and high performance \n        computing provide a competitive advantage because they allow \n        businesses to run faster simulations of complex systems or to \n        develop more precise computer models.\n            (3) The Federal Government is one of the investors in \n        research aimed at the development of new computational science \n        and high-performance computing capabilities.\n            (4) As determined by the Council on Competitiveness, the \n        Nation's small businesses and manufacturers must ``Out Compute \n        to Out Compete''. However, new computational science \n        technologies are not being transferred effectively from the \n        research organizations to small businesses and manufacturers.\n            (5) Small businesses and manufacturers are especially well-\n        positioned to benefit from increased availability and \n        utilization of high-performance computing technologies and \n        software.\n            (6) Current cost and technology barriers associated with \n        high-performance computing and software algorithms often \n        inhibit small businesses and manufacturers from successfully \n        making use of these technologies.\n            (7) The establishment of an advanced multidisciplinary \n        computing software institute will help make existing high \n        performance computing resources more accessible to small \n        businesses and manufacturers. This will create new \n        opportunities for economic growth, jobs, and product \n        development.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide grants for the \ncreation of an Advanced Multidisciplinary Computing Software Institute \nthat will--\n            (1) develop and compile high-performance computing software \n        and algorithms suitable for applications in small business and \n        manufacturing;\n            (2) effectively carry out the transfer of new computational \n        science and high-performance computing technologies to small \n        businesses and manufacturers; and\n            (3) actively assist small businesses and manufacturers in \n        utilizing such technologies.\n\nSEC. 3.
