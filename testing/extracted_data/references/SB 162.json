    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 25150.7 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n25150.7.\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares that this section is intended to address the unique circumstances associated with the generation and management of treated wood waste. The Legislature further declares that this section does not set a precedent applicable to the management, including disposal, of other hazardous wastes.\n(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:\n(1) \u201cTreated wood\u201d means wood that has been treated with a chemical preservative for purposes of protecting the wood against attacks from insects, microorganisms, fungi, and other environmental conditions that can lead to decay of the wood, and the chemical preservative is registered pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. Sec. 136 et seq.).\n(2) \u201cWood preserving industry\u201d means business concerns, other than retailers, that manufacture or sell treated wood products in the state.\n(c) This section applies only to treated wood waste that, solely due to the presence of a preservative in the wood, is a hazardous waste and to which both of the following requirements apply:\n(1) The treated wood waste is not subject to regulation as a hazardous waste under the federal act.\n(2) Section 25143.1.5 does not apply to the treated wood waste.\n(d) (1) Notwithstanding Sections 25189.5 and 25201, treated wood waste shall be disposed of in either a class I hazardous waste landfill, or in a composite-lined portion of a solid waste landfill unit that meets all requirements applicable to disposal of municipal solid waste in California after October 9, 1993, and that is regulated by waste discharge requirements issued pursuant to Division 7 (commencing with Section 13000) of the Water Code for discharges of designated waste, as defined in Section 13173 of the Water Code, or treated wood waste.\n(2) A solid waste landfill that accepts treated wood waste shall comply with all of the following requirements:\n(A) Manage the treated wood waste to prevent scavenging.\n(B) Ensure that any management of the treated wood waste at the solid waste landfill before disposal, or in lieu of disposal, complies with the applicable requirements of this chapter, except as otherwise provided by regulations adopted pursuant to subdivision (f).\n(C) If monitoring at the composite-lined portion of a landfill unit at which treated wood waste has been disposed of indicates a verified release, then treated wood waste shall not be discharged to that landfill unit until corrective action results in cessation of the release.\n(e) (1) Each wholesaler and retailer of treated wood and treated wood-like products in this state shall conspicuously post information at or near the point of display or customer selection of treated wood and treated wood-like products used for fencing, decking, retaining walls, landscaping, outdoor structures, and similar uses. The information shall be provided to wholesalers and retailers by the wood preserving industry in 22-point type, or larger, and contain the following message:\n\n\nWarning\u2014Potential Danger\n\n\nThese products are treated with wood preservatives registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation and should only be used in compliance with the product labels.\nThis wood may contain chemicals classified by the State of California as hazardous and should be handled and disposed of with care. Check product label for specific preservative information and Proposition 65 warnings concerning presence of chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or birth defects.\nAnyone working with treated wood, and anyone removing old treated wood, needs to take precautions to minimize exposure to themselves, children, pets, or wildlife, including:\n\n\u25a1Avoid contact with skin. Wear gloves and long sleeved shirts when working with treated wood. Wash exposed areas thoroughly with mild soap and water after working with treated wood.\n\n\u25a1Wear a dust mask when machining any wood to reduce the inhalation of wood dusts. Avoid frequent or prolonged inhalation of sawdust from treated wood. Machining operations should be performed outdoors whenever possible to avoid indoor accumulations of airborne sawdust.\n\n\u25a1Wear appropriate eye protection to reduce the potential for eye injury from wood particles and flying debris during machining.\n\n\u25a1If preservative or sawdust accumulates on clothes, launder before reuse. Wash work clothes separately from other household clothing.\n\n\u25a1Promptly clean up and remove all sawdust and scraps and dispose of appropriately.\n\n\u25a1Do not use treated wood under circumstances where the preservative may become a component of food or animal feed.\n\n\u25a1Only use treated wood that\u2019s visibly clean and free from surface residue for patios, decks, or walkways.\n\n\u25a1Do not use treated wood where it may come in direct or indirect contact with public drinking water, except for uses involving incidental contact such as docks and bridges.\n\n\u25a1Do not use treated wood for mulch.\n\n\u25a1Do not burn treated wood. Preserved wood should not be burned in open fires, stoves, or fireplaces.\n\n\nFor further information, go to the Internet Web site http://www.preservedwood.org and download the free Treated Wood Guide mobile application.\n\n\nIn addition to the above listed precautions, treated wood waste shall be managed in compliance with applicable hazardous waste control laws.\n(2) On or before July 1, 2005, the wood preserving industry shall, jointly and in consultation with the department, make information available to generators of treated wood waste, including fencing, decking, and landscape contractors, solid waste landfills, and transporters, that describes how to best handle, dispose of, and otherwise manage treated wood waste, through the use either of a toll-free telephone number, Internet Web site, information labeled on the treated wood, information accompanying the sale of the treated wood, or by mailing if the department determines that mailing is feasible and other methods of communication would not be as effective. A treated wood manufacturer or supplier to a wholesaler or retailer shall also provide the information with each shipment of treated wood products to a wholesaler or retailer, and the wood preserving industry shall provide it to fencing, decking, and landscaping contractors, by mail, using the Contractors\u2019 State License Board\u2019s available listings, and license application packages. The department may provide guidance to the wood preserving industry, to the extent resources permit.\n(f) (1) On or before January 1, 2007, the department, in consultation with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, and after consideration of any known health hazards associated with treated wood waste, shall adopt and may subsequently revise as necessary, regulations establishing management standards for treated wood waste as an alternative to the requirements specified in this chapter and the regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter.\n(2) The regulations adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall, at a minimum, ensure all of the following:\n(A) Treated wood waste is properly stored, treated, transported, tracked, disposed of, and otherwise managed to prevent, to the extent practical, releases of hazardous constituents to the environment, prevent scavenging, and prevent harmful exposure of people, including workers and children, aquatic life, and animals to hazardous chemical constituents of the treated wood waste.\n(B) Treated wood waste is not reused, with or without treatment, except for a purpose that is consistent with the approved use of the preservative with which the wood has been treated.
