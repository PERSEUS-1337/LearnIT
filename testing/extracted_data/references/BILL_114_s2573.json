SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Home Lead Safety \nTax Credit Act of 2016''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n            (1) Lead is a metal that can produce a wide range of health \n        effects in humans when ingested. Children are more vulnerable \n        to lead poisoning than adults.\n            (2) Lead poisoning is a serious, entirely preventable \n        threat to a child's intelligence, behavior, and learning. In \n        severe cases, lead poisoning can result in death.\n            (3) According to the Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development, approximately 23 million housing units nationwide \n        have at least one lead paint hazard.\n            (4) In fiscal year 2015, funding for Federal lead abatement \n        programs, such as the Lead Hazard Control Grant Program, only \n        provided for lead abatement or ``interim control measures'' for \n        18,600 homes.\n            (5) Childhood lead poisoning can be dramatically reduced by \n        the abatement or complete removal of all lead-based hazards. \n        Empirical studies also have shown substantial reductions in \n        lead poisoning when the affected properties have undergone \n        ``interim control measures'' that are less costly than \n        abatement.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage the safe \nremoval of lead hazards from homes and thereby decrease the number of \nchildren who suffer reduced intelligence, learning difficulties, \nbehavioral problems, and other health consequences due to lead \npoisoning.\n\nSEC. 2. HOME LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION ACTIVITY TAX CREDIT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after \nsection 36B the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 36C.
