FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1)(A) Research indicates that child welfare staff face a \n        variety of obstacles that hinder their effective work with \n        children and families in the child welfare system. These \n        obstacles include barriers described in subparagraphs (B) \n        through (D).\n            (B) High caseload and high workload levels prevent child \n        welfare staff from working intensively with children and \n        families and monitoring their progress carefully.\n            (C) Child welfare staff report an absence of sufficient \n        access to supervision, mentoring, and professional advancement. \n        A lack of access to supervision, mentoring, and professional \n        advancement contributes to staff burnout and turnover.\n            (D) States report difficulty hiring and retaining quality \n        child welfare staff. The average tenure of such a staff member \n        is less than 2 years. In addition to the increased cost of \n        hiring and training new child welfare staff, high turnover \n        rates among such staff are associated with multiple placements \n        of children in foster care, longer lengths of stays in foster \n        care, lower rates of permanency, and failed efforts at family \n        reunification. Lengthy periods of foster care increase costs \n        for child welfare agencies, as maintaining children in foster \n        care is more expensive than adoption, reunification, or other \n        permanency options.\n            (2) Supervision, staff preparation and training, caseloads, \n        workloads, data and accountability, working conditions, \n        cultural competence, and leadership are key components of an \n        effective child welfare workforce.\n\nSEC. 3.
