FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Americans have become increasingly comfortable with \n        using the Internet for a wide range of purposes, including \n        gathering information, purchasing items, performing financial \n        transactions, and obtaining information and services from the \n        Government.\n            (2) In 2008, 74 percent of adults in the United States \n        reported using the Internet, according to the Pew Internet and \n        American Life Project. Of those adults, 89 percent reported \n        using the Internet to find information, 71 percent made \n        purchases over the Internet, 70 percent read news online, 56 \n        percent looked up campaign or political information, 55 percent \n        utilized online banking, and 59 percent visited Government \n        Internet Web sites.\n            (3) The Internet is well-suited to allow individuals to \n        provide and update personal information. Completing such tasks \n        online saves time, reduces paper, increases efficiency, and \n        lowers costs.\n            (4) Many States already allow citizens to access Government \n        services online, including renewing driver's licenses and \n        registering cars.\n            (5) Two States, Arizona and Washington, have already \n        implemented online voter registration systems, and a number of \n        other States are in the process of adopting online voter \n        registration systems.\n            (6) Although 2008 was the first election cycle that the \n        online voter registration system was in place in Washington \n        State, in the month prior to the general election, voter use of \n        the online voter registration system exceeded that of mail-in \n        registration cards by more than 20 percent.\n            (7) Younger adults who are registering to vote for the \n        first time are the most adept Internet users and expect to be \n        able to accomplish most tasks online. In 2008, 87 percent of \n        adults age 18 to 29 used the Internet. In Washington State, \n        voters age 18 to 24 had the highest rate of use of its online \n        voter registration system.\n            (8) During the 2008 election cycle, Washington State \n        processed about 130,000 online voter registration transactions.\n            (9) Implementing an online voter registration requires an \n        initial investment to purchase the needed technology and to \n        input existing voter information into the registration \n        database. Washington State, for example, spent $278,000 to \n        establish its online voter registration system.\n            (10) Once in place, online voter registration systems allow \n        the processing of new voter registrations, changes of address \n        or party, and requests for absentee ballots.\n            (11) Washington State reports that it costs approximately \n        25 cents to process paper voter registration cards and 43 cents \n        to process those submitted via the department of motor vehicles \n        in compliance with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 \n        (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.). Voters must also pay postage costs \n        for registration cards sent through the mail. Once in place, \n        the online voter registration system requires no processing by \n        staff in order to complete a transaction, and therefore has no \n        per transaction cost. For the 2008 general election, the online \n        voter registration system saved Washington State $32,500, and \n        saved consumers $54,600 in postage costs, which resulted in \n        total savings to the State and consumers of over $87,000.\n\nSEC. 3.
