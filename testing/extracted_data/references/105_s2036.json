FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) United States Armed Forces in the Republic of Bosnia \n        and Herzegovina have accomplished the military mission assigned \n        to them as a component of the Implementation and Stabilization \n        Forces.\n            (2) The continuing and open-ended commitment of U.S. ground \n        forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is subject to \n        the oversight authority of the Congress.\n            (3) Congress may limit the use of appropriated funds to \n        create the conditions for an orderly and honorable withdrawal \n        of U.S. troops from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n            (4) On November 27, 1995, the President affirmed that \n        United States participation in the multinational military \n        Implementation Force in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n        would terminate in about one year.\n            (5) The President declared the expiration date of the \n        mandate for the Implementation Force to be December 20, 1996.\n            (6) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n        Chiefs of Staff expressed confidence that the Implementation \n        Force would complete its mission in about one year.\n            (7) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n        Chiefs of Staff expressed the critical importance of \n        establishing a firm deadline, in the absence of which there is \n        a potential for expansion of the mission of U.S. forces.\n            (8) On October 3, 1996, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n        Staff announced the intention of the United States \n        Administration to delay the removal of United States Armed \n        Forces personnel from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n        until March 1997.\n            (9) In November 1996 the President announced his intention \n        to further extend the deployment of United States Armed Forces \n        in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina until June 1998.\n            (10) The President did not request authorization by the \n        Congress of a policy that would result in the further \n        deployment of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of \n        Bosnia and Herzegovina until June 1998.\n            (11) Notwithstanding the passage of two previously \n        established deadlines, the reaffirmation of those deadlines by \n        senior national security officials, and the endorsement by \n        those same national security officials of the importance of \n        having a deadline as a hedge against an expanded mission, the \n        President announced on December 17, 1997 that establishing a \n        deadline had been a mistake and that U.S. ground combat forces \n        were committed to the NATO-led mission in Bosnia for the \n        indefinite future.\n            (12) NATO military forces have increased their \n        participation in law enforcement, particularly police \n        activities.\n            (13) U.S. Commanders of NATO have stated on several \n        occasions that, in accordance with the Dayton Peace Accords, \n        the principal responsibility for such law enforcement and \n        police activities lies with the Bosnian parties themselves.\n\nSEC. 3.
