FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Lower Mississippi area located south of New \n        Orleans, Louisiana, which is known as ``Plaquemines Parish'', \n        has great historical significance;\n            (2) from the earliest Spanish explorers traveling along the \n        banks of the Lower Mississippi River in the 1500s, to Robert de \n        LaSalle claiming all of the land drained by the Lower \n        Mississippi River in 1682, to the petroleum, fisheries, and \n        transportation industries of today, the area is one of the most \n        unique areas in the continental United States;\n            (3) while, in 1699, the area became the site of the first \n        fortification on the Lower Mississippi River, known as ``Fort \n        Mississippi'', it has since been home to 10 different \n        fortifications, more than a dozen lighthouses, and several \n        wildlife refuges, quarantine stations, and pilot stations;\n            (4) of particular interest to the area are--\n                    (A) Fort St. Philip, originally built in 1749, at \n                which, during the Battle of New Orleans, the British \n                navy was blocked from going up river and a victory for \n                the Colonial Army was ensured; and\n                    (B) Fort Jackson, built across from Fort St. Philip \n                at the request of General Andrew Jackson and partially \n                constructed by famous local Civil War General P.G.T. \n                Beauregard, which was the site of the famous Civil War \n                battle known as the ``Battle of the Forts'', which is \n                also referred to as the ``night the war was lost'';\n            (5) the area is--\n                    (A) at the end of the longest continuous river road \n                and levee system in the United States; and\n                    (B) a part of the River Road highway system;\n            (6) lower Plaquemines Parish is split down the middle by \n        the Mississippi River, surrounded on 3 sides by the Gulf of \n        Mexico, and crossed by numerous bayous, canals, and ditches;\n            (7) Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip are located on--\n                    (A) an ancient Head of Passes site; and\n                    (B) 1 of the most historic areas on the Lower \n                Mississippi River known as ``Plaquemines Bend'';\n            (8) the modern Head of Passes is only 21 miles south of \n        Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip where the Mississippi River \n        splits into a bird foot delta to travel the last 20 miles to \n        the Gulf of Mexico;\n            (9) there are numerous geological features that are unique \n        to a large river mouth or delta that could make a national park \n        in the area a particularly intriguing attraction;\n            (10) the coastal erosion, subsidence, river hydraulics, \n        delta features, fresh, salt, and brackish water marshes, and \n        other unique features of the area could be an effective \n        classroom for the public on the challenges of protecting our \n        river and coastal zones;\n            (11) the area includes the beginning of the Mississippi \n        River flyway, which is--\n                    (A) 1 of the most pristine eco-sites in the United \n                States; and\n                    (B) the site of 2 national wildlife refuges and 1 \n                state wildlife refuge;\n            (12) the area is culturally diverse in history, population, \n        industry, and politics;\n            (13) many well-known characters lived or performed deeds of \n        great notoriety in the area;\n            (14) in the area, Creoles, Europeans, Indians, Yugoslav, \n        African-Americans, and Vietnamese all worked together to weave \n        an interesting history of survival and success in a very \n        treacherous environment;\n            (15) the area has tremendous tourism potential, \n        particularly for historical tourism and eco-tourism, because of \n        the location, pristine ecosystems, and past indifference of the \n        local government to promote tourism in the area; and\n            (16) since Hurricane Katrina, the local government in the \n        area has--\n                    (A) passed a resolution strongly supporting a \n                national park study; and\n                    (B) shown an interest in developing tourism in the \n                area.\n\nSEC. 3.
