    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Afghanistan Freedom Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The rise to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan has \n        caused a drastic decline in the human, political, and civil \n        rights of the Afghan people, particularly among women, girls, \n        and ethnic minorities.\n            (2) In the year 2001, millions of Afghans are on the verge \n        of starvation, the largest such group in the world.\n            (3) The United States is the single largest donor of \n        humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, totaling more than \n        $185,000,000 in fiscal year 2001.\n            (4) There are approximately 2,000,000 Afghan refugees in \n        Pakistan, 1,500,000 Afghan refugees in Iran, and 1,000,000 \n        internally displaced persons in Afghanistan, most fleeing \n        oppression, violence, and economic hardship.\n            (5) During the period of Taliban rule, Afghanistan has \n        become the world's largest source of illegal opium, and \n        proceeds from the sale of raw opium to drug traffickers are \n        used by the Taliban to finance its war on the Afghan people.\n            (6) Under Taliban rule, Afghanistan has become a training \n        ground, operational base, and safe haven for terrorists and \n        international terrorist organizations, many of whom gain \n        experience fighting alongside Taliban forces inside Afghanistan \n        prior to conducting terrorist operations outside Afghanistan.\n            (7) The Taliban have, since 1996, harbored and protected \n        terrorist leader Osama bin Laden and members of his terrorist \n        al Qaeda network.\n            (8) Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda associates were \n        indicted for the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States \n        embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, as a \n        result of which the United Nations Security Council adopted \n        Resolution 1267 (1999), demanding that the Taliban surrender \n        Osama bin Laden for trial and determining that the Taliban's \n        continued provision of sanctuary to international terrorist \n        organizations constitutes a threat to international peace and \n        security.\n            (9) In order to compel the Taliban to surrender Osama bin \n        Laden and terminate support for international terrorist \n        organizations, the United Nations Security Council has imposed \n        progressively more comprehensive sanctions on the Taliban under \n        Resolutions 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000), and 1363 (2001), which \n        sanctions are binding on all members of the United Nations \n        under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\n            (10) As a result of the Taliban's failure to comply with \n        the demands of the United States and the United Nations \n        Security Council, Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network were \n        able to orchestrate from Afghanistan the September 11, 2001, \n        terrorist attack on the United States in which approximately \n        6,000 Americans and foreign nationals were murdered.\n            (11) The Taliban have, since the September 11th attack on \n        the United States, rejected all entreaties by the United States \n        and other governments to surrender Osama bin Laden, close down \n        international terrorist operations in Afghanistan, and comply \n        with the other demands that have been made by the United \n        Nations Security Council.\n            (12) Afghanistan is an ethnically diverse nation that can \n        prosper only under a representative government that affords all \n        citizens of that nation their basic human rights, restores \n        peace and security, eradicates the drug trade, and brings all \n        terrorists and terrorist organizations in Afghanistan to \n        justice.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD AFGHANISTAN.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States to promote the removal \nfrom power of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan so as to diminish the \nrisk of future terrorist attack on the United States and restore basic \nhuman freedoms to the people of Afghanistan.\n\nSEC. 4.
