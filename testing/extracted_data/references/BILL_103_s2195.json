FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Government has consistently \n        encouraged the development and dissemination of public \n        telecommunications services in broadcast and nonbroadcast \n        technologies through, among other things, the Public \n        Broadcasting Act of 1967, the Public Telecommunications \n        Financing Act of 1978, and the Public Telecommunications Act of \n        1992, wherein Congress found that ``it is in the public \n        interest for the Federal Government to ensure that all citizens \n        of the United States have access to public telecommunications \n        services through all appropriate available telecommunications \n        distribution technologies. . . ''.\n            (2) The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring \n        that all citizens of the United States have access to \n        noncommercial governmental, educational, informational, \n        cultural, civic, and charitable services through all \n        appropriate telecommunications networks.\n            (3) New telecommunications technologies will enhance the \n        ability of schools, libraries, local governments, public \n        broadcast institutions, and nonprofit organizations to deliver \n        and receive noncommercial governmental, educational, \n        informational, cultural, civic, and charitable services \n        throughout the United States.\n            (4) It is in the public interest that these entities be \n        granted access to capacity on telecommunications networks for \n        the purpose of disseminating and receiving noncommercial \n        governmental, educational, informational, cultural, civic, and \n        charitable services throughout the United States.\n            (5) It is necessary and appropriate that these entities \n        have access, without charge, to the capacity on \n        telecommunications networks to enable the public to have \n        affordable access to the governmental, educational, \n        informational, cultural, civic, and charitable services \n        provided by such entities.\n            (6) Telecommunications services, including cable television \n        programming, basic telephone service, and telecommunications \n        services not yet available, are likely to become an \n        increasingly pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans.\n            (7) Most Americans are currently served by \n        telecommunications networks that lack sufficiently open \n        architecture, sufficient capacity, and adequate \n        nondiscriminatory access terms necessary to provide open access \n        to a diversity of voice, video, and data communications.\n            (8) Private telecommunications carriers are likely to \n        control access to telecommunications networks that lack \n        sufficiently open architecture, sufficient capacity, and \n        adequate nondiscriminatory access terms. Without narrowly \n        tailored governmental intervention, the existence of these \n        private ``gatekeepers'' is likely to restrict access to these \n        networks.\n            (9) Private telecommunications carriers respond to \n        marketplace forces, and therefore are most likely to exclude \n        those members of the public and institutions with the fewest \n        financial resources, including but not limited to small town \n        and rural residents, low income people, minorities, individuals \n        with disabilities, the elderly, and noncommercial organizations \n        such as schools, libraries, public broadcasters, and nonprofit \n        community and civic organizations.\n            (10) To facilitate widespread public discourse on a range \n        of public concerns between and among all Americans, the \n        Government has a compelling interest in providing broad access \n        to telecommunications networks for a diversity of voices, \n        viewpoints, and cultural perspectives, including access for \n        members of the public whose voices are most likely to be \n        excluded by private telecommunications carriers.\n            (11) Assuring access to a diversity of voices, viewpoints, \n        and cultural perspectives over telecommunications networks \n        benefits all members of the public who use telecommunications \n        networks to disseminate or receive information.\n            (12) Government support and encouragement of a diversity of \n        voices, viewpoints, and cultural perspectives over \n        telecommunications networks furthers a compelling governmental \n        interest in improving democratic self-governance, and improving \n        and facilitating local government services and communication \n        between citizens and elected and unelected public officials.\n            (13) Telecommunications networks make substantial use of \n        public rights-of-way in real property and in spectrum \n        frequencies.\n            (14) Because of the Government's compelling interest in \n        ensuring broad and diverse access to telecommunications \n        networks for the purposes of disseminating and receiving \n        noncommercial educational and informational services, and in \n        exchange for the use of public rights-of-way accorded \n        telecommunications networks, it is appropriate for Congress \n        (through the assertion of concurrent Federal jurisdiction over \n        rights-of-way held or controlled by State or local governments) \n        to require that owners and operators of telecommunications \n        networks reserve capacity on such networks for public use.\n            (15) The least restrictive means to ensure that those \n        members of the public whose voices are most likely to be \n        excluded from telecommunications networks can access those \n        networks is to require those networks to reserve a portion of \n        their capacity for that access.\n            (16) It is in the public interest that reserved network \n        capacity for public use be accompanied by funding to facilitate \n        use of such capacity to provide noncommercial governmental, \n        educational, informational, cultural, civic, and charitable \n        services for the public.\n\nSEC. 3. PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.\n\n    Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 714. PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n            ``(1) The term `telecommunications network' means any group \n        of facilities that has been granted the right to occupy any \n        public right-of-way to transmit or carry telecommunications for \n        the public, and provides the consumer or end user the \n        opportunity to choose from a range of telecommunications that \n        are available contemporaneously to the public. A terrestrial \n        radio or television broadcast station licensed pursuant to \n        Title III shall not be considered a telecommunications network \n        by reason of its use of its assigned spectrum.\n            ``(2) The term `public right-of-way' means any right-of-\n        way, including use of the electromagnetic spectrum, that is \n        held or otherwise controlled by Federal, State, or local \n        governments on behalf of the public, and is used in the \n        transmission or carriage of telecommunications.\n            ``(3) The term `telecommunications' means communications of \n        any form transmitted or carried by any means, including analog \n        or digital electromagnetic signals.\n    ``(b) Requirement for Reserved Capacity.--Within 365 days after the \ndate of enactment of this section, the Commission shall promulgate \nregulations to require owners and operators of telecommunications \nnetworks to reserve, for public uses, capacity on such networks for use \nfree-of-charge by eligible entities. The reserved capacity shall be \nconsidered public property subject to disposition pursuant to \nregulations promulgated by the Commission, and the owner or operator of \nany affected telecommunications network shall have no control over, and \nno liability for, the communications content of such capacity.\n    ``(c) Reservation of Capacity.--\n            ``(1) Amount of capacity to be reserved.--The Commission \n        shall presume that a reservation under this section of 20 \n        percent of the capacity of a telecommunications network is \n        appropriate, but may require a reservation of a lower amount or \n        an amount to be phased-in not exceeding 20 percent, upon \n        consideration of the type of technology used by the network, \n        barriers to accessing the network, and such other factors as \n        the Commission considers appropriate. Telecommunications \n        networks shall not be required to reserve public capacity in \n        excess of that required under this paragraph.\n            ``(2) Temporary reductions.--If the Commission determines \n        that any portion of the amount of public capacity that a \n        telecommunications network is required to reserve under this \n        section will go unused, the Commission may temporarily reduce \n        the reserved amount by such unused portion. During the period \n        when the reserved public capacity of a telecommunications \n        network is temporarily reduced, an eligible entity described in \n        subsection (d) may request use of any of the portion by which \n        such reserved capacity was reduced and the Commission shall, \n        within 30 days after the request, provide sufficient capacity \n        to meet the request.\n            ``(3) Quality.--The quality of telecommunications capacity \n        reserved for public uses under this section shall be equivalent \n        to the best quality of available capacity of the affected \n        telecommunications network in all respects, including \n        accessibility, channel positioning, interconnection access \n        rights, network capabilities, and such other factors as the \n        Commission considers appropriate.\n            ``(4) Reduction or elimination of obligations.--The \n        Commission may reduce or eliminate obligations upon a \n        telecommunications network imposed under this subsection, if \n        the Commission determines on the record after notice and \n        opportunity for comment, that, throughout its entire service \n        area, such network has clearly sufficient open architecture, \n        capacity, and nondiscriminatory access terms to ensure that \n        economic and technological barriers to access by eligible \n        entities describe in subsection (d) are eliminated.\n            ``(5) Effect on franchise fee collection.--Nothing in this \n        section is intended to affect the power of any franchising \n        authority to collect a franchise fee authorized under section \n        622.\n    ``(d) Allocation of Capacity.--\n            ``(1) Eligible entities.--The following entities are the \n        entities eligible for access to the public capacity reserved \n        under this section:\n                    ``(A) State, local, and tribal governments and \n                their agencies.\n                    ``(B) Accredited educational institutions open to \n                enrollment by the public.\n                    ``(C) Public telecommunications entities.\n                    ``(D) Public and nonprofit libraries.\n                    ``(E) Nonprofit organizations described under \n                section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n                that are formed for the purpose of providing \n                nondiscriminatory public access to noncommercial \n                educational, informational, cultural, civic, or \n                charitable services.\n            ``(2) Terms and conditions of access.--Such eligible \n        entities shall have access to such public capacity at no charge \n        (for installation or service) if using such capacity only for \n        the provision of educational, informational, cultural, civic, \n        or charitable services directly to the public without charge \n        for such services. Telecommunications capacity allocated \n        pursuant to this section shall not be sold, resold, or \n        otherwise transferred in consideration for money or any other \n        thing of value.\n            ``(3) Allocation.--The Commission shall determine \n        appropriate mechanisms and guidelines for allocating such \n        public capacity.
