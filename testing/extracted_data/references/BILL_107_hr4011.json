FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) President George W. Bush, after much thoughtful \n        consideration, decided to move forward with Federal funding for \n        human embryonic stem cell research on existing stem cell lines.\n            (2) President George W. Bush established the President's \n        Council on Bioethics, which advises the President on the \n        ethical significance of emerging biomedical science and \n        technology.\n            (3) The principal mission of the President's Council on \n        Bioethics is to explore the ethical issues connected with \n        advances in biotechnology.\n            (4) Advances in biomedicine are guiding scientists to \n        improved medical treatments for people suffering from many \n        debilitating and life-threatening diseases and injuries, such \n        as Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes, and spinal cord \n        injuries.\n            (5) The advancement of science is paramount in the \n        alleviation and eradication of diseases and other medical \n        disorders.\n            (6) There are a finite number of human embryonic stem cell \n        lines designated on the Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry of \n        the National Institutes of Health. These lines will provide \n        much opportunity for researching the potential of embryonic \n        stem cells. However, this number of lines may not be enough to \n        meet the Nation's research needs.\n            (7) Federal funds are crucial for researchers to proceed \n        with stem cell research and technologies.\n            (8) The ability to use pluripotent stem cells derived from \n        human embryos provides an opportunity for doctors to learn to \n        generate specialized cells that are destroyed or damaged by \n        diseases or disabilities, such as the dopamine-producing cells \n        that are degenerated in Parkinson's disease and the insulin-\n        producing cells that are impaired in diabetes.\n            (9) Pluripotent stem cell research could lead to vastly \n        improved treatments or cures for AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, \n        anemia, arthritis, birth defects, blindness, brain injury, \n        cancer, deafness, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, \n        liver disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, lung disease, multiple \n        sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease, severe \n        burns, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord injury, and stroke, and \n        could also lead to improved success of organ transplantation.\n            (10) Federal funding through the National Institutes of \n        Health ensures that research will be conducted in accordance \n        with the highest scientific and ethical standards.\n            (11) According to the National Academy of Sciences:\n                    (A) Current scientific data indicate that there are \n                important biological differences between adult and \n                embryonic stem cells and among adult stem cells found \n                in different types of tissue. The therapeutic \n                implications of these biological differences are not \n                clear, and additional scientific data are needed on all \n                stem cell types.\n                    (B) Over time all cell lines in tissue culture \n                change, typically accumulating harmful genetic \n                mutations. Most existing stem cell lines have been \n                cultured in the presence of nonhuman cells or serums \n                that could lead to potential human health risks. \n                Changing genetic and biological properties of these \n                stem cell lines necessitate continued monitoring as \n                well as the development of new stem cell lines in the \n                future.\n                    (C) Human stem cell research that is publicly \n                funded and conducted under the established standards of \n                open scientific exchange, peer review, and public \n                oversight offers the most efficient and responsible \n                means to fulfill the promise of stem cells to meet the \n                need for regenerative medical therapies.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established in the legislative branch a bipartisan \ncommission to be known as the Stem Cell Research Board (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Board'').\n\nSEC. 4.
