FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Willamette River basin has been inhabited by humans \n        for at least 12,000 years, providing natural resources for the \n        cultural life-ways for the Native American tribes of the \n        Willamette Valley, Euro-Americans, pioneers, and other \n        citizens. The area has sustained a cultural history that \n        predates the Ice Age Floods of Missoula, Montana.\n            (2) The Willamette River Basin comprises almost 12,000 \n        square miles, is home to almost 70 percent of Oregon's \n        population, and generates approximately 75 percent of the \n        economic activity of the State.\n            (3) By 2050, an additional 1,700,000 people are expected to \n        inhabit the Willamette River Basin, bringing the total \n        population to approximately 4,000,000.\n            (4) The Willamette River is the 13th largest river, based \n        on stream flow and produces the most runoff for its land area \n        of any river in the Continental United States. Thirteen major \n        tributaries feed into the mainstem Willamette.\n            (5) The river and surrounding tributaries are home to a \n        wide variety of fish and wildlife. In particular, the river is \n        part of a migratory route for a variety of anadromous fish and \n        provides spawning grounds for coho salmon, lamprey, sturgeon, \n        spring and fall run chinook, and steelhead and cutthrout trout.\n            (6) The Willamette River is one of 14 rivers designated an \n        American Heritage River in 1998. The American Heritage Rivers \n        initiative is an innovative response to help river communities \n        that seek Federal assistance and other resources to meet tough \n        challenges, without imposing new regulations on private \n        property owners and businesses.\n            (7) State, local, and tribal governments and local private \n        for-profit and non-profit organizations have provided \n        significant resources and technical assistance to address \n        natural resource and environmental protection, economic \n        revitalization, archaeological resource protection, and \n        historic and cultural preservation through collaborative \n        partnerships.\n            (8) None of the accomplishments realized by the Willamette \n        River through the American Heritage Rivers initiative could \n        have occurred without the strong commitment of the Federal \n        Government agencies to facilitate cooperative conservation \n        actions that relate to use, enhancement, and enjoyment of \n        natural resources, protection of the environment, or both, and \n        that involve collaborative activity among Federal, State, \n        local, and tribal governments, private for-profit and nonprofit \n        institutions, other non-governmental entities and individuals.\n            (9) The natural resource federal agencies provide critical \n        studies, analysis, technical assistance and expertise such that \n        the scope of work that can be accomplished by local river \n        communities is limited when these agencies are not adequately \n        funded.\n            (10) Despite continued population growth, ongoing cleanup \n        efforts have resulted in improvement toward several measures of \n        watershed health, but more must be done to restore the river's \n        long-term health.\n            (11) Nature observation and sightseeing are among the \n        fastest growing recreation activities in the Willamette Basin, \n        increasing by 254 percent and 69 percent respectively, in the \n        last 15 years.\n            (12) The Willamette River is experiencing renewed \n        investments of State, regional, and non-government funding to \n        capitalize on this increasing interest in the river from \n        visitors and residents.\n            (13) Such investments include a $227,400,000 bond measure \n        voters approved in 2006 to protect natural areas and lands near \n        rivers and streams throughout the Portland metro region, \n        safeguarding the quality of water while managing the impacts of \n        growth and maintaining the area's quality of life for future \n        generations.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are:\n            (1) To continue the work to enhance access to the \n        Willamette River that has been initiated by the Willamette \n        River Basin communities, State, regional, local, and Indian \n        tribal governments and non-government partnerships, and for \n        other purposes.\n            (2) To assist the State of Oregon and the communities of \n        the Willamette River Basin in restoring, preserving, \n        protecting, promoting, and interpreting these historic, \n        recreational, and natural resources for the benefit of the \n        Nation.\n            (3) To authorize partnerships among Federal agencies, \n        State, local, and Indian tribal governments, local communities, \n        conservation organizations, and other non-Federal entities to \n        carry-out the above-mentioned purposes.\n\nSEC. 4.
