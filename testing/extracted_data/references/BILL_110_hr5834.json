FINDINGS.\n     Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-\n    333; 22 U.S.C. 7801 et seq.) (in this section referred to as ``the \n    Act'') was the product of broad, bipartisan consensus in Congress \n    regarding the promotion of human rights, transparency in the \n    delivery of humanitarian assistance, and refugee protection.\n        (2) In addition to the longstanding commitment of the United \n    States to refugee and human rights advocacy, the United States is \n    home to the largest Korean population outside of northeast Asia, \n    and many in the two-million strong Korean-American community have \n    family ties to North Korea.\n        (3) Human rights and humanitarian conditions inside North Korea \n    are deplorable, North Korean refugees remain acutely vulnerable, \n    and the findings in section 3 of the Act remain accurate today.\n        (4) The Government of China is conducting an increasingly \n    aggressive campaign to locate and forcibly return border-crossers \n    to North Korea, where they routinely face torture and imprisonment, \n    and sometimes execution. According to recent reports, the Chinese \n    Government is shutting down Christian churches and imprisoning \n    people who help North Korean defectors and has increased the bounty \n    paid for turning in North Korean refugees.\n        (5) In an attempt to deter escape attempts, the Government of \n    North Korea has reportedly stepped up its public execution of \n    border-crossers and those who help others cross into China.\n        (6) In spite of the requirement of the Act that the Special \n    Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea (the ``Special Envoy'') report \n    to the Congress no later than April 16, 2005, a Special Envoy was \n    not appointed until August 19, 2005, more than four months after \n    the reporting deadline.\n        (7) The Special Envoy appointed by the President has filled \n    that position on a part-time basis only.\n        (8) Since the passage of the North Korean Human Rights Act, \n    Congress has on several occasions expressed interest in the status \n    of North Korean refugees, and on February 21, 2006, a bipartisan \n    group of senior Members of the House and Senate wrote Secretary of \n    State Condoleezza Rice ``to express [their] deep concern for the \n    lack of progress in funding and implementing the key provisions of \n    the North Korean Human Rights Act'', particularly the lack of North \n    Korean refugee admissions to the United States.\n        (9) Although the United States refugee resettlement program \n    remains the largest in the world by far, the United States has \n    resettled only 37 North Koreans in the period from 2004 through \n    2007.\n        (10) From the end of 2004 through 2007, the Republic of Korea \n    resettled 5,961 North Koreans.\n        (11) Extensive delays in assessment and processing have led \n    numerous North Korean refugees to abandon their quest for United \n    States resettlement, and long waits (of more than a year in some \n    cases) have been the source of considerable discouragement and \n    frustration among refugees, many of whom are awaiting United States \n    resettlement in circumstances that are unsafe and insecure.\n        (12) From 2000 through 2006, the United States granted asylum \n    to 15 North Koreans, as compared to 60 North Korean asylum grantees \n    in the United Kingdom, and 135 in Germany during that same period.\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n        (1) the United States should continue to make it a priority to \n    seek broader permission and greater cooperation from foreign \n    governments to allow the United States to process North Korean \n    refugees overseas for resettlement in the United States, through \n    persistent diplomacy by senior officials of the United States, \n    including United States ambassadors to Asia-Pacific nations;\n        (2) at the same time that careful screening of intending \n    refugees is important, the United States also should make every \n    effort to ensure that its screening, processing, and resettlement \n    of North Korean refugees are as efficient and expeditious as \n    possible;\n        (3) the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues \n    should be a full-time position within the Department of State in \n    order to properly promote and coordinate North Korean human rights \n    and humanitarian issues, and to participate in policy planning and \n    implementation with respect to refugee issues, as intended by the \n    North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-333; 22 \n    U.S.C. 7801 et seq.);\n        (4) in an effort to more efficiently and actively participate \n    in humanitarian burden-sharing, the United States should approach \n    our ally, the Republic of Korea, to revisit and explore new \n    opportunities for coordinating efforts to screen and resettle North \n    Koreans who have expressed a wish to pursue resettlement in the \n    United States and have not yet availed themselves of any right to \n    citizenship they may enjoy under the Constitution of the Republic \n    of Korea; and\n        (5) because there are genuine refugees among North Koreans \n    fleeing into China who face severe punishments upon their forcible \n    return, the United States should urge the Government of China to--\n            (A) immediately halt its forcible repatriation of North \n        Koreans;\n            (B) fulfill its obligations pursuant to the 1951 United \n        Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 \n        Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and the 1995 \n        Agreement on the Upgrading of the UNHCR Mission in the People's \n        Republic of China to UNHCR Branch Office in the People's \n        Republic of China; and\n            (C) allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n        (UNHCR) unimpeded access to North Koreans inside China to \n        determine whether they are refugees and whether they require \n        assistance.\nSEC. 4.
