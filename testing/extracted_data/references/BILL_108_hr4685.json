FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On March 16, 1934, the Congress passed and President \n        Roosevelt signed the Act popularly known as the Duck Stamp Act \n        (16 U.S.C. 718a et seq.), which requires all migratory \n        waterfowl hunters 16 years of age or older to buy a Federal \n        migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp annually.\n            (2) The Federal Duck Stamp program has become one of the \n        most popular and successful conservation programs ever \n        initiated.

As of 2003, such stamps \n        have generated more than $600,000,000 in revenue that has been \n        used to preserve over 5 million acres of migratory waterfowl \n        habitat in the United States.
