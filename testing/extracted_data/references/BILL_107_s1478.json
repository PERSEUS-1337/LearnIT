FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) puppies in the United States are mass-produced at \n        breeding facilities known as ``puppy mills'';\n            (2) those puppies are typically sold at 8 weeks of age to \n        retail operations or to live animal brokers that subsequently \n        sell the puppies to retail operations;\n            (3) there are more than 3,000 commercial dog breeding \n        operations in the United States;\n            (4) problems documented at puppy mills include--\n                    (A) overcrowding in cages;\n                    (B) lack of protection from the elements;\n                    (C) infestation of food by rodents or insects;\n                    (D) overbreeding;\n                    (E) inbreeding;\n                    (F) lack of proper veterinary care;\n                    (G) lack of socialization with humans; and\n                    (H) the killing of unwanted animals;\n            (5) lack of early socialization seriously affects a dog's \n        ability to function as part of a human family and contributes \n        to behavior problems such as aggression;\n            (6) factors contributing to the declining health of female \n        dogs and litters include--\n                    (A) the breeding of female dogs during the first \n                estrus cycle when the female dogs are not fully mature; \n                and\n                    (B) the breeding of female dogs each estrus cycle \n                without sufficient rest between litters;\n            (7) the Department of Agriculture is responsible for \n        inspecting those facilities using a set of regulations for care \n        and treatment of the puppies and dogs promulgated under the \n        Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.);\n            (8) those facilities continue to operate despite repeated \n        violations of the regulations cited by Department of \n        Agriculture inspectors; and\n            (9) consumers purchase from retail operations puppies that \n        are believed to be healthy and genetically sound, but that--\n                    (A) suffer from an array of physical and behavioral \n                problems after purchase; or\n                    (B) harbor genetic diseases and deficiencies that \n                may not surface until several years later.\n\nSEC. 3. SOCIALIZATION PLAN; BREEDING RESTRICTIONS.\n\n    Section 13(a)(2) of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(2)) is \namended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n            (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end \n        and inserting a semicolon; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(C) for the development of an engineering \n                standard, including a written plan of activities, based \n                on the recommendations of animal welfare and behavior \n                experts, for the socialization of dogs to facilitate \n                contact with other dogs and people; and\n                    ``(D) for addressing the initiation and frequency \n                of breeding female dogs so that a female dog is not \n                bred--\n                            ``(i) before the female dog has reached at \n                        least 1 year of age; and\n                            ``(ii) more frequently than 3 times in any \n                        24-month period.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REVOCATION OF LICENSE.\n\n    Section 19 of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2149) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``Sec. 19.
