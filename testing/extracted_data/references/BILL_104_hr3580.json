FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Supreme Court announced in the \n        landmark decision, Communications Workers of America v. Beck \n        (487 U.S. 735), that employees who work under a union security \n        agreement, and are required to pay union dues as a condition of \n        employment, may not be forced to contribute through such dues \n        to union-supported political, legislative, social, or \n        charitable causes with which they disagree, and may only be \n        required to pay dues related to collective bargaining, contract \n        administration, and grievance adjustment necessary to \n        performing the duties of exclusive representation.\n            (2) Little action has been taken by the National Labor \n        Relations Board to facilitate the ability of employees to \n        exercise their right to object to the use of their union dues \n        for political, legislative, social, or charitable purposes, or \n        other activities not necessary to performing the duties of the \n        exclusive representative of employees in dealing with the \n        employer on labor-management issues, and the Board only \n        recently issued its first ruling implementing the Beck decision \n        nearly 8 years after the Supreme Court issued the opinion.\n            (3) The evolution of the right enunciated in the Beck \n        decision has diminished its meaningfulness because employees \n        are forced to forego critical workplace rights bearing on their \n        economic well-being in order to object to the use of their dues \n        for purposes unrelated to collective bargaining, to rely on the \n        very organization they are challenging to make the \n        determination regarding the amount of dues necessary to the \n        union's representational function, and do not have access to \n        clear and concise financial records that provide an accurate \n        accounting of how union dues are spent.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to ensure that workers who are required \nto pay union dues as a condition of employment have adequate \ninformation about how the money they pay in dues to a union is spent \nand to remove obstacles to the ability of working people to exercise \ntheir right to object to the use of their dues for political, \nlegislative, social, or charitable causes with which they disagree, or \nfor other activities not necessary to performing the duties of the \nexclusive representative of employees in dealing with the employer on \nlabor-management issues.\n\nSEC. 4.
