FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Republic of Turkey (in this Act referred to as \n        ``Turkey'') has played an important strategic, political, and \n        economic role in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East since its \n        founding in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal ``Ataturk'' following the \n        collapse of the 600-year Ottoman Empire.\n            (2) The friendship shared between the United States and \n        Turkey dates to the late 18th century and was consecrated by \n        the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States \n        and the Ottoman Empire in 1830.\n            (3) The United States reaffirmed its relationship with \n        Turkey by entering into the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation \n        of 1929.\n            (4) The United States and Turkey have subsequently entered \n        into over 60 treaties, memoranda of understanding, and other \n        agreements on a broad range of issues, including a bilateral \n        investment treaty (1986), a bilateral tax treaty (1998), and a \n        trade and investment framework agreement (1999), as evidence of \n        their strong friendship.\n            (5) Turkey is located in the strategic corridor between \n        Europe and Asia, bordering the Black Sea and the Mediterranean \n        Sea.\n            (6) Turkey has been a strategic partner of the United \n        States since it joined the allies at the end of World War II.\n            (7) The strategic alliance between Turkey and the United \n        States was cemented by--\n                    (A) the agreement of July 12, 1947 implementing the \n                Truman doctrine;\n                    (B) Turkey's membership in the North Atlantic \n                Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952; and\n                    (C) the United States-Turkey Agreement for \n                Cooperation on Defense and Economy of 1980.\n            (8) Turkey is also an important industrialized economy and \n        was a founding member of the Organization for Economic \n        Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations.\n            (9) Turkey has made significant progress since the 1980's \n        in liberalizing its economy and integrating with the global \n        economy.\n            (10) Turkey has joined other nations in advocating an open \n        trading system through its membership in the General Agreement \n        on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization.\n            (11) Despite the deep friendship between the United States \n        and Turkey, their trading relationship remains small.\n            (12) In 1998, United States merchandise exports to Turkey \n        reached $3,500,000,000.\n            (13) In 1998, United States imports from Turkey totaled \n        $2,500,000,000 or less than 0.3 percent of United States total \n        imports.\n            (14) A free trade agreement between the United States and \n        Turkey would greatly benefit both the United States and Turkey \n        by expanding their commercial ties.\n\nSEC. 3. NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES FOR A UNITED STATES-TURKEY FREE TRADE \n              AGREEMENT.\n\n    The overall trade negotiating objectives of the United States with \nrespect to a United States-Turkey Free Trade Agreement are to obtain--\n            (1) more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access \n        between the United States and Turkey; and\n            (2) the reduction or elimination of barriers and other \n        trade-distorting policies and practices that inhibit trade \n        between the United States and Turkey.\n\nSEC. 4.
