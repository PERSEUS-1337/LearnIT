A motion to \nreconsider the vote to resolve into the Committee of the Whole is not \nin order. Consideration of the bill in the Committee of the Whole may \nnot extend for a period in excess of 10 hours. When the Committee on \nthe Whole rises and reports the bill to the House, the previous \nquestion shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage \nwithout intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \nwithout instructions. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill \nis passed is not in order.\n    (c) Consideration in Senate.--(1)(A) A qualifying defense \nsupplemental appropriations bill shall be considered in the Senate in \naccordance with the provisions of this subsection.\n    (B) Such a bill received in the Senate from the House of \nRepresentatives shall be held at the desk in the Senate and may be \nconsidered in the Senate only in accordance with subsection (d).

A Member may make the motion only on the day after the calendar \nday on which the Member announces to the Senate the Member's intention \nto make the motion. The motion is privileged and is not debatable. The \nmotion is not subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a \nmotion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \nreconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to is \nnot in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the bill \nis agreed to, the Senate shall immediately proceed to consideration of \nthe bill without intervening motion, order, or other business, and the \nbill shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed \nof.\n    (4) Debate on the bill, and on all amendments thereto and debatable \nmotions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not \nmore than a total of 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between \nthose favoring and those opposing the bill.

No \namendment that is not germane to the provisions of the bill shall be \nreceived.\n    (6) A motion to further limit debate is not debatable. A motion to \nrecommit (except a motion to recommit with instructions to report back \nwithin a specified number of days, not to exceed three, not counting \nany day on which the Senate is not in session) is not in order. Debate \non any such motion to recommit shall be limited to one hour, to be \nequally divided between, and controlled by, the mover and the manager \nof the bill.\n    (7) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the bill \nand a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested \nin accordance with the rules of the Senate, the vote on advancing the \nbill to third reading shall occur.\n    (8) A motion to reconsider the vote by which third reading of the \nbill is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n    (9) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \napplication of the rules of the Senate to the procedure relating to a \nqualifying defense supplemental appropriations bill shall be decided \nwithout debate.\n    (d) Action in Senate on Measure From House.--If, upon the ordering \nof the third reading of a qualifying defense supplemental \nappropriations bill in the Senate the Senate has received from the \nHouse of Representatives a qualifying defense supplemental \nappropriations bill that is being held at the desk pursuant to \nsubsection (c)(1) or, if not, then upon the receipt from the House of \nRepresentatives of a qualifying defense supplemental appropriations \nbill, the following procedures shall apply:\n            (1) if the bill received from the House of Representatives \n        is identical to the bill as advanced to third reading by the \n        Senate, the vote on final passage shall be on the bill of the \n        House of Representatives; and\n            (2) if the bill received from the House is not identical to \n        the bill as advanced to third reading by the Senate--\n                    (A) the bill received from the House shall be \n                considered as amended with the text and title (if \n                different) of the bill of the Senate;\n                    (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the bill \n                of the House of Representatives as so amended; and\n                    (C) a motion shall be in order to insist on the \n                amendment or amendments of the Senate and to request a \n                conference with the House of Representatives on the \n                disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.\n    (e) Action in House on Request for Conference from the Senate.--\nUpon receiving from the Senate a message that the Senate has passed \nwith an amendment or amendments a qualifying defense supplemental \nappropriations bill and that the Senate insists upon its amendment or \namendments and requests a conference of the two Houses on the \ndisagreeing votes thereon, the House of Representatives shall be \nconsidered to have disagreed to the amendment or amendments of the \nSenate and agreed to the conference requested by the Senate.\n    (f) Limitation Pending Conclusion of Conference.--After a \nconference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on a qualifying \ndefense supplemental appropriations bill has been agreed to under \nsubsection (e), it shall not be in order in the Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives to consider a motion to adjourn that House for a period \nof more than three days until the committee of conference has filed its \nreport.\n    (g) Senate Action on Conference Reports, etc.--(1) A motion in the \nSenate to proceed to the consideration of a conference report on a \nqualifying defense supplemental appropriations bill may be made even \nthough a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to.\n    (2) During the consideration in the Senate of the conference report \n(or a message from the House) on qualifying defense supplemental \nappropriations bill, and all amendments in disagreement, and all \namendments thereto, and debatable motions and appeals in connection \ntherewith, debate shall be limited to five hours, to be equally divided \nbetween, and controlled by, the majority leader and minority leader or \ntheir designees.
