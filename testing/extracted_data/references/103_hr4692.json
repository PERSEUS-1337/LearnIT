CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the rise of American industry in the late 19th and \n        early 20th century led to tremendous growth in the Appalachian \n        coal fields, creating an area of national historic significance \n        in terms of its contributions to American industry, \n        architecture, culture, and diversity;\n            (2) within the Appalachian coal belt, the area surrounding \n        and including Pocahontas, Virginia, has a particularly rich \n        history because the Pocahontas mine produced some of the \n        Nation's purest and most sought-after coal and now serves as an \n        invaluable historical and educational resource;\n            (3) to accommodate the growing population in the area, the \n        coal mining companies built the town of Pocahontas, one of the \n        oldest and most important company towns in America's coal \n        region;\n            (4) the town of Pocahontas is blessed with a rich \n        architectural heritage that testifies to American cultural \n        ability;\n            (5) this heritage is unique and must be preserved;\n            (6) the influx of labor needed to support the Pocahontas \n        mine created a unique cultural convergence, bringing together \n        Americans from northern mining areas, African-Americans from \n        the South, recent immigrants from Southern and Southeastern \n        Europe, and native Appalachians into a diverse yet integrated \n        community that represents the distinctive American heritage;\n            (7) it is in the national interest to preserve and protect \n        physical remnants of the late 19th and early 20th century rise \n        of American industry for the education and benefit of present \n        and future generations; and\n            (8) there is a need to provide assistance for the \n        preservation and promotion of the vestiges of the coal heritage \n        of Appalachia that have outstanding cultural, historic, and \n        architectural value.\n\nSEC. 3.
