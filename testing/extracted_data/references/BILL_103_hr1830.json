FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the lack of environmental pollution controls in foreign \n        countries provides a huge cost savings for foreign \n        manufacturers and agricultural producers, which provide them \n        with an unfair competitive advantage in the global marketplace;\n            (2) air and water pollution, including pollution of the \n        oceans, by foreign countries is a direct threat to United \n        States citizens and undermines United States environmental \n        efforts;\n            (3) the United States is the largest export market for the \n        worst international polluters; and\n            (4) a Global Cleanup Fund that takes a portion of the \n        foreign assistance funds allocated to each foreign country with \n        pollution control standards less stringent than those of the \n        United States and uses those funds to make loans to that \n        country in order to finance the purchase of pollution control \n        equipment and services from the United States--\n                    (A) would not impose additional costs on United \n                States taxpayers,\n                    (B) would result in increased employment in the \n                United States, and\n                    (C) would promote international environmental \n                efforts by establishing environmental responsibility as \n                a clear United States foreign policy priority.\n\nSEC. 3. ANNUAL COUNTRY REPORTS ON POLLUTION PREVENTION PRACTICES.\n\n    (a) Requirement for Reports.--The Secretary of State shall prepare \na detailed annual report regarding the environmental protection \nrequirements of each foreign country with respect to air quality, water \nquality, and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes. For each foreign \ncountry, each such report shall--\n            (1) describe the air quality, water quality, and hazardous \n        and solid waste disposal conditions in that country;\n            (2) describe the laws, policies, and practices of the \n        government of that country with respect to air quality, water \n        quality, and hazardous and solid waste disposal; and\n            (3) include a determination by the Secretary of State, made \n        after consultation with Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency, of whether those laws, policies, and \n        practices are adequately enforced to protect the local \n        environment from damaging industrial practices.\n    (b) Use of Reports.--Not later than January 31 each year, the \nSecretary of State shall submit a copy of the report required by \nsubsection (a) to--\n            (1) the Congress;\n            (2) the United States Trade Representative, who shall \n        consider the information and determinations contained in such \n        report in carrying out trade negotiations; and\n            (3) the head of each agency of the United States Government \n        that is involved in foreign assistance programs, who shall \n        consider the information and determinations contained in such \n        report in determining which countries will receive foreign \n        assistance.\n\nSEC. 4. GLOBAL CLEANUP FUND.\n\n    (a) Countries to Which Section Applies.--This section applies with \nrespect to any country for which United States foreign assistance funds \nare allocated for a fiscal year unless the Secretary of State, after \nconsultation with Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, \ndetermines that that country, through its laws, policies, and \npractices, assures compliance with pollution control standards with \nrespect to air quality, water quality, and disposal of hazardous and \nsolid wastes and promotes the protection of the local environment from \ndamaging industrial practices.\n    (b) Use of Foreign Assistance Funds To Finance the Acquisition of \nUnited States Environmental Protection Goods and Services.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the President shall use 20 \npercent of the aggregate amount of foreign assistance funds allocated \neach fiscal year for a country described in subsection (a)--\n            (1) to make loans to the government of that country, on \n        such terms and conditions as the President determines, to \n        enable it to purchase United States pollution control products \n        and services; and\n            (2) for administrative expenses in carrying out this \n        section.\n    (c) Annual Report to Congress.--Each year, the President shall \nsubmit to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate \na report with respect to implementation of this section during the \npreceding fiscal year. Each such report--\n            (1) shall set forth the amount made available for loans to \n        each country under this section;\n            (2) shall describe the loans made;\n            (3) shall describe the use of United States pollution \n        control products and services purchased by each such country as \n        a result of loans; and\n            (4) shall describe the status of pollution control efforts \n        in each such country.\n\nSEC. 5. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION LOANS TO COUNTRIES THAT DO \n              NOT ENFORCE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS TO PROTECT LOCAL \n              ENVIRONMENTS FROM DAMAGING INDUSTRIAL PRACTICES.\n\n    (a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States \nExecutive Director of each international financial institution to use \nthe voice and vote of the United States to oppose any proposed lending \nby that institution unless the Secretary of State, after consultation \nwith the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, \ndetermines that--\n            (1) the borrowing country, through its laws, policies, and \n        practices, adequately and constructively assures compliance \n        with pollution control standards with respect to air quality, \n        water quality, and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes that \n        will protect local environments from damaging industrial \n        practices; or\n            (2) the lending will support an industrial project or \n        program that--\n                    (A) has the potential to adversely affect air \n                quality or water quality or will involve hazardous or \n                solid wastes, but\n                    (B) is designed to protect the local environment \n                from damaging industrial practices.\n\nSEC. 6.
