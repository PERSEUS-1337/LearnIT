FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The population of individuals age 65 or older in the \n        United States is growing and is estimated to reach \\1/5\\ of the \n        total population of the United States by the year 2030.\n            (2) According to a 2011 report by the Government \n        Accountability Office, during a recent year, 1 out of every 7 \n        older individuals living in a home or community-based setting \n        experienced some form of elder abuse.\n            (3) According to a report by the Bureau of Justice \n        Statistics, ``Criminal Victimization in the United States, \n        2008'', 54 percent of crimes involving victims age 65 or older \n        are unreported.\n            (4) The Crime Victims Fund, which was established to \n        support victims of crime--\n                    (A) is funded by the proceeds of forfeited bonds, \n                criminal penalty assessments, and fines collected from \n                persons convicted of offenses against the United \n                States; and\n                    (B) does not receive funds from taxpayers in the \n                United States.\n            (5) No amounts are specifically allocated from the Crime \n        Victims Fund to individuals age 65 or older who experience \n        victimization in the form of abuse, neglect, or exploitation.\n            (6) The Government Accountability Office estimates that \n        elder abuse investigations by Adult Protect Services in 33 \n        States may increase by 28 percent by the year 2020.\n            (7) The Federal Government and State governments use \n        varying definitions of the term ``elder abuse''. The definition \n        of ``elder abuse'' used by a State government is recognized as \n        the primary definition to ensure consistent administration of \n        existing and future elder abuse programs by the State.\n\nSEC. 3.
