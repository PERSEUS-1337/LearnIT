FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States and foreign countries will continue \n        to demand increasing quantities of energy into the foreseeable \n        future in order to support economic growth;\n            (2) nuclear power provides energy without generating \n        significant quantities of greenhouse gases;\n            (3) the growth of nuclear power in the United States and \n        many foreign countries has faced barriers from concerns related \n        to--\n                    (A) the proliferation of weapons-useable material; \n                and\n                    (B) the proper disposal of spent nuclear fuel;\n            (4) nuclear power plants operating on an advanced thorium \n        fuel cycle to generate nuclear energy--\n                    (A) would not produce weapons-useable material in \n                spent fuel; and\n                    (B) would produce less long-term waste as compared \n                to other nuclear power plants;\n            (5) thorium fuel cycle technology was originally developed \n        and proven in the United States;\n            (6) the United States possesses significant domestic \n        quantities of thorium in accessible high-grade deposits;\n            (7) cutting-edge research relating to thorium fuel cycle \n        technology continues to be carried out by entities in the \n        United States; and\n            (8) it is in the national security and foreign policy \n        interest of the United States that foreign countries seeking to \n        establish or expand generation and use of nuclear power should \n        be provided--\n                    (A) access to advanced thorium fuel cycle \n                technology;\n                    (B) incentives to explore the thorium-based fuel \n                cycle as a means to reduce the risk of nuclear \n                proliferation; and\n                    (C) access to a secure domestic supply of thorium.\n\nSEC. 3.
