FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Alcohol is by far the drug most widely used and abused \n        by young people in the United States today, even though it is \n        illegal for youths under the age of 21 to purchase alcohol in \n        all 50 of the States and the District of Columbia.\n            (2) According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \n        and Alcoholism, an estimated 18,000,000 persons in the United \n        States who are 18 or older currently experience problems as a \n        result of alcohol use. An estimated 4,500,000 young people are \n        dependent on alcohol or are problem drinkers.\n            (3) According to the 1995 National Institute on Drug Abuse \n        survey of high school students and young adults (entitled \n        ``Monitoring the Future''), 80 percent of high school seniors, \n        71 percent of tenth graders, and 56 percent of eighth graders \n        had used alcohol at least once. Twenty-eight percent of high \n        school seniors, 24 percent of tenth graders, and 15 percent of \n        eighth graders had experienced a ``binge'' of 5 or more drinks \n        in a row within the past 2 weeks. Among college students, 88 \n        percent reported having used alcohol and 40 percent reported \n        occasions of binge drinking, including 31 percent of the \n        females and 52 percent of the males.\n            (4) The average age at which young people begin drinking is \n        13. By age 13, approximately 30 percent of boys and 22 percent \n        of girls classify themselves as drinkers. According to the 1995 \n        ``Monitoring the Future'' survey, 14 percent of high school \n        seniors reported having been drunk by eighth grade, 30 percent \n        by ninth grade, 43 percent by tenth grade, and 60 percent by \n        twelfth grade. Studies demonstrate that the use of alcohol \n        before the age of 15 appears to be one of the predictors of \n        later heavy alcohol and other drug use.\n            (5) According to a national survey on youth and alcohol \n        (Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, 1991), the average binge drinker is a 16 year-old \n        male in the tenth grade who was 12 years old when he took his \n        first drink.\n            (6) Young people are not well informed about the hazards of \n        alcohol use. More than one quarter of high school seniors do \n        not view taking one or two drinks nearly every day as entailing \n        great risk. Approximately 45 percent of eighth graders, 47 \n        percent of tenth graders, and 53 percent of twelfth graders do \n        not perceive having 5 or more drinks once or twice a weekend as \n        entailing a great risk (1995 ``Monitoring the Future'' survey). \n        More than 2.6 million students do not know a person can die \n        from an overdose of alcohol. A projected 259,000 students think \n        that wine coolers or beer cannot get a person drunk, make a \n        person sick, or do as much harm as other alcoholic beverages \n        (Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, 1991).\n            (7) According to Healthy People 2000, the National Health \n        Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives--\n                    (A) nearly one-half of all deaths from motor \n                vehicle crashes are alcohol-related;\n                    (B) alcohol is implicated in nearly one-half of all \n                fatal intentional injuries such as suicides and \n                homicides; and\n                    (C) victims are intoxicated in approximately one-\n                third of all homicides, drownings, and boating deaths.\n            (8) An estimated 25 percent of all hospitalized persons \n        have alcohol-related problems.\n            (9) Alcohol in combination with other drugs is the leading \n        cause of emergency room drug abuse episodes.\n            (10) In 1995, chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, \n        was the 11th leading cause of death in the United States. Of \n        41,000 deaths attributed to liver disease in the United States, \n        46 percent diagnostically were associated with alcohol. Heavy \n        alcohol use is considered the most important risk factor for \nchronic liver disease. Even among liver disease deaths not coded as \nalcohol-related, approximately 50 percent are thought to be due to \nalcohol use.\n            (11) Between 5 and 24 percent of hypertension cases are \n        associated with alcohol. Many cases diagnosed as essential \n        hypertension (high blood pressure having no known causes) may \n        actually have chronic alcohol ingestion as their cause.\n            (12) Alcohol abuse is strongly associated with increased \n        risk of cancer, especially cancer of the liver, esophagus, \n        nasopharynx, and larynx. Alcohol is also associated with \n        dietary deficiency that may increase cancer risk.\n            (13) Treatment costs for fetal alcohol syndrome (referred \n        to in this paragraph as ``FAS'') and other alcohol-related \n        birth defects in the United States are estimated at nearly a \n        third of a billion dollars. FAS is one of the top 3 known \n        causes of birth defects with accompanying mental retardation \n        and the only known preventable cause among the top three. Among \n        children born to women who drink heavily, the incidence of FAS \n        may be as high as 25 per 1,000 live births. Among children born \n        to other women, the FAS incidence is between 1 to 3 infants \n        with the syndrome per 1,000 live births. The incidence of other \n        alcohol-related birth defects is estimated to be 3 times \n        greater than that of FAS.\n            (14) The alcoholic-beverage industry spends approximately \n        $2,000,000,000 each year on advertising and promotions in the \n        United States.\n            (15) Alcohol advertising, especially in the broadcast \n        media, represents the single greatest source of alcohol \n        education for persons in the United States. According to a 1990 \n        study of 10 to 13 year- olds, funded by the American Automobile \n        Association Foundation for Traffic Safety, there is a \n        relationship between exposure and attention by an individual to \n        beer advertising and expectations that the individual drink as \n        an adult.\n            (16) A major 1981 federally funded study found a \n        significant relationship between--\n                    (A) exposure of individuals to alcoholic-beverage \n                advertising as youth; and\n                    (B) drinking behaviors and attitudes of the \n                individuals that can lead to certain forms of problem \n                drinking.\n            (17) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, sponsorships and promotions on college campuses by \n        alcohol producers and the use of celebrities and youth-oriented \n        musical groups in advertising create a pro-drinking \n        environment.\n            (18) Over 80 percent of 2,000 adults surveyed in 1988 for \n        the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms by the Opinion \n        Research Corporation believe that alcohol advertising \n        influences underage youth to drink alcoholic beverages. The \n        survey also found that the general public feels that the young \n        people of the United States constitute the group that is most \n        at risk from drinking alcoholic beverages.\n            (19) The 1988 Surgeon General's Workshop on Drunk Driving \n        has recommended--\n                    (A) that the level of alcoholic-beverage \n                advertising be matched with an equal number of pro-\n                health and pro-safety messages; and\n                    (B) the inclusion of health warning messages in all \n                alcohol advertising.\n            (20) The National Commission on Drug-Free Schools' \n        September 1990 Final Report, ``Toward a Drug-Free Generation: A \n        Nation's Responsibility'' recommends that Congress--\n                    (A) require additional health and safety messages \n                on all alcohol products and advertising for the \n                products; and\n                    (B) consider enacting a ban on advertising and \n                promotion of alcohol if alcohol advertising still \n                targets youth and glamorizes alcohol use two years \n                following the publication of the report.\n                    (21) Over two-thirds of persons surveyed in a 1989 \n                Wall Street Journal poll favor requiring warnings about \n                the dangers of drinking both on alcoholic-beverage \n                containers and in alcohol advertisements. Nearly three-\n                fourths of persons surveyed in a 1990 Gallup Poll favor \n                requiring health warning messages in alcohol \n                advertising.\n\nSEC. 3.
