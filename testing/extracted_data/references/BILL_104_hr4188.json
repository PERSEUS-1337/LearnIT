FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) there are insufficient water supplies available to \n        residents of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, and \n        the water systems that are available do not meet minimum health \n        and safety standards, thereby posing a threat to public health \n        and safety;\n            (2) the United States has a trust responsibility to ensure \n        that adequate and safe water supplies are available to meet the \n        economic, environmental, water supply, and public health needs \n        of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation; and\n            (3) the best available, reliable, and safe rural and \n        municipal water supply to serve the needs of the Fort Peck \n        Indian Reservation is the Missouri River.\n    (b) Purpose.--The Congress declares that the purposes of sections 1 \nthrough 7 are to ensure a safe and adequate municipal, rural, and \nindustrial water supply for the residents of the Fort Peck Indian \nReservation in Montana;\n\nSEC. 3. FORT PECK RESERVATION RURAL WATER SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--The Secretary of the Interior (hereafter \nreferred to as the ``Secretary'') is authorized and directed to plan, \ndesign, construct, operate, maintain, and replace a municipal, rural \nand industrial water system, to be known as the Fort Peck Reservation \nRural Water System, as generally described in the report entitled \nTechnical Report for the Fort Peck Reservation Rural Water System and \ndated July, 1995.
