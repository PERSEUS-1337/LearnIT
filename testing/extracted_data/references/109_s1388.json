SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory \nFlexibility Reform Act of 2005''.\n    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Clarification and expansion of rules covered by the Regulatory \n                            Flexibility Act.\nSec. 4. Requirements providing for more detailed analyses.\nSec. 5. Periodic review of rules.\nSec. 6. Clerical amendments.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n        to creating jobs in a dynamic economy.\n            (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n        entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n        other small entities, even though the problems sought to be \n        solved by such regulations are not always caused by these small \n        businesses and other small entities.\n            (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n        in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n        small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n        demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs.\n            (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n        recognize and take account of the differences in the scale and \n        resources of regulated entities, but have failed to do so.\n            (5) Alternative regulatory approaches that do not conflict \n        with the stated objectives of the statutes the regulations seek \n        to implement may be available and may minimize the significant \n        economic impact of regulations on small businesses and other \n        small entities.\n            (6) Federal agencies have failed to analyze and uncover \n        less-costly alternative regulatory approaches, despite the fact \n        that the chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \n        known as the Regulatory Flexibility Act), requires them to do \n        so.\n            (7) Federal agencies continue to interpret chapter 6 of \n        title 5, United States Code, in a manner that permits them to \n        avoid their analytical responsibilities.\n            (8) The existing oversight of the compliance of Federal \n        agencies with the analytical requirements to assess regulatory \n        impacts on small businesses and other small entities and obtain \n        input from the Chief Counsel for Advocacy has not sufficiently \n        modified the Federal agency regulatory culture.\n            (9) Significant changes are needed in the methods by which \n        Federal agencies develop and analyze regulations, receive input \n        from affected entities, and develop regulatory alternatives \n        that will lessen the burden or maximize the benefits of final \n        rules to small businesses and other small entities.\n            (10) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n        title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n        including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n        rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking process \n        and that the agencies assess a full range of alternatives that \n        will limit adverse economic consequences or enhance economic \n        benefits.\n            (11) Federal agencies should be capable of assessing the \n        impact of proposed and final rules without delaying the \n        regulatory process or impinging on the ability of Federal \n        agencies to fulfill their statutory mandates.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION AND EXPANSION OF RULES COVERED BY THE REGULATORY \n              FLEXIBILITY ACT.\n\n    Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at \nthe end the following:\n            ``(9) Economic impact.--The term `economic impact' means, \n        with respect to a proposed or final rule--\n                    ``(A) any direct economic effect on small entities \n                of such rule; and\n                    ``(B) any indirect economic effect on small \n                entities which is reasonably foreseeable and results \n                from such rule (without regard to whether small \n                entities will be directly regulated by the rule).''.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS PROVIDING FOR MORE DETAILED ANALYSES.\n\n    (a) Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.--Section 603 of title \n5, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:\n    ``(b) Each initial regulatory flexibility analysis required under \nthis section shall contain a detailed statement--\n            ``(1) describing the reasons why action by the agency is \n        being considered;\n            ``(2) describing the objectives of, and legal basis for, \n        the proposed rule;\n            ``(3) estimating the number and type of small entities to \n        which the proposed rule will apply;\n            ``(4) describing the projected reporting, recordkeeping, \n        and other compliance requirements of the proposed rule, \n        including an estimate of the classes of small entities which \n        will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional \n        skills necessary for preparation of the report and record;\n            ``(5) describing all relevant Federal rules which may \n        duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule, or the \n        reasons why such a description could not be provided; and\n            ``(6) estimating the additional cumulative economic impact \n        of the proposed rule on small entities beyond that already \n        imposed on the class of small entities by the agency or why \n        such an estimate is not available.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) An agency shall notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the \nSmall Business Administration of any draft rules that may have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities \neither--\n            ``(1) when the agency submits a draft rule to the Office of \n        Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management \n        and Budget under Executive Order 12866, if that order requires \n        such submission; or\n            ``(2) if no submission to the Office of Information and \n        Regulatory Affairs is so required, at a reasonable time prior \n        to publication of the rule by the agency.''.\n    (b) Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 604(a) of title 5, United States \n        Code, is amended--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``succinct'';\n                    (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``summary'' each \n                place it appears and inserting ``statement'';\n                    (C) in paragraph (3), by--\n                            (i) striking ``an explanation'' and \n                        inserting ``a detailed explanation'';

Such determination shall be made without regard to \nwhether the agency performed an analysis under section 604. The purpose \nof the review shall be to determine whether such rules should be \ncontinued without change, or should be amended or rescinded, consistent \nwith the stated objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize any \nsignificant adverse economic impacts on a substantial number of small \nentities. Such plan may be amended by the agency at any time by \npublishing the revision in the Federal Register and subsequently \nplacing the amended plan on the agency's Web site.\n    ``(b) The plan shall provide for the review of all such agency \nrules existing on the date of the enactment of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Reform Act of 2005 within 10 years after the date of \npublication of the plan in the Federal Register and every 10 years \nthereafter and for review of rules adopted after the date of enactment \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Reform Act of 2005 within 10 years after \nthe publication of the final rule in the Federal Register and every 10 \nyears thereafter.
