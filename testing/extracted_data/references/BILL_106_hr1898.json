FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) While our Nation's schools are still relatively safe, \n        it is imperative that schools be provided with adequate \n        resources to prevent incidents of violence.\n            (2) Approximately 10 percent of all public schools reported \n        at least 1 serious violent crime to a law enforcement agency \n        over the course of the 1996-1997 school year.\n            (3) In 1996, approximately 225,000 students between the \n        ages of 12 and 18 were victims of nonfatal violent crime in \n        schools in the United States.\n            (4) From 1992 through 1994, 76 students and 29 non-students \n        were victims of murders or suicides that were committed in \n        schools in the United States.\n            (5) The school violence incidents in several States across \n        the Nation in 1998 and 1999 caused enormous damage to schools, \n        families, and whole communities.\n            (6) Because of escalating school violence, the children of \n        the United States are increasingly afraid that they will be \n        attacked or harmed at school.\n            (7) A report issued by the Department of Education in \n        August, 1998, entitled ``Early Warning, Early Response'' \n        concluded that the reduction and prevention of school violence \n        is best achieved through safety plans which involve the entire \n        community, policies which emphasize both prevention and \n        intervention, training school personnel, parents, students, and \n        community members to recognize the early warning signs of \n        potential violent behavior and to share their concerns or \n        observations with trained personnel, establishing procedures \n        which allow rapid response and intervention when early warning \n        signs of violent behavior are identified, and providing \n        adequate support and access to services for troubled students.\n\nSEC. 3.
