Such funds shall be considered a \nnonreimbursable Federal expenditure.\n    (2) The authority of the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of \nReclamation, under this or any other provision of law to implement \ncapital projects for the Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered \nFish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin shall expire in fiscal \nyear 2005 unless reauthorized by an Act of Congress.\n    (3) The authority of the Secretary to implement the capital \nprojects for the San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program \nshall expire in fiscal year 2007 unless reauthorized by an Act of \nCongress.\n    (b) Cost of Capital Projects.--The total costs of the capital \nprojects undertaken for the Recovery Implementation Programs receiving \nassistance under this Act shall not exceed $100,000,000 of which--\n            (1) costs shall not exceed $82,000,000 for the Recovery \n        Implementation Program for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper \n        Colorado River Basin through fiscal year 2005; and\n            (2) costs shall not exceed $18,000,000 for the San Juan \n        River Recovery Implementation Program through fiscal year 2007.\nThe amounts set forth in this subsection shall be adjusted by the \nSecretary for inflation in each fiscal year beginning after the \nenactment of this Act.\n    (c) Non-Federal Contributions to Capital Projects.--(1) The \nSecretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, may accept \ncontributed funds from the Upper Division States, or political \nsubdivisions or organizations with the Upper Division States, pursuant \nto  agreements that provide for the contributions to be used for \ncapital projects costs. Such funds may be expended as if appropriated \nfor such purposes. Such non-Federal contributions shall not exceed \n$17,000,000.\n    (2) In addition to the contribution described in paragraph (1), the \nSecretary of Energy, acting through the Western Area Power \nAdministration, and the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \nBureau of Reclamation, may utilize power revenues collected pursuant to \nthe Colorado River Storage Project Act to carry out the purposes of \nsection 3(c) of this Act. Such funds shall be treated as reimbursable \ncosts assigned to power for repayment under section 5 of the Colorado \nRiver Storage Project Act. This additional contribution shall not \nexceed $17,000,000. Such funds shall be considered a non-Federal \ncontribution for the purposes of this Act.\n    (3) The additional funding provided pursuant to paragraph (2) may \nbe provided through loans from the Colorado Water Conservation Board \nConstruction Fund (37-60-121 C.R.S.) to the Western Area Power \nAdministration in lieu of funds which would otherwise be collected from \npower revenues and used for storage project repayments.

For the San Juan River Recovery Implementation Program, such \ncontributions shall not exceed $2,000,000 per year. The Secretary shall \nadjust such amounts for inflation in fiscal years commencing after the \nenactment of this Act. The utilization of power revenues for annual \nbase funding shall cease after the fiscal year 2011, unless \nreauthorized by Congress; except that power revenues may continue to be \nutilized to fund the operation and maintenance of capital projects and \nmonitoring. No later than the end of fiscal year 2008, the Secretary \nshall submit a report on the utilization of power revenues to the \nappropriate Committees of the United States Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. The Secretary shall also make a recommendation in such \nreport regarding the need for continued funding after fiscal year 2011 \nthat may be required to fulfill the goals of the Recovery \nImplementation Programs. The Western Area Power Administration and the \nBureau of Reclamation shall maintain sufficient revenues in the \nColorado River Basin Fund to meet their obligation to provide base \nfunding in accordance with this provision. If the Western Area Power \nAdministration and the Bureau of Reclamation determine that the funds \nin the Colorado River Basin Fund will not be sufficient to meet the \nobligations of section 5(c)(1) of the Colorado River Storage Project \nAct for a 3-year period, the Western Area Power Administration and the \nBureau of Reclamation shall request appropriations to meet base funding \nobligations. Nothing in this Act shall otherwise modify or amend \nexisting agreements among participants regarding base funding and \ndepletion charges for the Recovery Implementation Programs.\n    (e) Authority To Retain Appropriated Funds.--At the end of each \nfiscal year any unexpended appropriated funds for capital projects \nunder this Act shall be retained for use in future fiscal years. \nUnexpended funds under this Act that are carried over shall continue to \nbe used to implement the capital projects needed for the Recovery \nImplementation Programs.\n    (f) Additional Authority.--The Secretary may enter into agreements \nand contracts with Federal and non-Federal entities, acquire and \ntransfer interests in land, water, and facilities, and accept or give \ngrants in order to carry out the purposes of this Act.\n    (g) Indian Trust Assets.--The Congress finds that much of the \npotential water development in the San Juan River Basin is for the \nbenefit of Indian tribes and most of the federally designated critical \nhabitat for the endangered fish species in the Basin is on Indian trust \nlands. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict the \nSecretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, from funding activities or capital projects in \naccordance with the Federal Government's Indian trust responsibility.\n\nSEC. 4.
