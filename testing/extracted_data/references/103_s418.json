FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Airbus Industrie is a multinational consortium of 4 \n        aircraft manufacturers organized to develop, produce, and sell \n        large civil aircraft.\n            (2) Airbus Industrie's shareholders are Aerospatiale of \n        France, British Aerospace of the United Kingdom, Deutsche \n        Aerospace of the Federal Republic of Germany, and \n        Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.\n            (3) The governments of the countries of the Airbus \n        Industrie member companies have signed agreements guaranteeing \n        political and financial support for Airbus Industrie's aircraft \n        programs.\n            (4) The United States Department of Commerce has \n        commissioned an analysis of the various Airbus Industrie \n        aircraft programs in order to advise the United States \n        Government regarding the economic performance of Airbus \n        Industrie programs, to document the past levels of government \n        support provided to the Airbus Industrie member companies by \n        their respective governments, to assess the financial viability \n        of Airbus Industrie aircraft programs to determine whether such \n        programs could have been undertaken by a commercial entity, and \n        to examine the effects of Airbus Industrie on the United States \n        aircraft, aircraft engine, and avionics manufacturing \n        industries.\n            (5) The Department of Commerce analysis concluded that--\n                    (A) the governments of France, the Federal Republic \n                of Germany, and the United Kingdom provided \n                $8,200,000,000 to support Airbus Industrie member \n                companies through 1989,\n                    (B) another $2,300,000,000 in government support \n                had been pledged as of 1989 for the Airbus A330/A340 \n                program,\n                    (C) the government of the Federal Republic of \n                Germany committed $3,000,000,000 to Deutsche Aerospace \n                as part of the merger between Daimler-Benz and MBB, the \n                parent company of Deutsche Aerospace,\n                    (D) the total government funds committed to Airbus \n                Industrie would be valued at $25,900,000,000, if Airbus \n                Industrie were required to pay commercial rates for the \n                government support it received through 1989,\n                    (E) the governments of the countries of the Airbus \n                Industrie member companies have provided almost 75 \n                percent of the development funds for the various Airbus \n                Industrie aircraft,\n                    (F) the financial analysis of Airbus Industrie \n                indicates that there is little likelihood that this \n                government support will be repaid in full,\n                    (G) Airbus Industrie programs, taken individually \n                or as a group, have not been and will not become \n                commercially viable in the foreseeable future; all \n                programs have a negative net present value when the \n                cash flows are discounted at the average commercial \n                borrowing rate in Europe,\n                    (H) if Airbus Industrie continues to sell its \n                aircraft at subsidized prices, United States aircraft \n                manufactures will lose market share even while being \n                pressured to lower their own prices,\n                    (I) as a consequence, both current and expected \n                profits for United States aircraft manufacturers will \n                decline due to continued government support for Airbus \n                Industrie programs,\n                    (J) reduced profits on current United States \n                aircraft programs have significant impacts because \n                United States aircraft manufacturers have traditionally \n                relied heavily upon internally generated funds to make \n                the necessary multibillion dollar investments in new \n                aircraft programs, and\n                    (K) lower than expected profits on existing United \n                States aircraft programs may discourage the \n                introduction of new, advanced-technology United States \n                aircraft at the same time that Airbus Industrie is \n                introducing advanced technology models.\n            (6) Airbus Industrie's worldwide market share of jet \n        aircraft orders has increased from 7 percent in 1980 to 28 \n        percent in 1992, while the worldwide market share for United \n        States aircraft manufacturers has declined from 88 percent in \n        1980 to 63 percent in 1992.\n            (7) Airbus Industrie's market share of United States jet \n        aircraft orders has increased from zero percent in 1980 to 44 \n        percent in 1992, while the United States market share for \n        United States aircraft has declined from 100 percent in 1980 to \n        56 percent in 1992.\n            (8) United States imports of Airbus Industrie large civil \n        aircraft have increased from $133,000,000 in 1981 to \n        $844,000,000 in the first 3 quarters (January-September) of \n        1992.\n            (9) Employment in the United States civil aircraft \n        manufacturing industry has declined from approximately 326,000 \n        positions in 1989, to an estimated 266,000 positions in 1993.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to initiate a \ncountervailing duty investigation with respect to large civil aircraft \nproduced by Airbus Industrie.\n\nSEC. 3.
