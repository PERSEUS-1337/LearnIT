REALLOCATION AND AUCTION OF 1755-1780 MHZ BAND.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding paragraph (15)(A) of section \n309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), not later \nthan 3 years after the date of the enactment of the Middle Class Tax \nRelief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-96), the Commission \nshall--\n            (1) reallocate the electromagnetic spectrum described in \n        subsection (d) for commercial use; and\n            (2) as part of the system of competitive bidding required \n        by section 6401(b)(1)(B) of such Act (47 U.S.C. 1451(b)(1)(B)), \n        grant new initial licenses, subject to flexible-use service \n        rules, for the use of such spectrum, paired with the spectrum \n        between the frequencies from 2155 megahertz to 2180 megahertz, \n        inclusive.\n    (b) Auction Proceeds.--For purposes of depositing the proceeds from \nthe competitive bidding described in subsection (a)(2) that are \nattributable to the electromagnetic spectrum described in subsection \n(d), such spectrum shall be treated as spectrum that is required to be \nauctioned by section 6401(b)(1)(B) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and \nJob Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. 1451(b)(1)(B)).\n    (c) Relocation of and Sharing by Federal Government Stations.--\n            (1) Relocation prioritized over sharing.--\n                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph \n                (2), all Federal Government stations in the \n                electromagnetic spectrum described in subsection (d) \n                shall be relocated to other frequencies under the \n                procedures implemented pursuant to section 113(g)(6) of \n                the National Telecommunications and Information \n                Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(6)). \n                Such relocation procedures shall ensure maximum \n                cooperation and coordination between the affected \n                Federal and commercial entities.\n                    (B) Department of defense stations.--Section \n                1062(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n                Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65;
