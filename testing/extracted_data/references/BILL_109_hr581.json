COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION.\n\n    The provisions of section 2 do not apply to a request by a Federal \nentity for any testimony or document that consists of only commercial \nor financial information unrelated to newsgathering or news and \ninformation dissemination by a covered person.\n\nSEC. 4. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE PROHIBITED.\n\n     Notwithstanding any provision of section 2, in any proceeding or \nin connection with any issue arising under Federal law, no Federal \nentity may compel a covered person to disclose--\n            (1) the identity of a source of information--\n                    (A) from whom the covered person obtained \n                information; and\n                    (B) who the covered person believes to be a \n                confidential source; or\n            (2) any information that could reasonably be expected to \n        lead to the discovery of the identity of such a source.\n\nSEC. 5. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM THIRD PARTIES.\n\n    (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--The provisions of \nsections 2, 3, and 4 shall apply to any testimony or document that a \nFederal entity seeks from a third party if such testimony or document \nconsists of any record, information, or other communication that \nrelates to a business transaction between such third party and a \ncovered person. Such record, information, or other communication \nincludes any telephone record or other record held by a \ntelecommunications service provider, Internet service provider, or \noperator of an interactive computer service for a business purpose.\n    (b) Notice and Opportunity Provided to Covered Persons.--A court \nmay compel the testimony or disclosure of a document under this section \nonly after the party seeking such a document provides the covered \nperson who is a party to the business transaction described in \nsubsection (a)--\n            (1) notice of the subpoena or other compulsory request for \n        such testimony or disclosure from the third party not later \n        than the time at which such subpoena or request is issued to \n        the third party; and\n            (2) an opportunity to be heard before the court before the \n        time at which the testimony or disclosure is compelled.\n    (c) Exception to Notice Requirement.--Notice under subsection \n(b)(1) may be delayed only if the court determines by clear and \nconvincing evidence that such notice would pose a substantial threat to \nthe integrity of a criminal investigation.\n\nSEC. 6. ACTIVITIES NOT CONSTITUTING A WAIVER.\n\n    The publication or dissemination of any testimony or document (or \nportion of such testimony or document) sought under section 2 shall not \nwaive the requirements of such section.
