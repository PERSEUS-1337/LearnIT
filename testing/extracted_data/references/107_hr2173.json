    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmacy Education Aid Act of \n2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Pharmacists are an important link in our Nation's \n        health care system. A critical shortage of pharmacists is \n        threatening the ability of community pharmacies to continue to \n        provide important prescription related services.\n            (2) The Institute of Medicine (``IOM'') prepared a landmark \n        report on medical errors, including medication errors. In the \n        report, entitled ``To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health \n        System'', IOM indicated that medication errors can be partially \n        attributed to factors such as staff shortages; having too many \n        customers places great pressure on available staff, leading to \n        a lack of concentration.\n            (3) In section 5 of Public Law 106-129, the Congress \n        acknowledged a growing demand for pharmacists by requiring the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to \n        determine whether there is a shortage of pharmacists in the \n        United States and, if so, to what extent.\n            (4) The study required by Public Law 106-129 was conducted \n        by the Health Resources and Services Administration (``HRSA''). \n        The report from the study was submitted to the Congress in \n        December 2000, and is entitled ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A \n        Study in Supply and Demand for Pharmacists''.\n            (5) The findings described in the HRSA report include the \n        following:\n                    (A) ``While the overall supply of pharmacists has \n                increased in the past decade, there has been an \n                unprecedented demand for pharmacists and for \n                pharmaceutical care services, which has not been met by \n                the currently available supply.''\n                    (B) The ``evidence clearly indicates the emergence \n                of a shortage of pharmacists over the past two years.''\n                    (C) ``The factors causing the current shortage are \n                of a nature not likely to abate in the near future \n                without fundamental changes in pharmacy practice and \n                education.''\n            (6) In the report, HRSA projects that the number of \n        prescriptions filled by community pharmacists will increase 20 \n        percent by 2004. In contrast, the number of community \n        pharmacists is expected to increase only 6 percent by 2005.\n            (7) The demand for pharmacists will increase as \n        prescription drug use continues to grow.\n            (8) The Federal Government has a role and the \n        responsibility, through programs such as the National Health \n        Service Corps and programs under title VII of the Public Health \n        Service Act, to ensure access to pharmacists services. Although \n        the statutory provisions for the program for the National \n        Health Service Corps expressly reference physicians, dentists, \n        certified nurse midwives, certified nurse practitioners, and \n        physician assistants, there is no statutory reference to \n        pharmacists. The National Health Service Corps statute should \n        provide for the significant participation of pharmacists.\n\nSEC. 3. INCLUSION OF PRACTICE OF PHARMACY IN PROGRAM FOR NATIONAL \n              HEALTH SERVICE CORPS.\n\n    (a) Inclusion in Corps Mission.--Section 331(a)(3) of the Public \nHealth Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254d(a)(3)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (D), by adding at the end the \n        following: ``Such term includes pharmacist services.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(E)(i) The term `pharmacist services' includes \n                medication therapy management services.\n                    ``(ii) The term `medication therapy management \n                services', with respect to pharmacist services, \n                includes services to assure that medications are used \n                appropriately by patients; to enhance patients' \n                understanding of the appropriate use of medications; to \n                increase patients' adherence to prescription medication \n                regimens; to reduce the risk of adverse events \n                associated with medications; and to reduce the need for \n                other costly medical services through better management \n                of medication therapy. Such services may include case \n                management, disease management, drug therapy \n                management, patient training and education, counseling, \n                drug therapy problem resolution, medication \n                administration, the provision of special packaging, or \n                other services that enhance the use of prescription \n                medications.''.\n    (b) Scholarship Program.--Section 338A(a)(1) of the Public Health \nService Act (42 U.S.C. 254l(a)(1)) is amended by inserting \n``pharmacists,'' after ``physicians,''.\n    (c) Loan Repayment Program.--Section 338B(a)(1) of the Public \nHealth Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254l-1(a)(1)) is amended by inserting \n``pharmacists,'' after ``physicians,''.\n    (d) Funding.--Section 338H(b)(2) of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 254q(b)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting before the period the \n        following: ``, which may include such contracts for individuals \n        who are in a course of study or program leading to a pharmacy \n        degree''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following subparagraph:\n                    ``(C) Scholarships for first-year study in \n                pharmacy.--Of the amounts appropriated under paragraph \n                (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall obligate not \n                less than 10 percent for the purpose of providing \n                contracts for scholarships under this subpart to \n                individuals who are entering the first year of study in \n                a course of study or program leading to a pharmacy \n                degree. Amounts obligated under this subparagraph shall \n                be in addition to amounts obligated under subparagraph \n                (A).''.\n\nSEC. 4. CERTAIN HEALTH PROFESSIONS PROGRAMS REGARDING PRACTICE OF \n              PHARMACY.\n\n    Part E of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n294n et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following subpart:\n\n                ``Subpart 3--Certain Workforce Programs\n\n``SEC. 771.
