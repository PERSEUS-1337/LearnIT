FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Coastal and ocean observations provide vital \n        information for protecting human lives and property from marine \n        hazards, enhancing national and homeland security, predicting \n        weather and global climate change, improving ocean health, and \n        providing for the protection, sustainable use, and enjoyment of \n        the resources of the Nation's coasts, oceans, and Great Lakes.\n            (2) The continuing and potentially devastating threat posed \n        by tsunamis, hurricanes, storm surges, and other marine hazards \n        requires immediate implementation of strengthened observation \n        and communications systems to provide timely detection, \n        assessment, and warnings to the millions of people living in \n        coastal regions of the United States and throughout the world.\n            (3) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States, \n        including the Great Lakes, is vital to the Nation's prosperity, \n        contributing over $117,000,000,000 to the national economy in \n        2000, supporting jobs for more than 200,000,000 Americans, \n        handling $700,000,000,000 in waterborne commerce, and \n        supporting commercial and sport fisheries valued at more than \n        $50,000,000,000 annually.\n            (4) Safeguarding homeland security, conducting search and \n        rescue operations, responding to natural and manmade coastal \n        hazards (such as oil spills and harmful algal blooms), and \n        managing fisheries and other coastal activities each require \n        improved monitoring of the Nation's waters and coastline, \n        including the ability to track vessels and to provide rapid \n        response teams with real-time environmental conditions \n        necessary for their work.\n            (5) While knowledge of the coastal and ocean environment \n        and processes is far from complete, advances in sensing \n        technologies and scientific understanding have made possible \n        long-term and continuous observation from shore, space, and in \n        situ of coastal and ocean characteristics and conditions.\n            (6) Many elements of a coastal and ocean observing system \n        are in place, but require national investment, consolidation, \n        completion, and integration at Federal, regional, State, and \n        local levels.\n            (7) The Commission on Ocean Policy recommends a national \n        commitment to a sustained and integrated coastal and ocean \n        observing system and to coordinated research programs in order \n        to assist the Nation and the world in understanding the oceans \n        and the global climate system, enhancing homeland security, \n        improving weather and climate forecasts, strengthening \n        management of coastal and ocean resources, improving the safety \n        and efficiency of maritime operations, and mitigating marine \n        hazards.\n            (8) In 2003, the United States led more than 50 nations in \n        affirming the vital importance of timely, quality, long-term \n        global observations as a basis for sound decisionmaking, \n        recognizing the contribution of observation systems to meet \n        national, regional, and global needs, and calling for \n        strengthened cooperation and coordination in establishing a \n        Global Earth Observation System of Systems, of which an \n        integrated coastal and ocean observing system is an essential \n        part.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide for--\n            (1) the development and maintenance of an integrated \n        coastal and ocean observing system that provides data and \n        information to ensure national security and public safety, \n        support economic development, sustain and restore healthy \n        marine ecosystems and the resources they support, enable \n        advances in scientific understanding of the oceans, and \n        strengthen science education and communication;\n            (2) implementation of research and development and \n        education programs to improve understanding of the oceans and \n        Great Lakes and to achieve the full national benefits of an \n        integrated coastal and ocean observing system;\n            (3) implementation of a data and information management \n        system required by all components of an integrated coastal and \n        ocean observing system and related research to develop early \n        warning systems; and\n            (4) establishment of a system of regional coastal and ocean \n        observing systems to address local needs for ocean information.\n\nSEC. 3.
