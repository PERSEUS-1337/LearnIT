FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Creating the appropriate infrastructure to move \n        renewable fuels is a necessary energy and transportation \n        objective for the United States.\n            (2) Currently more than 70 percent of the gasoline supply \n        of the United States is delivered to local terminals through \n        pipelines.\n            (3) Pipelines are the most cost-effective, efficient, and \n        safe transportation mode in use today to deliver large volumes \n        of liquid fuels.\n            (4) Renewable fuels are currently transported by truck, \n        barge, and rail, and the volume requirements of the Energy \n        Independence and Security Act of 2007 may overwhelm the \n        renewable fuels infrastructure.\n            (5) The transportation of renewable fuels through a \n        pipeline will facilitate the meeting of the volume requirements \n        of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.\n            (6) The production and use of renewable fuels is supported \n        by Federal policy and a corresponding Federal policy is \n        necessary to support the construction of an appropriate \n        infrastructure to transport such fuels.\n\nSEC. 3. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCT RENEWABLE FUEL \n              PIPELINES.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 1701 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 \nU.S.C. 16511) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(6) Renewable fuel.--The term `renewable fuel' has the \n        meaning given the term in section 211(o)(1) of the Clean Air \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)), as in effect on January 1, 2009, \n        except that the term shall include all ethanol and biodiesel.\n            ``(7) Renewable fuel pipeline.--The term `renewable fuel \n        pipeline' means a common carrier pipeline for transporting \n        renewable fuel.''.\n    (b) Specific Appropriation or Contribution.--Section 1702(b) of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16512(b)) is amended by striking \n``No'' and inserting ``Except with respect to a project described in \nsection 1703(f), no''.\n    (c) Amount.--Section 1702(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 \nU.S.C. 16512(c)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``(c) Amount.--Unless'' and inserting the \n        following:\n    ``(c) Amount.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Unless''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(2) Renewable fuel pipelines.--With respect to a project \n        described in section 1703(f)--\n                    ``(A) a guarantee by the Secretary shall not exceed \n                an amount equal to 90 percent of the project cost of \n                the renewable fuel pipeline that is the subject of the \n                guarantee, as estimated at the time at which the \n                guarantee is issued; and\n                    ``(B) the Secretary may make more than one \n                guarantee for such project, to the extent that the sum \n                of all guarantees for such project does not exceed an \n                amount equal to 90 percent of the project cost of the \n                renewable fuel pipeline that is the subject of such \n                guarantees, as estimated any time after the original \n                guarantee is issued.''.\n    (d) Eligible Projects.--Section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act of \n2005 (42 U.S.C. 16513) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(f) Renewable Fuel Pipelines.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may make guarantees under \n        this title for projects to construct renewable fuel pipelines \n        without regard to any limitation imposed by this section other \n        than one imposed in this subsection.\n            ``(2) Guarantee determinations.--In determining whether to \n        make a guarantee for a project described in paragraph (1), the \n        Secretary shall consider the following:\n                    ``(A) The volume of renewable fuel to be moved by \n                the renewable fuel pipeline.\n                    ``(B) The size of the markets to be served by the \n                renewable fuel pipeline.\n                    ``(C) The existence of sufficient storage to \n                facilitate access to the markets to be served by the \n                renewable fuel pipeline.\n                    ``(D) The proximity of the renewable fuel pipeline \n                to renewable fuel production facilities.\n                    ``(E) The investment in terminal infrastructure of \n                the entity carrying out the proposed project to \n                construct a renewable fuel pipeline.\n                    ``(F) The history and experience working with \n                renewable fuel of the entity carrying out the proposed \n                project to construct a renewable fuel pipeline.\n                    ``(G) The ability of the entity carrying out the \n                proposed project to construct a renewable fuel pipeline \n                to ensure and maintain the quality of the renewable \n                fuel through the terminal system of the entity and \n                through the dedicated pipeline system.\n                    ``(H) The ability of the entity carrying out the \n                proposed project to construct a renewable fuel pipeline \n                to complete such proposed project in a timely manner.\n                    ``(I) The ability of the entity carrying out the \n                proposed project to construct a renewable fuel pipeline \n                to secure property rights-of-way.\n                    ``(J) Other criteria the Secretary determines \n                appropriate for consideration.''.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 1704 of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16514) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n    ``(c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that there \nshould be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide \n$4,000,000,000 in guarantees under this title for projects described in \nsection 1703(f).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
