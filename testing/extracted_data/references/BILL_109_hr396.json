FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Over 160,000 people were killed in the Indian Ocean \n        region as a result of the tsunamis that occurred on December \n        26, 2004.\n            (2) The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii detected \n        the earthquake and knew of the potential threat of a tsunami in \n        the Indian Ocean, but had no way to inform the countries in the \n        most danger.\n            (3) Even if such countries had the information about the \n        tsunamis, some countries in the region would have had no way to \n        warn people present on the coasts.\n            (4) With as little as 15 minutes advance notice, people \n        could have moved to higher ground, with a potential huge \n        reduction in the death toll.\n            (5) The United Nations reports that tens of thousands of \n        people are killed and tens of billions of dollars of property \n        are lost every year as a result of disasters, and states that \n        early warning is one of the most effective ways to save lives \n        and protect property.\n            (6) The World Conference on Disaster Reduction announced \n        the creation of the International Early Warning Program in \n        January 2005, sponsored by multiple United Nations \n        organizations.\n            (7) The International Early Warning Program identified the \n        following four elements of effective early warning systems:\n                    (A) Prior knowledge of the risks faced by \n                communities.\n                    (B) Technical monitoring of hazards.\n                    (C) Getting understandable warnings to those at \n                risk.\n                    (D) Knowledge and preparedness of how to act by \n                those threatened by disasters.\n            (8) The United States, acting through the United States \n        Agency for International Development, contributed to the \n        establishment of a typhoon early-warning system in Bangladesh.\n            (9) The United States Agency for International \n        Development's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance has been \n        funding the United Nations Development Program to help develop \n        early warning communications systems for floods and coastal \n        storms in Vietnam.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n     The purpose of this Act is to establish a United States program to \nprovide technological and financial support to foreign countries for \ndevelopment of effective public warning systems for all-hazard events, \nand to strengthen the existing lines of communications between \ncountries for the dissemination of data relating to disasters.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) All-hazard event.--The term ``all-hazard event'' means \n        an emergency or disaster resulting from--\n                    (A) a natural disaster; or\n                    (B) an accident or intentional or negligent act \n                that causes widespread damage or harm.\n            (2) Effective public warning.--The term ``effective public \n        warning'' means practical, comprehensible, and timely \n        information given to all individuals threatened by an all-\n        hazard event sufficient to enable them to act to protect their \n        safety and well-being in a timely manner.\n\nSEC. 5.
