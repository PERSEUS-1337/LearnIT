PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission which will \nsubmit findings and recommendations to provide a more effective \npresentation of capital and operating expenses of the United States \nGovernment.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government does not take a comprehensive \n        look at capital investment programs across agency and program \n        lines to see how they fit into a national strategy for \n        maintaining and improving the Nation's public facilities.\n            (2) Both the executive branch and the Congress tend to set \n        priorities for physical capital investment program-by-program. \n        There is no consistent basis for setting priorities among \n        projects and programs, and there is no framework in which to \n        identify those having similar objectives and those that are at \n        cross-purposes.\n            (3) This program- and project-orientation makes planning \n        for public facilities vulnerable to short-term factors, thus \n        impairing the stability and predictability needed for an \n        efficient capital investment program.\n            (4) A separate capital budget would establish a useful \n        planning process because it would focus on long-term projects, \n        costs, and benefits.\n\nSEC. 4.
