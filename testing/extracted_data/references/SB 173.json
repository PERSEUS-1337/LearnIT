    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 10721 of the Water Code is amended to read:\n10721.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions govern the construction of this part:\n(a) \u201cAdjudication action\u201d means an action filed in the superior or federal district court to determine the rights to extract groundwater from a basin or store water within a basin, including, but not limited to, actions to quiet title respecting rights to extract or store groundwater or an action brought to impose a physical solution on a basin.\n(b) \u201cBasin\u201d means a groundwater basin or subbasin identified and defined in Bulletin 118 or as modified pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 10722).\n(c) \u201cBulletin 118\u201d means the department\u2019s report entitled \u201cCalifornia\u2019s Groundwater: Bulletin 118\u201d updated in 2003, as it may be subsequently updated or revised in accordance with Section 12924.\n(d) \u201cCoordination agreement\u201d means a legal agreement adopted between two or more groundwater sustainability agencies that provides the basis for coordinating multiple agencies or groundwater sustainability plans within a basin pursuant to this part.\n(e) \u201cDe minimis extractor\u201d means a person who extracts, for domestic purposes,\ntwo\n10\nacre-feet or less per year.\n(f) \u201cGoverning body\u201d means the legislative body of a groundwater sustainability agency.\n(g) \u201cGroundwater\u201d means water beneath the surface of the earth within the zone below the water table in which the soil is completely saturated with water, but does not include water that flows in known and definite channels.\n(h) \u201cGroundwater extraction facility\u201d means a device or method for extracting groundwater from within a basin.\n(i) \u201cGroundwater recharge\u201d means the augmentation of groundwater, by natural or artificial means.\n(j) \u201cGroundwater sustainability agency\u201d means one or more local agencies that implement the provisions of this part. For purposes of imposing fees pursuant to Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 10730) or taking action to enforce a groundwater sustainability plan, \u201cgroundwater sustainability agency\u201d also means each local agency comprising the groundwater sustainability agency if the plan authorizes separate agency action.\n(k) \u201cGroundwater sustainability plan\u201d or \u201cplan\u201d means a plan of a groundwater sustainability agency proposed or adopted pursuant to this part.\n(l) \u201cGroundwater sustainability program\u201d means a coordinated and ongoing activity undertaken to benefit a basin, pursuant to a groundwater sustainability plan.\n(m) \u201cLocal agency\u201d means a local public agency that has water supply, water management, or land use responsibilities within a groundwater basin.\n(n) \u201cOperator\u201d means a person operating a groundwater extraction facility. The owner of a groundwater extraction facility shall be conclusively presumed to be the operator unless a satisfactory showing is made to the governing body of the groundwater sustainability agency that the groundwater extraction facility actually is operated by some other person.\n(o) \u201cOwner\u201d means a person owning a groundwater extraction facility or an interest in a groundwater extraction facility other than a lien to secure the payment of a debt or other obligation.\n(p) \u201cPersonal information\u201d has the same meaning as defined in Section 1798.3 of the Civil Code.\n(q) \u201cPlanning and implementation horizon\u201d means a 50-year time period over which a groundwater sustainability agency determines that plans and measures will be implemented in a basin to ensure that the basin is operated within its sustainable yield.\n(r) \u201cPublic water system\u201d has the same meaning as defined in Section 116275 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(s) \u201cRecharge area\u201d means the area that supplies water to an aquifer in a groundwater basin.\n(t) \u201cSustainability goal\u201d means the existence and implementation of one or more groundwater sustainability plans that achieve sustainable groundwater management by identifying and causing the implementation of measures targeted to ensure that the applicable basin is operated within its sustainable yield.\n(u) \u201cSustainable groundwater management\u201d means the management and use of groundwater in a manner that can be maintained during the planning and implementation horizon without causing undesirable results.\n(v) \u201cSustainable yield\u201d means the maximum quantity of water, calculated over a base period representative of long-term conditions in the basin and including any temporary surplus, that can be withdrawn annually from a groundwater supply without causing an undesirable result.\n(w) \u201cUndesirable result\u201d means one or more of the following effects caused by groundwater conditions occurring throughout the basin:\n(1) Chronic lowering of groundwater levels indicating a significant and unreasonable depletion of supply if continued over the planning and implementation horizon. Overdraft during a period of drought is not sufficient to establish a chronic lowering of groundwater levels if extractions and recharge are managed as necessary to ensure that reductions in groundwater levels or storage during a period of drought are offset by increases in groundwater levels or storage during other periods.\n(2) Significant and unreasonable reduction of groundwater storage.\n(3) Significant and unreasonable seawater intrusion.\n(4) Significant and unreasonable degraded water quality, including the migration of contaminant plumes that impair water supplies.\n(5) Significant and unreasonable land subsidence that substantially interferes with surface land uses.\n(6) Depletions of interconnected surface water that have significant and unreasonable adverse impacts on beneficial uses of the surface water.\n(x) \u201cWater budget\u201d means an accounting of the total groundwater and surface water entering and leaving a basin including the changes in the amount of water stored.\n(y) \u201cWatermaster\u201d means a watermaster appointed by a court or pursuant to other law.\n(z) \u201cWater year\u201d means the period from October 1 through the following September 30, inclusive.\n(aa) \u201cWellhead protection area\u201d means the surface and subsurface area surrounding a water well or well field that supplies a public water system through which contaminants are reasonably likely to migrate toward the water well or well field."
