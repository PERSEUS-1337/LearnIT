EXPANSION OF PRECLEARANCE AT FOREIGN AIRPORTS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Preclearance operations provide the ultimate ability \n        for the United States to address potential threats at the \n        earliest possible moment and prior to departure, through the \n        forward deployment of officers of U.S. Customs and Border \n        Protection to last points of departure in a foreign country.\n            (2) With inspections and examination operations of U.S. \n        Customs and Border Protection located in a foreign country, \n        preclearance provides the capability to interdict, address, and \n        work with host-country law enforcement in furtherance of both \n        aviation security and border security in the United States.\n            (3) Under current preclearance operations, officers of the \n        U.S. Customs and Border Protection collect biometrics in the \n        same way that is currently done upon arrival in the United \n        States, in accordance with current regulation, and as part of \n        the routine entry process from certain aliens who are not \n        citizens of the United States prior to boarding flights \n        destined to the United States.\n            (4) Preclearance operations provide the best means for \n        existing and future biometric security capabilities beyond the \n        United States. Support for preclearance expansion will greatly \n        increase border and aviation security in the United States and \n        foreign countries.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that each \ncountry designated as a visa waiver program country under section 217 \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187) should seek to \nparticipate in the preclearance program with the United States, to \njointly address security concerns through additional exchange of \ninformation and to improve joint ability to secure the that visa waiver \nprogram while maintaining the original intent of the program.\n\nSEC. 5. BIOMETRIC DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS AT PRECLEARANCE LOCATIONS.\n\n    (a) Authority.--The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to \nselect preclearance locations, including preclearance expansion \nlocations, and enter into an agreement with a foreign government or \nairport to conduct a collaborative biometric demonstration program at \nsuch a location to test emerging biometric technologies. The scope of \nthe demonstration program may encompass travelers other than those \nutilizing preclearance at such a location, provided that such program \nincludes means for information sharing with U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection operations.\n    (b) International Cooperation and Coordination.--Section 233(a) of \nthe Security and Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. \n983(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking the period at the end and \n        inserting ``, and to establish and maintain, in partnership \n        with foreign governments, demonstration programs to test \n        emerging biometric technologies at foreign airports at which \n        the Secretary has established preclearance operations.''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (2)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the \n                end;\n                    (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at \n                the end and inserting a semicolon and ``and''; and\n                    (C) by adding the following:\n                    ``(C) lease, loan, provide, or otherwise assist in \n                the deployment of biometric technologies at foreign \n                airports at which the Secretary has established \n                preclearance operations under such terms and conditions \n                as the Secretary prescribes, including nonreimbursable \n                loans or the transfer of ownership of such \n                technologies, and provide the necessary training and \n                technical assistance related to the biometric \n                demonstration programs referred to in paragraph (1).''.\n\nSEC. 6. VISA WAIVER PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Information Sharing Process.--The Director of National \nIntelligence shall--\n            (1) develop a process to share information derived from the \n        Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) database and \n        the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), including biometric \n        and biographic information, with countries participating in the \n        visa waiver program established under section 217(a) of the \n        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187(a)); and\n            (2) not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment \n        of this Act, certify to Congress that such process may be \n        utilized by such countries.\n    (b) Continuing Qualification and Designation Terminations.--\nSubsection (c) of section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \nU.S.C. 1187) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``Attorney General,'' and \n        inserting ``Secretary of Homeland Security,''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (2)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (C)(iii)--\n                            (i) by striking ``and the Committee on \n                        International Relations'' and inserting ``, the \n                        Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee \n                        on Homeland Security''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``and the Committee on \n                        Foreign Relations'' and inserting ``, the \n                        Committee on Foreign Relations, and the \n                        Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n                        Affairs''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(G) Border security.--The government of the \n                country utilizes the process developed by the Director \n                of National Intelligence under section 6(a) of the \n                Travel Facilitation and Safety Act of 2015 to utilize \n                information derived from the Terrorist Identities \n                Datamart Environment (TIDE) database and the Terrorist \n                Screening Database (TSDB) for border security and \n                immigration purposes, including the screening of aliens \n                seeking asylum or refugee status in that country.''."
