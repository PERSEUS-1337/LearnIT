    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Americans with Disabilities Act \nRestoration Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Physical and mental impairments are natural parts of \n        the human condition as are race, gender, national origin, and \n        sex.\n            (2) Discrimination results when individuals with actual or \n        perceived physical or mental impairments are met with \n        attitudinal, societal, and physical barriers in society.\n            (3) The use of mitigating measures by an individual does \n        not change the fact that the individual has a physical or \n        mental impairment, nor should the use of a mitigating measure \n        by an individual insulate covered entities from liability for \n        discriminatory practices and policies.\n            (4) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 has not \n        been interpreted by the courts, including the Supreme Court, as \n        intended by Congress. The courts have significantly limited the \n        intended reach of the Americans with Disabilities Act, allowing \n        many individuals with actual or perceived impairments to be \n        subject to discrimination.\n            (5) It is necessary to restore the intent of the Americans \n        with Disabilities Act to fully remove the barriers that \n        confront disabled Americans and to permit all people to fully \n        participate in society.\n\nSEC. 3. DISABILITY DEFINED.\n\n    Section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n12102) is amended--\n            (1) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:\n            ``(2) Disability.--\n                    ``(A)  In general.--The term `disability' means, \n                with respect to an individual--\n                            ``(i) a physical or mental impairment;\n                            ``(ii) a record of a physical or mental \n                        impairment; or\n                            ``(iii) a perceived physical or mental \n                        impairment.\n                    ``(B) Rule of construction.--The existence of a \n                physical or mental impairment or record or perception \n                of a physical or mental impairment shall be determined \n                without taking into account an individual's use of \n                mitigating measures or whether the impairment is \n                episodic, short term, or long term.''; and\n            (2) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (7) and \n        inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n            ``(3) Physical impairment.--The term `physical impairment' \n        means any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic \n        disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the \n        following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal; special \n        sense organs; respiratory, including speech organs; \n        cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; genito-urinary; hemic \n        and lymphatic; skin and endocrine.\n            ``(4) Mental impairment.--The term `mental impairment' \n        means any mental or psychological disorder such as mental \n        retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental \n        illness, and specific learning disabilities.\n            ``(5) Record of physical or mental impairment.--The term \n        `record of physical or mental impairment' means having a \n        history of, or having been misclassified as having, a physical \n        or mental impairment.\n            ``(6) Perceived physical or mental impairment.--The term \n        `perceived physical or mental impairment' means not having an \n        impairment as set forth in paragraph (2)(A)(i) or (ii), but \n        being regarded as having, or treated as having, a physical or \n        mental impairment.''.\n\nSEC. 4. DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY.\n\n    The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et \nseq.) is further amended--\n            (1) in section 2(b), by striking ``against individuals with \n        disabilities'' each place it appears and inserting ``on the \n        basis of disability''; and\n            (2) in section 102(a), by striking ``against a qualified \n        individual with a disability because of the disability of such \n        individual'' and inserting ``against an individual on the basis \n        of disability''.\n\nSEC. 5. QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL.\n\n    (a) Defense.--Section 103, by redesignating subsections (a) through \n(d) as subsections (b) through (e), respectively, and inserting before \nsuch subsection (b) (as so redesignated) the following:\n    ``(a) In General.--It may be a defense to a charge of \ndiscrimination under this title that the individual with a disability \nalleging discrimination is not a qualified individual, as such term is \ndefined in section 101(8).''.\n    (b) Qualified Individual.--Title I of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) is further amended--\n            (1) in section 101(8)--\n                    (A) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``with a \n                disability''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``with a disability'' after \n                ``individual'' both places it appears;\n            (2) in section 102(b)(5), by striking ``with a disability'' \n        after ``individual'' both places it appears; and\n            (3) in section 104--\n                    (A) in subsection (a)--\n                            (i) in the subsection heading, by striking \n                        ``With a Disability''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``with a disability'' \n                        after ``individual''; and\n                    (B) in subsection (b), in the matter preceding \n                paragraph (1), by striking ``with a disability''.\n\nSEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    Section 501 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 \nU.S.C. 12201) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(e) Broad Construction.--In order to ensure that this Act \nachieves its purpose under section 2(b) of providing a comprehensive \nprohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability, the \nprovisions of this Act shall be broadly construed to advance their \nremedial purpose.''."
