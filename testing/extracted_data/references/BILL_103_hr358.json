CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) law enforcement officers risk their lives daily to \n        protect citizens, for modest rewards and too little \n        recognition;\n            (2) a significant shift has occurred in the problems that \n        law enforcement officers face without a corresponding change in \n        the support from the Federal Government;\n            (3) law enforcement officers are on the front line in the \n        war against drugs and crime;\n            (4) the rate of violent crime continues to increase along \n        with the increase in drug use;\n            (5) a large percentage of individuals arrested test \n        positive for drug usage;\n            (6) the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the \n        Administration of Justice of 1965 focused attention on many \n        issues affecting law enforcement, and a review twenty-five \n        years later would help to evaluate current problems, including \n        drug-related crime, violence, racial conflict, and decreased \n        funding; and\n            (7) a comprehensive study of law enforcement issues, \n        including the role of the Federal Government in supporting law \n        enforcement officers, working conditions, and responsibility \n        for crime control would assist in redefining the relationships \n        between the Federal Government, the public, and law enforcement \n        officials.\n\nSEC. 3.
