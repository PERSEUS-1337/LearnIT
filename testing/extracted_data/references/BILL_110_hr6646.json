FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Relations between the United States and Taiwan are \n        governed by the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.; \n        Public Law 96-8), three joint communiques, and the Six \n        Assurances.\n            (2) The Taiwan Relations Act has governed United States \n        arms sales to Taiwan since 1979, when the United States \n        extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of \n        China.\n            (3) The Taiwan Relations Act specifies that it is United \n        States policy, among other things, to consider any nonpeaceful \n        means to determine Taiwan's future ``a threat'' to the peace \n        and security of the Western Pacific and of ``grave concern'' to \n        the United States, ``to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive \n        character'', and ``to maintain the capacity of the United \n        States to resist any resort to force or other forms of \n        coercion'' jeopardizing the security or social or economic \n        system of Taiwan's people.\n            (4) Section 3(a) of the Taiwan Relations Act states that \n        ``the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense \n        articles and defense services in such quantity as may be \n        necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-\n        defense capability''.\n            (5) Section 3(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act stipulates \n        that both the President and the Congress shall determine the \n        nature and quantity of such defense articles and services \n        ``based solely'' upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan.\n            (6) Taiwan has recently reversed a downward trend in \n        defense spending with a $2.2 billion increase in 2007 to $9.8 \n        billion and the Defense Ministry has requested and the \n        Executive Yuan approved a 2008 budget of $10.6 billion, an \n        increase of 15 percent.\n            (7) According to the Congressional Research Service, the \n        executive branch has yet to send any arms transfer \n        notifications to Congress during calendar year 2008, including \n        notifications on at least seven pending arms sales programs \n        with a total value of about $11 billion that encompass programs \n        on a submarine design, Patriot PAC-3 missile defense systems, \n        and Apache and Blackhawk helicopters.\n            (8) Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou stated on July 12, \n        2008, that the island needs to secure defensive weapons from \n        the United States, despite a warming of relations with mainland \n        China.\n            (9) On July 16, 2008, Admiral Timothy Keating, Commander of \n        the Hawaii-based United States Pacific Command, acknowledged \n        that the executive branch had imposed a ``freeze'' on arms \n        sales to Taiwan, a decision that is in contradiction to \n        longstanding United States law and policy.\n\nSEC. 2.
