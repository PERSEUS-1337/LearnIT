Con. Res. 318, \n        which--\n                    (A) supports the goals and ideals of the \n                International Year of Sanitation; and\n                    (B) recognizes the importance of sanitation on \n                public health, poverty reduction, economic and social \n                development, and the environment.\n            (4) While progress is being made on safe water and \n        sanitation efforts--\n                    (A) more than 884,000,000 people throughout the \n                world lack access to safe drinking water; and\n                    (B) 2 of every 5 people in the world do not have \n                access to basic sanitation services.\n            (5) The health consequences of unsafe drinking water and \n        poor sanitation are staggering, accounting for--\n                    (A) nearly 10 percent of the global burden of \n                disease; and\n                    (B) more than 2,000,000 deaths each year.\n            (6) The effects of climate change are expected to produce \n        severe consequences for water availability and resource \n        management in the future, with 2,800,000,000 people in more \n        than 48 countries expected to face severe and chronic water \n        shortages by 2025.\n            (7) The impact of water scarcity on conflict and \n        instability is evident in many parts of the world, including \n        the Darfur region of Sudan, where demand for water resources \n        has contributed to armed conflict between nomadic ethnic groups \n        and local farming communities.\n            (8) In order to further the United States contribution to \n        safe water and sanitation efforts, it is necessary to--\n                    (A) expand foreign assistance capacity to address \n                the challenges described in this section; and\n                    (B) represent issues related to water and \n                sanitation at the highest levels of United States \n                foreign assistance deliberations, including \n                deliberations related to issues of global health, food \n                security, the environment, global warming, and maternal \n                and child mortality.\n\nSEC. 3.
