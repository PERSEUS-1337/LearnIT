FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Studies have shown that early detection and screening \n        for cancer can reduce cancer morbidity by as much as 50 percent \n        for certain types of cancer.\n            (2) Of the 1.17 million Americans diagnosed with cancer in \n        1993, the American Cancer Society estimates that 100,000 deaths \n        could be avoided through early detection and prompt treatment.\n            (3) Physicians report that concern about the costs of early \n        detection procedures is one of the main reasons for hesitating \n        to order such procedures.\n            (4) Many low-income Americans lack comprehensive health \n        insurance coverage and the majority of existing health \n        insurance policies do not adequately cover the costs of cancer \n        early detection and screening procedures.\n            (5) Socioeconomically disadvantaged Americans are \n        disproportionately affected by cancer in terms of incidence and \n        mortality.\n            (6) Demographic forecasts predict that the elderly \n        population will double by the year 2020. Since cancer mortality \n        and incidence rates rise dramatically with age, cancer \n        prevention in the elderly population will become increasingly \n        important.\n\nSEC. 3.
