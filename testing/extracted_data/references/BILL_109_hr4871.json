FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and \n        the subsequent introduction of weapons grade anthrax into the \n        United States Postal System and Congressional office buildings \n        in Washington, D.C., the President and the Congress have worked \n        closely to respond to the need to rebuild and strengthen the \n        nation's public health, national security, and emergency \n        response systems.\n            (2) Based on Article I, section 8 of the United States \n        Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and court decisions, \n        the United States has a unique historical and legal \n        relationship with American Indian and Alaska Native people, \n        which serves as the basis for the Federal Government's trust \n        responsibility and obligations. There are currently 558 \n        federally-recognized Indian tribes in the United States, with \n        some 40 percent of Indian tribes located in the State of \n        Alaska. Indian tribes have principle responsibility for lands \n        and people within their jurisdiction.\n            (3) Despite the government-to-government relationship \n        between Indian tribes and the United States, the United States \n        has failed to include and consult with Indian tribes with \n        regard to homeland security prevention, protection, and \n        response activities planning. Moreover, there are no specific \n        provisions for the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian \n        Health Service to participate in homeland security programs and \n        funding.\n            (4) Throughout many areas of the United States, facilities \n        operated, and services, activities and government functions \n        carried out, by Indian tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \n        the Indian Health Service are the only sources available to \n        provide emergency health services, disaster response, and law \n        enforcement to the tribal and non-tribal community, thus \n        serving the role as ``first responders'' in the event of a \n        terrorist attack.\n            (5) To provide for the public health and safety on tribal \n        lands and in the surrounding communities, it is imperative to \n        establish tribal participation in homeland security \n        initiatives. Indian tribes must be included in the national \n        strategy for homeland security and receive an appropriate share \n        of related funding.\n            (6) The treatment of Indian tribes as State governments, as \n        appropriate, for developing funding methodologies, planning, \n        consultation, coordination, and for eligibility for grant \n        monies will ensure Indian tribes are adequately prepared to \n        respond to Homeland Security threats.\n            (7) Indian tribes shall be treated as State, as \n        appropriate, for purposes of planning, consultation, \n        coordination, eligibility for grant monies and other purposes \n        to improve the United States capacity to prepare, prevent and \n        respond to terrorist activities.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To establish within the Department of Homeland Security \n        an office known as the Office of Tribal Government Homeland \n        Security.\n            (2) To authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n        appoint, in consultation with Indian tribes, a Director of \n        Tribal Government Homeland Security.\n            (3) To provide for more effective management of, and \n        accountability for the proper discharge of, the Secretary's \n        trust responsibility to Indian tribes and individual American \n        Indians and Alaska Natives by establishing in the Department of \n        Homeland Security an Office of Tribal Government Homeland \n        Security.\n            (4) To integrate and coordinate the efforts of the \n        Department of Homeland Security and Indian tribes to prepare \n        for, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from \n        terrorist attacks.\n            (5) To provide strategic integration of the Homeland \n        Security activities of Indian tribes that will complement the \n        operational consolidation of the various directorates within \n        the Department.\n            (6) To supplement the capacity of the Indian Health Service \n        and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to respond to the homeland \n        security needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives, without \n        jeopardizing the nonsecurity missions of the Indian Health \n        Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n            (7) To serve as an information clearinghouse and to enhance \n        the integration and coordination of Indian tribes and in the \n        activities of the Department of Homeland Security.\n            (8) To establish an organizational framework within the \n        Department of Homeland Security through which the Federal \n        Government, Indian tribes, and State and local governments can \n        work effectively and collaboratively on public health and \n        safety, terrorism detection, prevention, response, and \n        protection of critical infrastructure.\n\nSEC. 3.
