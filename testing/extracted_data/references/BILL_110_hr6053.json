FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable long-\n        term economic growth, job creation, and moderate interest \n        rates.\n            (2) Inflation erodes the value of Americans' income and \n        savings.\n            (3) Inflation distorts the pricing system and the efficient \n        allocation of resources in the economy.\n            (4) Inflation makes long-term planning difficult and raises \n        the effective tax rate on capital, thereby impeding investment.\n            (5) Through its determination of monetary policy, the Board \n        of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is ultimately \n        responsible for controlling the long-run rate of inflation in \n        the economy.\n            (6) The multiple policy goals of the Full Employment and \n        Balanced Growth Act of 1978 cause confusion and ambiguity about \n        the appropriate role and aims of monetary policy, which can add \n        to volatility in economic activity and financial markets.\n            (7) There is a need for the Congress to clarify the proper \n        role of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in \n        economic policymaking, in order to achieve the best environment \n        for long-term economic growth and job creation.\n            (8) An explicit price stability goal would promote \n        transparency, accountability and credibility in monetary \n        policy.\n            (9) Price stability should be the primary long-term goal of \n        the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nthat--\n            (1) the principal economic responsibilities of the \n        Government are to establish and ensure an environment that is \n        conducive to both long-term economic growth and increases in \n        living standards, by establishing and maintaining free markets, \n        low taxes, respect for private property, and the stable, long-\n        term purchasing power of the United States currency; and\n            (2) the primary long-term goal of the Board of Governors of \n        the Federal Reserve System should be to promote price \n        stability.\n\nSEC. 3.
