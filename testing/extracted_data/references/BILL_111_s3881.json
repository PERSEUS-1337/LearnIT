FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States supports the people of the Russian \n        Federation in their efforts to realize their full economic \n        potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and the rule \n        of law.\n            (2) The Russian Federation--\n                    (A) is a member of the United Nations, the \n                Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \n                and the International Monetary Fund;\n                    (B) has ratified the Convention against Torture and \n                Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n                Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and \n                Political Rights, the International Covenant on \n                Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the United \n                Nations Convention against Corruption; and\n                    (C) is bound by the legal obligations set forth in \n                the European Convention on Human Rights.\n            (3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect \n        obligations and responsibilities through the adoption of \n        international agreements and treaties, which must be observed \n        in good faith in order to maintain the stability of the \n        international order. Human rights are an integral part of \n        international law, and lie at the foundation of the \n        international order. The protection of human rights, therefore, \n        particularly in the case of a country that has incurred \n        obligations to protect human rights under an international \n        agreement to which it is a party, is not left exclusively to \n        the internal affairs of that country.\n            (4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are \n        instrumental in the protection of human rights and in achieving \n        sustainable economic growth, which benefits both the people of \n        the Russian Federation and the international community through \n        the creation of open and transparent markets.\n            (5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in \n        democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights \n        protections. This is the case when public officials are allowed \n        to abuse their authority with impunity for political or \n        financial gains in collusion with private entities.\n            (6) The President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry \n        Medvedev, has addressed corruption in many public speeches, \n        including stating in his 2009 address to Russia's Federal \n        Assembly, ``[Z]ero tolerance of corruption should become part \n        of our national culture. . . . In Russia we often say that \n        there are few cases in which corrupt officials are prosecuted. \n        . . . [S]imply incarcerating a few will not resolve the \n        problem. But incarcerated they must be.''. President Medvedev \n        went on to say, ``We shall overcome underdevelopment and \n        corruption because we are a strong and free people, and deserve \n        a normal life in a modern, prosperous democratic society.''. \n        Furthermore, President Medvedev has acknowledged Russia's \n        disregard for the rule of law and used the term ``legal \n        nihilism'' to describe a criminal justice system that continues \n        to imprison innocent people.\n            (7) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his \n        repressive arrest and torture in custody by the same officers \n        of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation that \n        Mr. Magnitsky had implicated in the embezzlement of funds from \n        the Russian Treasury and the misappropriation of 3 companies \n        from his client, Hermitage, reflects how deeply the protection \n        of human rights is affected by corruption.\n            (8) The denial by all state bodies of the Russian \n        Federation of any justice or legal remedies to Mr. Magnitsky \n        during the nearly 12 full months he was kept without trial in \n        detention, and the impunity of state officials he testified \n        against for their involvement in corruption and the carrying \n        out of his repressive persecution since his death, shows the \n        politically motivated nature of the persecution of Mr. \n        Magnitsky.\n            (9) Mr. Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009, at the age of \n        37, in Matrosskaya Tishina Prison in Moscow, Russia, and is \n        survived by a mother, a wife, and 2 sons.\n            (10) There is extensive evidence that public officials from \n        the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation, the \n        Russian federal tax authorities, the Prosecutor General's \n        Office of the Russian Federation, and the Russian Federal \n        Security Service, as well as regional courts and the prison \n        system of the Russian Federation, have abused their powers and \n        positions to commit serious human rights violations, embezzled \n        funds from the Russian Treasury, and retaliated against \n        whistleblowers.\n            (11) While he was in detention, Sergei Magnitsky called \n        himself a hostage of officials who misappropriated companies \n        from his client, the Hermitage Fund, and embezzled funds from \n        the Russian Treasury. He said that his criminal prosecution, \n        arrest, and detention were organized as a retribution by police \n        officers who had the full knowledge of his innocence.\n            (12) The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow \n        for the Control of the Observance of Human Rights in Places of \n        Forced Detention, an organization empowered by Russian law to \n        independently monitor prison conditions, concluded, ``A man who \n        is kept in custody and is being detained is not capable of \n        using all the necessary means to protect either his life or his \n        health. This is a responsibility of a state which holds him \n        captive. Therefore, the case of Sergei Magnitsky can be \n        described as a breach of the right to life. The members of the \n        civic supervisory commission have reached the conclusion that \n        Magnitsky had been experiencing both psychological and physical \n        pressure in custody, and the conditions in some of the wards of \n        Butyrka can be justifiably called torturous. The people \n        responsible for this must be punished.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
