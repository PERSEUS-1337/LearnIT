FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Tinnitus, or the perception of sound where no external \n        source of such sound exists, is the most prevalent disabling \n        condition that affects members of the Armed Forces, most \n        notably those members who have been exposed to blast injuries \n        during combat, or other high noise level situations.\n            (2) Tinnitus is the leading service-connected disability \n        for returning members of the Armed Forces and the prevalence of \n        tinnitus is continuing to increase at alarming rates.\n            (3) An otologic, or ear, injury such as tinnitus has been \n        shown to decrease performance and situational awareness during \n        combat, seriously compromising the ability of a member of the \n        Armed Forces to hear and execute commands properly, thereby \n        jeopardizing not only the affected member but other members as \n        well.\n            (4) While certain types of sensory impairment in combat or \n        other military activities may be readily apparent, otologic \n        injuries such as tinnitus may not be easily noticeable, which \n        necessitates the need for more rigorous screening for tinnitus \n        before and after deployment, and for additional research to \n        distinguish tinnitus from other forms of brain injury incurred \n        during combat.\n            (5) Medical evidence to date suggests a demonstrated link \n        between tinnitus and post-traumatic stress disorder and \n        traumatic brain injury, such that improved understanding of \n        treatment of tinnitus may also directly advance research \n        efforts to address post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic \n        brain injury.\n            (6) Improving the treatment and prevention of tinnitus will \n        benefit all members of the Armed Forces who are increasingly at \n        risk of injury from high-decibel equipment or explosive \n        devices.\n\nSEC. 3. CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THE STUDY OF TINNITUS.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish \n        one or more Centers of Excellence (in this section referred to \n        as a ``center'') for the study of tinnitus.\n            (2) Location.--The Secretary shall establish a center at a \n        military installation in the United States where members of the \n        Armed Forces perform activities involving high rates of sound, \n        including artillery instruction and other basic combat training \n        related activities.\n    (b) Responsibilities.--A center shall have the responsibilities as \nfollows:\n            (1) To study and enhance existing treatment modalities for \n        members of the Armed Forces with tinnitus, including diagnosed \n        cases of recurrent, chronic, or severe tinnitus.\n            (2) To conduct basic and clinical research to prevent, \n        treat, and cure tinnitus, including studies on the neurological \n        changes in the brain associated with tinnitus.\n            (3) To coordinate research activities with the Defense \n        Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic \n        Brain Injury in order to establish a tinnitus data registry for \n        members of the Armed Forces affected with tinnitus and other \n        neurological conditions that will enhance scientific progress \n        toward improvements in treatment for tinnitus and associated \n        neurological combat related conditions.\n    (c) Reports.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of \nDefense shall submit to Congress a report on the activities of the \ncenter.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section $7,000,000 for each of fiscal \nyears 2011 through 2016.\n\nSEC. 4.
