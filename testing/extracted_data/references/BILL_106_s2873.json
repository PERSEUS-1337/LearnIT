(hereafter \n        in this Act referred to as ``ELT'') acquired from the State of \n        Utah 2,440 acres of school trust lands in Washington County, \n        Utah, north of the city of St. George, for residential and \n        recreational development purposes and over the next several \n        years completed appraisals, cost estimates, engineering \n        studies, site plans, surveys, utility layouts, and right-of-way \n        negotiations with the city, and obtained water rights for the \n        land.\n            (2) With the issuance by the United States Fish and \n        Wildlife Service of a permit under section 10 of the Endangered \n        Species Act of 1973 to Washington County, Utah, and the \n        adoption of the Habitat Conservation Plan and Implementation \n        Agreement of February of 1996 (hereafter in the Act referred to \n        as ``HCP and Agreement''), the Bureau of Land Management \n        assumed an obligation to acquire from willing sellers \n        approximately 12,600 acres of non-Federal land, including the \n        ELT development land, to create the Red Cliffs Reserve for the \n        protection of the desert tortoise.\n            (3) Since 1996, the Bureau of Land Management has acquired, \n        through exchange or purchase, nearly all of the privately owned \n        property within the Federal portion of the Reserve, except for \n        1,516 acres of the ELT development land.\n            (4) With the creation of the Grand Staircase National \n        Monument in 1996 in the State of Utah and the subsequent land \n        exchanges for the consolidation of lands necessary for the \n        Monument, there are no longer sufficient comparable lands \n        within the State of Utah to conduct intrastate exchanges for \n        the remaining desert tortoise lands.\n            (5) Under the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land \n        Acquisitions, ELT is entitled to have its lands appraised at \n        fair market value, highest and best use.\n            (6) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service is charged \n        with protecting endangered species and administering the \n        cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund which may be \n        used for the acquisition of private lands, and the Bureau of \n        Land Management is responsible for acquiring the private lands \n        within the Red Cliffs Reserve.\n            (7) The bifurcation of responsibility between the United \n        States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land \n        Management has relegated ELT to a bureaucratic ``no-man's-\n        land''.\n            (8) The Secretary of the Interior and other department \n        officials have characterized the acquisition of the ELT lands \n        to be administered under the HCP and Agreement as a high \n        priority.\n            (9) The Department of the Interior did not request any \n        funds in the budget for fiscal year 2001 to purchase the \n        remaining privately held lands within the boundaries of the \n        land to be administered by the Bureau of Land Management under \n        the HCP and Agreement.\n            (10) The listing of the desert tortoise and the failure of \n        the Department of the Interior to identify comparable land \n        suitable for exchange within the State of Utah or to fund the \n        purchase of the ELT development land have effectively taken \n        this property from the remaining private land owner, denying it \n        the right to develop or otherwise dispose of the property.\n            (11) With the creation of the Red Cliffs Reserve, ELT has \n        been unable to develop its property, which has resulted in \n        extreme financial hardship to the owner, requiring the \n        liquidation of substantial ELT assets.\n            (12) It is in the public interest to complete this land \n        acquisition at the earliest practicable date so that the desert \n        tortoise habitat lands can be acquired and preserved by the \n        United States for permanent public management, use, and \n        enjoyment and the private land owner may be fairly compensated \n        for its lands.\n\nSEC. 2.
