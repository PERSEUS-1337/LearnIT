In those claims or legal actions, the insured of the insolvent insurer is entitled to a credit or setoff in the amount of the policy limits of the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy, or in the amount of the limits remaining, where those limits have been diminished by the payment of other claims.\n(6) \u201cCovered claims,\u201d except in cases involving a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or for unearned premiums, does not include a claim in an amount of one hundred dollars ($100) or less, nor that portion of a claim that is in excess of any applicable limits provided in the insurance policy issued by the insolvent insurer.\n(7) \u201cCovered claims\u201d does not include that portion of a claim, other than a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, that is in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).\n(8) \u201cCovered claims\u201d does not include any amount awarded as punitive or exemplary damages, nor any amount awarded by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board pursuant to Section 5814 or 5814.5 of the Labor Code because payment of compensation was unreasonably delayed or refused by the insolvent insurer.\n(9) \u201cCovered claims\u201d does not include (A) a claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article available to the claimant or insured or (B) a claim by a person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name, his or her assignee as the person entitled thereto under a premium finance agreement as defined in Section 673 and entered into prior to insolvency, his or her executor, administrator, guardian, or other personal representative or trustee in bankruptcy, and does not include a claim asserted by an assignee or one claiming by right of subrogation, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\n(10) \u201cCovered claims\u201d does not include any obligations arising out of the issuance of an insurance policy written by the separate division of the State Compensation Insurance Fund pursuant to Sections 11802 and 11803.\n(11) \u201cCovered claims\u201d does not include any obligations of the insolvent insurer arising from a policy or contract of insurance issued or renewed prior to the insolvent insurer\u2019s admission to transact insurance in the State of California.\n(12) \u201cCovered claims\u201d does not include surplus deposits of subscribers as defined in Section 1374.1.\n(13) \u201cCovered claims\u201d shall also include obligations arising under an insurance policy written to indemnify a permissibly self-insured employer pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 3700 of the Labor Code for its liability to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits in excess of a specific or aggregate retention. However, for purposes of this article, those claims shall not be considered workers\u2019 compensation claims and therefore are subject to the per-claim limit in paragraph (7), and any payments and expenses related thereto shall be allocated to category (c) for claims other than workers\u2019 compensation, homeowners, and automobile, as provided in Section 1063.5.\nThese provisions shall apply to obligations arising under a policy as described herein issued to a permissibly self-insured employer or group of self-insured employers pursuant to Section 3700 of the Labor Code and notwithstanding any other provision of this code, those obligations shall be governed by this provision in the event that the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund is ordered to assume the liabilities of a permissibly self-insured employer or group of self-insured employers pursuant to Section 3701.5 of the Labor Code. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to insurance policies written to indemnify a permissibly self-insured employer or group of self-insured employers under subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 3700 of the Labor Code, for its liability to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits in excess of a specific or aggregate retention, and this paragraph does not apply to special excess workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies unless issued pursuant to authority granted in subdivision (c) of Section 3702.8 of the Labor Code, and as provided for in subparagraph (G) of paragraph (3). In addition, this paragraph does not apply to any claims servicing agreement or insurance policy providing retroactive insurance of a known loss or losses as are excluded in subparagraph (G) of paragraph (3).\nEach permissibly self-insured employer or group of self-insured employers, or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund, shall, to the extent required by the Labor Code, be responsible for paying, adjusting, and defending each claim arising under policies of insurance covered under this section, unless the benefits paid on a claim exceed the specific or aggregate retention, in which case:\n(A) If the benefits paid on the claim exceed the specific or aggregate retention, and the policy requires the insurer to defend and adjust the claim, the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) shall be solely responsible for adjusting and defending the claim, and shall make all payments due under the claim, subject to the limitations and exclusions of this article with regard to covered claims. As to each claim subject to this paragraph, notwithstanding any other provisions of this code or the Labor Code, and regardless of whether the amount paid by CIGA is adequate to discharge a claim obligation, neither the self-insured employer, group of self-insured employers, nor the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund shall have any obligation to pay benefits over and above the specific or aggregate retention, except as provided in this subdivision.\n(B) If the benefits paid on the claim exceed the specific or aggregate retention, and the policy does not require the insurer to defend and adjust the claim, the permissibly self-insured employer or group of self-insured employers, or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund, shall not have any further payment obligations with respect to the claim, but shall continue defending and adjusting the claim, and shall have the right, but not the obligation, in any proceeding to assert all applicable statutory limitations and exclusions as contained in this article with regard to the covered claim. CIGA shall have the right, but not the obligation, to intervene in any proceeding where the self-insured employer, group of self-insured employers, or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund is defending a claim and shall be permitted to raise the appropriate statutory limitations and exclusions as contained in this article with respect to covered claims. Regardless of whether the self-insured employer or group of self-insured employers, or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund, asserts the applicable statutory limitations and exclusions, or whether CIGA intervenes in a proceeding, CIGA shall be solely responsible for paying all benefits due on the claim, subject to the exclusions and limitations of this article with respect to covered claims. As to each claim subject to this paragraph, notwithstanding any other provision of the Insurance Code or the Labor Code and regardless of whether the amount paid by CIGA is adequate to discharge a claim obligation, neither the self-insured employer, group of self-insured employers, nor the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund, shall have an obligation to pay benefits over and above the specific or aggregate retention, except as provided in this subdivision.\n(C) In the event that the benefits paid on the covered claim exceed the per-claim limit in paragraph (7), the responsibility for paying, adjusting, and defending the claim shall be returned to the permissibly self-insured employer or group of employers, or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund.\nThese provisions shall apply to all pending and future insolvencies. For purposes of this paragraph, a pending insolvency is one involving a company that is currently receiving benefits from the guarantee association.\n(14) \u201cCovered claims\u201d shall include any claims filed by an employee of a general employer that has entered into a contractual relationship with a special employer who is a self-insured governmental entity and has satisfied the provisions of paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 3602 of the Labor Code. In no event is the self-insurance of a special employer governmental entity to be considered other insurance for purposes of this article if the provisions of paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 3602 of the Labor Code are required by contractual agreement between the general employer and the special employer. The contractual agreement shall be conclusive proof that the special employer never had the intent to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the employees of the general employer.\n(d) \u201cAdmitted to transact insurance in this state\u201d means an insurer possessing a valid certificate of authority issued by the department.\n(e) \u201cAffiliate\u201d means a person who directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insolvent insurer on December 31 of the year next preceding the date the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer.\n(f) \u201cControl\u201d means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract other than a commercial contract for goods or nonmanagement services, or otherwise, unless the power is the result of an official position with or corporate office held by the person. Control is presumed to exist if a person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10 percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. This presumption may be rebutted by showing that control does not in fact exist.\n(g) \u201cClaimant\u201d means an insured making a first party claim or a person instituting a liability claim. However, no person who is an affiliate of the insolvent insurer may be a claimant.\n(h) \u201cOcean marine insurance\u201d includes marine insurance as defined in Section 103, except for inland marine insurance, as well as any other form of insurance, regardless of the name, label, or marketing designation of the insurance policy, that insures against maritime perils or risks and other related perils or risks, that are usually insured against by traditional marine insurance such as hull and machinery, marine builders\u2019 risks, and marine protection and indemnity. Those perils and risks insured against include, without limitation, loss, damage, or expense or legal liability of the insured arising out of or incident to ownership, operation, chartering, maintenance, use, repair, or construction of a vessel, craft, or instrumentality in use in ocean or inland waterways, including liability of the insured for personal injury, illness, or death for loss or damage to the property of the insured or another person.\n(i) \u201cUnearned premium\u201d means that portion of a premium as calculated by the liquidator that had not been earned because of the cancellation of the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy and is that premium remaining for the unexpired term of the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy. \u201cUnearned premium\u201d does not include any amount sought as return of a premium under a policy providing retroactive insurance of a known loss or return of a premium under a retrospectively rated policy or a policy subject to a contingent surcharge or a policy in which the final determination of the premium cost is computed after expiration of the policy and is calculated on the basis of actual loss experienced during the policy period."
