    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) while blends of up to 10 percent ethanol are currently \n        required in the American motor fuels market as the result of \n        renewable fuels mandates and incentives for ethanol production \n        and use, significant environmental and energy research, \n        development, and demonstration is needed on the effects of \n        higher percentage ethanol blends before permitting widespread \n        use in the United States;\n            (2) government and industry testing suggests significant \n        negative environmental, safety, durability, health, and \n        performance effects for onroad and nonroad vehicles and \n        infrastructure resulting from use of mid-level ethanol blends \n        containing up to 15 percent ethanol; and\n            (3) the decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to \n        allow the use of mid-level ethanol blends in model year 2001 \n        and newer motor vehicles--\n                    (A) failed to consider the full spectrum of \n                available government and industry scientific and \n                technical research on such effects; and\n                    (B) relied on the results of a single study thereby \n                violating the Environmental Protection Agency's \n                scientific integrity principles.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Mid-level ethanol blend.--The term ``mid-level ethanol \n        blend'' means an ethanol-gasoline blend containing 15 or 20 \n        percent ethanol by volume that is intended to be used in any \n        conventional gasoline-powered motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle \n        or engine.\n\nSEC. 3. EVALUATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Prior to the implementation of any waiver, partial \nwaiver, or decision pursuant to current law and not later than 45 days \nafter enactment of this Act, the Administrator, acting through the \nAssistant Administrator of the Office of Research and Development at \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, shall enter into an agreement with \nthe National Academies to provide a comprehensive assessment of the \nscientific and technical research on the implications of the use of \nmid-level ethanol blends. This assessment should compare mid-level \nethanol blends to gasoline blends containing 10 and zero percent \nethanol.\n    (b) Contents.--The assessment performed under subsection (a) \nshall--\n            (1) evaluate the short-term and long-term environmental, \n        safety, durability, and performance effects of the introduction \n        of mid-level ethanol blends on onroad, nonroad and marine \n        engines, onroad and nonroad vehicles, and related equipment. \n        Such evaluation shall include a review of all available \n        scientific evidence, including all relevant government and \n        industry data and testing, including that relied upon by the \n        Administrator and published at 75 Fed. Reg. 68094 (November 4, \n        2010) and 76 Fed. Reg. 4662 (January 26, 2011), gaps in \n        understanding, and research needs related to--\n                    (A) tailpipe emissions;\n                    (B) evaporative emissions;\n                    (C) engine and fuel system durability;\n                    (D) on-board diagnostics;\n                    (E) emissions inventory and other modeling effects;\n                    (F) materials compatibility;\n                    (G) operability and drivability;\n                    (H) fuel efficiency;\n                    (I) catalyst durability; and\n                    (J) durability of storage tanks, piping and \n                dispensers for retail; and\n            (2) identify research and development, including testing, \n        necessary to permit existing motor fuels (distribution and \n        supply) infrastructure to handle mid-level ethanol blends while \n        preventing or mitigating against adverse impacts such as \n        corrosion of metal, plastic, rubber, or any other materials \n        used in pipes or storage tanks, ensuring fuel fungiblity, and \n        protecting against intentional and unintentional misfueling by \n        users at various points in the distribution and supply chain, \n        including--\n                    (A) bulk storage;\n                    (B) retail storage and distribution configurations; \n                and\n                    (C) standardization of a label consistent with \n                applicable technical standards and recommendations of \n                the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the \n                American National Standards Institute, and the \n                International Organization for Standardization.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the enactment of this \nAct, the National Academies shall submit to the Committee on Science, \nSpace, and Technology a report on the results of such assessment, \nincluding necessary research and development.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    In order to carry out this Act, the Administrator shall utilize up \nto $900,000 from the funds made available for research and development \nunder Public Law 96-569."
