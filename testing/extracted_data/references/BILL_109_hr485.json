SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Soda Ash Royalty Reduction Act of \n2005''.\n\nSEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The combination of global competitive pressures, flat \n        domestic demand, and spiraling costs of production threaten the \n        future of the United States soda ash industry.\n            (2) Despite booming world demand, growth in United States \n        exports of soda ash since 1997 has been flat, with most of the \n        world's largest markets for such growth, including Brazil, the \n        People's Republic of China, India, the countries of eastern \n        Europe, and the Republic of South Africa, have been closed by \n        protectionist policies.\n            (3) The People's Republic of China is the prime competitor \n        of the United States in soda ash production, and recently \n        supplanted the United States as the largest producer of soda \n        ash in the world.\n            (4) Over 700 jobs have been lost in the United States soda \n        ash industry since the Department of the Interior increased the \n        royalty rate on soda ash produced on Federal land, in 1996.\n            (5) Reduction of the royalty rate on soda ash produced on \n        Federal land will provide needed relief to the United States \n        soda ash industry and allow it to increase export growth and \n        competitiveness in emerging world markets, and create new jobs \n        in the United States.\n\nSEC. 203. REDUCTION IN ROYALTY RATE ON SODA ASH.\n\n    Notwithstanding section 102(a)(9) of the Federal Land Policy \nManagement Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701(a)(9)), section 24 of the \nMineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 262), and the terms of any lease under \nthat Act, the royalty rate on the quantity or gross value of the output \nof sodium compounds and related products at the point of shipment to \nmarket from Federal land in the 5-year period beginning on the date of \nthe enactment of this Act shall be 2 percent.\n\nSEC. 204. STUDY.\n\n    After the end of the 4-year period beginning on the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and before the end of the 5-year period \nbeginning on that date, the Secretary of the Interior shall report to \nthe Congress on the effects of the royalty reduction under this title, \nincluding--\n            (1) the amount of sodium compounds and related products at \n        the point of shipment to market from Federal land during that \n        4-year period;\n            (2) the number of jobs that have been created or maintained \n        during the royalty reduction period;\n            (3) the total amount of royalty paid to the United States \n        on the quantity or gross value of the output of sodium \n        compounds and related products at the point of shipment to \n        market produced during that 4-year period, and the portion of \n        such royalty paid to States; and\n            (4) a recommendation of whether the reduced royalty rate \n        should apply after the end of the 5-year period beginning on \n        the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives May 16, 2005.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 JEFF TRANDAHL,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
