On November 4, 2008, California citizens passed Proposition 8, which added new Section 7.5 to Article I of the California Constitution, and reads \"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" Below are links to selected resources from the California secretary of state that offer history and further information on California Proposition 22 and Proposition 8. Official Title and Summary prepared by the Attorney General http://primary2000.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22.htm Text of Proposition 22 http://primary2000.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22text.htm Analysis by the Legislative Analyst http://primary2000.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/22analysis.htm Official Title and Summary prepared by the Attorney General http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm Text of Proposition 8 http://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf#prop8 Analysis by the Legislative Analyst http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/analysis/prop8-analysis.htm On November 9, 2010, Edith Windsor filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York over the estate tax levied on her after the death of her partner, whom she had married in Canada. The complaint stated that the estate tax should be refunded as it had been \"levied on a married same-sex couple, which would not have applied to a married straight couple, and which consequently violates the United States Constitution.\" On February 23, 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to congressional leadership informing them that \"recent lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of DOMA Section 3 have caused the President and the Department to conduct a new examination of the defense of this provision\" and that the Department of Justice will cease defense of Section 3. As a result, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives filed a motion to intervene in the case, \"for the limited purpose of defending the constitutionality of Section III of the Defense of Marriage Act.\" On June 6, 2012, the district judge ruled that \"section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, 1 U.S.C. 7, is unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiff\" and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently upheld the lower court's ruling, stating \"Section 3 of DOMA violates equal protection and is therefore unconstitutional.\" On December 7, 2012, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case, U.S. v. Windsor , No. 12-307.  According to the petition for a writ of certiorari,  Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) defines the term 'marriage' for all purposes under federal law, including the provision of federal benefits, as 'only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.' 1 U.S.C. 7. It similarly defines the term 'spouse' as 'a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.' Ibid. The question presented is: whether Section 3 of DOMA violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of the laws as applied to persons of the same sex who are legally married under the laws of their State.  Additionally, the order granting certiorari states that  in addition to the question presented by the petition, the parties are directed to brief and argue the following questions: Whether the Executive Branch's agreement with the court below that DOMA in unconstitutional deprives this Court of jurisdiction to decide this case; and whether the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives has Article III standing in this case.

United States , 833 F. Supp. 2d 394 (S.D. N.Y.). http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PB-NY-0017-0002.pdf In 2008, California citizens voted on a proposed constitutional amendment titled \"Eliminates Rights of Same-Sex Couples to Marry.\" Better known as \"Proposition 8\" or \"Prop 8,\" the ballot initiative sought to add new Section 7.5 to Article I of the California Constitution, which reads \"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" Voters passed the proposition on November 4.  On November 19, 2008, the California Supreme Court agreed to hear three cases: Strauss v. Horton , Tyler v. California , and City and County of San Francisco v. Horton . On May 26, 2009, the court upheld the ban on same-sex marriage in Strauss v. Horton , concluding Prop 8 \"constitutes a permissible constitutional amendment,\" \"does not violate the separation of powers doctrine,\" and \"does not apply retroactively . \"  On May 22, 2009, several plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Northern District of California to \"enjoin, preliminarily and permanently, all enforcement of Proposition 8 and any other California statutes that seek to exclude gays and lesbians from access to civil marriage.\" In August 2010, the District Judge ruled that Proposition 8 \"fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license,\" and \"because Proposition 8 prevents California from fulfilling its constitutional obligation to provide marriages on an equal basis, the court concludes that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional.\" In February 2012, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing en banc, stating that the People of California \"may not employ the initiative power to single out a disfavored group for unequal treatment and strip them, without a legitimate justification, of a right as important as the right to marry,\" and \"accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\" On July 30, 2012, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case, Hollingsworth v. Perry , No. 12-144.  According to the petition for a writ of certiorari, the question presented by the case is whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the state of California from defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. In addition, the order granting certiorari states that \"in addition to the question presented by the petition, the parties are directed to brief and argue the following question: Whether petitioners have standing under Article III, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution in this case.\" For a more detailed legal analysis of this case, see CRS Report RL31994, Same-Sex Marriages: Legal Issues , by [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report R42976, Same-Sex Marriage and the Supreme Court: United States v.
