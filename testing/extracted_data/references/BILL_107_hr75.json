FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) At least one in five children and adolescents has a \n        diagnosable mental, emotional, or behavioral problem that can \n        lead to school failure, alcohol or other drug use, violence, or \n        suicide. Mental disorders that begin early in life have a \n        strong effect on future educational success. Adolescent \n        emotional problems may increase the likelihood of risk-taking \n        behaviors, including gun violence, drug abuse, reckless \n        driving, and early sexual activity.\n            (2) From a public health promotion/disease prevention \n        perspective, it is noteworthy that children and adolescents \n        with mental illnesses often don't become substance abusers \n        until 5 to 10 years after the mental illness becomes apparent. \n        This creates a window of opportunity during which time it may \n        be possible to prevent substance abuse from occurring in these \n        children.\n            (3) The interaction of multiple factors has increased the \n        overall number of children suffering from psychological, \n        emotional and behavioral disorders. Children as a group suffer \n        from poverty at a higher rate than all other age groups. More \n        than one in three children are raised in single-parent \n        households. Children over the age of 10 years are frequently \n        caring for themselves after school and sometimes into the \n        evening before their parents or other caregivers arrive. These \n        factors create greater problems with children's emotional \n        development.\n            (4) The combination of witnessing and experiencing \n        traumatic events, poverty, alienation, and multiple \n        environmental and family factors including abuse and neglect, \n        creates greater psychological neglect and social isolation, \n        further contributing to various mental health problems. The \n        combination of these factors in an emotionally unhealthy \n        climate combined with the availability of firearms can produce \n        deadly results.\n            (5) In many urban, poor and predominantly minority \n        communities, young children are chronically exposed to serious \n        violent crime during their formative years. It is the recent \n        school violence in suburban and rural communities that has \n        increased awareness about the prevalence of violence in the \n        lives of America's children. Increasingly, in the home, \n        community and at school, children are affected by or involved \n        in theft, vandalism, bullying, intimidation, intolerance, and \n        disruption.\n            (6) While the above behaviors are symptomatic of mental \n        health problems requiring service interventions, most children \n        with mental health problems are not violent to others. They are \n        more likely than their peers to be the recipients of \n        intimidation and violence, and are the largest, most neglected \n        group of children suffering from serious illness or disability.\n            (7) Only one in five children with a serious emotional \n        disturbance receive mental health specialty services, although \n        twice as many such children receive some form of mental health \n        intervention. Thus, about 75 to 80 percent fail to receive \n        specialty services, and the majority of these children fail to \n        receive any services at all.\n            (8) Mental health is indispensable to personal well-being, \n        family and interpersonal relationships, and contribution to \n        community or society. From early childhood until death, mental \n        health is the basis for thinking and communication skills, \n        learning, emotional growth, resilience, and self-esteem.\n            (9) Mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders lead to \n        irregular school attendance, difficulty with concentration, \n        focus, and motivation to learn basic academic fundamentals.\n            (10) Prevention programs, early intervention, help from the \n        faith-based community, and mental health services in the \n        family, school, and community setting have proven successful \nand cost-effective using both school and community resources for \nreducing the neglected tragedy of mental, emotional and behavioral \nproblems among youth.\n            (11) Mental health services personnel can provide \n        consultation with teachers to improve classroom environment and \n        provide guidance around specific children. Consulting with \n        parents, they enable teachers and families to work together, \n        increasing the family's involvement in their child's academic \n        performance and psychosocial development.\n            (12) The lack of mental health services in schools and \n        communities where the greatest need exists has resulted in a \n        disproportionate increase in children dropping out of school, \n        becoming involved in delinquent activity, and becoming part of \n        the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems. In fact, \n        because of the lack of intervention and mental health services, \n        more children are being certified to be tried as adults and are \n        being subjected to incarceration in the juvenile or adult \ncriminal justice systems. These issues impact especially minority \npopulations and those living in poverty.\n            (13) Little effort has previously been directed toward \n        promoting the development of mental health, recognizing signs \n        of early problems and providing early intervention to \n        ameliorate these problems.\n\nSEC. 3. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND THEIR \n              FAMILIES.\n\n    Title V of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290aa et seq.) \nis amended by inserting after section 520A the following section:\n\n``SEC. 520B.
