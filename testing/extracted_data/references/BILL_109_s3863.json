FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Most recipients of assistance under the Temporary \n        Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program established under \n        part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et \n        seq.) and individuals moving toward self-sufficiency operate \n        outside the financial mainstream, paying high costs to handle \n        their finances and saving little for emergencies or the future.\n            (2) Personal debt levels and bankruptcy filing rates are \n        high and savings rates are at their lowest levels in 70 years. \n        In 2005, the savings rate was negative. The inability of many \n        households to budget, save, and invest prevents them from \n        laying the foundation for a secure financial future.\n            (3) Financial planning can help families meet near-term \n        obligations and maximize their longer-term well being, \n        especially valuable for populations that have traditionally \n        been underserved by our financial system.\n            (4) Economic and financial education can give individuals \n        the necessary financial tools to create household budgets, \n        initiate savings plans, and acquire assets.\n            (5) Economic and financial education can prevent vulnerable \n        customers from becoming entangled in financially devastating \n        credit arrangements.\n            (6) Economic and financial education that addresses abusive \n        lending practices targeted at specific neighborhoods or \n        vulnerable segments of the population can prevent unaffordable \n        payments, equity stripping, and foreclosure.\n            (7) Economic and financial education speaks to the broader \n        purpose of the TANF Program to equip individuals with the tools \n        to succeed and support themselves and their families in self-\n        sufficiency.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To promote economic and financial literacy among \n        individuals receiving assistance under Temporary Assistance for \n        Needy Families programs funded under part A of title IV of the \n        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) by permitting \n        States to include economic and financial literacy education \n        that is provided directly to individuals as a work activity \n        under such programs.\n            (2) To provide individuals receiving assistance under \n        Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs funded under \n        part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et \n        seq.) with the skills and knowledge needed to effectively \n        address personal financial matters and to make financial \n        choices that will lead such individuals toward becoming \n        financially self-sufficient.\n\nSEC. 3.
