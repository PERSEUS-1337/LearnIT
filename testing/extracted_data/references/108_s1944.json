    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Israeli-Palestinian Peace \nEnhancement Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The security of the State of Israel is a major and \n        enduring national security interest of the United States.\n            (2) A lasting peace in the Middle East region, which Israel \n        desperately seeks, can only take root in an atmosphere free of \n        violence and terrorism.\n            (3) The Palestinian people have been ill-served by leaders \n        who, by resorting to violence and terrorism to pursue their \n        political objectives, have brought economic and personal \n        hardship to their people and brought a halt to efforts seeking \n        a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\n            (4) The United States has an interest in a Middle East in \n        which two states, Israel and Palestine, will live side by side \n        in peace and security.\n            (5) In his speech of June 24, 2002, and in other \n        statements, President George W. Bush outlined a comprehensive \n        vision of the possibilities of peace in the Middle East region \n        following a change in Palestinian leadership.\n            (6) President Bush stated in his June 24, 2002, speech that \n        ``a stable and peaceful Palestinian state is necessary to \n        achieve the security that Israel longs for,'' and Israel has \n        committed itself to concrete steps to achieve that end.\n            (7) The Palestinian state must be a reformed, peaceful, and \n        democratic state that abandons forever the use of terror.\n            (8) Israel has repeatedly indicated its willingness to make \n        painful concessions to achieve peace once there is a partner \n        for peace on the Palestinian side.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to express the sense of Congress with respect to United \n        States recognition of a Palestinian state;\n            (2) to encourage the emergence of a Palestinian leadership \n        that is capable of achieving the reforms outlined by President \n        Bush, including making peace with Israel, combating all forms \n        of terrorism, and developing a peaceful, democratic Palestinian \n        state; and\n            (3) to demonstrate United States willingness to provide \n        substantial economic and humanitarian assistance, and to \n        support large-scale multilateral assistance, to a peaceful, \n        democratic Palestinian state, after the Palestinians have \n        achieved the reforms outlined by President Bush and have \n        achieved peace with Israel.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) peace between Israel and the Palestinians cannot be \n        achieved until the Palestinian system of government has been \n        transformed along the lines outlined in President Bush's June \n        24, 2002, speech;\n            (2) substantial United States and international economic \n        assistance will be needed after the Palestinians have achieved \n        the reforms described in section 620K(c)(2) of the Foreign \n        Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by section 6 of this Act) and \n        have made a lasting and secure peace with Israel;\n            (3) any new Palestinian administration urgently should take \n        the necessary security-related steps to allow for \n        implementation of a performance-based road map to resolve the \n        Israeli-Palestinian conflict;\n            (4) the United States Administration should work vigorously \n        toward the goal of two states living side-by-side in peace \n        within secure and internationally-recognized boundaries free \n        from threats or acts of force; and\n            (5) the United States has a vital national security \n        interest in a permanent, comprehensive, and just resolution of \n        the Arab-Israeli conflict, and particularly the Palestinian-\n        Israeli conflict, based on the terms of United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolutions 242 and 338.\n\nSEC. 5. RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE.\n\n     It is the sense of Congress that a Palestinian state should not be \nrecognized by the United States until the President determines that--\n            (1) a new leadership of a Palestinian governing entity, not \n        compromised by terrorism, has been elected and taken office; \n        and\n            (2) the newly-elected Palestinian governing entity--\n                    (A) has demonstrated a firm and tangible commitment \n                to peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel and to \n                ending anti-Israel incitement, including the cessation \n                of all officially sanctioned or funded anti-Israel \n                incitement;\n                    (B) has taken sustained and effective measures to \n                counter terrorism and terrorist financing in the West \n                Bank and Gaza, including the dismantling of the \nterrorist infrastructure and the confiscation of unlawful weaponry;\n                    (C) has established one unified Palestinian \n                security entity that is fully cooperating with the \n                appropriate Israeli security organizations;\n                    (D) has achieved exclusive authority and \n                responsibility for governing the national affairs of a \n                Palestinian state, has taken effective steps to ensure \n                democracy, the rule of law, and an independent \n                judiciary, and has adopted other reforms ensuring \n                transparent and accountable governance; and\n                    (E) has taken effective steps to ensure that its \n                education and communications systems promote the \n                acceptance of Israel's existence and of peace with \n                Israel and actively discourage anti-Israel incitement.\n\nSEC. 6. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO A PALESTINIAN STATE.\n\n    Chapter 1 of part III of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \nU.S.C. 2351 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating the second section 620G (as added by \n        section 149 of Public Law 104-164 (110 Stat. 1436)) as section \n        620J; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 620K.
