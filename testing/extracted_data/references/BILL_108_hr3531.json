FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Coal mining has been an important part of America's \n        industrial heritage for over 150 years. As coal is removed from \n        underground mines, a large amount of other materials \n        accompanies the coal to the surface. This substance, known as \n        gob, contains a mixture of clay, rocks, soil, minerals and \n        other raw materials. The gob piles contain millions of cubic \n        feet of material known to contribute to acid mine drainage.\n            (2) The mountains of gob contain large amounts of potential \n        energy that can be recycled to create new sources of power. The \n        technology to use the gob pile materials as an efficient \n        alternative energy source has been developed over the past 15 \n        years. However, the incentive to invest in the technology has \n        not been pursued due to the high capitalization and operating \n        costs.\n            (3) Developing alternate energy sources reduces energy \n        costs, reduces dependencies on foreign oil, and improves the \n        competitiveness of American industry. Increasing energy \n        demands, and over reliance on limited sources of energy, will \n        result in higher prices for homeowners and industry. Higher \n        production costs hurt American jobs, overburdens industry, and \n        stifles economic growth. The development of alternate energy \n        sources will result in lower prices, a cleaner environment, new \n        manufacturing, and more jobs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage and create \nincentives for alternate fuel sources to meet increasing demand for \nhomeowners and industries.\n\nSEC. 3. ENERGY PRODUCED FROM WASTE COAL.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to business related \ncredits) is amended by inserting after section 45F the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 45G. ENERGY PRODUCED FROM WASTE COAL.\n\n    ``(a) General Rule.--For purposes of section 38, the waste coal \nenergy production per ton credit for any taxable year is an amount \nequal to $1.50 per million Btu of heat input utilized by the taxpayer \nto produce energy in an eligible facility from qualified waste coal \nduring the 10-year period beginning on the date the facility was \noriginally placed in service (or, if later, the date of the enactment \nof this section).\n    ``(b) Credit Reduced for Grants.--The amount of the credit \ndetermined under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any \ntaxable year shall be reduced by the amount which is the product of the \namount so determined for such year and a fraction--\n            ``(1) the numerator of which is the sum, for the taxable \n        year and all prior taxable years, of--\n                    ``(A) grants provided by the United States, a \n                State, or a political subdivision of a State for use in \n                connection with the project, and\n                    ``(B) the amount of any other credit allowable with \n                respect to any property which is part of the project, \n                and\n            ``(2) the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of \n        additions to the capital account for the project for the \n        taxable year and all prior taxable years. The amounts under the \n        preceding sentence for any taxable year shall be determined as \n        of the close of the taxable year.\n    ``(c) Qualified Waste Coal.--\n            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the term \n        `qualified waste coal' means coal certified by the Secretary to \n        be waste (as defined in paragraphs (1) through (6) of section \n        292.202 of title 18, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect \n        on the date of the enactment of this section)).\n            ``(2) Certification process.--For purposes of paragraph \n        (1), coal may not be certified as waste coal unless application \n        therefor is submitted before the end of the 6-month period \n        beginning on the date of the enactment of this section to the \n        Secretary.\n    ``(d) Eligible Facility.--For purposes of this section--\n            ``(1) In general.--The term `eligible facility' means a \n        facility--\n                    ``(A) whose heat input is not less than 75 percent \n                from qualified waste coal, and\n                    ``(B) which, as of the date on which the Secretary \n                determines by private letter ruling that the taxpayer \n                is eligible for the allowance of the credit under this \n                section, has under its control, by ownership or lease, \n                not less than a 15-year supply of qualified waste coal, \n                and\n                    ``(C) which is placed in service not more than 42 \n                months after the month in which the taxpayer receives \n                the private letter ruling referred to in subparagraph \n                (B).\n            ``(2) Private letter ruling.--For purposes of paragraph \n        (1)(B), a private letter ruling shall not be taken into account \n        unless the request therefor is submitted to the Secretary \n        within 30 days after the date on which the taxpayer receives \n        the certification required by subsection (b).\n    ``(e) Other Definition and Applicable Rules.--For purposes of this \nsection--\n            ``(1) Heat content.--Heat content shall be determined on an \n        `as received' basis.\n            ``(2) Applicable rules.--Rules similar to the rules of \n        section 45(d) (other than paragraph (2)) shall apply.\n            ``(3) Force majeure.--Performance time requirements \n        specified in this section may be suspended by the Secretary for \n        reasons beyond the control of the taxpayer when the Secretary \n        is so requested to extend deadlines by the taxpayer as long as \n        the taxpayer makes such request within 72 hours of determining \n        such event has occurred.
