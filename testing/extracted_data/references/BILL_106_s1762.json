Since the requirements for accomplishing the rehabilitation \nare generally for public health and safety reasons, in many instances \nbeing mandated by other State or Federal laws, a benefit-cost ratio \ngreater than 1 shall not be required. The benefits of and the \nrequirements for the rehabilitation project shall be documented to \nensure the wise and responsible use of Federal funds.\n    ``(g) Ranking of Requests for Rehabilitation Assistance.--The \nSecretary shall establish such system of approving rehabilitation \nrequests, recognizing that such requests will be received throughout \nthe fiscal year and subject to the availability of funds to carry out \nthis section, as is necessary for proper administration by the \nDepartment of Agriculture and equitable for all eligible local \norganizations.
