FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In many of the units of the National Forest System, \n        current conditions, such as heavy fuel loads, tree density, and \n        increased threats from catastrophic fires, disease, and insect \n        infestations, adversely affect the biodiversity, health, and \n        sustainability of the forest ecosystems of such units.\n            (2) The current authority granted to resource managers of \n        units of the National Forest System does not provide for the \n        distribution of revenues from the sale of timber and other \n        forest products to accomplish ecosystem restoration work under \n        a single contract.\n            (3) A new and innovative contracting process for the \n        National Forest System is required to meet Federal goals of \n        improving forest resource conditions through implementation of \n        ecosystem management.\n            (4) The improvement of the forest resource is important to \n        the long-term viability of species found on National Forest \n        System lands.\n            (5) Ecosystem restoration work performed as part of a \n        timber sale contract would improve employment opportunities in \n        communities near units of the National Forest System to the \n        benefit of long-term economic health and community stability.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To improve and restore the health of forest resources \n        through implementation of ecosystem management.\n            (2) To provide for employment opportunities and economic \n        stability for communities near units of the National Forest \n        System.\n            (3) To provide for needed flexibility in procurement and \n        funding practices and in the distribution of revenues from \n        timber and other forest products to assist in implementation of \n        ecosystem management.\n            (4) To provide the Secretary of Agriculture with the \n        authority to enter into stewardship contracts to achieve \n        management requirements prescribed in the following provisions \n        of law:\n                    (A) The Act of June 4, 1897 (commonly known as the \n                Organic Administration Act; 16 U.S.C. 473-475, 477-482, \n                551).\n                    (B) The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 \n                (16 U.S.C. 528-531).\n                    (C) The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources \n                Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614).\n                    (D) Section 14 of the National Forest Management \n                Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a).\n                    (E) The Act of May 23, 1908, and section 13 of the \n                Act of March 1, 1911 (16 U.S.C. 500).\n    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Account.--The term ``Account'' means the Stewardship \n        Account established under section 5.\n            (2) Stewardship contract.--The term ``stewardship \n        contract'' means a contract under which receipts from the sale \n        of timber or other forest products are available to finance \n        other resource activities for the improvement and restoration \n        of forest ecosystems of units of the National Forest System.\n            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Agriculture.\n            (4) Resource activities.--The term ``resource activities'' \n        includes site preparation, replanting, fish and wildlife \n        habitat enhancement, silvi-cultural treatments, watershed \n        improvement, fuel treatments (including prescribed burning), \n        and road obliteration.\n            (5) Resource manager.--The term `resource manager' refers \n        to the line officer responsible for management decisios \n        associated with project implementation on a unit of a national \n        forest.\n\nSEC. 3.
