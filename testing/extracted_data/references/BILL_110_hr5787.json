FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In January 2003, the Government Accountability Office \n        identified Federal real property as a high-risk area, citing \n        excess property as a long-standing problem.\n            (2) The magnitude of the problem with excess Federal real \n        property continues to put the government at risk for lost \n        dollars and missed opportunities.\n            (3) The Administration has stated its goal is to reduce the \n        size of the Federal real property inventory by 5 percent, or \n        $15 billion, by disposing of unneeded assets by 2015.\n            (4) The Federal inventory includes many properties that are \n        no longer relevant to agencies' missions and agencies are \n        spending billions of dollars to maintain these unneeded \n        properties.\n            (5) The costs of preparing a property for transfer or sale \n        continue to hamper some agencies' efforts to address their \n        unneeded properties and serve as a disincentive to disposal \n        because, in the short-term, it can be more beneficial \n        economically to maintain a property that is not being used than \n        to dispose of it.\n            (6) Agencies should give greater attention to right-sizing \n        their real property portfolios.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reduce the Federal \ninventory of unneeded and costly property.\n\nSEC. 3.
