FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the fair administration of justice depends on the \n        ability of all participants in a courtroom proceeding to \n        understand that proceeding, regardless of their English \n        proficiency;\n            (2) 21 percent of the population of the United States over \n        5 years of age speaks a language other than English at home;\n            (3) only qualified and certified court interpreters can \n        ensure that persons with limited English proficiency comprehend \n        judicial proceedings in which they are a party;\n            (4) the knowledge and skills required of a qualified court \n        interpreter differ substantially from those required in other \n        interpretation settings, such as social service, medical, \n        diplomatic, and conference settings;\n            (5) the Federal Government has demonstrated its commitment \n        to equal administration of justice, regardless of English \n        proficiency;\n            (6) regulations implementing title VI of the Civil Rights \n        Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), as well as the guidance \n        issued by the Department of Justice pursuant to Executive Order \n        13166, issued August 11, 2000, clarify that all recipients of \n        Federal financial assistance, including State courts, are \n        required to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access \n        to their proceedings for persons with limited English \n        proficiency;\n            (7) 43 States have developed, or are developing, qualified \n        court interpreter programs;\n            (8) a robust and effective court interpreter program--\n                    (A) actively recruits skilled individuals to serve \n                as court interpreters;\n                    (B) trains those individuals in the interpretation \n                of court proceedings;\n                    (C) develops and uses a thorough, systematic \n                certification process for court interpreters;\n                    (D) has sufficient funding to ensure that a \n                qualified and certified interpreter will be available \n                to the court whenever necessary; and\n                    (E) efficiently uses funding to create substantial \n                cost savings; and\n            (9) Federal funding is necessary to--\n                    (A) encourage State courts that do not have court \n                interpreter programs to develop them;\n                    (B) assist State courts with nascent court \n                interpreter programs to implement them;\n                    (C) assist State courts with limited court \n                interpreter programs to enhance them; and\n                    (D) assist State courts with robust court \n                interpreter programs to make further improvements and \n                share successful cost saving programs with other \n                States.\n\nSEC. 3.
