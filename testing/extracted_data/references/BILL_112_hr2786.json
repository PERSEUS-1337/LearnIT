SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Survivors Assistance Act \nof 2011''.\n\n            TITLE I--PURPOSES; FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS; GRANTS\n\nSEC. 101. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to include ``older individuals who are Holocaust \n        survivors'' to the list of groups that receive preference for \n        services as defined in section 305(a)(2)(E) of the Older \n        Americans Act of 1965,\n            (2) to designate within the Administration on Aging an \n        individual to have responsibility for older individuals who are \n        Holocaust survivors, and\n            (3) to create a grant program to increase and improve \n        transportation services for older individuals with preference \n        to those older individuals who are Holocaust survivors.\n\nSEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) During the Holocaust, which took place between 1933 and \n        1945, an estimated 6,000,000 Jews, as well as millions from \n        other targeted groups, were murdered by the Nazis and their \n        collaborators.\n            (2) Approximately 127,000 Holocaust survivors remain in the \n        United States, and thousands pass away each year.\n            (3) Holocaust survivors are getting older and frailer, and \n        will be seeking additional support and assistance from social \n        service providers to enable them to age in place. Providers \n        face increased levels of demand from vulnerable individuals \n        without any additional revenue to cover needed services.\n            (4) All Holocaust survivors are at least 65 years old with \n        approximately three quarters of them older than 75 and a \n        majority in their 80s and 90s.\n            (5) More than half of all Holocaust survivors who emigrated \n        to the United States from the former Soviet Union after 1965 \n        fall beneath 200 percent of the Federal poverty threshold and \n        constitute an extremely vulnerable at-risk population in the \n        United States.\n            (6) Holocaust survivors continue to live with the mental \n        and physical scars of the unconscionable trauma caused by the \n        Holocaust.\n            (7) While institutionalized settings are beneficial for \n        some older people, long-term care facilities can have an \n        adverse effect on Holocaust survivors. For many Holocaust \n        survivors, institutionalized settings reintroduce sights, \n        sounds, smells, emotions and routines which can induce panic, \n        anxiety, and re-traumatization as a result of experiences \n        resulting from the Holocaust.\n            (8) Approximately two-thirds of Holocaust survivors live \n        alone and living alone is a risk factor for \n        institutionalization.\n            (9) Low income Holocaust survivors are more reliant on \n        social service programs than most other older Americans, with \n        proportionally more Holocaust survivors needing services such \n        as personal care, home-delivered and congregate meals, \n        transportation, counseling and mental health support.\n\nSEC. 103. DEFINITION.\n\n    Section 102 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3002) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(55) The term `Holocaust survivor' means an individual \n        who--\n                    ``(A)(i) lived in a country between 1933 and 1945 \n                under a Nazi regime, under Nazi occupation, or under \n                the control of Nazi collaborators; or\n                    ``(ii) fled from a country between 1933 and 1945 \n                under a Nazi regime; under Nazi occupation, or under \n                the control of Nazi collaborators;\n                    ``(B) was persecuted between 1933 and 1945 on the \n                basis of race, religion, physical or mental disability, \n                sexual orientation, political affiliation, ethnicity, \n                or other basis; and\n                    ``(C) was a member of a group that was persecuted \n                by the Nazis.''.\n\nSEC. 104.
