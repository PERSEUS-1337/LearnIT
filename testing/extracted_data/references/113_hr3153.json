FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Too many juveniles are introduced to the formal \n        criminal justice system for minor behavioral infractions at \n        school.\n            (2) Common behavioral infractions at school often result in \n        suspension, expulsion, or incarceration of the juvenile \n        students involved.\n            (3) Zero-tolerance school discipline policies increase the \n        number of incarcerated juveniles.\n            (4) Research shows that juveniles who are incarcerated are \n        significantly less likely to complete secondary school, \n        experience less human capital development and diminished \n        earnings potential, and are more likely to recidivate and be \n        incarcerated as adults.\n\nSEC. 3.
