FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Domestic violence and sexual assault represent serious \n        threats to the health and well-being of millions of women in \n        the United States.\n            (2) Violence against women has serious health consequences \n        for its victims, including fatality, severe trauma, repeated \n        physical injuries, and chronic stress-related disorder.\n            (3) Violence against women has serious mental health \n        consequences for its victims, including substance abuse, severe \n        psychological trauma, and suicide.\n            (4) Approximately 4,000,000 women in the United States are \n        victims of domestic violence each year.\n            (5) One of two women is a victim of domestic violence or \n        sexual assault during her lifetime.\n            (6) Battering is the leading cause of injury to women.\n            (7) It has been estimated that 1 in 6 pregnant women are \n        battered, resulting in increased rates of miscarriage, \n        stillbirths, and low-birthweight babies.\n            (8) Domestic violence may account for as much as one-third \n        of emergency-room visits by women, an annual total of \n        approximately 28,700 such visits.\n            (9) Estimates based on the National Crime Survey provide \n        that domestic violence accounts for 21,000 hospitalizations, \n        99,800 days of hospitalization, and 39,900 visits to a \n        physician each year.\n            (10) Fewer than 5 percent of injured women are correctly \n        diagnosed by medical personnel as being victims of domestic \n        violence.\n            (11) Hospitals and clinics do not have a uniform set of \n        protocols for the identification and referral of victims of \n        domestic violence and sexual assault, or for the training of \n        health care professionals to perform such functions.\n            (12) A national surveillance system for monitoring the \n        health effects of domestic violence and sexual assault should \n        be established to determine the nature and extent of such \n        violence and assault in the United States.\n            (13) The Surgeon General has identified domestic violence \n        as a public health problem to which all health care providers \n        must actively and vigorously respond.\n            (14) Estimates of the percentage of male batterers who also \n        abuse their children range from 50 percent to 75 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.
