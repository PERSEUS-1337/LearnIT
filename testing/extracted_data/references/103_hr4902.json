FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there exists a small but extremely dangerous group of \n        sexually violent persons who do not have a mental disease or \n        defect;\n            (2) persons who are sexually violent predators generally \n        have antisocial personality features that--\n                    (A) are not amenable to mental illness treatment \n                modalities in existence on the date of enactment of \n                this Act; and\n                    (B) render the persons likely to engage in sexually \n                violent behavior;\n            (3) the likelihood that sexually violent predators will \n        repeat acts of predatory sexual violence is high; and\n            (4) the prognosis for curing sexually violent predators is \n        poor and the treatment needs of the population of the predators \n        are very long-term.\n\nSEC. 3.
