FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for \n        regulating civil aviation in the United States.\n            (2) Each State is responsible for the regulation of public \n        health planning and protection, patient safety and protection, \n        emergency medical services, the quality and coordination of \n        medical care, and the practice of medicine within its \n        jurisdiction.\n            (3) Helicopter medical services are an essential component \n        of the health care delivery and emergency medical services \n        system in each State and are integral to each State's \n        management of public health planning and protection, patient \n        safety and protection, emergency medical services, the quality \n        and coordination of medical care, and the practice of medicine \n        within the State's jurisdiction.\n            (4) Existing or future regulation of helicopter medical \n        services by the several States is in the public interest.\n            (5) Helicopter medical services represent a unique and \n        discrete area of air transportation because those services \n        present issues involving the adequacy and availability of \n        medical services to patients.\n            (6) Court rulings and statutory interpretations issued by \n        the Secretary of Transportation have imposed limitations on, \n        impeded, or prevented, the ability of States to effectively \n        regulate helicopter medical services in a manner similar to the \n        regulation of other health care services by the States.\n            (7) Those rulings and interpretations have concluded that \n        certain State actions related to public health planning and \n        protection, patient safety and protection, emergency medical \n        services, the quality and coordination of medical care, and the \n        practice of medicine, and related aspects of helicopter medical \n        services, are preempted by Federal law, either pursuant to the \n        preemption provisions of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 \n        (Public Law 95-504; 92 Stat. 1705) or through the application \n        of the ``field occupation'' preemption doctrine.\n            (8) The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 did not \n        contemplate helicopter medical services, and the use of the Act \n        to strike down intrastate health-related regulations overseeing \n        the provision of helicopter medical services that would \n        otherwise be permissible with respect to any other segment of \n        the health care industry is not in the public interest.\n            (9) At the same time, it is also important to ensure that \n        the Federal Aviation Administration's plenary and exclusive \n        jurisdiction over matters of aviation safety is not infringed \n        by any State. Accordingly, any State health-related regulation \n        of helicopter medical services must be harmonized and shall not \n        be inconsistent with Federal regulation of aviation safety \n        because the safe operation of the helicopter medical services \n        flight is of paramount importance.\n            (10) Accordingly, there is a need for clarification of \n        existing Federal law so that States may regulate helicopter \n        medical services with respect to public health planning and \n        protection, patient safety and protection, emergency medical \n        services, the quality and coordination of medical care, and the \n        practice of medicine without infringing on the Federal \n        government's plenary power to regulate aviation safety.\n\nSEC. 3.
