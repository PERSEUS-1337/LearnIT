FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is a severe shortage of capital available and \n        targeted for investment in the United States minority business \n        marketplace and that such shortage constitutes a ``capital \n        gap'';\n            (2) the capital gap is a significant barrier to increased \n        minority entrepreneurship, employment, and economic \n        development;\n            (3) the development of targeted venture capital resources \n        is an important and needed stimulus for economic development, \n        employment growth, and wealth creation;\n            (4) existing Federal incentives are inadequate to address \n        the capital gap;\n            (5) the existing system of federally regulated specialized \n        small business investment companies (and similar public and \n        private entities who support and invest in the minority small \n        business marketplace) should be fully utilized to aggregate and \n        efficiently deploy new capital investments; and\n            (6) it is essential, and should be a high priority of the \n        United States Government, to pursue a broad array of Federal \n        tax and other domestic policies that will serve as a catalyst \n        for the creation of capital pools for investment in the \n        minority enterprise marketplace.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) authorize a Federal tax credit for investment in \n        qualified minority fund interests;\n            (2) increase the availability of venture capital for \n        minority small business;\n            (3) strengthen existing public and private minority venture \n        capital financial institutions (as well as to encourage the \n        formation of such new institutions); and\n            (4) through these actions, support minority enterprise and \n        economic development, increase minority entrepreneurship and \n        employment, and to enhance the opportunities for minority \n        persons to participate fully in the free enterprise system.\n\nSEC. 3.
