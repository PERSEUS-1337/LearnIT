PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to decrease substantially the likelihood \nof the intentional use of nuclear weapons, or their unintentional use \nas a result of accident, miscalculation, unauthorized action, or \nterrorist activity.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF WARHEADS IN \n              ARSENALS OF UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA.\n\n    (a) Repeal of Prohibition Against Reductions.--Section 1302 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law \n105-85) is repealed.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \nreduce the number of nuclear warheads and nuclear weapons delivery \nsystems of the United States and Russia, through bilateral agreements \nbetween the United States and Russia, to the lowest possible number \nconsistent with the national security of the United States. Any \nbilateral agreement for purposes of that policy shall provide for \ntransparency, predictability, and verification of the reductions.\n    (c) Implementation of Reductions.--In effecting any reduction in \nthe number of nuclear warheads of the United States, it shall be the \npolicy of the United States--\n            (1) that such reductions be intended as permanent \n        reductions in the United States nuclear weapons force, in \n        keeping with the purposes and objectives of the Nuclear \n        Nonproliferation Treaty;\n            (2) that if the President makes unilateral reductions in \n        the United States nuclear weapons force, such reductions should \n        be intended to facilitate bilateral agreement with Russia, and \n        the President should undertake diplomatic efforts to convince \n        Russia to undertake parallel or commensurate reductions in its \n        nuclear weapons force; and\n            (3) that the President should (A) offer enhanced \n        consultation and cooperation by the United States with Russia \n        in making such reductions, and (B) pursue enhanced transparency \n        and other confidence-building measures to ensure predictable \n        and stable strategic relations between the two nations.\n    (d) Policy Regarding Warheads Removed From Weapon Systems.--(1) It \nis the policy of the United States to ensure through formal agreements \nwith Russia that any nuclear warhead removed from a weapon system by \neither nation as part of reductions in the number of warheads or \nsystems pursuant to the policies in this Act--\n            (A) be kept safe and secure;\n            (B) be accounted for; and\n            (C) eventually be destroyed or eliminated in a manner that \n        is verifiable by the other nation.\n    (2) Any such formal agreement shall be entered into either through \nthe agreement referred to in subsection (b) or other agreement between \nthe United States and Russia.\n\nSEC. 4. REDUCTION IN ALERT STATUS OF NUCLEAR \n              WEAPONS OF UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA.\n\n    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \npursue with Russia formal arrangements to remove as many nuclear \nweapons of those two nations as possible from immediate, launch-ready \n(or ``high alert'') status, consistent with United States national \nsecurity, beginning with those weapons earmarked for downloading, \ndismantlement, or elimination under the START II treaty. Such \narrangements should seek to ensure that any change in the alert status \nof such weapons of either nation be transparent and verifiable.\n    (b) Implementation of Reduction in Alert Status.--If the President \nmakes unilateral changes to the alert status of weapons in the United \nStates nuclear arsenal, such changes should--\n            (1) be consistent with the national security of the United \n        States; and\n            (2) be pursued as part of a broader United States effort to \n        persuade Russia to enter into arrangements as called for in \n        subsection (a).\n    (c) Security and Verifiability.--Any formal arrangement that \nresults from subsection (a) should include measures to ensure that--\n            (1) weapons, including their warheads, that are removed \n        from high alert status are secure and accounted for throughout \n        the process by which they are removed from that status; and\n            (2) such accountability measures are verifiable by both \n        nations.\n\nSEC. 5.

\n                and\n                    (C) developing and pursuing initiatives to reduce \n                the Russian nuclear production capacity to a size \n                appropriate to its post-Cold War mission.\n            (4) Rendering permanently unusable for weapons purposes all \n        nuclear materials and weapons systems that Russia no longer \n        requires to support its arsenal and forces.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out activities under \nthis Act, cooperative threat reduction programs of the Department of \nDefense under section 1501(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 1997 (50 U.S.C. 2362 note), and other cooperative \nthreat reduction, nonproliferation, and related programs, there are \nauthorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 2002 amounts as follows:\n            (1) For the Department of Defense $600,000,000.\n            (2) For the Department of Energy $1,200,000,000.\n            (3) For the Department of State, $200,000,000.\n    (c) Plan for Nonproliferation Programs With Russia.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than April 15, 2002, the \n        President shall submit to Congress a plan--\n                    (A) to secure and neutralize over the succeeding \n                eight years all nuclear weapons and weapons-usable \n                nuclear material in Russia that Russia does not retain \n                in its nuclear arsenal;
