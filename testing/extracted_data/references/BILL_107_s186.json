FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and \n        Drug Administration on the basis of scientific testing and \n        other information establishing that such pharmaceuticals are \n        therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n        ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective \n        alternative to brand-name innovator pharmaceuticals.\n            (2) The pharmaceutical market has become increasingly \n        competitive during the last decade because of the increasing \n        availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals.\n            (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n                    (A) the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for \n                brand-name pharmaceuticals will save purchasers of \n                pharmaceuticals between $8,000,000,000 and \n                $10,000,000,000 each year; and\n                    (B) quality generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 \n                percent and 60 percent less than brand-name \n                pharmaceuticals, resulting in an estimated average \n                savings of $15 to $30 on each prescription filled.\n            (4) Independent studies have estimated that generics \n        provide an average savings of $45.50 for each prescription drug \n        sold.\n            (5) Generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by both \n        consumers and the medical profession, as the market share held \n        by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name \n        pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, \n        from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the \n        Congressional Budget Office.\n            (6) Generic pharmaceuticals can save consumers an \n        additional $1,320,000,000 each year for each 1 percent increase \n        in the use of such pharmaceuticals.\n            (7) Generic pharmaceutical use can help both consumers and \n        the Government reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to the United \n        States Government and to beneficiaries under Federal health \n        care programs while maintaining the quality of health care by \n        requiring the use of generic drugs rather than nongeneric \n        drugs, unless no therapeutically equivalent generic drug has \n        been approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or the nongeneric drug is specifically--\n                    (A) ordered by the prescribing provider; or\n                    (B) requested by the individual for whom the drug \n                is prescribed; and\n            (2) to increase the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals \n        by requiring the Food and Drug Administration, where \n        appropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is the \n        therapeutic equivalent of its brand-name counterpart, and by \n        affording national uniformity to that determination.\n\n              TITLE I--REQUIRING THE USE OF GENERIC DRUGS\n\nSEC. 101.
