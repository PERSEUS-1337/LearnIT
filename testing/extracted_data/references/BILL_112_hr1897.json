FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Alzheimer's disease is a disorder that destroys cells \n        in the brain. The disease is the leading cause of dementia, a \n        condition that involves gradual memory loss, decline in the \n        ability to perform routine tasks, disorientation, difficulty in \n        learning, loss of language skills, impairment of judgment, and \n        personality changes. As the disease progresses, people with \n        Alzheimer's disease become unable to care for themselves. The \n        loss of brain cells eventually leads to the failure of other \n        systems in the body.\n            (2) Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death \n        in the United States and remains the only one of the top ten \n        causes of death without an identified way to prevent, cure, or \n        slow its progression.\n            (3) An estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's \n        disease. With the aging of the baby boomers, the number of \n        Americans with Alzheimer's disease will likely reach 13.5 \n        million in 2050--and could be as high as 16 million.\n            (4) An individual will live with the increasingly \n        devastating, debilitating, and destructive effects of \n        Alzheimer's disease for an average of 4 to 8 years after \n        diagnosis, and some live as long as 20 years.\n            (5) Alzheimer's disease does not just affect those with the \n        disease but takes an emotional, financial, and physical toll on \n        caregivers. In 2010, nearly 15 million Americans provided 17 \n        billion hours of unpaid care to family members and friends with \n        Alzheimer's disease and other dementias at a total value of \n        over $202 billion.\n            (6) In 2011, Medicare is expected to spend $93 billion for \n        the care of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other \n        dementias and this amount is projected to increase to $627 \n        billion in 2050. Medicaid costs is expected to increase nearly \n        400 percent, from $37 billion in 2011 to $178 billion in 2050.\n            (7) In fiscal year 2010, the Federal Government spent $450 \n        million on Alzheimer's disease research. For every $100 the \n        Federal Government spent on Alzheimer's disease research in \n        fiscal year 2010, Medicare and Medicaid spent more than $28,000 \n        for care for people with Alzheimer's disease.\n            (8) Research leading to treatments that delay onset of \n        Alzheimer's disease by just five years would cut Federal \n        Government spending on the disease by 45 percent in 2050.\n            (9) In 2010, Congress passed the National Alzheimer's \n        Project Act, which instructs the Department of Health and Human \n        Services to develop a strategic plan (referred to in this \n        section as the ``National Alzheimer's Project plan'') to \n        address the rapidly escalating Alzheimer's disease crisis.\n            (10) The annually updated National Alzheimer's Project plan \n        must be transmitted to Congress each year and is to include \n        outcome-driven objectives, recommendations for priority \n        actions, and coordination of all federally funded programs in \n        Alzheimer's disease research, care, and services.\n            (11) It is expected that the National Alzheimer's Project \n        plan will include research priority actions to accelerate the \n        development of treatments that would prevent, cure, or slow the \n        progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n            (12) The medical and research communities have the ideas, \n        the technology, and the will, but need the Federal Government \n        to commit to an innovative research approach, to find \n        breakthroughs that will provide significant returns on \n        investment and will save millions of lives.\n\nSEC. 3.
