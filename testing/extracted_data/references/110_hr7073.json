    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Hoh Indian Tribe Safe Homelands \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Hoh Indian Reservation, located along the Hoh River \n        and the Pacific Ocean in a remote section of Jefferson County, \n        Washington, is the homeland of the Hoh Indian Tribe, a \n        federally recognized Indian tribe.\n            (2) Established by Executive Order in 1893, the Reservation \n        is approximately one square mile, but its habitable acreage has \n        been reduced over time due to storm surges, repeated flooding \n        and erosion, and lack of river dredging.\n            (3) Due to its location along the river and ocean and \n        frequent torrential rains, 90 percent of the Reservation is \n        located within a flood zone and, in fact, has flooded \n        repeatedly over the last five years. In addition, 100 percent \n        of the Reservation is within a tsunami zone, leaving most of \n        the Reservation unfit for safe occupation.\n            (4) The Tribe has repeatedly suffered from serious flood \n        and wind damage to homes, tribal buildings, and utility \n        infrastructure that have caused significant damage and resulted \n        in critical safety and environmental hazards.\n            (5) Federal agencies such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \n        the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the \n        Federal Emergency Management Agency have limited authority to \n        assist the Tribe with housing and other improvements and \n        services due to the dangerous and unsustainable location of the \n        Reservation.\n            (6) The Tribe has purchased from private owners near the \n        Reservation approximately 260 acres of land in order to move \n        key infrastructure out of the flood zone.\n            (7) In addition, the State of Washington's Department of \n        Natural Resources has transferred ownership of 160 acres of \n        land to the Tribe.\n            (8) An approximately 37 acre parcel of logged land, \n        administered by the National Park Service, lies between the \n        current Reservation land and those lands acquired by the Tribe, \n        and the only road accessing the Reservation crosses this \n        parcel.\n            (9) Together, the lands described in paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 \n        would constitute a contiguous parcel for the Reservation and \n        would create a safe area for members of the Tribe to live and \n        rebuild their community.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For the purposes of this Act----\n            (1) the term ``Federal land'' mean the Federal lands \n        described in section 4(c)(2);\n            (2) the term ``Reservation'' means the reservation of the \n        Hoh Indian Tribe;\n            (3) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n        Interior; and\n            (4) the term ``Tribe'' means the Hoh Indian Tribe, a \n        federally recognized Indian tribe.\n\nSEC. 4.
