FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tobacco products cause numerous serious diseases, \n        including cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease, and \n        they contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance.\n            (2) According to the Surgeon General of the United States, \n        adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects \n        of nicotine, and adolescent exposure to nicotine may have \n        lasting adverse consequences for brain development.\n            (3) Youth use of electronic cigarettes and hookah (water \n        pipe) has risen according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey \n        released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and \n        the Food and Drug Administration, in April 2015.\n            (4) Current use of electronic cigarettes among high school \n        students tripled from 4.5 percent in 2013 to 13.4 percent in \n        2014 (compared to 1.5 percent in 2011); approximately 2,000,000 \n        high school students currently use these products.\n            (5) Current use of electronic cigarettes among middle \n        school students tripled from 1.1 percent in 2013 to 3.9 percent \n        in 2014; approximately 450,000 middle school students currently \n        use these products.\n            (6) Current use of hookah among high school students \n        increased from 4.1 percent in 2011 to 9.4 percent in 2014.\n            (7) Current use of cigars among high school students was \n        8.2 percent in 2014 (1,200,000 students). Current use of cigars \n        among high school boys was 10.8 percent, about the same rate at \n        which they smoke cigarettes (10.6 percent).\n            (8) The sale of electronic cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and \n        other tobacco products over the Internet, and through mail, \n        fax, or phone orders, makes it cheaper and easier for children \n        to obtain these products.\n            (9) Electronic cigarettes are being marketed in ways that \n        appeal to youth, in the form of advertising using images that \n        appeal to youth, advertisements on television and the Internet, \n        and sponsorships of events popular with youth, such as concerts \n        and sporting events.\n            (10) According to a study published in March 2015 in the \n        Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics, 93.7 \n        percent of youth participating in a study of Internet \n        electronic cigarette sales successfully purchased electronic \n        cigarettes because the Web sites lacked adequate age-\n        verification methods.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    Section 1 of the Act of October 19, 1949 (15 U.S.C. 375); commonly \nreferred to as the ``Jenkins Act''), is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (2)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (A)--\n                            (i) in clause (i) by striking ``and'' at \n                        the end,\n                            (ii) in clause (ii) by striking the period \n                        at the end and inserting ``; and'', and\n                            (iii) by adding at the end the following:\n                            ``(iii) includes electronic cigarettes.'', \n                        and\n                    (B) in subparagraph (B)--\n                            (i) in the heading by striking \n                        ``Exception'' and inserting ``Inclusions'',\n                            (ii) by striking ``does not include'' and \n                        inserting ``includes'', and\n                            (iii) by inserting ``and pipe tobacco (as \n                        defined in section 5702 of the Internal Revenue \n                        Code of 1986)'' before the period at the end, \n                        and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following:\n            ``(6A) Electronic cigarette.--The term `electronic \n        cigarette' means any electronic device that delivers nicotine, \n        flavor, or other substance via an aerosolized solution \n        (including an electronic cigarette, cigar, pipe, or hookah) to \n        the user inhaling from the device (including any component, \n        liquid, part, or accessory of such a device whether or not sold \n        separately) but excludes product that--\n                    ``(A) is approved by the Food and Drug \n                Administration for sale as a tobacco cessation product \n                or for another therapeutic purpose; and\n                    ``(B) is marketed and sold solely for a purpose \n                approved as described in subparagraph (A).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
