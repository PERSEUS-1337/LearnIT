FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Traditional transportation refueling networks are well-\n        established, but market uncertainties continue to hamper the \n        full use of cleaner alternative domestic energy resources.\n            (2) Despite considerable investor interest, higher capital \n        costs and an uncertain consumer base has limited expansion of \n        cleaner alternative refueling options and its customer base.\n            (3) Reduced emissions and energy independence are important \n        factors at a National level, but they are not a sufficient \n        inducement to create large-scale changes.\n            (4) While American-made fuels provide many energy security \n        and environmental benefits, a significant portion of imported \n        oil continues to be consumed as diesel fuel in on-road motor \n        vehicles.\n            (5) Motor vehicles fueled by domestically generated, \n        cleaner alternative transportation fuels, such as compressed \n        natural gas, liquefied natural gas, propane, electricity, \n        hydrogen, and advanced biofuels, can pay for themselves over \n        time, but sales of such vehicles, other than return-to-base \n        vehicles, have been hampered because of insufficient refueling \n        infrastructure.\n            (6) Simultaneous facilitation of infrastructure development \n        and a robust customer base is needed to avoid penalizing \n        current users or early adopters.\n            (7) Facilitating focused infrastructure development along \n        designated routes will foster an expansion of cleaner \n        alternative fuel vehicles and increase the likelihood for \n        commercial success.\n            (8) Eliminating the logistical barriers that are delaying \n        infrastructure development along Clean Vehicle Corridors will--\n                    (A) provide cleaner alternative refueling stations \n                with a larger customer base;\n                    (B) attract more buyers to the purchase of clean \n                vehicles; and\n                    (C) provide new market outlets for clean fuel \n                providers.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide market certainty to drive private and \n        commercial capital investment in clean transportation options;\n            (2) to promote clean transportation technologies that \n        will--\n                    (A) lead to increased diversity and dissemination \n                of cleaner alternative fuel options; and\n                    (B) enable the United States to bridge the gap from \n                foreign energy imports to secure, domestically produced \n                energy; and\n            (3) to facilitate clean transportation incentives that \n        will--\n                    (A) attract a critical mass of clean transportation \n                vehicles that will give cleaner alternative fueling \n                stations an assured customer base and market certitude;\n                    (B) provide for ongoing increases in energy \n                demands;\n                    (C) support the growth of jobs and businesses in \n                the United States;\n                    (D) reduce emissions by motor vehicles;\n                    (E) decrease our Nation's use of foreign oil; and\n                    (F) encourage innovation in transportation energy \n                and technology.\n\nSEC. 4.
