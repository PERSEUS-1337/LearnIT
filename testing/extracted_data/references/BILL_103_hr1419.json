FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) lead is a naturally occurring element which has been \n        used in a variety of industrial applications including \n        radiation shields, storage batteries, paint, and gasoline;\n            (2) 1 in 6 United States children are victims of lead \n        poisoning, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and \n        Disease Registry;\n            (3) lead poses a significant environmental health problem \n        since adverse effects have been conclusively demonstrated at \n        relatively low exposures;\n            (4) lead exposures to children under age 7 are of greatest \n        concern because of its association with significant neurotoxic \n        effects, including reduction in intelligence, attention span \n        deficits, and reading and learning disabilities;\n            (5) the quantity of lead in house dust appears to be the \n        best single indicator of lead levels in the blood of an infant;\n            (6) past efforts to abate lead-based paint have relied on \n        methods which endangered workers and often resulted in more \n        available lead dust for the occupants;\n            (7) improving methods for testing and abating lead-based \n        paint offers a highly cost effective means of reducing \n        exposures and thus preventing childhood lead poisoning; and\n            (8) the efforts of the Federal Government to develop and \n        disseminate information on the most effective techniques to \n        lower human exposure to lead should be improved.\n\nSEC. 2. DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n    (a) Emerging Technologies Research.--The Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the heads of \nother appropriate Federal agencies, shall develop methods for \nconducting evaluations of lead detection products and techniques. The \nAdministrator shall make available to the public the results of any \nevaluations conducted by such methods as the results of the evaluations \nbecome available.\n    (b) Standardization.--Within 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Director of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, in consultation with the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, shall establish protocols, criteria, \nand minimum performance standards to be used in the evaluations \ndescribed in subsection (a) and to ensure reliable, accurate, and \neffective lead detection technologies.\n\nSEC. 3. LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN.\n\n    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in \nconsultation with the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, \nshall conduct a long-term research study to establish the sources of \nlead exposure for children under the age of seven years. The research \nshall, to the greatest extent possible--\n            (1) establish profiles for the percentage of such children \n        who have an exposure to a particular lead source (such as lead-\n        based paint and dust from lead-based paint), and the particular \n        route of such exposure (such as drinking water, food, air, and \n        soil);\n            (2) establish the percentage of each particular kind of \n        exposure and route of exposure described in paragraph (1); and\n            (3) be broken down by region, economic strata, and any \n        other demographic feature the Administrator considers to be \n        appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4. RESEARCH ON ABATEMENT AND IN-PLACE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES.\n\n    The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nin consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency and the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, shall carry \nout research studies to evaluate which practices and techniques are \nmost effective in reducing human exposure to lead. The research studies \nshall emphasize the development of new technologies and shall address \nthe cost effectiveness of such practices and techniques. The \nAdministrator shall make available to the public the results of such \nstudies as the results become available.\n\nSEC. 5. LEAD REMOVAL AND CONTAINMENT PRODUCTS.\n\n    (a) Research.--The Director of the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, in consultation with the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the heads of other appropriate \nFederal agencies, shall conduct research on the safety, efficacy, \ndurability, and other relevant performance properties of lead removal \nand containment products.\n    (b) Standardization.--Within 24 months after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology shall establish performance criteria and standards for lead \nremoval and containment products.\n\nSEC. 6. PUBLIC EDUCATION.\n\n    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in \ncooperation with other appropriate Federal agencies, shall sponsor \npublic education and outreach efforts to increase awareness of the \nscope, severity, and sources of lead exposure. The Administrator shall \nfocus such public education and efforts in a manner which provides, to \nthe greatest extent possible, information to the children for whom \nprofiles are established in section 3 about the particular kind and \nroute of lead exposure of such children.\n\nSEC. 7. USE OF CLEARINGHOUSE AND TELEPHONE HOTLINE.\n\n    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall \nensure that any information which is made available to the public \npursuant to this Act is made available through the clearinghouse and \nhotline established pursuant to section 405(e) of the Toxic Control \nSubstances Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) in addition to any other means \nof availability the Administrator considers to be appropriate.\n\nSEC. 8. STATE PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Grant Assistance.--The Governor of a State may apply to the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for a grant to \ncompile (particularly through the use of questionnaires) data on lead \nexposure in the State, to coordinate with other States the collection \nof such data in order to build a national data base on lead exposure, \nand to carry out public outreach programs on lead exposure.\n    (b) Grant Management.--\n            (1) Criteria for selection.--In selecting States for grants \n        under subsection (a) the Administrator shall review--\n                    (A) the previous experience of the State in \n                addressing lead exposure and lead exposure data \n                collection issues;\n                    (B) the seriousness of the lead exposure issues \n                identified by the State; and\n                    (C) the State standards for techniques and \n                practices to reduce human exposure to lead.\n            (2) Availability of sufficient funding.--In selecting \n        States for grants under subsection (a), the Administrator shall \n        focus resources to ensure that sufficient funds are available \n        to selected States to provide for comprehensive collection and \n        coordination of lead exposure data and for sufficient public \n        outreach programs.\n            (3) Federal share of funding.--The Federal share of grants \n        under subsection (a) shall not exceed 75 percent of the costs \n        incurred by the State to carry out the activities described in \n        such subsection and shall be made on the condition that the \n        non-Federal share is provided from non-Federal funds.\n            (4) Availability of funds.--Funds granted pursuant to \n        subsection (a) in a fiscal year shall remain available for \n        obligation for that fiscal year and for the next following \n        fiscal year.\n            (5) Limitation on receipt of grant in following year.--No \n        grant shall be made under this section in any fiscal year to a \n        State which in the preceding year received a grant under this \n        section unless the Administrator determines that such State \n        satisfactorily implemented such grant activities in such \n        preceding fiscal year.\n            (6) Information required in grant application.--States \n        shall provide such information in applications for grant \n        assistance and pertaining to grant funded activities as the \n        Administrator requires.\n    (c) Coordination.--In carrying out this section, the Administrator \nshall coordinate with the Director of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology.\n\nSEC. 9.
