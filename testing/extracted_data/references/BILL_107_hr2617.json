FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) monetary stability is necessary for strong long-term \n        economic growth and higher standards of living;\n            (2) many emerging market countries lack monetary stability \n        and have therefore suffered economic and financial problems \n        that reduce their economic growth and living standards, \n        including currency crises, financial fragility, inflation \n        expectations that are built into labor markets, and high and \n        volatile inflation rates and interest rates;\n            (3) there has been growing international interest in \n        official dollarization, whereby a country substantially or \n        totally eliminates its domestic currency and adopts the United \n        States dollar as legal tender;\n            (4) official dollarization enables a country to import \n        monetary stability, thereby bringing inflation and interest \n        rates down toward the levels of the United States;\n            (5) greater monetary stability helps increase long-term \n        economic growth and raise living standards in emerging market \n        countries;\n            (6) by increasing trade and investment flows and decreasing \n        the need for foreign assistance, greater economic growth and \n        higher living standards abroad would serve the interests of the \n        United States;\n            (7) countries that become officially dollarized lose \n        seigniorage (the profit from issuing a currency), and this is a \n        significant barrier to official dollarization;\n            (8) official dollarization would increase the seigniorage \n        earnings of the United States;\n            (9) it would be mutually beneficial for the United States \n        to encourage official dollarization by offering to share with \n        countries that become officially dollarized a portion of the \n        extra seigniorage earnings that the United States would earn; \n        and\n            (10) encouraging official dollarization complements ongoing \n        efforts by the United States to strengthen the international \n        financial architecture.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nthat--\n            (1) the Federal Reserve System has no obligation to act as \n        a lender of last resort to the financial systems of dollarized \n        countries;\n            (2) the Federal Reserve System has no obligation to \n        consider the economic conditions of dollarized countries when \n        formulating or implementing monetary policy;\n            (3) the supervision of financial institutions in dollarized \n        countries remains the responsibility of those countries; and\n            (4) in the absence of qualification by the Secretary of the \n        Treasury under section 3, countries are free to dollarize \n        unilaterally.\n\nSEC. 3. QUALIFICATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Secretary'') may qualify a country as officially \ndollarized for purposes of this Act, after consideration of whether the \ncountry has--\n            (1) ceased issuing a local paper currency;\n            (2) extinguished a substantial portion of the domestic \n        currency in circulation, with plans to extinguish as much of \n        that currency as feasible;\n            (3) granted legal tender status to the United States \n        dollar; and\n            (4) substantially redenominated its prices, assets, and \n        liabilities in United States dollars;\n    (b) Other Considerations.--In deciding whether to qualify a country \nas officially dollarized under this section, the Secretary may consider \nany additional factors the Secretary deems relevant.\n    (c) Statement by Secretary.--The Secretary shall issue a written \nstatement on qualification of a country under this section that \nexplains why the country has been qualified.\n    (d) Limitation.--The Secretary may not qualify a United States \nterritory or commonwealth as officially dollarized for purposes of this \nAct.\n\nSEC. 4.
