UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR AWARD OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by \napplicable State law, be awarded against a defendant if the claimant \nestablishes by clear and convincing evidence that conduct carried out \nby the defendant with a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights \nor safety of others was the proximate cause of the harm that is the \nsubject of the action--\n            (1) in any civil action where the claim relates to \n        volunteer services performed by the defendant for a government \n        entity or a not for profit organization organized and conducted \n        for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, \n        civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes; or\n            (2) in any civil action where the claim relates to \n        activities or services performed by a not for profit \n        organization organized and conducted for public benefit and \n        operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, \n        religious, welfare, or health purposes, not including health \n        care providers.\n    (b) Limitation on Amount.--\n            (1) In general.--The amount of punitive damages that may be \n        awarded in an action described in subsection (a) may not exceed \n        the greater of--\n                    (A) 2 times the sum of the amount awarded to the \n                claimant for economic loss and non-economic loss; or\n                    (B) $250,000.\n            (2) Special rule.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in any \n        action described in section (a) against an individual whose net \n        worth does not exceed $500,000 or against an owner of an \n        unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, \n        association, congregation, unit of local government, or \n        organization which has fewer than 25 full-time employees, the \n        punitive damages shall not exceed the lesser of--\n                    (A) 2 times the sum of the amount awarded to the \n                claimant for economic loss and non-economic loss; or\n                    (B) $250,000.\n            (3) Exception for particular categories of misconduct.--The \n        limitations on the amount of punitive damages contained in \n        paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply in any action described \n        in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) where the misconduct for which \n        punitive damages are awarded--\n                    (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term \n                is defined in section 16 of title 18, United States \n                Code) or act of international terrorism (as that term \n                is defined in section 2331 of title 18) for which the \n                defendant has been convicted in any court;\n                    (B) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used \n                in the Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n                    (C) involves a sexual offense, as defined by \n                applicable State law, for which the defendant has been \n                convicted in any court;\n                    (D) involves misconduct for which the defendant has \n                been found to have violated a Federal or State civil \n                rights law; or\n                    (E) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n                determined pursuant to applicable State law) of \n                intoxicating alcohol or any drug, as defined in section \n                104(b)(2) of this title, at the time of the misconduct \n                for which punitive damages are awarded.\n            (4) Exception for insufficient award in cases of egregious \n        conduct.--\n                    (A) Determination by court.--If the court makes a \n                determination, after considering each of the factors in \n                subparagraph (B), that the application of paragraph (1) \n                would result in an award of punitive damages that is \n                insufficient to punish the egregious conduct of the \n                defendant against whom the punitive damages are to be \n                awarded or to deter such conduct in the future, the \n                court shall determine the additional amount of punitive \n                damages (referred to in this paragraph as the \n                ``additional amount'') in excess of the amount \n                determined in accordance with paragraph (1) to be \n                awarded against the defendant in a separate proceeding \n                in accordance with this paragraph.\n                    (B) Factors for consideration.--In any proceeding \n                under paragraph (A), the court shall consider--\n                            (i) the extent to which the defendant acted \n                        with actual malice;\n                            (ii) the likelihood that serious harm would \n                        arise from the conduct of the defendant;\n                            (iii) the degree of the awareness of the \n                        defendant of that likelihood;\n                            (iv) the profitability of the misconduct to \n                        the defendant;\n                            (v) the duration of the misconduct and any \n                        concurrent or subsequent concealment of the \n                        conduct by the defendant;\n                            (vi) the attitude and conduct of the \n                        defendant upon the discovery of the misconduct \n                        and whether the misconduct has terminated;\n                            (vii) the financial condition of the \n                        defendant; and\n                            (viii) the cumulative deterrent effect of \n                        other losses, damages, and punishment suffered \n                        by the defendant as a result of the misconduct, \n                        reducing the amount of punitive damages on the \n                        basis of the economic impact and severity of \n                        all measures to which the defendant has been or \n                        may be subjected, including--\n                                    (I) compensatory and punitive \n                                damage awards to similarly situated \n                                claimants;\n                                    (II) the adverse economic effect of \n                                stigma or loss of reputation;\n                                    (III) civil fines and criminal and \n                                administrative penalties; and\n                                    (IV) stop sale, cease and desist, \n                                and other remedial or enforcement \n                                orders.\n                    (C) Requirements for awarding additional amount.--\n                If the court awards an additional amount pursuant to \n                this subsection, the court shall state its reasons for \n                setting the amount of the additional amount in findings \n                of fact and conclusions of law.\n                    (D) Preemption.--This section does not create a \n                cause of action for punitive damages and does not \n                preempt or supersede any State or Federal law to the \n                extent that such law would further limit the award of \n                punitive damages. Nothing in this subsection shall \n                modify or reduce the ability of courts to order \n                remittiturs.\n            (5) Application by court.--This subsection shall be applied \n        by the court and application of this subsection shall not be \n        disclosed to the jury.
