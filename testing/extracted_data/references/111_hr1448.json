SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement Enhancement \nAct of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government to \n        adequately secure the borders of the United States and prevent \n        the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs into the \n        United States in order to better secure such borders.\n            (2) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n        due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n        the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n        law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n        illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n        Southwest border counties.\n            (3) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n        declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n        enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n        activity along the Southwest border.\n            (4) While the Federal Government provides States and \n        localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n        detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n        Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border are \n        provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must use \n        their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n        smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n        and other border security related crimes.\n            (5) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n        Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n        enforcement agencies located along the border are small, rural \n        departments charged with patrolling large areas of land. \n        Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico border are \n        some of the poorest in the country and lack the financial \n        resources to cover the additional costs associated with border \n        security, narcoterrorism, and other border-related crimes.\n            (6) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n        enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n        challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n        international border and the lack of overall border security in \n        the region.\n\nSEC. 103. BORDER RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--From amounts made available under section 104, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security may make border security grants to--\n            (1) sheriffs' offices of counties any part of which is \n        within 25 miles of the southern border of the United States; \n        and\n            (2) police departments serving a city, town, or other \n        political subdivision in a county any part of which is within \n        25 miles of the southern border of the United States (including \n        tribal police departments serving a community any part of which \n        is within 25 miles of such border).\n    (b) Use of Funds.--\n            (1) In general.--Grant funds received under subsection (a) \n        may be used for the following activities:\n                    (A) To conduct law enforcement operations to \n                enforce criminal laws, prevent and punish criminal \n                activity, and protect the lives, property, and security \n                of the people within the jurisdiction of the grant \n                recipient.\n                    (B) To transfer to appropriate Federal law \n                enforcement officials aliens unlawfully present in the \n                United States who detained or in the custody of the \n                grant recipient.\n                    (C) To enforce State and Federal laws relating to \n                securing the border and enforce other State and Federal \n                criminal laws.\n            (2) Payment of costs.--Use of funds under paragraph (1) \n        shall include payment for costs of--\n                    (A) hiring, equipping, training, and otherwise \n                controlling the operations and deployment of law \n                enforcement officials engaged in duties described in \n                paragraph (1), as well as the costs of paying overtime \n                to such officials; and\n                    (B) detaining, housing, and transporting aliens who \n                are unlawfully present in the United States and who are \n                taken into custody by the grant recipient, until such \n                aliens are transferred to appropriate Federal law \n                enforcement officials.\n            (3) Detention facilities.--In accordance with paragraph \n        (2)(B), grant funds received under subsection (a) may be used \n        for the construction, maintenance, and operation of detention \n        facilities to detain aliens who are unlawfully present in the \n        United States, except that not more than 20 percent of such \n        funds may be used for the construction or renovation of \n        detention or similar facilities.\n    (c) Application.--\n            (1) In general.--Each eligible law enforcement agency \n        seeking a grant under this section shall submit to the \n        Secretary of Homeland Security an application at such time, in \n        such manner, and accompanied by such information as the \n        Secretary may require.\n            (2) Contents.--Each application submitted pursuant to \n        paragraph (1) shall--\n                    (A) describe the activities for which assistance \n                under this section is sought; and\n                    (B) provide such additional assurances as the \n                Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be \n                essential to ensure compliance with the requirements of \n                this section.\n\nSEC. 104.
