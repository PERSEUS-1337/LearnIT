FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1)(A) Many information technology computer systems, \n        software programs, and similar facilities are vulnerable to \n        attacks or misuse through the Internet, public or private \n        telecommunications systems, or similar means.\n            (B) The problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting \n        failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the \n        functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, utilities, \n        government, and safety and defense systems, in the United \n        States and throughout the world.\n            (C) Protecting, reprogramming, or replacing affected \n        systems before the problem incapacitates essential systems is a \n        matter of national and global interest.\n            (2) The prompt, candid, and thorough, but secure and \n        protected, disclosure and exchange of information related to \n        the cybersecurity of entities, systems, and infrastructure--\n                    (A) would greatly enhance the ability of public and \n                private entities to improve their own cyber security; \n                and\n                    (B) is therefore a matter of national importance \n                and a vital factor in minimizing any potential cyber \n                security related disruption to the Nation's economic \n                well-being and security.\n            (3) Concern about the potential for legal liability \n        associated with the disclosure and exchange of cyber security \n        information could unnecessarily impede the secure disclosure \n        and protected exchange of such information.\n            (4) The capability to securely disclose and engage in the \n        protected exchange of information relating to cyber security, \n        solutions, test practices and test results, without undue \n        concern about inappropriate disclosure of that information, is \n        critical to the ability of public and private entities to \n        address cyber security needs in a timely manner.\n            (5) The national interest will be served by uniform legal \n        standards in connection with the secure disclosure and \n        protected exchange of cyber security information that will \n        promote appropriate disclosures and exchanges of such \n        information in a timely fashion.\n            (6) The ``National Plan for Information Systems Protection, \n        Version 1.0, An Invitation to a Dialogue'', released by the \n        President on January 7, 2000, calls for the Government to \n        assist in seeking changes to applicable laws on ``Freedom of \n        Information, liability, and antitrust where appropriate'' in \n        order to foster industry-wide centers for information sharing \n        and analysis.\n    (b) Purposes.--Based upon the powers contained in article I, \nsection 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, the \npurposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote the secure disclosure and protected exchange \n        of information related to cyber security;\n            (2) to assist private industry and government in \n        effectively and rapidly responding to cyber security problems;\n            (3) to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by \n        establishing certain uniform legal principles in connection \n        with the secure disclosure and protected exchange of \n        information related to cyber security; and\n            (4) to protect the legitimate users of cyber networks and \n        systems, and to protect the privacy and confidence of shared \n        information.\n\nSEC. 3.
