    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``End Child Poverty Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nearly 13,000,000, or nearly 1 in 5, children in the \n        United States who are younger than 18 live below the poverty \n        line.\n            (2) The parents of poor children are playing by the rules \n        by working to support their families. Despite their efforts, \n        many of these parents still cannot help their children get \n        ahead, since 7 out of 10 poor children live in a working family \n        and almost 1 poor child in 3 lives with a full-time year-around \n        worker.\n            (3) Poor children are at least twice as likely as non-poor \n        children to suffer stunted growth or lead poisoning, or to be \n        kept back in school. Poor children score significantly lower on \n        reading, mathematics, and vocabulary tests when compared with \n        otherwise similar non-poor children. More than half of poor \n        people in the United States, including poor children, \n        experience serious deprivations during the year, including lack \n        of food, utility shutoffs, crowded or substandard housing, or \n        lack of a stove or refrigerator.\n            (4)(A) Eighteen percent of children are hungry or on the \n        verge of hunger, largely because they are living in poverty.\n            (B) Hungry children--\n                    (i) lack nutrients vital to healthy brain \n                development;\n                    (ii) have difficulty focusing their attention and \n                concentrating in school; and\n                    (iii) often have greater emotional and behavioral \n                problems, have weaker immune systems, and are more \n                susceptible to infections, including anemia, than other \n                children, and often suffer from obesity.\n            (5) Child poverty has risen significantly, by 1,300,000 \n        since 2000.\n            (6) The poverty rate for children in the United States is \n        substantially higher than that in other major industrialized \n        nations.\n            (7) Children in the United States are more likely to live \n        in poverty than any other age group in the United States.\n            (8) African-American and Latino children are much more \n        likely to live in poverty than White children. One third of \n        African-American children are low-income, as are nearly a third \n        of Latino children.\n            (9) Great Britain made a public commitment to cut child \n        poverty in half in 10 years, and end child poverty by 2020, and \n        it has already successfully lifted 2,000,000 children out of \n        poverty.\n            (10) Poverty is a moral issue and Congress has a moral \n        obligation to address it.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to set a national goal of cutting child \npoverty in half within a decade, and eliminating child poverty entirely \nas soon as possible.\n\nSEC. 4.
