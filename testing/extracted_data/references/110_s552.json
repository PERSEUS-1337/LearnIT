TAX TREATMENT OF INCOME RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXXON \n              VALDEZ LITIGATION.\n\n    (a) Income Averaging of Amounts Received From the Exxon Valdez \nLitigation.--\n            (1) In general.--At the election of a qualified taxpayer \n        who receives qualified settlement income during a taxable year, \n        the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n        1986 for such taxable year shall be equal to the sum of--\n                    (A) the tax which would be imposed under such \n                chapter if--\n                            (i) no amount of elected qualified \n                        settlement income were included in gross income \n                        for such year, and\n                            (ii) no deduction were allowed for such \n                        year for expenses (otherwise allowable as a \n                        deduction to the taxpayer for such year) \n                        attributable to such elected qualified \n                        settlement income, plus\n                    (B) the increase in tax under such chapter which \n                would result if taxable income for each of the years in \n                the applicable period were increased by an amount equal \n                to the applicable fraction of the elected qualified \n                settlement income reduced by any expenses (otherwise \n                allowable as a deduction to the taxpayer) attributable \n                to such elected qualified settlement income.\n        Any adjustment under this section for any taxable year shall be \n        taken into account in applying this section for any subsequent \n        taxable year.\n            (2) Coordination with farm income averaging.--If a \n        qualified taxpayer makes an election with respect to any \n        qualified settlement income under paragraph (1) for any taxable \n        year, such taxpayer may not elect to treat such
