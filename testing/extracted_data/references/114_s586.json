FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report \n        that nearly 29,000,000 Americans have diabetes in addition to \n        an estimated 86,000,000 American adults that have pre-diabetes, \n        an increase of 3,000,000 Americans with diabetes and 7,000,000 \n        American adults with pre-diabetes since 2011.\n            (2) Diabetes affects 9.3 percent of Americans of all ages \n        and 12.3 percent of adults age 20 and older. Adults age 20 and \n        older of racial and ethnic minorities continue to have higher \n        rates of diabetes than individuals not of such minorities, as \n        demonstrated by the following: 15.9 percent of all adult \n        American Indians and Alaskan Natives have diabetes; 13.2 \n        percent of all adult African-Americans have diabetes; 12.8 \n        percent of all adult Hispanics have diabetes; and 9.0 percent \n        of all adult Asian-Americans have diabetes, while 7.6 percent \n        of all non-Hispanic Whites have diabetes.\n            (3) Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the \n        United States.\n            (4) People with diabetes are more likely than people \n        without diabetes to also have chronic diseases and conditions \n        that are complications of diabetes, including cardiovascular \n        disease, strokes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, \n        including dialysis, blindness, neuropathy, and leg and feet \n        amputations.\n            (5) Adults with diabetes have an elevated risk of heart \n        disease and stroke. Adults with diabetes have death rates from \n        heart disease that are nearly twice as high as adults without \n        the disease.\n            (6) Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure. Each \n        year, nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States are \n        diagnosed with kidney failure, and diabetes accounts for 44 \n        percent of these new cases.\n            (7) Diabetic neuropathies are a family of nerve disorders \n        caused by diabetes and are prevalent in nearly 60 to 70 percent \n        of individuals with diabetes.\n            (8) Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness \n        among adults aged 20 to 74.\n            (9) About 60 percent of all non-traumatic lower limb \n        amputations in the United States occur in individuals with \n        diabetes.\n            (10) Total national costs associated with diabetes in 2012 \n        exceeded $245,000,000,000, according to the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention.\n            (11) One in three Medicare dollars is currently spent on \n        people with diabetes.\n            (12) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        projects that as many as 1 in 3 American adults could have \n        diabetes by 2050 if current trends continue.\n            (13) There are 35 Federal departments, agencies, and \n        offices involved in the implementation of Federal diabetes \n        activities.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL DIABETES CLINICAL CARE \n              COMMISSION.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 399V-6.
