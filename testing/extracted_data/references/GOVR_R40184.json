    "content": "The Medicaid statute (Section 1902(a)(43)) requires states to inform and arrange for the delivery of EPSDT services to eligible children, and also includes annual reporting requirements for states. The tool used to capture these required EPSDT data is called the CMS-416 form. The current CMS-416 form (effective as of FY1999) includes the unduplicated count of EPSDT eligibles by age and basis of eligibility who receive (1) any dental services, (2) preventive dental services, and (3) dental treatment services. Classification into one of these measures is based on specific dental procedure codes recorded on provider claims. Across states in FY2006, use of dental services among Medicaid children was generally low, as shown in Table 1 . Receipt of any dental services among Medicaid children eligible for EPSDT ranged from 18.9% (in North Dakota) to 55.7% (in West Virginia). Receipt of preventive dental services ranged from 6.7% (in Utah) to 51.0% (in Vermont). Finally, receipt of dental treatment services ranged from 6.4% (in Nevada) to 40.8% (in West Virginia). During routine immunization and well-child visits, there are a number of opportunities for physicians to inform parents about the need for dental services for their children. Guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics for well-child visits during 2006 (in effect since 2000) called for initial dental referrals at age three years, or as early as one year of age when indicated.  Table 2 provides a more detailed analysis of the receipt of preventive dental services by age in FY2006. Across age groups within each state and for all reporting states as a whole, utilization patterns resembled a bell-shaped curve (see Figure 1 ). That is, children at the age extremes tended to receive fewer preventive dental services than children in the middle of the age range. Among nearly all states, the highest rates of preventive dental care were observed for the six- to nine-year-old age group. For this age group, 10 states had preventive dental rates over 50%, and one state (Vermont) met the Healthy People 2010 goal that at least 66% of such children receive a preventive dental visit. The higher rates of preventive dental care among children aged six to nine may be related in part to school entry requirements for childhood immunizations. In order to attend kindergarten at ages five and six, for example, all states require that children have received common childhood immunizations (e.g., vaccinations for diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis, or DTaP; measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR; and polio). When children receive those immunizations, health care providers may make referrals for other health services, including dental care. Many states recognize that dental care is underutilized across most Medicaid sub-populations. In a September 2008 hearing before the Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, state officials and other representatives from Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, and from the dental profession, described recent state actions to improve dental care for Medicaid children. Their recommendations included the following: increase dental reimbursement rates to make them more in line with private market-based rates; remove administrative barriers (e.g., prior authorization for certain procedures, simplified claims, and use of electronic billing); carve out dental benefits from managed care contracts and use a single dental vendor to establish a more stream-lined approach to processing claims and paying providers; when designing new dental program features, involve dentists and professional dental organizations; establish dedicated dental units in state governments to help guide policy decisions; and establish \"dental extenders\" to increase service capacity, including for example, (1) primary care medical professionals to provide oral evaluation and risk assessment, counseling for parents about oral hygiene, and application of fluorides, and (2) other allied dental providers that can do community outreach and education, and perform preventive services such as fluoride and sealant application, potentially expanding to additional dental treatment services. Other states may draw lessons from these experiences and recommendations. With respect to the final point above, provider groups hold varying opinions about the extent to which non-dentists can and should provide certain dental services. States may need to address such issues if they wish to expand access to dental care under Medicaid for children and other sub-groups."
