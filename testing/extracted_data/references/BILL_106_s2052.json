FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A unique legal and political relationship exists \n        between the United States and Indian tribes that is reflected \n        in article I, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United \n        States, various treaties, Federal statutes, Supreme Court \n        decisions, executive agreements, and course of dealing.\n            (2) Despite the infusion of substantial Federal dollars \n        into Native American communities over several decades, the \n        majority of Native Americans remain mired in poverty, \n        unemployment, and despair.\n            (3) The efforts of the United States to foster community, \n        economic, and business development in Native American \n        communities have been hampered by fragmentation of authority, \n        responsibility and performance and by lack of timeliness and \n        coordination in resources and decision-making.\n            (4) The effectiveness of Federal and tribal efforts to \n        generate employment opportunities and bring value-added \n        activities and economic growth to Native American communities \n        depends on cooperative arrangements among the various Federal \n        agencies and Indian tribes.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) enable Indian tribes and tribal organizations to use \n        available Federal assistance more effectively and efficiently;\n            (2) adapt and target such assistance more readily to \n        particular needs through wider use of projects that are \n        supported by more than 1 executive agency, assistance program, \n        or appropriation of the Federal Government;\n            (3) encourage Federal-tribal arrangements under which \n        Indian tribes and tribal organizations may more effectively and \n        efficiently combine Federal and tribal resources to support \n        economic development projects;\n            (4) promote the coordination of Native American economic \n        programs to maximize the benefits of these programs to \n        encourage a more consolidated, national policy for economic \n        development; and\n            (5) establish a demonstration project to aid Indian tribes \n        in obtaining Federal resources and in more efficiently \n        administering these resources for the furtherance of tribal \n        self-governance and self-determination.\n\nSEC. 3.
