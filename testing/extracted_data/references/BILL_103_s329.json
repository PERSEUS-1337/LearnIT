FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in the thirty days preceding a primary, and in the \n        forty-five days preceding a general election, candidates for \n        political office need to be able to buy, at the lowest unit \n        charge, nonpreemptible advertising spots from broadcast \n        stations and community antenna television systems to ensure \n        that their messages reach the intended audience and that the \n        voting public has an opportunity to make informed decisions;\n            (2) since the Communications Act of 1934 was amended in \n        1972 to guarantee the lowest unit charge for candidates during \n        these important preelection periods, the method by which \n        advertising spots are sold in the broadcast and community \n        antenna television industries has changed significantly;\n            (3) changes in the method for selling advertising spots \n        have made the interpretation and enforcement of the lowest unit \n        charge provision difficult and complex;\n            (4) clarification and simplification of the lowest unit \n        charge provision in the Communications Act of 1934 are \n        necessary to ensure compliance with the original intent of the \n        provision;\n            (5) in granting discounts and setting charges for \n        advertising time, broadcasters and operators of community \n        antenna television systems shall treat candidates for political \n        office at least as well as the most favored commercial \n        advertisers; and\n            (6) enhancing the disclosure requirements of the Federal \n        Election Campaign Act of 1971 will increase candidate \n        accountability to the electorate and enhance the ability of the \n        individual citizen to exercise informed judgment by more \n        effectively identifying the source of political advertising and \n        the credibility of each advocate.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF BROADCASTING STATIONS BY CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC OFFICE.\n\n    Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 315) is \namended--\n            (1) in subsection (b)(1)--\n                    (A) by striking ``forty-five'' and inserting in \n                lieu thereof ``thirty'';\n                    (B) by striking ``sixty'' and inserting in lieu \n                thereof ``forty-five''; and\n                    (C) by striking ``class and'';\n            (2) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections \n        (d) and (e), respectively; and\n            (3) by inserting immediately after subsection (b) the \n        following new subsection:\n    ``(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a licensee shall not \npreempt the use, during any period specified in subsection (b)(1), of a \nbroadcasting station by a legally qualified candidate for public office \nwho has purchased and paid for such use pursuant to the provisions of \nsubsection (b)(1).\n    ``(2) If a program to be broadcast by a broadcasting station is \npreempted because of circumstances beyond the control of the \nbroadcasting station, any candidate advertising spot scheduled to be \nbroadcast during that program may also be preempted.''.\n\n-S-E-C-. -4-. -P-O-L-I-T-I-C-A-L -A-D-V-E-R-T-I-S-I-N-G \n              -R-E-Q-U-I-R-E-M-E-N-T-S-.\n\n    -(-a-) -S-e-c-t-i-o-n -3-1-8-(-a-) -o-f -t-h-e -F-e-d-e-r-a-l \n-E-l-e-c-t-i-o-n -C-a-m-p-a-i-g-n -A-c-t -o-f -1-9-7-1 -(-2 \n-U-.-S-.-C-. -4-4-1-d-(-a-)-) -i-s -a-m-e-n-d-e-d---\n            -(-1-) -b-y -s-t-r-i-k-i-n-g -t-h-e -p-e-r-i-o-d -a-t \n        -t-h-e -e-n-d -o-f -p-a-r-a-g-r-a-p-h -(-3-) -a-n-d \n        -i-n-s-e-r-t-i-n-g -i-n -l-i-e-u -t-h-e-r-e-o-f -a \n        -s-e-m-i-c-o-l-o-n-; -a-n-d\n            -(-2-) -b-y -a-d-d-i-n-g -a-t -t-h-e -e-n-d -t-h-e \n        -f-o-l-l-o-w-i-n-g-:\n-`-`-e-x-c-e-p-t -t-h-a-t -i-n -t-h-e -c-a-s-e -o-f -a-n-y \n-c-o-m-m-u-n-i-c-a-t-i-o-n -a-u-t-h-o-r-i-z-e-d -b-y -a \n-c-a-n-d-i-d-a-t-e -a-n-d -m-a-d-e -t-h-r-o-u-g-h -a \n-b-r-o-a-d-c-a-s-t-i-n-g -s-t-a-t-i-o-n -o-r -a -c-o-m-m-u-n-i-t-y \n-a-n-t-e-n-n-a -t-e-l-e-v-i-s-i-o-n -s-y-s-t-e-m-, -s-u-c-h \n-c-o-m-m-u-n-i-c-a-t-i-o-n -s-h-a-l-l -a-l-s-o -m-e-e-t -t-h-e \n-f-o-l-l-o-w-i-n-g -r-e-q-u-i-r-e-m-e-n-t-s-:\n            -`-`-(-A-) -D-u-r-i-n-g -t-h-e -c-o-m-m-u-n-i-c-a-t-i-o-n-, \n        -t-h-e -f-o-l-l-o-w-i-n-g -s-h-a-l-l -b-e -s-t-a-t-e-d \n        -a-u-r-a-l-l-y -i-n -t-h-e -c-a-n-d-i-d-a-t-e-'-s -v-o-i-c-e-: \n        -`-I-, ____________-, -A -C-A-N-D-I-D-A-T-E -F-O-R \n        ____________-, -H-A-V-E -A-P-P-R-O-V-E-D -O-F -T-H-I-S -A-D-'-, \n        -w-i-t-h -t-h-e -f-i-r-s-t -b-l-a-n-k -s-p-a-c-e -b-e-i-n-g \n        -f-i-l-l-e-d -w-i-t-h -t-h-e -c-a-n-d-i-d-a-t-e-'-s -n-a-m-e \n        -a-n-d -t-h-e -s-e-c-o-n-d -b-l-a-n-k -s-p-a-c-e -b-e-i-n-g \n        -f-i-l-l-e-d -w-i-t-h -t-h-e -n-a-m-e -o-f -t-h-e -o-f-f-i-c-e \n        -s-o-u-g-h-t -b-y -t-h-e -c-a-n-d-i-d-a-t-e-.\n            -`-`-(-B-) -T-h-e -s-t-a-t-e-m-e-n-t -r-e-q-u-i-r-e-d -b-y \n        -s-u-b-p-a-r-a-g-r-a-p-h -(-A-) -s-h-a-l-l -b-e -s-p-o-k-e-n \n        -c-l-e-a-r-l-y -w-i-t-h-o-u-t -r-u-s-h-i-n-g-, \n        -d-i-s-g-u-i-s-i-n-g-, -o-r -d-e-e-m-p-h-a-s-i-z-i-n-g \n        -p-a-r-t-i-c-u-l-a-r -w-o-r-d-s-.\n            -`-`-(-C-) -I-n -t-h-e -c-a-s-e -o-f -a \n        -c-o-m-m-u-n-i-c-a-t-i-o-n -m-a-d-e -t-h-r-o-u-g-h -a \n        -t-e-l-e-v-i-s-i-o-n -b-r-o-a-d-c-a-s-t-i-n-g -s-t-a-t-i-o-n \n        -o-r -c-o-m-m-u-n-i-t-y -a-n-t-e-n-n-a -t-e-l-e-v-i-s-i-o-n \n        -s-y-s-t-e-m-, -t-h-e -b-a-c-k-g-r-o-u-n-d \n        -p-h-o-t-o-g-r-a-p-h-y -d-u-r-i-n-g -t-h-e -e-n-t-i-r-e \n        -t-i-m-e -t-h-e -s-t-a-t-e-m-e-n-t -r-e-q-u-i-r-e-d -b-y \n        -s-u-b-p-a-r-a-g-r-a-p-h -(-A-) -i-s -m-a-d-e -s-h-a-l-l \n        -c-o-n-s-i-s-t -o-f -a-n -u-n-o-b-s-c-u-r-e-d -f-u-l-l -f-a-c-e \n        -p-i-c-t-u-r-e -o-f -t-h-e -c-a-n-d-i-d-a-t-e-, \n        -o-c-c-u-p-y-i-n-g -n-o -l-e-s-s -t-h-a-n -4-0 -p-e-r-c-e-n-t \n        -o-f -t-h-e -t-e-l-e-v-i-s-i-o-n -s-a-f-e -s-c-r-e-e-n \n        -a-r-e-a-, -a-g-a-i-n-s-t -a -n-e-u-t-r-a-l \n        -b-a-c-k-g-r-o-u-n-d-.-'-'-.\n    -(-b-) -S-e-c-t-i-o-n -3-1-8 -o-f -t-h-e -F-e-d-e-r-a-l \n-E-l-e-c-t-i-o-n -C-a-m-p-a-i-g-n -A-c-t -o-f -1-9-7-1 -(-2 \n-U-.-S-.-C-. -4-4-1-d-) -i-s -a-m-e-n-d-e-d -b-y -a-d-d-i-n-g -a-t \n-t-h-e -e-n-d -t-h-e -f-o-l-l-o-w-i-n-g -n-e-w -s-u-b-s-e-c-t-i-o-n-:\n    -`-`-(-c-) -A-s -u-s-e-d -i-n -t-h-i-s -s-e-c-t-i-o-n-, -t-h-e \n-`-c-o-m-m-u-n-i-t-y -a-n-t-e-n-n-a -t-e-l-e-v-i-s-i-o-n -s-y-s-t-e-m-' \n-h-a-s -t-h-e -m-e-a-n-i-n-g -g-i-v-e-n -t-h-a-t -t-e-r-m -u-n-d-e-r \n-s-e-c-t-i-o-n -3-1-5 -o-f -t-h-e -C-o-m-m-u-n-i-c-a-t-i-o-n-s -A-c-t \n-o-f -1-9-3-4 -(-4-7 -U-.-S-.-C-. -3-1-5-)-.-'-'-.\n\nSEC. 4.
