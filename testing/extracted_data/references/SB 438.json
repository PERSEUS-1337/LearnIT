Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nThe development and implementation of the California Earthquake Early Warning System will help mitigate the loss of lives and property due to an earthquake. The need to protect the proprietary rights of owners of trade secrets relating to systems or products that may be incorporated into the California Earthquake Early Warning System and used within the California Earthquake Early Warning Program and the need to encourage the participation of those owners in the development and implementation of that system and program outweigh publicly disclosing those trade secrets."
