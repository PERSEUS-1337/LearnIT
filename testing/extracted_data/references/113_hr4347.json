    "title": "Turkey Christian Churches Accountability Act",
    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Turkey Christian Churches \nAccountability Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) United States diplomatic leadership contributes \n        meaningfully and materially to the protection internationally \n        of religious minorities and their faith-based practices and \n        places of worship.\n            (2) The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 states \n        that ``It shall be the policy of the United States to condemn \n        violations of religious freedom, and to promote, and to assist \n        other governments in the promotion of, the fundamental right to \n        freedom of religion.''.\n            (3) The House of Representatives, when it adopted House \n        Resolution 306 on December 13, 2011, called on the Secretary of \n        State, in all official contacts with Turkish leaders, to urge \n        Turkey to ``allow the rightful church and lay owners of \n        Christian church properties, without hindrance or restriction, \n        to organize and administer prayer services, religious \n        education, clerical training, appointments, and succession'', \n        and to ``return to their rightful owners all Christian churches \n        and other places of worship, monasteries, schools, hospitals, \n        monuments, relics, holy sites, and other religious properties, \n        including movable properties, such as artwork, manuscripts, \n        vestments, vessels, and other artifacts''.\n            (4) On September 28, 2010, the House of Representatives \n        adopted House Resolution 1631, calling for the protection of \n        religious sites and artifacts, as well as for general respect \n        for religious freedom in Turkish-occupied areas of northern \n        Cyprus.\n            (5) Christian churches and communities in the Republic of \n        Turkey and in the occupied areas of Cyprus continue to be \n        prevented from fully practicing their faith and face serious \n        obstacles to reestablishing full legal, administrative, and \n        operational control over stolen, expropriated, confiscated, or \n        otherwise unreturned churches and other religious properties \n        and sites.\n            (6) In many cases the rightful Christian church \n        authorities, including relevant Holy Sees located outside \n        Turkey and Turkish-occupied territories, are obstructed from \n        safeguarding, repairing, or otherwise caring for their holy \n        sites upon their ancient homelands, because the properties have \n        been destroyed, expropriated, converted into mosques, storage \n        facilities, or museums, or subjected to deliberate neglect.\n            (7) While the Turkish Government has made efforts in recent \n        years to address these issues and to return some church \n        properties, much more must be done to rectify the situation of \n        Christian communities in these areas, as a vast majority of \n        Christian holy sites continue to be held by the Turkish \n        Government or by third parties.\n            (8) On April 24, 2013, Catholicos Karekin II and Catholicos \n        Aram I, spiritual leaders of the millions of Christian Armenian \n        faithful in Armenia and the Diaspora, noted that Turkey \n        continued to unjustly ``[retain] confiscated church estates and \n        properties, and religious and cultural treasures of the \n        Armenian people'', and called on Turkey ``[t]o immediately \n        return the Armenian churches, monasteries, church properties, \n        and spiritual and cultural treasures, to the Armenian people as \n        their rightful owner''.\n            (9) The boundaries of Turkey encompass significant historic \n        Christian lands, including the biblical lands of Armenia \n        (present-day Anatolia), home to many of early Christianity's \n        pivotal events and holy sites, such as Mount Ararat, the \n        location cited in the Bible as the landing place of Noah's Ark.\n            (10) These ancient territories were for thousands of years \n        home to a large, indigenous Christian population, but, because \n        of years of repressive Turkish Government policies, historic \n        atrocities, and brutal persecution, today Christians constitute \n        less than one percent of Turkey's population.\n            (11) As a result of the Turkish Government's invasion of \n        the northern area of the Republic of Cyprus on July 20, 1974, \n        and the Turkish military's continued illegal and discriminatory \n        occupation of portions of this sovereign state, the future and \n        very existence of Greek Cypriot, Maronite, and Armenian \n        communities are now in grave jeopardy.\n            (12) Under the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus, \n        freedom of worship has been severely restricted, access to \n        religious sites blocked, religious sites systematically \n        destroyed, and a large number of religious and archaeological \n        objects illegally confiscated or stolen.\n            (13) The United States Commission on International \n        Religious Freedom, in its 2012 annual report, criticized ``the \n        Turkish government's systematic and egregious limitations on \n        the freedom of religion'', and warned that ``[l]ongstanding \n        policies continue to threaten the survivability and viability \n        of minority religious communities in Turkey''.\n            (14) Christian minorities in Turkey continue to face \n        discrimination, prohibitions on the training and succession of \n        clergy, and violent attacks, which have at times resulted in \n        lenient sentencing, including the reduced sentence for the \n        murderer of the Catholic Church's head bishop in Turkey, Luigi \n        Padovese, in June 2010, or delayed justice, including the \n        unresolved torture and murder, in April 2007, of three \n        employees of a Protestant Bible publishing house in Malatya, \n        Turkey.\n            (15) The Government of Turkey, in contravention of its \n        international legal obligations, refuses to recognize the \n        2,000-year-old Sacred See of the Ecumenical Patriarchate's \n        international status, has confiscated the large majority of the \n        assets and properties of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Greek \n        cultural and educational foundations, maintains that candidates \n        for the position of Ecumenical Patriarch must be Turkish \n        citizens, and continues to refuse to reopen the Theological \n        School at Halki, thus impeding training and succession for the \n        Greek Orthodox clergy in Turkey.\n            (16) The Government of Turkey, in contravention of its \n        international legal obligations, continues to place substantial \n        restrictions and other limitations upon the Armenian \n        Patriarchate's right to train and educate clergy and select and \n        install successors without government interference.\n            (17) Religious freedom is an essential cornerstone of \n        democracy that promotes respect for individual liberty, which \n        contributes to greater stability, and is therefore a priority \n        value for the United States to promote in its engagement with \n        other countries.\n\nSEC. 3.
