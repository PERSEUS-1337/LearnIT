    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, is intended to reduce investigation time and facilitate efficient communication between law enforcement personnel and electronic communication service providers that provide service to the general public and that have received requests from law enforcement personnel for electronic communication and electronic communication information subject to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code). It shall not be construed to apply to a person or entity solely on the basis that the person or entity is a subscriber to an electronic communication service or a customer of an electronic communication service provider.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 1524.4 is added to the Penal Code, to read:\n1524.4.\n(a) This section applies to a service provider that is subject to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546)) and that operates in California. This section does not apply to a service provider that does not offer services to the general public.\n(b) (1) Every service provider described in subdivision (a) shall maintain a law enforcement contact process that meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (2).\n(2) Every service provider described in subdivision (a) shall ensure, at a minimum, that its law enforcement contact process meets all of the following criteria:\n(A) Provides a specific contact mechanism for law enforcement personnel.\n(B) Provides continual availability of the law enforcement contact process.\n(C) Provides a method to provide status updates to a requesting law enforcement agency on a request for assistance.\n(3) Every service provider described in subdivision (a) shall, by July 1, 2017, file a statement with the Attorney General describing the law enforcement contact process maintained pursuant to paragraph (1). If a service provider makes a material change to its law enforcement contact process, the service provider shall, as soon as practicable, file a statement with the Attorney General describing its new law enforcement contact process.\n(c) The Attorney General shall consolidate the statements received pursuant to this section into one discrete record and regularly make that record available to local law enforcement agencies.\n(d) The exclusive remedy for a violation of this section shall be an action brought by the Attorney General for injunctive relief. Nothing in this section shall limit remedies available for a violation of any other state or federal law.\n(e) A statement filed or distributed pursuant to this section is confidential and shall not be disclosed pursuant to any state law, including, but not limited to, the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).\nSEC. 3.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, imposes a limitation on the public\u2019s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nIn order to protect the internal processes of private businesses from unnecessary intrusion and facilitate contact between law enforcement and private businesses regarding access to information that will protect public health and safety, it is necessary to limit access to statements filed by service providers that describe the service providers\u2019 law enforcement contact processes.\nSEC. 4.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 1524.4 to the Penal Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:\nBy facilitating contact between law enforcement and service providers regarding access to information that will protect public health and safety and by appropriately limiting access to internal business processes, this bill furthers the purpose of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.\nSEC. 5.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution."
