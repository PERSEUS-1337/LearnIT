FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area was \n        authorized as a unit of the National Park System on November \n        10, 1978;\n            (2) the Santa Monica Mountains and the Rim of the Valley \n        Corridor include a diverse range of nationally significant \n        natural and cultural resources;\n            (3) expanding the Santa Monica Mountains National \n        Recreation Area would provide new opportunities for the \n        National Park Service to serve a broad range of urban \n        communities, including many communities that are--\n                    (A) underrepresented in units of the National Park \n                System; and\n                    (B) underserved by State and local parks;\n            (4) the Santa Susana Field Laboratory is located in the \n        Simi Hills in southeastern Ventura County, California, within \n        the external boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Corridor;\n            (5) activities at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory have--\n                    (A) included rocket engine testing and research and \n                development of fuels, propellants, nuclear power, and \n                lasers; and\n                    (B) resulted in releases of radioactive and \n                hazardous substances into the environment that require \n                cleanup;\n            (6) in 2010, the California Department of Toxic Substances \n        Control, the Department of Energy, and the National Aeronautics \n        and Space Administration entered into administrative orders on \n        consent for the cleanup of contamination in soil to background \n        levels on the portions of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory \n        covered by the orders, with certain limited specified \n        exceptions; and\n            (7) Congress expects that a comparable cleanup will occur \n        on the remaining portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, \n        such that the cleanup on the remaining portion will be \n        protective of all allowable uses under Ventura County, \n        California, zoning and general plan designations for the Santa \n        Susana Field Laboratory in effect as of December 7, 2016.\n\nSEC. 3.
