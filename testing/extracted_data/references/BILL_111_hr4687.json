In complying with \n        such determination requirement, a State housing credit agency \n        shall establish a process in which applicants that are \n        allocated credits are required to demonstrate good faith \n        efforts to obtain investment commitments for such credits \n        before the agency makes such subawards.\n            (2) Subawards subject to same requirements as low-income \n        housing credit allocations.--Any such subaward with respect to \n        any qualified low-income building may be in the form of a grant \n        or a loan of any duration and shall be made in the same manner \n        and shall be subject to the same limitations (including rent, \n        income, and use restrictions on such building) as an allocation \n        of housing credit dollar amount allocated by such State housing \n        credit agency under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n        1986, except that such subawards shall not be limited by, or \n        otherwise affect (except as provided in subsection (i)(9) of \n        such section), the State housing credit ceiling applicable to \n        such agency.\n            (3) Compliance and asset management.--The State housing \n        credit agency shall perform asset management functions to \n        ensure compliance with section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code \n        of 1986 and the long-term viability of buildings funded by any \n        subaward under this section. The State housing credit agency \n        may collect reasonable fees from a subaward recipient to cover \n        expenses associated with the performance of its duties under \n        this paragraph, including the reasonable costs of administering \n        such subawards. The State housing credit agency may retain an \n        agent or other private contractor to satisfy the requirements \n        of this paragraph.\n            (4) Recapture.--The State housing credit agency shall \n        impose conditions or restrictions, including a requirement \n        providing for recapture, on any subaward under this section so \n        as to assure that the building with respect to which such \n        subaward is made remains a qualified low-income building during \n        the compliance period. Any amounts of recapture shall be \n        proportional to the length of time of the noncompliance \n        compared to the 15-year compliance period and the percentage of \n        qualified basis out of compliance compared to the total \n        qualified basis. Any such recapture shall be payable to the \n        Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of \n        the Treasury and may be enforced by means of liens or such \n        other methods as the Secretary of the Treasury determines \n        appropriate.
