ENFORCEMENT FOR INSURERS.\n\n    (a) State Enforcement.--\n            (1) In general.--Each State may establish under State law a \n        regulatory program that provides for the application and \n        enforcement of standards for insurers equal to or more \n        stringent than the standards established under section 8 to \n        carry out this Act.\n            (2) Review.--The Secretary periodically shall review State \n        regulatory programs to determine if they continue to \n        substantially meet the requirements specified in paragraph (1). \n        If the Secretary finds that a State regulatory program no \n        longer substantially meets the requirements, before making a \n        final determination, the Secretary shall provide the State an \n        opportunity to adopt such a plan of correction as would permit \n        the State regulatory program to continue to meet such \n        requirements. If the Secretary makes a final determination that \n        the State regulatory program, after such an opportunity, fails \n        to substantially meet such requirements, the provisions of \n        subsection (b) shall apply to insurers in that State.\n    (b) Federal Fallback Enforcement.--In the case of an insurer, with \nrespect to insurance policies issued in a State which does not have an \napproved regulatory program in effect under subsection (a)(1), that the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services determines fails to comply with \nan applicable standard established under section 8, the insurer is \nsubject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each such \nviolation. The provisions of section 1128A of the Social Security Act \n(other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than \nsubsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous \nsentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or \nproceeding under section 1128A(a) of such Act.\n\nSEC. 10. ENFORCEMENT WITH RESPECT TO GROUP HEALTH PLANS.\n\n    The provisions of this Act insofar as they relate to group health \nplans shall be deemed to be provisions of title I of the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 for purposes of applying such \ntitle. With respect to group health plans, the Secretary of Labor shall \nenforce the requirements of this Act in the same manner as provided for \nunder sections 502, 504, 506, and 510 of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1132, 1134, 1136, and 1140).\n\nSEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the requirements of \nthis Act shall take effect on July 1, 1997, or, in the case of insurers \nand if later, the date specified in subsection (b), and shall apply to \nactions occurring on or after such date.\n    (b) Special Rule.--In the case of a State which the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services identifies as--\n            (1) requiring State legislation (other than legislation \n        appropriating funds) in order for insurance policies to meet \n        standards established under section 8 or for the State \n        insurance commissioner to perform the functions described in \n        section 9(a), but\n            (2) having a legislature which is not scheduled to meet in \n        1997 in a legislative session in which such legislation may be \n        considered,\nthe date specified in this subsection is the first day of the first \ncalendar quarter beginning after the close of the first legislative \nsession of the State legislature that begins on or after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, and in which legislation described in \nparagraph (1) may be considered.
