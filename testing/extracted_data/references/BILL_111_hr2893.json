FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Check cashers, money transmitters, and other legally \n        authorized and regulated money transmitting businesses (also \n        designated as money services businesses) provide a wide range \n        of necessary financial services and products to customers from \n        all walks of life, including the under-banked and urban \n        communities.\n            (2) Those services include domestic and international funds \n        transfers, check cashing, money order and traveler's check \n        sales, and electronic bill payments.\n            (3) Regulatory guidance issued by, and expectations of, the \n        Federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury urge \n        insured depository institutions to conduct reviews of money \n        services businesses' anti-money laundering compliance programs, \n        placing such depository institutions in the position of quasi-\n        regulators.\n            (4) Consequently, many insured depository institutions have \n        refused or closed money services businesses' accounts in order \n        either not to incur the burden, risk or potential liability for \n        undertaking a de facto regulatory function, or else to avoid \n        supervisory sanctions for not exercising such oversight.\n            (5) This trend endangers the existence of legitimate, \n        regulated money services businesses' industry and the ability \n        of such businesses to deliver financial services and products.\n            (6) Loss of depository institution accounts by money \n        services businesses threatens to drive the customer \n        transactions of such businesses underground through unregulated \n        channels, including bulk cash smuggling or other means.\n            (7) It is critical to the interests of national security \n        that transparency of money services businesses' transactions be \n        maintained by ensuring such businesses have a reasonable \n        process to demonstrate to insured depository institutions the \n        compliance by such businesses with anti-money laundering and \n        counter-terrorism financing obligations.\n            (8) Money services businesses are subject to Federal money \n        laundering and terrorist financing control programs and \n        reporting requirements as enforced by State and Federal \n        regulators, including the Secretary of the Treasury, which are \n        authorized to conduct compliance oversight and to impose \n        sanctions through licensing, registration or other powers.\n            (9) These State and Federal regulators have committed to \n        coordinate their supervision and enforcement of such money \n        services businesses' obligations.\n            (10) Insured depository institutions and Federal banking \n        regulators should be able to rely on a regulatory process for \n        conducting oversight of money services businesses' compliance \n        with subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States \n        Code, as well as on a process of self-certification by \n        legitimate money services businesses that attest to such \n        compliance.\n            (11) Accordingly, to eliminate regulatory burden imposed on \n        insured depository institutions and promote access by money \n        services businesses to the banking system and to give full \n        recognition to Federal and State agency authority to supervise \n        and enforce money services businesses' compliance with anti-\n        money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations \n        and their implementing regulations, it is appropriate and \n        necessary to provide for the self-certification process \n        established pursuant to this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
