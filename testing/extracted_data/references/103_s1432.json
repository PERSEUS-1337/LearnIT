FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since early in our Nation's history, it has been the \n        policy of the United States to maintain a strong United States \n        maritime industry that--\n                    (A) includes an operating fleet of modern United \n                States-flag vessels that is sufficient to carry the \n                domestic waterborne commerce of the United States and a \n                substantial portion of the waterborne export and import \n                foreign commerce of the United States, and to provide \n                shipping service essential for maintaining the flow of \n                such domestic and foreign waterborne commerce at all \n                times;\n                    (B) includes a fleet of vessels under United States \n                registry that is adequate to serve as a naval auxiliary \n                in time of war or national emergency;\n                    (C) has a labor force composed of highly trained \n                and efficient United States citizens; and\n                    (D) includes a United States shipbuilding industry \n                with the most modern and efficient facilities.\n            (2) The United States maritime industry has declined to the \n        point that this longstanding national policy is imperiled.\n            (3) There is a growing sentiment in favor of reforming the \n        maritime laws and governmental practices in order to revitalize \n        the industry.\n            (4) Without such reform, it is foreseeable that the \n        remaining United States-flag carriers will shift their \n        operations to foreign-flag vessels and the Nation's \n        shipbuilding industry and other sectors of the maritime \n        industry will continue to decline.\n            (5) A focused review of the United States maritime industry \n        and impediments to its success should be undertaken in order to \n        lay a solid foundation for reform.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO MERCHANT MARINE ACT, 1936.\n\n    The Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), is \namended by adding at the end the following new title:\n\n``TITLE XIV--NATIONAL COMMISSION ON MARITIME INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS\n\n``SEC. 1401.
