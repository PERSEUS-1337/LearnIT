FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that the interim payment system for home health \nservices under medicare enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 is having the following unintended consequences:\n            (1) The sickest, most frail medicare beneficiaries are \n        losing access to medically necessary home health services which \n        are otherwise covered under the medicare program.\n            (2) Many high-quality, cost-effective agencies have had per \n        beneficiary limits set so low that they are finding it \n        impossible to continue their participation in the medicare \n        program.\n            (3) Many agencies are being subjected to aggregate per \n        beneficiary limits which do not accurately reflect their \n        current patient mix and make it impossible for these agencies \n        to compete with similarly situated agencies.\n            (4) Residents of certain States and regions of the country \n        are being afforded access to far fewer home health services \n        under medicare than residents of certain other States or \n        regions of the country who have identical medical conditions.\n            (5) Under the surety bond requirements, high-quality, law-\n        abiding home health agencies which have participated \n        satisfactorily in the medicare program for years are being \n        excluded.\n\nSEC. 3.
