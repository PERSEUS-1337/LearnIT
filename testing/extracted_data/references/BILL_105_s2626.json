FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Over 10,000,000 children in the United States, 1 in 7, \n        lack health insurance coverage.\n            (2) Nearly half of those children (4,700,000) are eligible \n        for health benefits coverage through the medicaid program but \n        are not enrolled in that program.\n            (3) Children without health insurance coverage are 4 times \n        more likely to go without needed medical or surgical care.\n            (4) One out of 5 children who are uninsured for a year or \n        longer are missing all of their current immunizations.\n            (5) Children without health insurance are less likely to \n        have a family doctor, less likely to receive timely preventive \n        care, and less likely to receive treatment, even for serious \n        illnesses.\n            (6) Uninsured children are more likely to need emergency \n        room care at twice the cost of office-based care.\n            (7) A recent report by the Agency for Health Care Policy \n        and Research (AHCPR) stressed the need for States to engage in \n        outreach activities to increase the enrollment of medicaid-\n        eligible children.\n            (8) Outreach activities like shortened and simplified \n        applications, presumptive and continuous eligibility, and \n        outstationing of eligibility workers in schools and day care \n        centers have been found to be effective in getting medicaid-\n        eligible children enrolled in the medicaid program.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICAID CHILDREN'S ENROLLMENT PERFORMANCE BONUS.\n\n    Section 1903 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(x)(1) In General.--Beginning with fiscal year 1999 and each \nfiscal year thereafter, in addition to any other payment under this \ntitle, the Secretary shall pay to each State that satisfies the \nrequirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) a children's enrollment \nperformance bonus under this subsection for such fiscal year in such \namount as the Secretary shall determine.\n    ``(2) Demonstration of Implementation of Outreach Strategies.--A \nState shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the \nState has a commitment to reach and enroll children who are eligible \nfor medical assistance under, but not enrolled in, the State plan under \nthis title through effective implementation of each of the following \noutreach activities:\n            ``(A) Streamlined eligibility procedures.--\n                    ``(i) In general.--The State uses streamlined \n                procedures described in clause (ii) for determining the \n                eligibility for medical assistance under, and \n                enrollment in, the State plan under this title of--\n                            ``(I) children in families with incomes \n                        that do not exceed the effective income level \n                        (expressed as a percent of the poverty line) \n                        that has been specified under such State plan \n                        (including under a waiver authorized by the \n                        Secretary or under section 1902(r)(2) for the \n                        child to be eligible for medical assistance \n                        under section 1902(l)(2) or 1905(n)(2) (as \n                        selected by a State)) for the age of such \n                        child;
