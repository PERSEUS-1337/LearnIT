I \n        have said it has characteristics of an insurgency . . .''.\n            (4) When Americans at home and abroad, including agents \n        assigned to protect United States borders and national \n        security, are targeted, threatened, and attacked by such \n        foreign entities, it threatens the safety and security of the \n        United States and its people.\n            (5) Mexican drug cartels maintain drug-distribution \n        networks, or supply drugs to distributors, in at least 230 \n        American cities, leading the Justice Department to call Mexican \n        drug cartels the ``greatest organized crime threat'' to the \n        United States.\n            (6) On March 13, 2010, Lesley A.
