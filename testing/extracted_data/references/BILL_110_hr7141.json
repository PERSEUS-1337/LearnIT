HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH.\n\n    Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 498C the following:\n\n``SEC. 498D. HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n(including any regulation or guidance), the Secretary shall conduct and \nsupport research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells (regardless \nof the date on which the stem cells were derived from a human embryo).\n    ``(b) Ethical Requirements.--Human embryonic stem cells shall be \neligible for use in any research conducted or supported by the \nSecretary if the cells meet each of the following:\n            ``(1) The stem cells were derived from human embryos that \n        have been donated from in vitro fertilization clinics, were \n        created for the purposes of fertility treatment, and were in \n        excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such \n        treatment.\n            ``(2) Prior to the consideration of embryo donation and \n        through consultation with the individuals seeking fertility \n        treatment, it was determined that the embryos would never be \n        implanted in a woman and would otherwise be discarded.\n            ``(3) The individuals seeking fertility treatment donated \n        the embryos with written informed consent and without receiving \n        any financial or other inducements to make the donation.''.\n\nSEC. 3. GUIDELINES ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN STEM CELLS.\n\n    Part H of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289 \net seq.) is further amended by inserting after section 498D, as \ninserted by this Act, the following:\n\n``SEC. 498E. GUIDELINES ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN STEM CELLS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Director of NIH--\n            ``(1) shall issue guidelines on research involving human \n        embryonic stem cells; and\n            ``(2) may issue guidelines on research involving other \n        human stem cells, as determined to be scientifically warranted \n        by the Director of NIH.\n    ``(b) Updates.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Director \n        of NIH shall review and, as appropriate, update the guidelines \n        issued under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) when the \n        Director determines that such updates are scientifically \n        warranted. The Director of NIH may determine the extent to \n        which such an update applies to ongoing National Institutes of \n        Health conducted- or supported-research.\n            ``(2) Frequency of updates.--The first update required \n        under paragraph (1), with respect to guidelines issued under \n        paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), shall be made not later \n        than the last day of the three-year period beginning on the \n        date such respective guidelines are issued and each subsequent \n        update to such respective guidelines shall be made not later \n        than the last day of each subsequent three-year period.\n    ``(c) Consideration of Other Guidelines.--In developing and \nupdating the guidelines under this section, the Director of NIH shall, \nas appropriate, take into consideration guidelines on human stem cell \nresearch developed by nationally- and internationally-recognized \nscientific organizations.\n    ``(d) Application of Guidelines to Research.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), research that \n        is first conducted or supported by the National Institutes of \n        Health on or after the effective date of the applicable \n        guidelines under subsection (a) shall comply with such \n        guidelines.\n            ``(2) Exception for cells derived before the effective date \n        of the guidelines.--The Director of NIH shall determine the \n        extent to which the guidelines under this section shall apply \n        to research described in paragraph (1) that uses human stem \n        cells derived before the effective date of such guidelines.\n    ``(e) Public Disclosure.--The Director of NIH shall publish the \nguidelines issued and updated under this section on the public website \nof the National Institutes of Health.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    Section 403(a)(5) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n283(a)(5)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraph (L) as (M); and\n            (2) by inserting the following:\n                    ``(L) Human stem cells.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
