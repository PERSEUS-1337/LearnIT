FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States and the Republic of Azerbaijan have \n        many areas of mutual interest and cooperation, but the United \n        States ability to more fully cooperate with Azerbaijan has been \n        severely hindered by the Government of Azerbaijan's gross \n        violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including \n        violations of basic principles of democratic governance, \n        standards to which Azerbaijan has committed itself to adhere as \n        a participating State in the Organization for Security and \n        Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other multilateral \n        institutions.\n            (2) On December 5, 2014, the Government of Azerbaijan \n        arrested investigative reporter Khadija Ismayilova, who also \n        was a radio host on Radio Free/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The \n        charge against her was ``incitement to suicide'', and she was \n        held in pretrial detention and not allowed out on bail. On \n        December 26, 2014, the Government of Azerbaijan raided the Baku \n        Office of RFE/RL and closed its operations. Over the course of \n        a year in pretrial detention, the original charges against Ms. \n        Ismayilova were dropped after government-called witnesses \n        refused to cooperate with the case. However, Ms. Ismayilova \n        remained in detention and the Government of Azerbaijan \n        subsequently charged her with embezzlement, illegal \n        entrepreneurship, tax evasion, and abuse of power. She was \n        convicted and is now serving a 7\\1/2\\-year sentence in prison. \n        The RFE/RL Baku Bureau has not been allowed to reopen.\n            (3) According to the United States State Department report \n        for 2014, the Government of Azerbaijan did not respect its own \n        laws on freedom of speech and press censorship. The report \n        said, ``The government continued to limit freedom of speech and \n        media independence. Journalists faced intimidation and at times \n        were beaten and imprisoned.''.\n            (4) The Committee to Protect Journalists stated that \n        Azerbaijan is the leading jailer of journalists in Europe and \n        Central Asia, and is the fifth most censored country in the \n        world.\n            (5) As an OSCE participating State, the Government of \n        Azerbaijan has committed itself to work toward a standard of \n        free and fair elections. Since its independence in 1992, no \n        election held in Azerbaijan has met the minimum requirements as \n        outlined by the OSCE. Elections for President and for the \n        Parliament have shown a pattern of disregard for the conduct of \n        democratic elections and have been marred by the arbitrary use \n        of state power, disregard for the basic rights of freedom of \n        assembly, association, and expression. The conduct of the \n        elections demonstrates the unwillingness of authorities in \n        Azerbaijan to tolerate political competition.\n            (6) According to the United States Department of State's \n        Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014, Azerbaijan \n        has used ``. . . the judicial system to punish peaceful \n        dissent--including increased reports of arbitrary arrest and \n        detention, politically motivated imprisonment, lack of due \n        process, and lengthy pretrial detention--by secular and \n        religious individuals perceived as a threat by government \n        officials, while crimes against such individuals or their \n        family members went unpunished.''.\n            (7) According to the 2015 report on religious freedom by \n        the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom \n        (USCIRF), ``Despite societal religious tolerance in Azerbaijan, \n        governmental respect for religious freedom continued to \n        deteriorate in 2014.''. The report details the Government's use \n        of the 2009 religion law ``to limit religious freedom and to \n        justify fines, police raids, detentions, and imprisonment.''. \n        There are 44 names on the list of religious prisoners published \n        by USCIRF.\n            (8) USCIRF cited poor conditions for religious minorities \n        in Azerbaijan, reporting that ``most Protestant denominations \n        do not have legal status, including Baptists, Seventh-day \n        Adventists, and Pentecostals, as well as Jehovah's \n        Witnesses.''.\n            (9) The Government of Azerbaijan has further attempted to \n        silence dissent through retribution against the political \n        opposition, journalists, independent NGOs, and their family \n        members, through physical threats and beatings, dismissal from \n        employment, travel restrictions and other forms of \n        intimidation.\n            (10) Those jailed opposition candidates and activists have \n        been treated harshly in pretrial detention and in prison, \n        including physical beatings, denied access to family, defense \n        counsel, medical treatment, and open legal proceedings.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to secure United States national security and economic \n        interests in the region through promotion of a stable and \n        democratic government in Azerbaijan;\n            (2) to call for the immediate release without preconditions \n        of all political prisoners in Azerbaijan;\n            (3) to support the aspirations of the people of Azerbaijan \n        for democracy, internationally recognized human rights, and the \n        rule of law;\n            (4) to support the growth of the rule of law and democratic \n        institutions in Azerbaijan;\n            (5) to work closely with other countries and international \n        organizations, including the OSCE, to bring Azerbaijan in \n        compliance with its multilateral commitments; and\n            (6) reassess United States policy toward the Government of \n        Azerbaijan reevaluating United States policy toward Azerbaijan \n        as warranted by demonstrable progress made by the Government of \n        Azerbaijan consistent with the policy of the United States as \n        stated in this section.\n\nSEC. 4.
