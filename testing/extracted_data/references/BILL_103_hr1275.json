POLICY TOWARD THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) if the transformation of the totalitarian Soviet Union \n        to independent states does not result in the creation of free \n        market economies and functioning democracies, there is a real \n        threat of economic and social collapse, the reemergence of \n        threatening totalitarian states, and the continued rapid \n        production of conventional weapons and weapons of mass \n        destruction;\n            (2) the national security interests of the United States \n        are best served by stable, democratic societies and free \n        markets in Russia and the other former Soviet republics;\n            (3) the economic interests of the United States are best \n        served by the full integration of Russia and the other former \n        Soviet republics into world markets; and\n            (4) the transformation into working democracies with open \n        market economies is primarily the responsibility of the former \n        republics themselves, but the rest of the world can make \n        significant contributions to this effort, linking such \n        contributions to well-planned reform programs.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) it should be the goal of United States policy toward \n        the former Soviet Union to help Russia and the other former \n        Soviet republics, and the Baltic states, achieve economic and \n        political stability through the establishment of democratic \n        states with free market economies that are integrated into the \n        international market economy and political community;\n            (2) the President should immediately begin consultations \n        with the Congress with respect to, and promptly prepare and \n        transmit to the Congress, a comprehensive plan to assist \n        Russia, and those former Soviet republics with democratically \n        elected governments which are moving toward free market \n        economies; and\n            (3) this plan should include expeditious action--\n                    (A) to provide prompt humanitarian assistance when \n                necessary to prevent life-threatening shortages of food \n                and urgently needed medical supplies;\n                    (B) to combat the proliferation of nuclear weapons \n                and components and nuclear weapons technology;\n                    (C) to provide technical and economic assistance to \n                facilitate the emergence of free market economies and \n                democratic institutions; and\n                    (D) to help the former Soviet republics draft laws, \n                establish political and legal structures, and build \n                institutions that facilitate open, democratic, free \n                market societies that protect individual rights.\n\nSEC. 2.
