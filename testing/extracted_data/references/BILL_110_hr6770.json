FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) State and local governments are a vital part of our \n        economy and American life. States, cities, counties, school \n        districts, and other localities and jurisdictions provide \n        health care, education, public safety, and innumerable social \n        services to hundreds of millions of Americans.\n            (2) From September 2007 to June 2008, America's \n        unemployment rate increased from 4.7 percent to 5.5 percent, \n        and hundreds of thousands of additional Americans went without \n        jobs.\n            (3) America's economic downturn is causing painful budget \n        problems for State and local governments. The economic slowdown \n        has lowered State and local tax revenues while the need for \n        public service is expanding. As a result, most States and many \n        localities are suffering budget deficits.\n            (4) Given that 49 of 50 States, and many local governments, \n        are legally required to balance their budgets, the only way \n        these governments can reduce deficits is to cut public services \n        or raise taxes.\n            (5) In 2003, in response to the prior economic downturn, \n        Congress enacted a $20,000,000,000 fiscal relief package for \n        States, including authorizing $10,000,000,000 for flexible \n        anti-recession grants to stimulate the ailing economy and \n        protect vital public services.\n\nSEC. 3. ONE-TIME REVENUE GRANT TO STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 67 of title 31, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 6721.
