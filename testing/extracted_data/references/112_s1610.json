COMPLIANCE DATES.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Compliance Dates.--For each regulation \npromulgated pursuant to section 2(a), the Administrator--\n            (1) shall establish a date for compliance with standards \n        and requirements under the regulation that is, notwithstanding \n        any other provision of law, not earlier than 5 years after the \n        effective date of the regulation; and\n            (2) in proposing a date for that compliance, shall take \n        into consideration--\n                    (A) the costs of achieving emission reductions;\n                    (B) any non-air quality health and environmental \n                impact and energy requirements of the standards and \n                requirements;\n                    (C) the feasibility of implementing the standards \n                and requirements, including the time necessary--\n                            (i) to obtain necessary permit approvals; \n                        and\n                            (ii) to procure, install, and test control \n                        equipment;\n                    (D) the availability of equipment, suppliers, and \n                labor, given the requirements of the regulation and \n                other proposed or finalized regulations of the \n                Administrator; and\n                    (E) potential net employment impacts.\n    (b) New Sources.--The date on which the Administrator proposes a \nregulation pursuant to section 2(a)(1) establishing an emission \nstandard under section 112 or 129 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412, \n7429) shall be treated as the date on which the Administrator first \nproposes such a regulation for purposes of applying--\n            (1) the definition of the term ``new source'' under section \n        112(a)(4) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(a)(4)); or\n            (2) the definition of the term ``new solid waste \n        incineration unit'' under section 129(g)(2) of that Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 7429(g)(2)).\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act restricts or \notherwise affects paragraphs (3)(B) and (4) of section 112(i) of the \nClean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(i)).\n\nSEC. 4. ENERGY RECOVERY AND CONSERVATION.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and to ensure the \nrecovery and conservation of energy consistent with the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), in promulgating regulations \nunder section 2(a) addressing the subject matter of the rules specified \nin section 2(b)(2), the Administrator shall--\n            (1) adopt the definitions of the terms ``commercial and \n        industrial solid waste incineration unit'', ``commercial and \n        industrial waste'', and ``contained gaseous material'' in the \n        rule entitled ``Standards for Performance of New Stationary \n        Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: \n        Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units'' (65 \n        Fed. Reg. 75338 (December 1, 2000)); and\n            (2) identify nonhazardous secondary material to be solid \n        waste (as defined in section 1004 of the Solid Waste Disposal \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 6903) only if--\n                    (A) the material meets that definition of \n                commercial and industrial waste; or\n                    (B) if the material is a gas, the material meets \n                that definition of contained gaseous material.\n\nSEC. 5. OTHER PROVISIONS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Standards Achievable in Practice.--In \npromulgating regulations under section 2(a), the Administrator shall \nensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that emission standards for \nexisting and new sources established under section 112 or 129 of the \nClean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412, 7429), as applicable, can be met under \nactual operating conditions consistently and concurrently with emission \nstandards for all other air pollutants covered by regulations \napplicable to the source category, taking into account--\n            (1) variability in actual source performance;\n            (2) source design;\n            (3) fuels;\n            (4) inputs;\n            (5) controls;\n            (6) ability to measure the pollutant emissions; and\n            (7) operating conditions.\n    (b) Regulatory Alternatives.--For each regulation promulgated under \nsection 2(a), from among the range of regulatory alternatives \nauthorized under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), including \nwork practice standards under section 112(h) of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n7412(h)), the Administrator shall impose the least burdensome, \nconsistent with the purposes of that Act and Executive Order 13563 (76 \nFed.
