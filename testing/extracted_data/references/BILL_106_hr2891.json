FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) non-discriminatory access to, and use of, the rooftops, \n        risers, telephone cabinets, conduits, points of entry or \n        demarcation for internal wiring, and all utility spaces in or \n        on federal buildings and commercial property is essential to \n        the competitive provision of telecommunications services and \n        information services;\n            (2) incumbent telecommunications carriers often enjoy \n        access to such buildings and property through historic rights \n        of way that were developed before the advent of new means of \n        providing such services, in particular the provision of such \n        services using terrestrial fixed wireless or satellite services \n        that enter a building through equipment located on rooftops;\n            (3) the National Telecommunications and Information \n        Administration is the Federal agency tasked with developing \n        policies for the efficient and competitive use of emerging \n        technologies that combine spectrum use with the convergence of \n        communications and computer technologies for the utilization of \n        telecommunications services and information services by Federal \n        agencies;\n            (4) that several States, for example Connecticut and Texas, \n        have already enacted measures to promote non-discriminatory \n        access by telecommunications carriers to rooftops, risers, \n        conduits, utility spaces, and points of entry and demarcation \n        in order to promote the competitive provision of \n        telecommunications services and information services; and\n            (5) that the Federal Government should encourage States to \n        develop similar policies by establishing as Federal policy \n        requirements to promote non-discriminatory access to Federal \n        buildings and commercial property used by agencies of the \n        Federal Government so that taxpayers receive the benefits and \n        cost savings from the competitive provision of \n        telecommunications services and information services by \n        telecommunications carriers.\n\nSEC. 3.
