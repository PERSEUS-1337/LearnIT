FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The growing popularity of recreational boating, \n        including personal watercraft, has resulted in increased \n        numbers of boaters competing for limited space, which leads to \n        more boating accidents and a diminished experience for all \n        users.\n            (2) Personal watercraft are ``thrill craft'' that are \n        operated differently from other motorized boats, are designed \n        to be highly maneuverable at high speeds, and are capable of \n        operating at high speeds in shallow areas that are typically \n        inaccessible by other motorized boats.\n            (3) Irresponsible operation of personal watercraft poses a \n        safety risk for untrained operators and other recreational \n        users, and damages valuable aquatic habitat in shallow waters.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES AND POLICIES.\n\n    The purposes and policies of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To ensure the safe and responsible use of personal \n        watercraft in the Nation's waterways.\n            (2) To protect sensitive shallow water habitat that is \n        important for many fish and wildlife species.\n            (3) To reduce conflicts among recreational boaters by \n        providing a forum for collaborative management efforts to \n        develop innovative boating regulations for overcrowded \n        waterways.\n            (4) To provide Federal assistance to States to improve the \n        enforcement of recreational boating laws.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n            (1) Terms defined in coastal zone management act of 1972.--\n        Each of the terms ``coastal state'', ``coastal waters'', and \n        ``Secretary'' has the meaning given that term under section 304 \n        of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1453).\n            (2) Personal watercraft.--The term ``personal watercraft'' \n        means a motor vessel that is capable of carrying one or more \n        persons and--\n                    (A) uses an inboard motor powering a water jet pump \n                or a caged propeller as its primary source of motive \n                power; and\n                    (B) is designed to be operated by a person standing \n                on, kneeling on, sitting in, or sitting astride the \n                vessel.\n            (3) No-wake speed.--The term ``no-wake speed'' means the \n        speed at which a personal watercraft moves through the water \n        while maintaining minimum headway and producing the smallest \n        wake possible.\n\nSEC. 5.
