No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an \nextension for more than ten working days, except as provided in clause \n(ii) of this subparagraph.\n    ``(ii) With respect to a request for which a written notice under \nclause (i) extends the time limits prescribed under clause (i) of \nsubparagraph (A), the agency shall notify the person making the request \nif the request cannot be processed within the time limit specified in \nthat clause and shall provide the person an opportunity to limit the \nscope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit \nor an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame \nfor processing the request or a modified request.
