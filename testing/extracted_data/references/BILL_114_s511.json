PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) establish a consistent and enforceable standard for \n        labeling of foods produced using genetic engineering, thereby \n        providing consumers with knowledge of how their food is \n        produced; and\n            (2) prevent consumer confusion and deception by prohibiting \n        the labeling of products produced from genetic engineering as \n        ``natural'', and by promoting the disclosure of factual \n        information on food labels to allow consumers to make informed \n        decisions.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the process of genetically engineering food organisms \n        results in material changes and the fact that foods are \n        genetically engineered is of material importance to consumers;\n            (2) the Food and Drug Administration requires the labeling \n        of more than 3,000 ingredients, additives, and processes;\n            (3) individuals in the United States have a right to know \n        if their food was produced with genetic engineering for a \n        variety of reasons, including health, economic, environmental, \n        religious, and ethical;\n            (4) more than 60 countries, including the United Kingdom \n        and all other countries of the European Union, South Korea, \n        Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, China, and other key United \n        States trading partners have laws or regulations mandating \n        disclosure of genetically engineered food on food labels;\n            (5) in 2011, Codex Alimentarius, the food standards \n        organization of the United Nations, adopted a text that \n        indicates that governments can decide on whether and how to \n        label foods produced with genetic engineering;\n            (6) mandatory identification of food produced with genetic \n        engineering can be a critical method of preserving the economic \n        value of exports or domestically sensitive markets with \n        labeling requirements for genetically engineered foods; and\n            (7) the cultivation of genetically engineered crops can \n        have adverse effects on the environment in the form of cross-\n        pollination of native plants, increased herbicide usage, and \n        impacts on non-target and beneficial organisms, including the \n        Monarch butterfly.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(z)(1) If it is a food that has been genetically engineered or \ncontains 1 or more genetically engineered ingredients, unless the \ningredients label clearly states that the food has been genetically \nengineered or identifies any genetically engineered ingredients, as \napplicable.\n    ``(2) This paragraph does not apply to food that--\n            ``(A) is served in restaurants or other similar eating \n        establishments, such as cafeterias and carryouts;\n            ``(B) is a medical food (as defined in section 5(b) of the \n        Orphan Drug Act);\n            ``(C) would be subject to this paragraph solely because it \n        was produced using a genetically engineered vaccine or drug;\n            ``(D) is a food or processed food that would be subject to \n        this paragraph solely because it includes the use of a \n        genetically engineered processing aid (including yeast) or \n        enzyme; or\n            ``(E) is a packaged food consisting of materials produced \n        through genetic engineering that do not account for more than \n        nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total weight of the packaged \n        food.\n    ``(3) In this paragraph and in paragraph (aa):\n            ``(A) The term `genetic engineering' means a process--\n                    ``(i) involving the application of in vitro nucleic \n                acid techniques, including recombinant deoxyribonucleic \n                acid (DNA) and direct injection of nucleic acid into \n                cells or organelles;\n                    ``(ii) involving the application of fusion of cells \n                beyond the taxonomic family;

and\n                    ``(ii) the organism is capable for use as human \n                food.''.\n    (b) Restrictions on the Term ``Natural''.--Section 403 of the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343), as amended by \nsubsection (a), is further amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(aa) If it is a food intended for human consumption that has been \nproduced using genetic engineering or that contains one or more \ngenetically engineered ingredients and it bears a label, or for which \nthere is signage or advertising, containing a claim that the food is \n`natural', `naturally made', `naturally grown', `all natural', or using \nany similar words that would be misleading to a consumer.''.\n    (c) Guaranty.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 303(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, \n        and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333(d)) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``(d)'' and inserting ``(d)(1)''; \n                and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(2)(A) No person shall be subject to the penalties of \n        subsection (a)(1) for a violation of subsection (a), (b), or \n        (c) of section 301 involving food that is misbranded within the \n        meaning of paragraph (z) or (aa) of section 403 if such person \n        (referred to in this paragraph as the `recipient') establishes \n        a guaranty or undertaking that--\n                    ``(i) is signed by, and contains the name and \n                address of, a person residing in the United States from \n                whom the recipient received in good faith the food \n                (including the receipt of seeds to grow raw \n                agricultural commodities);
