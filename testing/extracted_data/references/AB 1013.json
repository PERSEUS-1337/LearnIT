    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 25402.1 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n25402.1.\nIn order to implement the requirements of subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402, all of the following shall apply:\n(a) The commission shall develop a public domain computer program that will enable contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and government officials to estimate the energy consumed by residential and nonresidential buildings. The commission may charge a fee for the use of the program, which shall be based upon the actual cost of the program, including any computer costs.\n(b) The commission shall establish a formal process for certification of compliance options for new products, materials, and calculation methods that provides for adequate technical and public review to ensure accurate, equitable, and timely evaluation of certification applications. Proponents filing applications for new products, materials, and calculation methods shall provide all information needed to evaluate the application that is required by the commission. The commission shall publish annually the results of its certification decisions and instructions to users and local building officials concerning requirements for showing compliance with the building standards for new products, materials, or calculation methods. The commission may charge and collect a reasonable fee from applicants to cover the costs under this subdivision. Any funds received by the commission for purposes of this subdivision shall be deposited in the Energy Resources Programs Account and, notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, are continuously appropriated to the commission for the purposes of this subdivision. Any unencumbered portion of funds collected as a fee for an application remaining in the Energy Resources Programs Account after completion of the certification process for that application shall be returned to the applicant within a reasonable period of time.\n(c) The commission shall include a prescriptive method of complying with the standards, including design aids such as a manual, sample calculations, and model structural designs.\n(d) The commission shall conduct a pilot project of field testing of actual residential buildings to calibrate and identify potential needed changes in the modeling assumptions to increase the accuracy of the public domain computer program specified in subdivision (a) and to evaluate the impacts of the standards, including, but not limited to, the energy savings, cost-effectiveness, and the effects on indoor air quality. The pilot project shall be conducted pursuant to a contract entered into by the commission. The commission shall consult with the participants designated pursuant to Section 9202 of the Public Utilities Code, as that section read on December 31, 2003, to seek funding and support for field monitoring in each public utility service territory, with the University of California to take advantage of its extensive building monitoring expertise, and with the California Building Industry Association to coordinate the involvement of builders and developers throughout the state. The pilot project shall include periodic public workshops to develop plans and review progress. The commission shall prepare and submit a report to the Legislature on progress and initial findings not later than December 31, 1988, and a final report on the results of the pilot project on residential buildings not later than June 30, 1990. The report shall include recommendations regarding the need and feasibility of conducting further monitoring of actual residential and nonresidential buildings. The report shall also identify any revisions to the public domain computer program and energy conservation standards if the pilot project determines that revisions are appropriate.\n(e) The commission shall certify, not later than 180 days after approval of the standards by the State Building Standards Commission, an energy conservation manual for use by designers, builders, and contractors of residential and nonresidential buildings. The manual shall be furnished upon request at a price sufficient to cover the costs of production and shall be distributed at no cost to all affected local agencies. The manual shall contain, but not be limited to, the following:\n(1) The standards for energy conservation established by the commission.\n(2) Forms, charts, tables, and other data to assist designers and builders in meeting the standards.\n(3) Design suggestions for meeting or exceeding the standards.\n(4) Any other information which the commission finds will assist persons in conforming to the standards.\n(5) Instructions for use of the computer program for calculating energy consumption in residential and nonresidential buildings.\n(6) The prescriptive method for use as an alternative to the computer program.\n(f) The commission shall approve and make publicly available, not less than six months prior to the effective date of adopted or updated standards, a version of the public domain computer program developed pursuant to subdivision (a) that will function properly with those adopted on updated standards. Before approving the public domain computer program for use with adopted or updated standards, the commission shall do both of the following:\n(1) Perform preliminary tests of the public domain computer program using common examples of residential and nonresidential buildings and building systems to ensure the usability of the public domain computer program by users of the program, including, but not limited to, architects, builders, contractors, and local code enforcement personnel.\n(2) Make the results of the preliminary tests publicly available.\n(g) The commission shall establish a continuing program of technical assistance to local building departments in the enforcement of subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402 and this section. The program shall include the training of local officials in building technology and enforcement procedures related to energy conservation, and the development of complementary training programs conducted by local governments, educational institutions, and other public or private entities. The technical assistance program shall include the preparation and publication of forms and procedures for local building departments in performing the review of building plans and specifications. The commission shall provide, on a contract basis, a review of building plans and specifications submitted by a local building department, and shall adopt a schedule of fees sufficient to repay the cost of those services.\n(h) Subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402 and this section, and the rules and regulations of the commission adopted pursuant to those provisions, shall be enforced by the building department of every city, county, or city and county.\n(1) A building permit for a residential or nonresidential building shall not be issued by a local building department, unless a review by the building department of the plans for the proposed residential or nonresidential building contains detailed energy system specifications and confirms that the building satisfies the minimum standards established pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 25402 and this section applicable to the building.\n(2) Where there is no local building department, the commission shall enforce subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402 and this section.\n(3) If a local building department fails to enforce subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402 and this section or any other provision of this chapter or standard adopted pursuant thereto, the commission may provide enforcement after furnishing 10 days\u2019 written notice to the local building department.\n(4) A city, county, or city and county may, by ordinance or resolution, prescribe a schedule of fees sufficient to pay the costs incurred in the enforcement of subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402 and this section. The commission may establish a schedule of fees sufficient to pay the costs incurred by that enforcement.\n(5) The construction of a state building shall not commence until the Department of General Services or the state agency that otherwise has jurisdiction over the property reviews the plans for the proposed building and certifies that the plans satisfy the minimum standards established pursuant to Chapter 2.8 (commencing with Section 15814.30) of Part 10b of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 25402, and this section that are applicable to the building.\n(i) Subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402 and this section shall apply only to new residential and nonresidential buildings on which actual site preparation and construction have not commenced prior to the effective date of rules and regulations adopted pursuant to those provisions that are applicable to those buildings. Those sections shall not prohibit either of the following:\n(1) The enforcement of state or local energy conservation or energy insulation standards, adopted prior to the effective date of rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402 and this section with regard to residential and nonresidential buildings on which actual site preparation and construction have commenced prior to that date.\n(2) The enforcement of city or county energy conservation or energy insulation standards, whenever adopted, with regard to residential and nonresidential buildings on which actual site preparation and construction have not commenced prior to the effective date of rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 25402 and this section, if the city or county files the basis of its determination that the standards are cost effective with the commission and the commission finds that the standards will require the diminution of energy consumption levels permitted by the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to those sections. If, after two or more years after the filing with the commission of the determination that those standards are cost effective, there has been a substantial change in the factual circumstances affecting the determination, upon application by any interested party, the city or county shall update and file a new basis of its determination that the standards are cost effective. The determination that the standards are cost effective shall be adopted by the governing body of the city or county at a public meeting. If, at the meeting on the matter, the governing body determines that the standards are no longer cost effective, the standards shall, as of that date, be unenforceable and no building permit or other entitlement shall be denied based on the noncompliance with the standards.\n(j) The commission may exempt from the requirements of this section and of any regulations adopted pursuant to this section any proposed building for which compliance would be impossible without substantial delays and increases in cost of construction, if the commission finds that substantial funds have been expended in good faith on planning, designing, architecture, or engineering prior to the date of adoption of the regulations.\n(k) If a dispute arises between an applicant for a building permit, or the state pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (h), and the building department regarding interpretation of Section 25402 or the regulations adopted pursuant thereto, either party may submit the dispute to the commission for resolution.
