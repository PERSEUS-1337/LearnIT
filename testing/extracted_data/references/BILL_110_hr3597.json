FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In recent years, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has \n        described the American health care system in crisis. It is \n        estimated between 44,000 to 98,000 American die as a result of \n        medical errors each year. A paramount reason for compromised \n        patient safety is the critical shortage of Registered Nurses \n        (RN) in the United States.\n            (2) In 2002, the Joint Commission found that for roughly a \n        quarter (24 percent) of hospital patient deaths and injuries, \n        low nurse staffing levels was a contributing factor.\n            (3) The current nursing shortage places the lives of \n        patients at risk and the shortage is only projected to worsen. \n        In April 2006, the Health Resources and Services Administration \n        (HRSA) predicted that the nation's nursing shortage would grow \n        to more than one million nurses by 2020. If the current nursing \n        shortage trend continues, only sixty-four percent of the \n        projected demand will be met.\n            (4) More registered nurses must be educated to meet the \n        demanding needs of the future. They are a critical component of \n        the health care delivery system, are the first responders \n        during natural disasters and are essential to provide health \n        care to the U.S. military. In the future, RNs will play an even \n        larger role in the health care delivery system as 78 million \n        baby boomers age and require additional health care services.\n            (5) Over the last nine years, the nursing shortage has \n        become more apparent as constraints in nursing education \n        programs have intensified. According to the American \n        Association of Colleges of Nursing report on 2006-2007 \n        Enrollment and Graduations in Baccalaureate and Graduate \n        Programs in Nursing, U.S. nursing schools turned away 42,866 \n        qualified applicants from baccalaureate and graduate nursing \n        programs in 2006 due to insufficient number of faculty, \n        clinical sites, classroom space, clinical preceptors, and \n        budget constraints.\n            (6) While graduations increased by 18 percent from 2005 to \n        2006 in entry-level baccalaureate nursing programs, this \n        increase does not meet the demand. The April 2006 HRSA \n        projection noted that nursing schools must increase the number \n        of graduates by 90 percent in order to adequately address the \n        nursing shortage.\n            (7) From 1971 to 1978, Congress provided schools of nursing \n        Capitation Grants, which are formula grants based on the number \n        of students enrolled. Most notably, the Nurse Training Act of \n        1971 (P.L. 92-158) and the Nurse Training Act of 1975 (P.L. 94-\n        63) facilitated increased enrollments in schools of nursing and \n        helped relieve past nursing shortages.\n            (8) According to a 2006 National League for Nursing report, \n        nurse faculty vacancies continued to grow with 1,390 as the \n        estimated number of budgeted, unfilled, full-time positions \n        countrywide in 2006.\n\nSEC. 3. NURSING EDUCATION.\n\n    Title VII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1133 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new part:\n\n   ``PART E--ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR R.N. STUDENTS OR GRADUATE-LEVEL \n                            NURSING STUDENTS\n\n``SEC. 771. ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR R.N.
