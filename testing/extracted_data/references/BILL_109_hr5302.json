SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the States, with an average gas \ntax of 20.8 cents per gallon, also possess the ability to provide \nsignificant immediate relief to motorists by temporarily suspending \ntheir own motor fuel excise taxes. While Congress believes such action \nis appropriate, Congress also believes that the States should find \noffsets for such temporary motor fuel excise tax suspensions in order \nto maintain their commitment to transportation infrastructure \ninvestment.\n\nSEC. 3.
