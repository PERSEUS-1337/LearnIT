and\n                    (B) should be commended for their flexibility, \n                quick turnaround times, and the one-on-one assistance \n                from Small Business Administration personnel in \n                structuring loan deals, negotiating payment terms, and \n                ensuring that the financial needs of small businesses \n                are met;\n            (2) the Export-Import Bank of the United States only has \n        Regional Export Finance Managers co-located in 12 Department of \n        Commerce United States Export Assistance Centers, whereas the \n        Small Business Administration--\n                    (A) has Regional Export Finance Managers co-located \n                in 20 United States Export Assistance Centers;

and\n                    (B) under the current structure, competing against \n                each other for small business clients; and\n            (5) the Export Credit Insurance Program of the Export-\n        Import Bank of the United States is a vital component of export \n        loan programs.\n    (c) Declaration of Policy.--It is hereby declared to be the policy \nof this Act--\n            (1) that, should the statutory authority for the export \n        loan programs administered by the Export-Import Bank of the \n        United States lapse, the Small Business Administration shall \n        serve the small business clients of the Export-Import Bank of \n        the United States under existing statutory authority of the \n        Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.);\n            (2) to create an Export Credit Insurance Program within the \n        Small Business Administration similar to the Export Credit \n        Insurance Program of the Export-Import Bank of the United \n        States;
