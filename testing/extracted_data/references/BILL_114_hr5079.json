FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) With the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \n        (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.), Congress provided a statutory basis \n        for the operation of gaming by federally recognized Indian \n        tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, \n        self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments.\n            (2) The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act defines three classes \n        of gaming, specifying that class III gaming may only be \n        conducted in States that have authorized gaming and pursuant to \n        Tribal-State compacts negotiated in good faith through the \n        government-to-government relationship between federally \n        recognized Indian tribes and States.\n            (3) With the passage of Proposition 1A in 2000, the voters \n        of California amended the State Constitution to authorize the \n        operation of class III gaming by federally recognized Indian \n        tribes on Indian lands in California in accordance with Federal \n        law. Proposition 1A also authorized the Governor of California \n        to negotiate gaming compacts with such tribes, subject to \n        ratification by the State legislature.\n            (4) Under California law, actions by the State legislature, \n        including the ratification of gaming compacts, are subject to \n        California's referendum process. Under that process, the State \n        legislature's ratification of a gaming compact does not go into \n        effect if California voters qualify a referendum vote on that \n        compact. If such a referendum is qualified, the Compact only \n        goes into effect after voter approval of the legislature's \n        decision.\n            (5) This referendum process serves as a form of democratic \n        oversight of the California Governor and State legislature.\n            (6) In passing the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, Congress \n        intended to respect the individual States' authority to \n        determine their own public policy and to negotiate and conclude \n        gaming compacts pursuant to each State's laws.\n            (7) The Tribal-State gaming compact process in California \n        is undermined if the Secretary of the Interior prescribes \n        Federal procedures under which class III gaming may be \n        conducted on the land made eligible for Indian gaming pursuant \n        to section 20(b)(1)(A) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 \n        U.S.C. 2719 (b)(1)(A)), when the compact for gaming on that \n        land was not ratified by the State Legislature or was rejected \n        by a constitutionally called referendum.\n            (8) Congress reaffirms the importance of section \n        20(b)(1)(A) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. \n        2719(b)(1)(A)), the statutory authority by which federally \n        recognized Indian tribes can acquire certain gaming lands \n        eligible for gaming purposes outside of their reservation \n        boundaries. This section provides State and tribal governments \n        with the flexibility to locate tribal government gaming \n        facilities on newly acquired land at the most appropriate \n        locations. However, Congress did not intend for this section to \n        allow for tribal gaming facilities on after-acquired lands over \n        the express objection of the voters of the State.\n            (9) It is in the interest of the Federal Government, \n        States, and federally recognized Indian tribes that Congress \n        require that, in California, off-reservation gaming proposals \n        be subject to the full ratification and referendum process \n        established by California State law.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON ACTION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ABSENT A \n              VALID COMPACT.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Certain Class III Gaming.--Section 11(d)(7)(B) \nof the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(7)(B)) is \namended by inserting after clause (vii) the following:\n    ``(viii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, for any \nland in California on which Indian gaming was authorized under (25 \nU.S.C. 2719(b)(1)(A)) and for which the Legislature of the State of \nCalifornia did not ratify a proposed class III Tribal-State gaming \ncompact or for which the electorate of California rejected the approval \nof a class III Tribal-State gaming compact through a constitutionally \nvalid referendum, the Secretary may not--\n            ``(I) prescribe class III gaming procedures;\n            ``(II) approve a class III gaming compact; or\n            ``(III) consider a class III gaming compact to have been \n        approved by the Secretary, if the Secretary does not approve or \n        disapprove the compact before the date that is 45 days after \n        the date on which the compact is submitted.''.\n    (b) Clarification.--Nothing in this Act or the amendment made by \nsubsection (a) shall be interpreted to impact the implementation of \nauthorities under the Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as the \n``Indian Reorganization Act''), or any other section of the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act.\n    (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall be \neffective as of April 27, 2016."
