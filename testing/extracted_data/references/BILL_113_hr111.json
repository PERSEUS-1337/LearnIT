FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued an order \n        commissioning around 250,000 troops from the Philippines into \n        active service for the United States during World War II.\n            (2) The United States War Department immediately formed the \n        United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). The unit \n        was made up of the United States-Philippine Military Forces of \n        the Commonwealth Army, Guerrilla Units, New Philippine Scout.\n            (3) The Filipino Infantry Regiment, was mostly composed of \n        first-generation immigrants living along the Pacific Coast, who \n        volunteered after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, \n        later many second-generation Filipino-American soldiers joined \n        the Regiment from Hawaii.\n            (4) The Philippine Scout units and the New Philippine \n        Scouts were directly recruited by the United States Army for \n        the war effort.\n            (5) Under extremely severe occupation policies imposed by \n        the Japanese, it was the anti-Japanese resistance movement that \n        drew more and more Filipinos to its side and through 1943 many \n        of these anti-Japanese guerrillas recovered or newly \n        established liaisons with the United States Army Command of the \n        Southwest Pacific Area and placed themselves under the command \n        of General Douglas MacArthur.\n            (6) These Filipino soldiers responded to President \n        Roosevelt's call-to-arms and later fought under the American \n        flag during World War II.\n            (7) After the Japanese invasion in December 1941, Filipino \n        and American troops literally shared the same fate at Bataan, \n        Corregidor, and the ``Death March''.\n            (8) Many made the ultimate sacrifice as both soldiers in \n        the United States Armed Forces in the Far East and as guerilla \n        fighters during the Imperial Japanese occupation of the \n        Philippines.\n            (9) These troops had served under the expectation that they \n        would be treated as United States military servicemembers.\n            (10) The Rescission Act of 1946 later passed, which stated \n        that Filipino forces would not be deemed to have been active \n        military.\n            (11) Congress recognizes the courage and bravery of the \n        Filipino and Filipino American servicemen and servicewomen who \n        have fought alongside and in the United States Armed Forces.\n            (12) The United States remains forever indebted to the \n        bravery, valor, and dedication to country these men displayed.\n            (13) Their commitment and sacrifice demonstrates a highly \n        uncommon and commendable sense of patriotism and honor.\n\nSEC. 3.
