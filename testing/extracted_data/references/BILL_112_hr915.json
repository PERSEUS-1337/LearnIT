These \n    multi-agency teams are designed to increase information-sharing and \n    collaboration among the participating law enforcement agencies.\n        (5) BEST teams incorporate personnel from ICE, United States \n    Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Drug Enforcement \n    Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \n    Explosives (ATFE), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the \n    United States Coast Guard (USCG), and the U.S. Attorney's Office \n    (USAO), along with other key Federal, State and local law \n    enforcement agencies.\n        (6) Foreign law enforcement agencies participating in BEST \n    include Mexico's Secretaria de Seguridad Publica (SSP), the Canada \n    Border Services Agency (CBSA), the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), \n    and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\nSEC. 3.
