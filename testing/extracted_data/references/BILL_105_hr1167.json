FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n        is deterred by potential for liability actions against them and \n        the organizations they serve;\n            (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n        organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n        associations, social service agencies, educational \n        institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n        affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n        directors and service in other capacities;\n            (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n        is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n        programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were \n        participating; and\n            (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n        effective social service programs, many of which are national \n        in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n        represent some of the most successful public-private \n        partnerships, protection of volunteerism through clarification \n        and limitation of the personal liability risks assumed by the \n        volunteer in connection with such participation is an \n        appropriate subject for Federal legislation.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the interests \nof social service program beneficiaries and taxpayers and to sustain \nthe availability of programs, nonprofit organizations, and governmental \nentities that depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws \nto provide protection from personal financial liability to volunteers \nserving nonprofit organizations and governmental entities for actions \nundertaken in good faith on behalf of such organizations.\n\nSEC. 3. PREEMPTION.\n\n    This Act preempts the laws of any State to the extent that such \nlaws are inconsistent with this Act, except that this Act shall not \npreempt any State law that provides additional protections to \nvolunteers or category of volunteers from personal liability in the \nperformance of services for a nonprofit organization or governmental \norganization.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n    (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as provided in \nsubsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity shall be liable for harm caused by an act or \nomission of the volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity if--\n            (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \n        volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n        governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n            (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n        licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate \n        authorities for the activities or practice in the State, in \n        which the harm occurred, undertaken within the scope of the \n        volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n        governmental entity; and\n            (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal \n        misconduct or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights \n        or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer.\n    (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers to Organizations and \nEntities.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any \ncivil action brought by any nonprofit organization or any governmental \nentity against any volunteer of such organization or entity.\n    (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization or Entity.--Nothing in \nthis section shall be construed to affect the liability of any \nnonprofit organization or governmental entity with respect to harm \ncaused to any person, except that in an action brought on the basis of \nsuch liability punitive damages may not be awarded against such \norganization or entity unless the harm was proximately caused by the \naction of a volunteer of such organization or entity which was willful \nor criminal or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or \nsafety of the individual harmed.\n    (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the laws of a \nState limit volunteer liability subject to one or more of the following \nconditions, such conditions shall not be construed as inconsistent with \nthis section:\n            (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \n        governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures, \n        including mandatory training of volunteers.\n            (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity \n        liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the same \n        extent as an employer is liable for the acts or omissions of \n        its employees.\n            (3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n        inapplicable if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, \n        vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which the State requires \n        the operator or vehicle owner to possess an operator's license \n        or to maintain insurance.\n            (4) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n        inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of a \n        State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n            (5) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n        applicable only if the nonprofit organization or governmental \n        entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for \n        individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a \n        volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A \n        financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance \n        policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a risk \n        pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n        arrangements that satisfy the State that the organization or \n        entity will be able to pay for losses up to a specified amount. \n        Separate standards for different types of liability exposure \n        may be specified.\n\nSEC. 5.
