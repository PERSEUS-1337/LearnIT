FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Migratory Bird Treaty Act was enacted in 1918 to \n        implement the 1916 Convention for the Protection of Migratory \n        Birds between the United States and Great Britain (for Canada). \n        The Act was later amended to reflect similar agreements with \n        Mexico, Japan, and the former Soviet Union.\n            (2) Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as amended, \n        the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to promulgate \n        regulations specifying when, how, and whether migratory birds \n        may be hunted.\n            (3) Contained within these regulations are prohibitions on \n        certain methods of hunting migratory birds to prevent an \n        excessive harvest of the resource. These prohibitions, many of \n        which were recommended by sportsmen, have been in place for \n        over 60 years and have received broad acceptance among the \n        hunting community with one principal exception relating to the \n        application and interpretation of the prohibitions on the \n        hunting of migratory birds by the aid of baiting, or on or over \n        any baited area.\n            (4) The prohibitions regarding the hunting of migratory \n        birds by the aid of bait, or on or over bait, have been fraught \n        with interpretive difficulties on the part of law enforcement, \n        the hunting community, and courts of law. Hunters who desire to \n        comply with applicable regulations have been subject to \n        citation for violations of the regulations due to the lack of \n        clarity, inconsistent interpretations, and enforcement. The \n        baiting regulations have been the subject of multiple \n        congressional hearings and a law enforcement advisory \n        commission.\n            (5) Restrictions on the hunting of migratory birds by the \n        aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, must be \n        clarified in a manner that recognizes the national and \n        international importance of protecting the migratory bird \n        resource while ensuring consistency and appropriate enforcement \n        including the principles of ``fair chase''. No baiting \n        restrictions should act as a detriment to the benefits of \n        habitat management including wildlife food crops.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFYING HUNTING PROHIBITIONS.\n\n    Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 704) is \namended as follows:\n            (1) By inserting ``(a)'' after ``Sec. 3.''.\n            (2) By adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) No person shall take migratory game birds--\n            ``(1) with a trap, snare, net, rifle, pistol, swivel gun, \n        shotgun larger than 10 gauge, punt gun, battery gun, machine \n        gun, fish hook, poison, drug, explosive, or stupefying \n        substance;\n            ``(2) with a shotgun of any description capable of holding \n        more than 3 shells, unless it is plugged with a one-piece \n        filler, incapable of removal without disassembling the gun, so \n        that its total capacity does not exceed 3 shells;\n            ``(3) from or by means, aid, or use of a sinkbox or any \n        other type of low floating device, having a depression \n        affording a hunter a means of concealment beneath the surface \n        of the water;\n            ``(4) from or by means, aid or use of any motor vehicle, \n        motor-driven land conveyance, or aircraft of any kind, except \n        that paraplegics and persons missing 1 or both legs may take \n        from any stationary motor vehicle or stationary motor-driven \n        land conveyance;\n            ``(5)(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), from or by \n        means of any motorboat or other craft having a motor attached, \n        or any sailboat, unless the motor has been completely shut off \n        and/or the sails furled, and its progress therefrom has ceased;\n            ``(B) a craft under power may be used to retrieve dead or \n        crippled birds (except that crippled birds may not be shot from \n        such craft under power except in the seaduck area, as provided \n        by regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior);\n            ``(6) by means or aid of any motor-driven land, water, or \n        air conveyance, or any sailboat used for the purpose of or \n        resulting in the concentrating, driving, rallying or stirring \n        up of any migratory bird;\n            ``(7) by the use or aid of live birds as decoys, including \n        on any area where tame or captive live ducks or geese are \n        present, unless such birds are and have been for a period of 10 \n        consecutive days prior to such taking, confined within an \n        enclosure which substantially reduces the audibility of their \n        calls and totally conceals such birds from the sight of wild \n        migratory waterfowl;\n            ``(8) by the use or aid of recorded or electrically \n        amplified bird calls or sounds, or recorded or electrically \n        amplified imitations of bird calls or sounds; and\n            ``(9) while possessing shot (either in shotshells or loose \n        shot for muzzle-loading) other than steel shot, bismuth-tin \n        shot, or such other shot as may be approved as nontoxic by the \n        Secretary of the Interior; this paragraph applies only to the \n        taking of Anatidae (ducks, geese, including brant, and swans), \n        coots (Fulica americana) and any species that make up aggregate \n        bag limits during concurrent seasons with the former in areas \n        designated as nontoxic shot zones by the Secretary of the \n        Interior.\n    ``(c)(1) No person shall take any migratory bird by the aid of \nbaiting, or on or over any baited area, where that person knows or \nshould have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that \nbait was present.\n    ``(2) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit--\n            ``(A) the taking of all migratory game birds, including \n        waterfowl, on or over standing crops, flooded standing crops \n        (including aquatics), flooded harvested croplands, grain crops \n        properly shocked on the field where grown, or grains found \n        scattered solely as the result of normal agricultural planting \n        or harvesting;\n            ``(B) the taking of all migratory game birds, except \n        waterfowl, on or over any lands where shelled, shucked, or \n        unshucked corn, wheat or other grain, salt, or other feed has \n        been distributed or scattered as a result of normal \n        agricultural operations or procedures or as a result of \n        manipulation of a crop or other feed on the land where grown \n        for wildlife management purposes; or\n            ``(C) the taking of any migratory game birds, including \n        waterfowl, on or over moist soil on emergent marsh plants--\n                    ``(i) that are on the land where the plants were \n                grown;\n                    ``(ii) that have been mowed, chopped, disced, or \n                otherwise manipulated;
