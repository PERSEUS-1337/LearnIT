The court may \n        issue such warrant if the United States demonstrates that there \n        is probable cause to believe that--\n                    ``(A) the property with respect to which the \n                warrant is sought is subject to the sanction; and\n                    ``(B) the property may be moved outside the \n                jurisdiction of the United States.\n            ``(2) Exception.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The United States may impose a \n                sanction that blocks property of a charity before \n                applying to the court for a warrant under paragraph (1) \n                if the United States has reason to believe that delay \n                in seizure from such ex parte application may have an \n                adverse result, including--\n                            ``(i) endangering the life or physical \n                        safety of an individual;\n                            ``(ii) flight from prosecution;\n                            ``(iii) destruction of or tampering with \n                        evidence;\n                            ``(iv) intimidation of potential witnesses; \n                        or\n                            ``(v) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an \n                        investigation.\n                    ``(B) Probable cause showing.--In a case in which \n                property is subject to a sanction under subparagraph \n                (A), the property shall be released from the order \n                blocking it unless the United States makes the probable \n                cause showing required by paragraph (1) within 48 hours \n                after the property is blocked.\n            ``(3) Subsequent court actions.--Upon a finding of probable \n        cause, the court may issue the warrant.
