FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) electric power utilities are a source of air pollutant \n        emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;INF&gt;x), sulfur dioxide \n        (SO&lt;INF&gt;2), and anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide \n        (CO&lt;INF&gt;2), a greenhouse gas;\n            (2) the electric utility industry is entering a period of \n        restructuring and deregulation in numerous States, regions, and \n        Federal administrative bodies;\n            (3) the opportunities for increased competition offers \n        potentially significant economic benefits to all classes of \n        consumers; however there remains a substantial risk of \n        increased emissions and environmental damages due to changed \n        operating procedures and market characteristics among electric \n        utility generators;\n            (4) studies have raised concerns regarding the likely \n        impacts of electric utility restructuring on the environment, \n        in particular, proposed restructuring actions which may be \n        taken by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;\n            (5) there have been a number of proposals among States for \n        mitigating the environmental impacts of electric utility \n        restructuring, but no regional or national mitigating \n        strategies and policies have been developed or implemented;\n            (6) it is in the national interest to further examine the \n        entire range of environmental impacts associated with electric \n        utility restructuring and to develop additional, more \n        comprehensive strategies and policy recommendations for \n        addressing such impacts; and\n            (7) it is in the national interest for Federal and State \n        utility regulators, Federal and State environmental \n        authorities, and all other affected parties, to cooperate in \n        the formulation of new policies and procedures that will result \n        in no significant diminution in the quality of the national and \n        global environment as a consequence of electric utility \n        restructuring.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Administrator'') \nshall undertake an assessment of the reasonable range of environmental \nimpacts associated with the likely outcomes of electric utility \nrestructuring within and among regions. The assessment shall consider \nsignificant proposed State and Federal alterations of public utility \nregulatory laws and the probable results of these alterations upon \nemissions or on the environment, including emissions of air pollutants, \nincluding pollutants for which standards are in effect under section \n109 of the Clean Air Act, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, \ncarbon; and significant land and water impacts.\n    (b) Consultation.--In performing the assessment under this section \nthe Administrator shall consult with the Secretary of Energy, the Chair \nof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Chair of the Council \non Environmental Quality, and other Federal and State agency officials \nas appropriate.\n    (c) Report.--The Administrator shall submit a report to Congress \nwithin 6 months after the enactment of this Act containing the results \nof the assessment under this section.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to the Administration for the fiscal year 1997 not more \nthan $1,000,000 to be used to carry out the assessment under this \nsection.\n\nSEC. 4. COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Administrator and the Secretary of Energy \nshall establish and co-chair a commission to be known as the Commission \nfor Environmental Mitigation of Electric Utility Restructuring \n(hereinafter in this section referred to as ``the Commission''). The \nCommission shall include a representative from the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and \nthe Council of Economic Advisors.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Commission shall be to develop \nstrategies and policies, using the assessment prepared under section 3, \nto mitigate the environmental impacts associated with electric utility \nrestructuring. The strategies and policies shall--\n            (1) not reduce the benefits of electric utility \n        restructuring;\n            (2) preserve or enhance the quality of competition in the \n        restructured industry, as well as preserving robust and fair \n        competition between other fuels and electricity;\n            (3) give due consideration to the impacts upon companies or \n        investors in companies that provide service in the existing or \n        restructured industry;\n            (4) rely to the maximum extent possible on voluntary \n        measures, economic incentives, and market based policies;\n            (5) be flexible and performance-based;\n            (6) fully mitigate all probable incremental environmental \n        impacts associated with electric utility restructuring;\n            (7) be consistent with the intent of existing State and \n        Federal environmental and siting statutes, policies, and \n        commitments; and\n            (8) assist the Nation in meeting its environmental, \n        economic, employment, and energy policy objectives, including \n        the efficient use of natural resources.\n    (c) Report.--Within 12 months after the enactment of this Act, the \nCommission shall submit a report to Congress containing the \nrecommendations for strategies and policies developed under subsection \n(b). The report shall include, at a minimum--\n            (1) recommendations for the alteration of existing Federal \n        environmental or regulatory statutes;\n            (2) recommendations concerning rules and procedures for the \n        operation of power pools, transmission groups, or other \n        coordinated power systems;\n            (3) recommendations concerning the need for regional and \n        interregional mechanisms or institutions; and\n            (4) options for Federal, regional, or model State policies \n        to fully or adequately mitigate the adverse environmental \n        impacts of restructuring.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated for the fiscal years 1997 and 1998, $1,000,000 to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and $1,000,000 to the Department of \nEnergy to carry out the duties of the Commission.\n\nSEC. 5. EXISTING AUTHORITIES OF FERC AND STATES.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit or otherwise \nadversely affect the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to address the mitigation of adverse environmental impacts \nin any rulemaking relating to the restructuring of the electric utility \nindustry, competition in wholesale energy markets, open transmission \naccess or any related matter. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \nlimit or affect in any way the authority of States to examine or \naddress electric utility restructuring concerns and related \nenvironmental issues that are within the jurisdiction of State \ngovernment authorities."
