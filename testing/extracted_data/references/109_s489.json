    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Consent Decree Fairness \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) Consent decrees are for remedying violations of rights, \n        and they should not be used to advance any policy extraneous to \n        the protection of those rights.\n            (2) Consent decrees are also for protecting the party who \n        faces injury and should not be expanded to apply to parties not \n        involved in the litigation.\n            (3) In structuring consent decrees, courts should take into \n        account the interests of State and local governments in \n        managing their own affairs.\n            (4) Consent decrees should be structured to give due \n        deference to the policy judgments of State and local officials \n        as to how to obey the law.\n            (5) Whenever possible, courts should not impose consent \n        decrees that require technically complex and evolving policy \n        choices, especially in the absence of judicially discoverable \n        and manageable standards.\n            (6) Consent decrees should not be unlimited, but should \n        contain an explicit and realistic strategy for ending court \n        supervision.\n\nSEC. 3.
