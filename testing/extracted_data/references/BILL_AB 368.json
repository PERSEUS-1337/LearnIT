    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 33607.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n33607.5.\n(a) (1) This section shall apply to each redevelopment project area that, pursuant to a redevelopment plan\nwhich\nthat\ncontains the provisions required by Section 33670, is either: (A) adopted on or after January 1, 1994, including later amendments to these redevelopment plans; or (B) adopted prior to January 1, 1994, but amended, after January 1, 1994, to include new territory. For plans amended after January 1, 1994, only the tax increments from territory added by the amendment shall be subject to this section. All the amounts calculated pursuant to this section shall be calculated after the amount required to be deposited in the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund pursuant to Sections 33334.2, 33334.3, and 33334.6 has been deducted from the total amount of tax increment funds received by the agency in the applicable fiscal year.\n(2) The payments made pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any amounts the affected taxing entities receive pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 33670. The payments made pursuant to this section to the affected taxing entities, including the community, shall be allocated among the affected taxing entities, including the community if the community elects to receive payments, in proportion to the percentage share of property taxes each affected taxing entity, including the community, receives during the fiscal year the funds are allocated, which percentage share shall be determined without regard to any amounts allocated to a city, a city and county, or a county pursuant to Sections 97.68 and 97.70 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and without regard to any allocation reductions to a city, a city and county, a county, a special district, or a redevelopment agency pursuant to Sections 97.71, 97.72, and 97.73 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 33681.12. The agency shall reduce its payments pursuant to this section to an affected taxing entity by any amount the agency has paid, directly or indirectly, pursuant to Section 33445, 33445.5, 33445.6, 33446, or any other provision of law other than this section for, or in connection with, a public facility owned or leased by that affected taxing agency, except: (A)  any amounts the agency has paid directly or indirectly pursuant to an agreement with a taxing entity adopted prior to January 1, 1994; or (B)  any amounts that are unrelated to the specific project area or amendment governed by this section. The reduction in a payment by an agency to a school district, community college district, or county office of education, or for special education, shall be subtracted only from the amount that otherwise would be available for use by those entities for educational facilities pursuant to paragraph (4). If the amount of the reduction exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been available for use for educational facilities in any one year, the agency shall reduce its payment in more than one year.\n(3) If an agency reduces its payment to a school district, community college district, or county office of education, or for special education, the agency shall do all of the following:\n(A) Determine the amount of the total payment that would have been made without the reduction.\n(B) Determine the amount of the total payment without the reduction\nwhich:\nthat:\n(i) would have been considered property taxes; and (ii) would have been available to be used for educational facilities pursuant to paragraph (4).\n(C) Reduce the amount available to be used for educational facilities.\n(D) Send the payment to the school district, community college district, or county office of education, or for special education, with a statement that the payment is being reduced and including the calculation required by this subdivision showing the amount to be considered property taxes and the amount, if any, available for educational facilities.\n(4) (A) Except as specified in subparagraph (E), of the total amount paid each year pursuant to this section to school districts, 43.3 percent shall be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of Section 42238 of the Education Code, as it read on January 1, 2013, and paragraph (1) of subdivision (j) of Section 42238.02 of the Education Code, and 56.7 percent shall not be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of that section and shall be available to be used for educational facilities, including, in the case of amounts paid during the 2011\u201312 fiscal year through the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, inclusive, land acquisition, facility construction, reconstruction, remodeling, maintenance, or deferred maintenance.\n(B) Except as specified in subparagraph (E), of the total amount paid each year pursuant to this section to community college districts, 47.5 percent shall be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of Section 84751 of the Education Code, and 52.5 percent shall not be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of that section and shall be available to be used for educational facilities, including, in the case of amounts paid during the 2011\u201312 fiscal year through the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, inclusive, land acquisition, facility construction, reconstruction, remodeling, maintenance, or deferred maintenance.\n(C) Except as specified in subparagraph (E), of the total amount paid each year pursuant to this section to county offices of education, 19 percent shall be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of Section 2558 of the Education Code, as it read on January 1, 2013, and Section 2575 of the Education Code, and 81 percent shall not be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of that section and shall be available to be used for educational facilities, including, in the case of amounts paid during the 2011\u201312 fiscal year through the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, inclusive, land acquisition, facility construction, reconstruction, remodeling, maintenance, or deferred maintenance.\n(D) Except as specified in subparagraph (E), of the total amount paid each year pursuant to this section for special education, 19 percent shall be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of Section 56712 of the Education Code, and 81 percent shall not be considered to be property taxes for the purposes of that section and shall be available to be used for education facilities, including, in the case of amounts paid during the 2011\u201312 fiscal year through the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, inclusive, land acquisition, facility construction, reconstruction, remodeling, maintenance, or deferred maintenance.\n(E) If, pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3), an agency reduces its payments to an educational entity, the calculation made by the agency pursuant to paragraph (3) shall determine the amount considered to be property taxes and the amount available to be used for educational facilities in the year the reduction was made.\n(5) Local education agencies that use funds received pursuant to this section for school facilities shall spend these funds at schools that are: (A) within the project area, (B) attended by students from the project area, (C) attended by students generated by projects that are assisted directly by the redevelopment agency, or (D) determined by the governing board of a local education agency to be of benefit to the project area.\n(b) Commencing with the first fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments and continuing through the last fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments, a redevelopment agency shall pay to the affected taxing entities, including the community if the community elects to receive a payment, an amount equal to 25 percent of the tax increments received by the agency after the amount required to be deposited in the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund has been deducted. In any fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments, the community that has adopted the redevelopment project area may elect to receive the amount authorized by this paragraph.\n(c) Commencing with the 11th fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments and continuing through the last fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments, a redevelopment agency shall pay to the affected taxing entities, other than the community\nwhich\nthat\nhas adopted the project, in addition to the amounts paid pursuant to subdivision (b) and after deducting the amount allocated to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund, an amount equal to 21 percent of the portion of tax increments received by the agency, which shall be calculated by applying the tax rate against the amount of assessed value by which the current year assessed value exceeds the first adjusted base year assessed value. The first adjusted base year assessed value is the assessed value of the project area in the 10th fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increment revenues.\n(d) Commencing with the 31st fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments and continuing through the last fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments, a redevelopment agency shall pay to the affected taxing entities, other than the community\nwhich\nthat\nhas adopted the project, in addition to the amounts paid pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) and after deducting the amount allocated to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund, an amount equal to 14 percent of the portion of tax increments received by the agency, which shall be calculated by applying the tax rate against the amount of assessed value by which the current year assessed value exceeds the second adjusted base year assessed value. The second adjusted base year assessed value is the assessed value of the project area in the 30th fiscal year in which the agency receives tax increments.\n(e) (1) Prior to incurring any loans, bonds, or other indebtedness, except loans or advances from the community, the agency may subordinate to the loans, bonds, or other indebtedness the amount required to be paid to an affected taxing entity by this section, provided that the affected taxing entity has approved these subordinations pursuant to this subdivision.\n(2) At the time the agency requests an affected taxing entity to subordinate the amount to be paid to it, the agency shall provide the affected taxing entity with substantial evidence that sufficient funds will be available to pay both the debt service and the payments required by this section, when due.\n(3) Within 45 days after receipt of the agency\u2019s request, the affected taxing entity shall approve or disapprove the request for subordination. An affected taxing entity may disapprove a request for subordination only if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the agency will not be able to pay the debt payments and the amount required to be paid to the affected taxing entity. If the affected taxing entity does not act within 45 days after receipt of the agency\u2019s request, the request to subordinate shall be deemed approved and shall be final and conclusive.\n(f) (1) The Legislature finds and declares both of the following:\n(A) The payments made pursuant to this section are necessary in order to alleviate the financial burden and detriment that affected taxing entities may incur as a result of the adoption of a redevelopment plan, and payments made pursuant to this section will benefit redevelopment project areas.\n(B) The payments made pursuant to this section are the exclusive payments that are required to be made by a redevelopment agency to affected taxing entities during the term of a redevelopment plan.\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a redevelopment agency shall not be required, either directly or indirectly, as a measure to mitigate a significant environmental effect or as part of any settlement agreement or judgment brought in any action to contest the validity of a redevelopment plan pursuant to Section 33501, to make any other payments to affected taxing entities, or to pay for public facilities that will be owned or leased to an affected taxing entity.\n(g) As used in this section, a \u201clocal education agency\u201d is a school district, a community college district, or a county office of education."
