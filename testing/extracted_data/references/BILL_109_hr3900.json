FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Thousands of fugitives have fled to Mexico to escape \n        prosecution in the United States, including individuals accused \n        of murdering peace officers.\n            (2) The United States should use all reasonable tools \n        available to encourage foreign countries to change their \n        extradition policies so that the possibility of capital \n        punishment or life imprisonment will not interfere with the \n        timely extradition of fugitives of the United States.\n            (3) Under Federal law, it is a crime to kill a Federal \n        peace officer or State or local officers engaged in a Federal \n        investigation.\n            (4) Murdering a State or local peace officer and fleeing \n        the country to avoid prosecution should also be a Federal crime \n        with the same penalties as the murder of a Federal officer.\n            (5) State and local prosecutors are the best equipped \n        prosecutors to prosecute crimes against local and State peace \n        officers.\n            (6) Cases involving the murder of local and State peace \n        officers and subsequent flight to avoid prosecution in the \n        United States implicate Federal interests, and by providing \n        Federal jurisdiction in such cases the Federal Government will \n        be able to provide additional investigatory and prosecutorial \n        resources.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF FEDERAL CRIME FOR KILLING PEACE OFFICERS AND \n              TRAVELING IN FOREIGN COMMERCE.\n\n    (a) Federal Crime Relating to Peace Officers.--Section 1121 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(c)(1) Whoever murders a peace officer engaged in, or on account \nof the performance of, the official duties of such officer, and moves \nor travels in foreign commerce with intent to avoid prosecution or \nconfinement after conviction of that crime--\n            ``(A) in the case of murder in the first degree, shall be \n        punished by death or by imprisonment for life (in accordance \n        with section 1111(b)); and\n            ``(B) in the case of murder in the second degree, shall be \n        imprisoned for not less than 30 years (notwithstanding section \n        1111(a)) or for life.\n    ``(2) Whoever, under section 3, is an accessory after the fact with \nrespect to a violation of paragraph (1) shall be imprisoned for not \nless than 15 years.\n    ``(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a term of \nimprisonment imposed under this subsection shall be consecutive to any \nother sentence of imprisonment imposed by a Federal or State court or \nby a court of a foreign state.\n    ``(4) Violations of this section may be prosecuted only after \nformal approval in writing, upon consultation with the appropriate \nState or local prosecutor, by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, the Associate Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, which function of approving prosecutions \nmay not be delegated.\n    ``(5) As used in this subsection, the term `peace officer' means \nany officer of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision \nof a State who is empowered by law to conduct investigations of or to \nmake arrests for offenses against the United States, the State, or the \npolitical subdivision.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendments.--\n            (1) The heading for section 1121 of title 18, United States \n        Code, is amended to read as follows:\n``Sec. 1121.
