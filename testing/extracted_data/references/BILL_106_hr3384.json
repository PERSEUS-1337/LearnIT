FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) although there are significant uncertainties \n        surrounding the science of climate change, human activities may \n        contribute to increasing global concentrations of greenhouse \n        gases in the atmosphere, which in turn may ultimately \n        contribute to global climate change beyond that resulting from \n        natural variability;\n            (2) the characteristics of greenhouse gases and the \n        physical nature of the climate system require that any \n        stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations must \n        be a long-term effort undertaken on a global basis;\n            (3) since developing countries will constitute the major \n        source of greenhouse gas emissions early in the 21st century, \n        all nations must share in an effective international response \n        to potential climate change;\n            (4) environmental progress and economic prosperity are \n        interrelated;\n            (5) effective greenhouse gas management efforts depend on \n        the development of long-term, cost-effective technologies and \n        practices that can be developed, refined, and deployed \n        commercially in an orderly manner in the United States and \n        around the world;\n            (6) in its present form as signed by the Administration, \n        the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention \n        on Climate Change fails to meet the minimum conditions of \n        Senate Resolution 98, 105th Congress, which was adopted by the \n        Senate on July 25, 1997, by a vote of 95-0;\n            (7) the President has not submitted the Kyoto protocol to \n        the Senate for debate and advice and consent to ratification \n        under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the United States \n        Constitution and has indicated that the Administration has no \n        intention to do so in the foreseeable future, or to implement \n        any portion of the Kyoto protocol prior to its ratification in \n        the Senate.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to strengthen provisions \nof the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13381 et seq.) to--\n            (1) further promote voluntary efforts to reduce or avoid \n        greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency; and\n            (2) focus Department of Energy efforts in this area.\n\nSEC. 3. OFFICE OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n    Section 1603 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13383) is \namended--\n            (1) in the section heading, by striking ``DIRECTOR OF \n        CLIMATE PROTECTION'' and inserting ``OFFICE OF GLOBAL CLIMATE \n        CHANGE''; and\n            (2) by striking the first sentence and inserting the \n        following:\n    ``(a) Establishment.--There is established by this Act in the \nDepartment of Energy an Office of Global Climate Change.\n    ``(b) Function.--The Office shall serve as a focal point for \ncoordinating for the Secretary and Congress all departmental issues and \npolicies regarding climate change and related matters.\n    ``(c) Director.--The Secretary shall appoint a director of the \nOffice, who--\n            ``(1) shall be compensated at no less than level IV of the \n        Executive Schedule;\n            ``(2) shall report to the Secretary; and\n            ``(3) at the request of the Committees of the Senate and \n        House of Representatives with appropriation and legislative \n        jurisdiction over programs and activities of the Department of \n        Energy, shall report to Congress on the activities of the \n        Office.'';\n            (3) in the second sentence, by striking ``The Director'' \n        and inserting the following:\n    ``(d) Duties.--The Director''; and\n            (4) in subsection (c) (as designated by paragraph (2)), by \n        striking paragraphs (2) and (3) and inserting the following:\n            ``(2) participate, in cooperation with other federal \n        agencies, in the development and monitoring of domestic and \n        international policies for their effects on any kind of climate \n        change globally and domestically and on the generation, \n        reduction, avoidance, and sequestration of greenhouse gases;\n            ``(3) develop and implement a balanced, scientifically \n        sound, nonadvocacy educational and informative public awareness \n        program on--\n                    ``(A) potential global climate change, including \n                any known adverse and beneficial effects on the United \n                States and the economy of the United States and the \n                world economy, taking into consideration whether those \n                effects are known or expected to be temporary, long-\n                term, or permanent; and\n                    ``(B) voluntary means and measures to mitigate or \n                minimize significant adverse effects and, where \n                appropriate, to adapt, to the greatest extent \n                practicable, to climate change;\n            ``(4) provide, consistent with applicable provisions of law \n        (including section 1605 (b)(3)), public assess to all \n        information on climate change, effects of climate change, and \n        adaptation to climate change;\n            ``(5) promote and cooperate in the research, development, \n        demonstration, and diffusion of environmentally sound, cost-\n        effective and commercially practicable technologies, practices \n        and processes that avoid, sequester, control, or reduce \n        anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by \n        the Montreal Protocol for all relevant economic sectors, \n        including, where appropriate, the transfer of environmentally \n        sound, cost-effective and commercially practicable \n        technologies, practices, and processes developed with Federal \n        funds by the Department of Energy or any of its facilities and \n        laboratories to interested persons in the United States and to \n        developing country Parties to the United Nations Framework \n        Convention on Climate Change, and Parties thereto with \n        economies in transition to market-based economies, consistent \n        with, and subject to, any applicable Federal law, including \n        patent and intellectual property laws, and any applicable \n        contracts, and taking into consideration the provisions and \n        purposes of section 1608; and\n            ``(6) have the authority to participate in the planning \n        activities of relevant Department of Energy programs.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

The \n                inventory shall identify for calendar year 2001 and \n                thereafter the amount of emissions reductions \n                attributed to those reported under subsection (b).'';\n            (2) by amending subsection (b)(1)(B) and (C) to read as \n        follows--\n            ``(B) annual reductions or avoidance of greenhouse gas \n        emissions and sequestration and carbon fixation achieved \n        through any measures, including agricultural activities, \n        cogeneration, appliance efficiency, energy efficiency, forestry \n        activities that increase carbon sequestration stocks (including \n        the use of forest products), fuel switching, management of \n        grasslands and drylands, manufacture or use of vehicles with \n        reduced greenhouse gas emissions, methane recovery, ocean \n        seeding, use of renewable energy, chlorofluorocarbon capture \n        and replacement, and power plant heat rate improvement; and\n            ``(C) reductions in, or avoidance of, greenhouse gas \n        emissions achieved as a result of voluntary activities \n        domestically, or internationally, plant or facility closings, \n        and State or Federal requirements.'';\n            (3) by striking in the first sentence of subsection (b)(2) \n        the word ``entities'' and inserting ``persons or entities'' and \n        in the second sentence of such subsection, by inserting after \n        ``Persons'' the words ``or entities'';\n            (4) by inserting in the second sentence of subsection \n        (b)(4) the words ``persons or'' before ``entity''; and\n            (5) by adding after subsection (b)(4) the following new \n        paragraphs--\n    ``(5) Recognition of voluntary reductions or avoided emissions of \ngreenhouse gases.--In order to encourage and facilitate new and \nincreased voluntary efforts on a continuing basis, particularly by \npersons and entities in the private sector, to reduce global emissions \nof greenhouse gases, including voluntary efforts to limit, control, \nsequester, and avoid such emissions, the Secretary shall promptly \ndevelop and establish, after an opportunity for public comment of at \nleast 60 days, a program of giving annual public recognition, beginning \nnot later than January 31, 2001, to all reporting persons and entities \ndemonstrating, pursuant to the voluntary collections and reporting \nguidelines issued under this section, voluntarily achieved greenhouse \ngases reductions, including such information reported prior to the \nenactment of this paragraph. Such recognition shall be based on the \ninformation certified, subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001, by such persons or \nentities for accuracy as provided in paragraph 2 of this subsection. At \na minimum such recognition shall annually be published in the Federal \nRegister.\n    ``(6) Changes in guidelines to improve accuracy and reliability.--\nThe Secretary of Energy, through the Administrator of the Energy \nInformation Administration, shall conduct a review, which shall include \nan opportunity for public comment, of what, if any, changes should be \nmade to the guidelines established under this section regarding the \naccuracy and reliability of greenhouse gas reductions and related \ninformation reported under this section. Any such review shall give \nconsiderable weight to the voluntary nature of this section and to the \npurpose of encouraging voluntary greenhouse gas emission reductions by \nthe private sector. Changes to be reviewed shall include the need for, \nand the appropriateness of--\n            ``(A) a random or other verification process using the \n        authorities available to the Administrator under other \n        provisions of law;\n            ``(B) a range of reference cases for reporting of project-\n        based activities in sectors, including, but not limited to, the \n        measures specified in subparagraph (1)(B) of this subsection, \n        and the inclusion of benchmark and default methodologies for \n        use in the reference cases for `greenfield' projects; and\n            ``(C) provisions to address the possibility of reporting, \n        inadvertently or otherwise, of some or all of the same \n        greenhouse gas emissions reductions by more than one reporting \n        entity or person and to make corrections where necessary.\n    The review should consider the costs and benefits of any such \nchanges, the impacts on encouraging participation in this section, \nincluding by farmers and small businesses, and the need to avoid \ncreating undue economic advantages or disadvantages for persons or \nentities of the private sector. The review should provide, where \nappropriate, a range of reasonable options that are consistent with the \nvoluntary nature of this section and that will help further the \npurposes of this section. The review should be available in draft form \nfor public comment at least 45 days before it is submitted to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the \nCommittee on Commerce of the House of Representatives. Such submittal \nshould be made by December 31, 2000. If the Secretary, in consultation \nwith the Administrator, finds, based on the study results, that such \nchanges are likely to be beneficial and cost effective in improving the \naccuracy and reliability of reported greenhouse gas reductions and \nrelated information, are consistent with the voluntary nature of this \nsection, and furthers the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall \npropose and promulgate, consistent with such finding, such guidelines, \ntogether with such findings.
