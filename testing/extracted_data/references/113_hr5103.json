    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Chinese Communist Economic Espionage \nSanctions Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has made it its \n        policy to engage in economic warfare against the United States.\n            (2) The CCP uses the resources of the People's Liberation \n        Army (PLA) and the Chinese State to drain the United States of \n        economic might, including by means of economic espionage and \n        cyber espionage, unfair trade practices, unfair labor \n        practices, and currency manipulation.\n            (3) Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOE) and the PLA are \n        the main beneficiary of the CCP's campaign of theft against the \n        United States.\n            (4) Although many SOEs are listed on stock exchanges or \n        officially privatized, the Chinese government retains at least \n        one-half of equity in those companies.\n            (5) SOEs come under the control of the ministerial-level \n        State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.\n            (6) Members of the boards of directors and senior \n        management of SOEs are appointed by the State-owned Assets \n        Supervision and Administration Commission in consultation with \n        the Communist Party's Department of Organization.\n            (7) More than two-thirds of board members and three-\n        quarters of senior executives of SOEs are either Communist \n        Party members or officials.\n            (8) Corruption within the CCP is widespread and endemic.\n            (9) CCP officials use their positions of control and \n        influence within and over SOE's to enrich themselves and their \n        families.\n            (10) The vast majority of the Chinese people do not benefit \n        from the corruption of the CCP.\n            (11) On May 19, 2014, the United States Department of \n        Justice announced charges against five members of the PLA, \n        accusing them of stealing trade secrets from United States \n        companies and marking the first time the United States has \n        charged foreign government employees with economic espionage.\n            (12) The indictment charged that members of the PLA worked \n        to ``steal information'' from United States companies ``that \n        would be useful to their competitors in China, including state-\n        owned enterprises''.\n            (13) Chinese SOEs are reported to have benefitted directly \n        from their actions, including the State Nuclear Power \n        Technology Corporation, the Baosteel Group, and the Aluminum \n        Corporation of China (Chinalco).\n            (14) The chairman of the board and the majority of the \n        boards for the State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation, the \n        Baosteel Group, and the Aluminum Corporation of China \n        (Chinalco) are members of the CCP.\n            (15) On May 21, 2014, Assistant Attorney General John \n        Carlin said that criminal charges can justify economic \n        sanctions.\n            (16) The indictment named members of Unit 61398 which is \n        publicly identified as a Shanghai-based cyber unit of the PLA \n        also known as APT1.\n            (17) Unit 61398 is part of the 2nd Bureau of the PLA, 3rd \n        Department of the General Staff.\n            (18) Unit 61398 was first publically identified in 2013 as \n        APT1 by Mandiant, a United States cyber security firm and \n        leader in cyber incident response industry.\n            (19) Mandiant exposed a timeline of Unit 61398's economic \n        espionage conducted since 2006 against 141 victims across \n        multiple industries.\n            (20) Mandiant's conclusions have been supported by \n        CrowdStrike, another cyber security company, which publicly \n        revealed the existence of Unit 61486, a related PLA unit \n        dedicated to cyber espionage.\n            (21) George Kurts, the co-founder of CrowdStrike, stated \n        that ``If you look at all the groups that we track in China, \n        the indictments are just the very tip of the iceberg.''.\n            (22) Units 61398 and 61486 are only two of at least 20 \n        cyber threat groups in Communist China and are considered by \n        multiple experts to have stolen vast amounts of valuable \n        information from the United States.\n            (23) The 2011 annual report to Congress from the Office of \n        the Secretary of Defense, titled ``Military and Security \n        Developments Involving the People's Republic of China'', \n        states, ``The PRC also utilizes a large, well-organized network \n        of enterprises, defense factories, affiliated research \n        institutes, and computer network operations to facilitate the \n        collection of sensitive information and export-controlled \n        technology, as well as basic research and science that supports \n        U.S. defense system modernization.''.\n            (24) A 2011 report by the Office of the National \n        Counterintelligence Executive found that ``Chinese actors are \n        the world's most active and persistent perpetrators of economic \n        espionage.''.\n            (25) The 2012 annual report to Congress from the Office of \n        the Secretary of Defense, titled ``Military and Security \n        Developments Involving the People's Republic of China'', found \n        that ``Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and \n        economic information will continue at a high level and will \n        represent a growing and persistent threat to U.S. economic \n        security.''.\n            (26) James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, \n        stated, ``Among significant foreign threats . . . China \n        remain[s] the most capable and persistent intelligence threats \n        and are aggressive practitioners of economic espionage against \n        the United States.''.\n            (27) Retired General Michael Hayden, former Director of the \n        Central Intelligence Agency and Director of the National \n        Security Agency, stated, ``The intensity of Chinese espionage \n        is certainly greater than that what we saw between the U.S. and \n        the Soviets during the Cold War. The problem is China's view is \n        that industrial espionage by the state against relatively \n        vulnerable private enterprise is a commonly accepted state \n        practice,''.\n            (28) The annual report by the congressional United States-\n        China Economic and Security Review Commission stated in 2013, \n        ``strong evidence emerged that the Chinese government is \n        directing and executing a large-scale cyber espionage campaign \n        against the United States''.\n            (29) Retired Lieutenant General Ronald Burgess, Jr., former \n        Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, stated, ``China \n        has used its intelligence services to gather information via a \n        significant network of agents and contacts using a variety of \n        methods . . . In recent years, multiple cases of economic \n        espionage and theft of dual-use and military technology have \n        uncovered pervasive Chinese collection efforts,''.\n            (30) Congressman Mike Rogers, Chairman of the Permanent \n        Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n        Representatives, stated, ``China's economic espionage has \n        reached an intolerable level and I believe that the United \n        States and our allies in Europe and Asia have an obligation to \n        confront Beijing and demand that they put a stop to this \n        piracy. Beijing is waging a massive trade war on us all, and we \n        should band together to pressure them to stop. Combined, the \n        United States and our allies in Europe and Asia have \n        significant diplomatic and economic leverage over China, and we \n        should use this to our advantage to put an end to this \n        scourge,''.\n            (31) The threat of Chinese espionage is so large that \n        Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, who chaired the \n        Cyber Task Force of the Select Committee on Intelligence, \n        proclaimed it to be part of ``the biggest transfer of wealth \n        through theft and piracy in the history of mankind''.\n            (32) Massive cyber and economic espionage organized, \n        directed, and carried out by the CCP and the PLA has \n        contributed to creating a $318,000,000,000 United States trade \n        deficit with Communist China in 2013, which equals 1.89 percent \n        of total United States gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the Chinese Communist Party and \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China should be condemned \nfor sponsoring, planning, ordering, conducting, and benefitting from \ncyber and economic espionage against the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
