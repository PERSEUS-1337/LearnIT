FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the 8th \n        Amendment to require governmental entities to provide medical \n        care to persons involuntarily confined in jails, detention \n        centers, and prisons.\n            (2) The Federal Government does not provide health benefits \n        under Medicare, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), \n        or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to inmates \n        even if the person is awaiting trial in jail and has not been \n        convicted. However, beneficiaries who are released after \n        posting bond, or who are released under their own recognizance, \n        or who are released under house arrest may continue to receive \n        Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, and CHIP benefits.\n            (3) The cost of providing health care in prisons and jails \n        has increased exponentially due in part to high incarceration \n        rates, infectious diseases, chronic conditions, substance abuse \n        treatment, mental illness, aging prison populations, rising \n        prescription drug costs, and mandatory sentencing laws.\n            (4) Providing health care for inmates constitutes a major \n        portion of local jail operating costs. Requiring county \n        governments to cover health care costs for inmates who have not \n        been convicted places an unnecessary burden on local \n        governments who have been negatively impacted by recession, \n        widespread budget deficits, and cuts to safety net programs and \n        services.\n            (5) Jails generally have a higher instance of mentally ill \n        inmates because jails frequently serve as holding places for \n        low-income persons who are waiting placement in a mental \n        facility and for mentally ill persons who commit nuisance \n        crimes because of inadequate access to treatment in their \n        communities.\n            (6) The rising cost of bail has also contributed to an \n        overall increase in the jail population and health care costs \n        for inmates. The high cost of bail has contributed to the \n        disproportionate rate of incarceration among African-Americans \n        and Latinos.\n            (7) Terminating benefits to people in county jails who are \n        awaiting trial violates the presumption of innocence, because \n        it does not distinguish between persons awaiting disposition of \n        charges and those who have been duly convicted and sentenced.\n            (8) Otherwise eligible individuals who have been charged \n        with a crime and incarcerated, but not convicted, should \n        continue to be eligible for Federal health benefits, such as \n        Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, or CHIP, until such time as they may \n        be convicted and sentenced to an institution. SSI payments \n        should be held until the inmate has been acquitted and \n        released, or until the inmate has completed his or her sentence \n        and been released.\n\nSEC. 3. REMOVAL OF INMATE LIMITATION ON BENEFITS UNDER MEDICAID, \n              MEDICARE, SSI, AND CHIP.\n\n    (a) Medicaid.--The subdivision (A) of section 1905(a) of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)) that follows paragraph (29) is \namended by inserting ``or in custody pending disposition of charges'' \nafter ``patient in a medical institution''.\n    (b) Medicare.--Section 1862(a)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395y(a)(3)) is amended by inserting ``in the case of services \nfurnished to individuals who are in custody pending disposition of \ncharges,'' after ``1880(e)''.\n    (c) SSI.--Section 1611(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1382(e)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubparagraph:\n    ``(K)(i) As used in subparagraph (A), the term `inmate of a public \ninstitution' does not include an individual who is in custody pending \ndisposition of charges.\n    ``(ii) In the case of an individual who is an eligible individual \nor eligible spouse for purposes of this title only because of the \napplication of the definition in clause (i), any supplemental security \nincome benefits otherwise payable shall be withheld until such time as \nthe individual is no longer either in custody pending disposition of \ncharges or an inmate of a public institution or shall be paid to the \nindividual's estate if the individual dies before the pending charges \nare disposed of or while the individual is an inmate of a public \ninstitution.''.\n    (d) CHIP.--Section 2110(b)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1397jj(b)(2)(A)) is amended by inserting ``(except as an \nindividual in custody pending disposition of charges)'' after ``inmate \nof a public institution''.\n    (e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take \neffect on the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning more \nthan 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and shall \napply to items and services furnished, and supplemental security income \nbenefits paid, for periods beginning on or after such date."
