FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The claims of a significant number of African-American \n        farmers who brought discrimination cases against the Department \n        of Agriculture in the case Pigford v. Glickman were denied \n        without such farmers receiving a hearing on the merits of those \n        claims.\n            (2) Section 14012 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act \n        of 2008 (Public Law 110-246; 122 Stat. 2210) states that it is \n        Congress' express intent that such section ``be liberally \n        construed so as to effectuate its remedial purpose of giving a \n        full determination on the merits for each Pigford claim \n        previously denied that determination,'' and explicitly \n        authorizes expedited resolutions to Pigford claims.\n            (3) Such section authorizes the expenditure of $100,000,000 \n        from the Commodity Credit Corporation for the purpose of \n        addressing such claims.\n            (4) The $100,000,000 expenditure was not intended to serve \n        as a cap, but was intended to serve as a place-holder allowing \n        Congress to increase funding as necessary so that each Pigford \n        claim may be determined on the merits.\n            (5) The number of African-American farmers who have had \n        discrimination claims against the Department of Agriculture \n        unfairly denied may total more than 77,000 persons.\n            (6) Funding in addition to the $100,000,000 made available \n        in such section 14012 will be needed to achieve Congress' \n        intent to carry out the remedial purpose of having each Pigford \n        claim determined on the merits.\n\nSEC. 2. FUNDING FOR PIGFORD CLAIMS.\n\n    Section 14012 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 \n(122 Stat. 2209; Public Law 110-246) is amended--\n            (1) by striking subsection (c) and inserting the following:\n    ``(c) Criminal Penalties.--\n            ``(1) In general.--It shall be unlawful for any person to--\n                    ``(A) knowingly execute, or attempt to execute, a \n                scheme or artifice to defraud, or obtain money or \n                property from any person by means of false or \n                fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, \n                relating to the eligibility or ability of a person to--\n                            ``(i) file a civil action relating to a \n                        Pigford claim;\n                            ``(ii) submit a late-filing request under \n                        section 5(g) of the consent decree;\n                            ``(iii) obtain a determination on the \n                        merits of a Pigford claim; or\n                            ``(iv) recover damages or other relief \n                        relating to a Pigford claim; and\n                    ``(B) for the purpose of executing the scheme or \n                artifice or attempting so to do, or obtaining the money \n                or property--\n                            ``(i) place or deposit, or cause to be \n                        placed or deposited, any matter or thing to be \n                        sent or delivered by the Postal Service or any \n                        private or commercial interstate carrier;\n                            ``(ii) take or receive any matter or thing \n                        sent or delivered by the Postal Service or any \n                        private or commercial interstate carrier;\n                            ``(iii) knowingly cause to be delivered by \n                        the Postal Service or any private or commercial \n                        interstate carrier any matter or thing \n                        according to the direction on the matter or \n                        thing, or at the place at which the matter or \n                        thing is directed to be delivered by the person \n                        to whom it is addressed; or\n                            ``(iv) transmit, or cause to be \n                        transmitted, any writings, signs, signals, \n                        pictures, or sounds by means of wire, radio, or \n                        television communication in interstate or \n                        foreign commerce.\n            ``(2) Penalty.--Any person who violates paragraph (1) shall \n        be fined under title 18, United States Code, imprisoned for not \n        more than 5 years, or both.''; and\n            (2) in subsection (i), by striking paragraph (2) and \n        inserting the following:\n            ``(2) Permanent judgment appropriation.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--After the expenditure of all \n                funds made available under paragraph (1), any \n                additional payments or debt relief in satisfaction of \n                claims against the United States under subsection (b) \n                and for any actions under subsection (f) or (g) shall \n                be paid from amounts appropriated under section 1304 of \n                title 31, United States Code.\n                    ``(B) Authorization of certain expenses.--\n                Reasonable attorney's fees, administrative costs, and \n                expenses described in section 14(a) of the consent \n                decree and related to adjudicating the merits of claims \n                brought under subsection (b), (f), or (g) shall be paid \n                from amounts appropriated under section 1304 of title \n                31, United States Code.\n            ``(3) Authorization of appropriations.--In addition to any \n        other funds made available under this subsection, there are \n        authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to \n        carry out this section.''."
