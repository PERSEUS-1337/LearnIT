    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``National Renewable \nEnergy Lands Act of 2002''.\n    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``renewable energy'' means electric energy \n        generated by solar, wind, or geothermal power.\n            (2) The term ``candidate sites'' means sites identified \n        under section 4 as candidates for the siting of renewable \n        energy production facilities.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The expedited development and deployment of energy \n        efficiency and renewable energy technologies and resources in \n        the United States will both increase our energy independence \n        and contribute to ensuring our energy security.\n            (2) Renewable energy facilities produce cleaner energy and \n        have much less impact on the environment than conventional \n        energy facilities and fuels in terms of air pollution, acid \n        rain, and greenhouse gases.\n            (3) The United States has abundant solar, wind, and \n        geothermal resources on Federal lands providing, a tremendous \n        potential for the development and deployment of renewable \n        energy power.\n            (4) The use of solar, wind, and geothermal technologies and \n        resources can be enhanced through the use of integrated \n        hydroelectric storage systems.\n            (5) The development and deployment of renewable energy \n        technologies and resources on Federal lands can be done in an \n        expedited fashion consistent with the requirements of the \n        Federal Land Management Policy Act of 1976 and the National \n        Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n\nSEC. 3. EVALUATION OF FEDERAL HYDROELECTRIC FACILITY CANDIDATE SITES.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \nReclamation and the Bureau of Land Management, and in consultation with \nthe Federal Power Marketing Administrations and other appropriate \nFederal agencies, shall evaluate all Federal hydroelectric facilities \non Federal lands and, within 1 year after the enactment of this Act, \nidentify facilities that are candidates for interconnection with \npotential renewable energy generation facilities. Evaluation criteria \nto identify candidate facilities shall include--\n            (1) proximity of the hydroelectric facilities to Federal \n        lands suitable for renewable energy projects;\n            (2) existing transmission capacity infrastructure in \n        proximity to the hydroelectric facilities;\n            (3) the need for, and value of, enhanced peaking power \n        production capability in conjunction with the hydroelectric \n        facilities;\n            (4) the value of increased Department of the Interior \n        ability to address varied multiple-use concerns, such as water \n        resource management, recreational and wildlife uses, deriving \n        from the additional margins of generation potentially provided \n        by collocated renewable energy production facilities; and\n            (5) other criteria to be determined.\n\nSEC. 4. EVALUATION OF FEDERAL RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION CANDIDATE \n              SITES.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \nReclamation and the Bureau of Land Management, and in consultation with \nthe Federal Power Marketing Administrations and other appropriate \nFederal agencies, shall, within 1 year after the enactment of this Act, \nevaluate and identify potential renewable energy production sites on \nFederal lands. Evaluation criteria to identify candidate sites shall \ninclude each of the following:\n            (1) Proximity to (A) hydroelectric facilities that are \n        identified under section 3 as candidates for interconnection \n        with potential renewable energy generation facilities, or (B) \n        support infrastructure, including roadways, transmission lines, \n        and other facilities.\n            (2) Topography appropriate for solar, wind, or geothermal \n        generation systems.\n            (3) The absence of cultural or historic resources.\n            (4) The impact of facilities on wildlife including the \n        likelihood of interference with federally listed threatened or \n        endangered species and their habitats.\n            (5) The absence of any other potential impediments to the \n        development of electric energy generation and transmission \n        facilities.\nUpon completion of the evaluation, the Secretary shall publish a list \nof the sites that the Secretary finds to be qualified for the location \nof renewable energy facilities. Such list shall be made available for \npublic comment for a period of at least 90 days.\n\nSEC. 5. ENGINEERING FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of \nReclamation and the Bureau of Land Management, and in consultation with \nother appropriate Federal agencies, shall complete an engineering \nfeasibility analysis for sites that are identified under section 4 as \ncandidate sites setting forth each of the following:\n            (1) The capability and cost estimates of additional hydro-\n        related transmission equipment additions (if any) based on pro \n        forma power production increases in 1-percent increments up to \n        a total of 10 percent of the subject hydrofacilities current \n        production capacity.\n            (2) An analysis of the potential financial benefits of \n        coordinated operation of the potential renewable energy \n        facilities located at the candidate sites with hydroelectric \n        facilities on Federal lands.\n            (3) An analysis of the potential environmental benefits to \n        affected aquatic ecosystems arising from improved flexibility \n        in hydrofacility water management attributable to collocated \n        renewable energy systems.\n\nSEC. 6. LEASING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Upon the completion of the engineering feasibility \nanalysis under section 5 of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior, \nacting through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, shall \nexpeditiously make the most promising of the candidate sites identified \nunder section 4 available for long-term lease pursuant to a competitive \nbidding process to qualified renewable energy development firms. In \nidentifying the candidate areas to be made available for leasing under \nthis section, the Secretary shall locate such areas and determine the \nsize of such areas in such manner as will (1) minimize the need for \nadditional rights of way for transmission and for transportation, and \n(2) provide such lands to enable the lessee to expand the size of any \ninitial facility to be constructed on the lease lands.\n    (b) Advertising.--The Director of the Bureau of Land Management \nshall publicly advertise the terms and conditions of potential long-\nterm lease agreements for the candidate sites.\n    (c) Request for Proposals.--The Director of the Bureau of Land \nManagement shall prepare a request for proposals to develop the \ncandidate sites identified under section 4.\n    (d) Issuance of Leases.--The leases issued under this section shall \nbe for a period of not less than 30 years.\n    (e) Commencement of Construction and Operation.--As a condition of \nany lease under this section, the Director of the Bureau of Land \nManagement shall require lessees to commence construction of a \nrenewable energy production facility within 24 months of the signing of \nthe lease and be fully capable of producing electric energy for sale \nwithin 36 months of the signing of the lease for the public lands site.\n\nSEC. 7. GAO REPORT.\n\n    The Comptroller General of the United States shall undertake an \ninvestigation of, and prepare and submit to the Congress a report on, \nthe existing impediments to the construction of renewable energy \nprojects on Federal lands and the measures, including legislative \nmeasures, necessary to expedite the development of such projects.\n\nSEC. 8. CONTRACT EXPIRATION.\n\n    Upon expiration and renegotiation of any contract for the sale of \nelectric energy generated by a Federal hydroelectric facility on \nFederal land, the interconnection of potential renewable energy sources \nto such facility shall be evaluated and implemented in accordance with \nthe evaluation criteria as defined in section 3 of this Act."
