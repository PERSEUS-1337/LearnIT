FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Issues of teacher diversity and cultural competence are \n        critical factors influencing the achievement gap among \n        elementary school and secondary school students and must be \n        addressed by national education policy, as recommended in the \n        report entitled ``Assessment of Diversity in America's Teaching \n        Force'', presented by the National Collaborative on Diversity \n        in the Teaching Force in 2004.\n            (2) Some experts believe the lack of diversity among public \n        schoolteachers inhibits positive learning outcomes generally, \n        and can leave students in underrepresented groups without role \n        models to whom the students can relate, which may lead to \n        poorer performance in the classroom. Statistics show that for \n        students in some underrepresented groups, a lack of diversity \n        among public school teachers contributes to lower standardized \n        test scores and lower graduation rates.\n            (3) Department of Education statistics reveal a lack of \n        diversity among public schoolteachers. During the school year \n        of 2007 through 2008, an estimated 83.1 percent of public \n        schoolteachers were Caucasian, while 7.1 percent were Latino, 7 \n        percent were African-American, and 1.2 percent were Asian. Of \n        all public schoolteachers, 24.1 percent were male and 75.9 \n        percent were female.\n            (4) Teacher demographics should be sufficiently diverse to \n        provide the educational benefits described in paragraphs (1) \n        and (2), including ensuring that students have role models--\n                    (A) from diverse backgrounds and racial and ethnic \n                groups; and\n                    (B) of different genders.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to further a compelling interest in obtaining the \n        educational benefits that result, particularly for schools with \n        a concentration of individuals in 1 or more categories \n        described in section 1111(b)(2)(C)(v)(II) of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        6311(b)(2)(C)(v)(II)), from a diverse group of elementary \n        school and secondary school teachers, including--\n                    (A) promoting learning outcomes generally, and \n                reducing achievement gaps for diverse student bodies; \n                and\n                    (B) increasing student cultural competence by \n                better preparing students for an increasingly diverse \n                workforce and society;\n            (2) to provide narrowly tailored activities by funding the \n        activities for the period needed to attain meaningful numbers \n        or a critical mass of teachers who are individuals from \n        underrepresented groups, sufficient to provide the educational \n        benefits described in paragraph (1), and offering the \n        activities for other teachers as well; and\n            (3) to remedy the historically low employment, among \n        teachers in public elementary schools and secondary schools, of \n        individuals from underrepresented groups.\n\nSEC. 3. RECRUITMENT, TRAINING, AND RETENTION OF TEACHERS, INCLUDING \n              TEACHERS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new part:\n\n ``PART E--RECRUITMENT, TRAINING, AND RETENTION OF TEACHERS, INCLUDING \n                 TEACHERS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS\n\n``SEC. 2501.
