FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) While most forms of pollution are steadily being \n        reduced in the United States, solid waste discards are \n        projected to increase by 10 percent between 2000 and 2010, \n        based on Environmental Protection Agency data.\n            (2) American consumers and businesses spend an estimated $1 \n        billion annually to dispose of cardboard boxes and low quality \n        shipping pallets.\n            (3) The cost of disposing of municipal solid waste has been \n        increasing at a 7 percent annual rate.\n            (4) There are regional shortages of solid waste disposal \n        capacity, and siting new facilities is contentious for local \n        governments. These conditions will be exacerbated by the growth \n        of solid waste discards.\n            (5) There are already spirited interstate disputes, \n        expressed in litigation and legislation, regarding efforts to \n        regulate interstate shipment of solid waste.\n            (6) Dozens of other nations are pursuing regulatory \n        approaches and surtaxes to reduce the amount of solid waste \n        from packaging.\n            (7) The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 establishes a \n        hierarchy for handling waste, with source reduction and reuse \n        being preferable to recycling.\n            (8) It is in the national environmental and economic \n        interest to reaffirm and emphasize the Pollution Prevention Act \n        of 1990's priority on source reduction and reuse, without \n        resorting to new Federal regulatory requirements or new Federal \n        taxes.\n            (9) Emerging industry has the means to dramatically reduce \n        the amount of packaging waste, thereby conserving solid waste \n        disposal capacity, improving the environment, and reducing \n        unnecessary costs to consumers, local governments, and business \n        alike.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide tax incentives to encourage \nthe utilization of reusable wooden and plastic pallets and plastic \ncontainers in order to fulfill the goals of the Pollution Prevention \nAct of 1990, improve national environmental quality through reduced \nsolid waste, increase economic productivity by reducing the costs \nassociated with waste disposal, reduce inflationary pressures \nassociated with the escalating cost of waste disposal, reduce friction \namong the States concerning interstate solid waste transportation, and \nprovide a cost-efficient nonregulatory model for addressing \nenvironmental problems.\n\nSEC. 4.
