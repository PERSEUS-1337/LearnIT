FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The metals industry in the United States is a \n        $100,000,000,000 plus industry and employs millions of \n        Americans.\n            (2) Because of their unique features, most metals can be \n        recycled over and over again which conserves the world's \n        natural resources and contributes to a healthy environment.\n            (3) Metal is an essential component of millions of \n        industrial, business, and consumer products. The presence of \n        radioactive contamination in steel scrap and other metals \n        resulting from the production, utilization, and fabrication of \n        nuclear fuel by the Department of Energy and other facilities \n        poses a risk to public safety, threatens the metals recycling \n        stream, and can cause millions of dollars worth of damage to \n        facilities that unknowingly process contaminated metals.\n            (4) The metals industry in the United States desires to \n        keep radioactive contamination resulting from the production, \n        utilization, and fabrication of nuclear fuel by the Department \n        of Energy and other facilities out of its facilities and \n        products.\n            (5) Currently there are no approved standards for the \n        unrestricted release of metals containing radioactive \n        contamination in the United States. The American public has \n        rejected all previous attempts by the Nuclear Regulatory \n        Commission to set a standard for such releases. It is expected \n        that American consumers will reject products that contain \n        unknown amounts of radioactive contamination from the \n        Department of Energy and nuclear fuel production, utilization, \n        and fabrication facilities. All such releases are now done only \n        with the specific approval of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n        or its agreement States.\n            (6) However, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission currently is \n        deliberating whether there is a need for a rulemaking to set a \n        specified level of radioactive material in scrap and other \n        metal that will be allowed in metals for unrestricted use.\n            (7) At present, there is a lack of accountability and a \n        lack of standards regarding radioactive content in metals \n        imported into the United States. The Nuclear Regulatory \n        Commission has no authority to regulate these metals at the \n        time of their importation.\n\nSEC. 3. DUTIES OF FEDERAL AGENCIES.\n\n    (a) Nuclear Regulatory Commission.--\n            (1) Standard.--\n                    (A) Establishment.--Not later than 24 months after \n                the date of enactment of this Act, the Nuclear \n                Regulatory Commission shall establish, through a \n                rulemaking under chapter 5 of title 5, United States \n                Code (relating to administrative procedures), a \n                standard that controls the free release of \n                radioactively contaminated scrap metal from the \n                Department of Energy or nuclear fuel cycle facilities \n                in order to protect the health and safety of the \n                American consumer.\n                    (B) Limitation.-- Until such standard is \n                established, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \n                agreement States shall not take any action to \n                facilitate, implement, promulgate, or issue a rule or \n                guidance or take any other administrative action that \n                would allow the free release into commerce of \n                radioactively contaminated scrap metal.\n            (2) Release of radioactively contaminated equipment, \n        devices, commodities, and other materials.--Effective upon the \n        date of enactment of this Act, all radioactively contaminated \n        equipment, devices, commodities, and other materials approved \n        for general release to persons exempt from licensing by the \n        Nuclear Regulatory Commission or any of its agreement States \n        will be released only under the provisions of the Atomic Energy \n        Act of 1954 and its implementing regulations governing the \n        release of byproduct and source material (as defined in section \n        11 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 2014)). The Nuclear Regulatory \n        Commission is prohibited from establishing separate and \n        differing release regulations and standards for equipment, \n        devices, commodities, and other materials which are \n        contaminated during the nuclear fuel production, utilization, \n        and fabrication process from those regulations and standards \n        established for equipment, devices, commodities, and other \n        materials into which byproduct and source material have been \n        deliberately inserted for their beneficial use.\n    (b) Departments of Defense and Energy; Environmental Protection \nAgency; Other Agencies.--The Departments of Defense and Energy, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and all other agencies that have \noversight or control over the release of radioactively contaminated \nmetals shall adopt standards that are no less stringent than the \nstandards established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under \nsubsection (a). Until such standards are established, the Secretary of \nEnergy, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and the heads of all other agencies \nthat have oversight or control over the release of radioactively \ncontaminated metals shall not take any action to facilitate, promote, \nor allow the release into commerce of radioactively contaminated scrap \nmetal.\n    (c) United States Customs Service.--The United States Customs \nService shall, within 12 months after establishment of the standard \nunder subsection (a), monitor and enforce these standards at the \nborders of the United States.\n    (d) Secretary of State.--After the standard is established under \nsubsection (a), the Secretary of State shall work with international \nstandard-writing bodies to adopt standards consistent with the standard \nestablished under subsection (a).\n    (e) Interim Certifications.--Before the standard established under \nsubsection (a) takes effect, all scrap metal imported into the United \nStates must be accompanied by documentation--\n            (1) stating the amount of radioactive contamination as \n        certified by the government of the exporting country; and\n            (2) validating that the metal does not contain any \n        byproduct, source, or any special nuclear material.\nSuch information shall be readily available as part of the \ndocumentation and must accompany the shipment of these products. This \nrequirement will go into effect 90 days after the date of enactment of \nthis Act and the Secretary of Commerce is directed to promulgate a \nfinal rule implementing this requirement by that date.\n\nSEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTY FOR FALSE DOCUMENTATION.\n\n    Any person who knowingly falsifies any documentation required under \nsection 3(e) or required under any standard in effect under section 3 \nshall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $250,000 for each \nviolation.\n\nSEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    The Secretary of Commerce shall not later than one year after the \ndate of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter submit a report \nto the Congress which--\n            (1) lists the number of violations of the standards in \n        effect under section 3 and the volume of tons of radioactively \n        contaminated metals involved in each violation reported on; and\n            (2) for each violation, lists the number of tons of \n        radioactively contaminated metals involved in each violation \n        reported on, the country of origin of such metals, and the type \n        of metal involved.\n\nSEC. 6.
