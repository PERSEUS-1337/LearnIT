Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:\nThis act ensures that members of the public have the opportunity to be informed of, and meaningfully participate in, the negotiation and approval of contracts for goods and services by a city, county, city and county, or special district that has adopted a civic openness in negotiations (COIN) ordinance, thereby furthering the purposes of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.\nSEC. 3.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district under this act would result from a legislative mandate that is within the scope of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution."
