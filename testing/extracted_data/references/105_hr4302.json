FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1)(A) birds constitute one of the most widely recognized \n        and appreciated components of North American wildlife;\n            (B) approximately 25,000,000 Americans travel to observe \n        birds; and\n            (C) more than 60,000,000 adult Americans watch and feed \n        birds at home;\n            (2) birds--\n                    (A) are key indicators of environmental health;\n                    (B) play important roles in plant pollination and \n                seed dispersal;\n                    (C) serve as critical links in the food web; and\n                    (D) maintain the health of the environment;\n            (3)(A) healthy bird populations provide important economic \n        benefits, such as control of noxious insects on agricultural \n        crops, thereby preventing hundreds of millions of dollars in \n        economic losses each year to farming and timber interests; and\n            (B) more than $20,000,000,000 is spent in the United States \n        each year on watching and feeding birds;\n            (4)(A) despite their irreplaceable value, many North \n        American bird species, once considered common, are in decline;\n            (B) 90 North American bird species are listed as endangered \n        or threatened in the United States;\n            (C) another 124 North American bird species are of high \n        conservation concern; and\n            (D) Mexico's Secretariat of Environment, Natural Resources \n        and Fisheries lists approximately 390 bird species as being \n        endangered, threatened, vulnerable, or rare;\n            (5)(A) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the \n        United States, approximately 500 migrate among nations;\n            (B) the large majority of those species, the neotropical \n        migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean; and\n            (C) neotropical migrants in particular have received much \n        attention because of their population declines;\n            (6)(A) the primary reason for the declines is habitat loss \n        and degradation (including pollution and contamination);\n            (B) because neotropical migrants range across numerous \n        international borders each year, their conservation requires \n        that safeguards be established at both ends of the migration \n        routes, as well as at critical stopover areas along the way; \n        and\n            (C) establishing such safeguards necessitates the joint \n        commitment and effort of all nations that support those \n        species, as well as all levels of society; and\n            (7) this Act constitutes an effort on the part of the \n        United States to adopt appropriate measures for the protection \n        of migratory birds in collaboration with--\n                    (A) neighboring nations that are parties to the \n                Convention Respecting Nature Protection and Wildlife \n                Preservation in the Western Hemisphere, done at the Pan \n                American Union, Washington, October 12, 1940 (56 Stat. \n                1354); and\n                    (B) States, conservation organizations, \n                corporations and business interests, and other private \n                entities.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to assist in the conservation of neotropical migratory \n        birds by supporting neotropical migratory bird conservation \n        programs in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the United States \n        with a focus on reversing habitat loss and degradation;\n            (2) to promote partnerships between Federal, State, and \n        nongovernmental entities in the United States in the \n        conservation of neotropical migratory birds;\n            (3) to foster active governmental and nongovernmental \n        participation in neotropical migratory bird conservation by \n        cooperating countries throughout Latin America and the \n        Caribbean;\n            (4) to promote circumstances under which the conservation \n        of neotropical migratory birds in Latin America and the \n        Caribbean may be carried out by local entities;\n            (5) to provide financial resources for projects that \n        support neotropical migratory bird conservation;\n            (6) to promote the effective conservation of neotropical \n        migratory birds in the Western Hemisphere through collaboration \n        at all levels of society; and\n            (7) to link, bolster, and augment successful existing \n        neotropical migratory bird conservation efforts, rather than \n        creating new and separate initiatives.\n\nSEC. 4.
