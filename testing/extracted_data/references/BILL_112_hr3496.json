FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fish and wildlife are fundamental parts of America's \n        history and character, and fish and wildlife conservation is a \n        core value shared by all Americans. All future generations \n        deserve the opportunity to benefit from and enjoy a diverse \n        array of fish and wildlife species.\n            (2) Fish and wildlife conservation provides economic, \n        social, educational, recreational, emotional, and spiritual \n        benefits. The economic value of hunting, fishing, and wildlife-\n        associated recreation alone is estimated to contribute \n        $122,000,000,000 annually to the American economy. Fish and \n        wildlife habitats, including forests, grasslands, riparian \n        lands, wetlands, rivers, and other bodies of water are an \n        essential component of the American landscape, and are \n        protected and valued by Federal, State, and local governments, \n        tribes, private landowners, conservation organizations, and \n        millions of American sportsmen and outdoor recreationists.\n            (3) States possess broad trustee and police powers over \n        fish and wildlife within their borders.\n            (4) The States and the Federal Government both have \n        management responsibilities affecting fish and wildlife, and \n        should work cooperatively in fulfilling these responsibilities.\n            (5) The American landscape is rapidly changing, \n        particularly in the Western United States where the majority of \n        the Federal public lands are found, increasing the importance \n        of sustaining fish and wildlife and their habitats on our \n        public lands.\n            (6) Federal public lands are critical to the future of \n        fish, plant, and wildlife species in America. Federal public \n        lands help to protect endangered and threatened species from \n        going extinct and help prevent species from becoming endangered \n        in the first place. These lands complement the conservation of \n        fish, plants, and wildlife on private lands by providing \n        comparatively intact tracts of land that serve as refuges from \n        human development and other pressures. Federal public lands \n        also help keep common species common, including species valued \n        for hunting and fishing.\n            (7) Federal public lands provide habitats for species \n        impacted by the effects of global climate change and will play \n        an important role in the ability of fish, plants, and wildlife \n        to adapt to and survive global warming's mounting impacts.\n            (8) Consistent with long-standing principles of multiple \n        use and sustained yield management, the goal of sustaining the \n        diverse fish, wildlife, and plant communities that depend on \n        our Federal public lands should guide the stewardship of \n        America's public lands.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Desired non-native species.--The term ``desired non-\n        native species'' means those wild species of plants or animals \n        that are not indigenous to a planning area but are valued for \n        their contribution to species diversity or their social, \n        cultural, or economic value.\n            (2) Focal species.--The term ``focal species'' means \n        species selected for monitoring because their population status \n        and trends are believed to provide useful information regarding \n        the effects of management activities, natural disruptions, or \n        other factors on unmeasured species and to provide insights to \n        the integrity of the ecological systems to which they belong.\n            (3) Native species.--The term ``native species'' means \n        species of plants and animals indigenous to a planning area.\n            (4) Planning area.--The term ``planning area'' means any \n        geographic unit of National Forest System lands or Bureau of \n        Land Management lands covered by an individual management plan.\n            (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means--\n                    (A) the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to \n                land under such Secretary's jurisdiction; and\n                    (B) the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to \n                land under such Secretary's jurisdiction.\n            (6) Species-of-concern.--The term ``species-of-concern'' \n        means the following:\n                    (A) A species listed as an endangered species or \n                threatened species, or proposed or identified as \n                candidates for such listing, under the Endangered \n                Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n                    (B) A species designated with a Global, State, or \n                Taxon status ranking of G1, G2, G3, S1, S2, T1, T2, or \n                T3 by a State Natural Heritage Program.\n                    (C) A species of greatest conservation need \n                identified by State comprehensive wildlife conservation \n                strategies.\n                    (D) Other species identified by the Forest Service \n                or the Bureau of Land Management for which scientific \n                evidence raises a concern regarding the species' \n                sustainability in a planning area.\n            (7) Sustainable population.--The term ``sustainable \n        population'' means a population of a species that has a high \n        likelihood of persisting well distributed throughout its range \n        within a planning area for a period of at least 50 years into \n        the future, based on the best available scientific information, \n        including information obtained through the monitoring program \n        under section 5, regarding its abundance, distribution, habitat \n        quality, and reproduction and survival rates.\n\nSEC. 4. SUSTAINABLE POPULATIONS.\n\n    (a) Management Direction.--Each Secretary shall plan for and manage \nplanning areas under the Secretary's respective jurisdiction in order \nto maintain sustainable populations of native species and desired non-\nnative species within each planning area, except that management for \ndesired non-native species shall not interfere with the maintenance of \nsustainable populations of native species within a planning area.\n    (b) Management Coordination.--If a population of a species extends \nacross more than one planning area, each Secretary shall coordinate the \nmanagement of lands in the planning areas containing such population in \norder to maintain a sustainable population of such species.\n    (c) Extrinsic Conditions.--If a Secretary, using the best available \nscience and after providing notice to the public by publication in the \nFederal Register and opportunity for public comment for a period of at \nleast 60 days, determines that conditions beyond such Secretary's \nauthority make it impossible for the Secretary to maintain a \nsustainable population of a native species or desired non-native \nspecies within a planning area, or, under the circumstances identified \nin paragraph (2), within two or more planning areas, such Secretary \nshall--\n            (1) manage lands within the planning area or areas in order \n        to achieve to the maximum extent possible the survival and \n        health of that population; and\n            (2) ensure that any activity authorized, funded, or carried \n        out within the planning area does not increase the likelihood \n        of extirpation of the population in such planning area or \n        areas.\n    (d) Compliance.--Each Secretary shall ensure that land management \nplans for a planning area under the Secretary's respective \njurisdiction, actions implementing or authorized under such plans, and \nother activities that may affect the maintenance of sustainable \npopulations conducted under the Secretary's jurisdiction comply with \nthis section.\n\nSEC. 5. MONITORING AND EVALUATION.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Monitoring Programs.--To provide a basis for \ndetermining the sustainability of native species and desired non-native \nspecies populations for purposes of section 4, each Secretary shall \nadopt and implement, as part of the land management planning for a \nplanning area, a strategically targeted monitoring program to determine \nthe status and trends of such species populations in such planning \narea.\n    (b) Monitoring Program Requirements.--The monitoring programs \nestablished under subsection (a) shall designate focal species \nrepresenting the diversity of ecological systems and species present in \nthe planning area, identify species-of-concern in the planning area, \nand provide for--\n            (1) the monitoring of the status and trends of the habitats \n        and ecological conditions that support focal species and \n        species-of-concern;\n            (2) population surveys of the focal species identified in \n        the monitoring program using methods sufficient to ensure that \n        monitoring of habitats and ecological conditions pursuant to \n        paragraph (1) is providing accurate information regarding the \n        status and trends of species' populations in the planning area; \n        and\n            (3) population surveys of species-of-concern whose \n        populations are not adequately assessed by monitoring pursuant \n        to paragraphs (1) and (2) and for which there is reasonable \n        concern regarding potential reductions in distribution or \n        abundance within such planning area in order to evaluate \n        information regarding population status and trends.\n    (c) Cooperation With State Entities and Other Agencies.--Each \nSecretary shall develop and implement, to the maximum extent \npracticable, the monitoring program established under this section, \nincluding the selection of native species and desired non-native \nspecies, habitat, and ecological conditions to be monitored and \nmethodologies for conducting such monitoring, in cooperation with State \nfish and wildlife agencies and in coordination with other State \nagencies with responsibility for management of natural resources. Each \nSecretary shall consider and utilize relevant population data \nmaintained by other Federal agencies, State agencies, tribes, or other \nrelevant entities.\n\nSEC. 6.
