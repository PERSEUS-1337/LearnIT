FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) High fuel costs retard economic growth and diminish the \n        quality of life for all Americans.\n            (2) The trucking industry is particularly hard hit by high \n        fuel prices.\n            (3) Attempts to address the issue of high gasoline costs by \n        increasing government involvement in the market through \n        measures such as price controls will only lead to shortages, \n        rationing, and a return of gasoline lines.\n            (4) The Federal regulations restricting drilling impose \n        prohibitive costs on the development of new sources of energy, \n        artificially inflating the price of gas.\n            (5) Federal gas taxes increase the price of oil thus \n        burdening American families, business, and truckers.\n            (6) Allowing private parties to delay, or even halt, the \n        construction of new refineries through litigation over the \n        National Environmental Protection Act's Environmental Impact \n        Statement requirement reduces the supply of gas thus raising \n        gas prices.\n            (7) The so-called Jackson-Vanik (``freedom-of-emigration'') \n        amendment (section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974) was a United \n        States reaction to the Soviet Union's highly restrictive \n        emigration policy of the time.\n            (8) By 2005, some 15 years after the end of communist rule \n        over the Soviet Union, successor states Russia and Kazakhstan \n        allow their citizens the right and opportunity to emigrate, \n        free of any heavy tax on the visas or other documents required \n        for emigration and free of any other tax, levy, fine, fee, or \n        other charge on any citizens as a consequence of the desire of \n        such citizens to emigrate to the country of their choice.\n            (9) Elimination of the Jackson-Vanik amendment's threat of \n        trade-restricting provisions would increase the United States \n        access to oil supplies from non-Arab countries, thus lowering \n        gas prices.\n\nSEC. 3. TERMINATION OF RESTRICTIONS ON OIL AND NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT \n              ON FEDERAL LANDS.\n\n    (a) Outer Continental Shelf.--\n            (1) Termination of laws prohibiting expenditures for \n        natural gas leasing and preleasing activities.--All provisions \n        of existing Federal law prohibiting the spending of \n        appropriated funds to conduct oil or natural gas leasing and \n        preleasing activities for any area of the Outer Continental \n        Shelf shall have no force or effect.\n            (2) Revocation of existing presidential withdrawals.--All \n        existing withdrawals by the President under the authority of \n        section 12 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. \n        1341) are hereby revoked and are no longer in effect with \n        respect to the leasing of areas for exploration for, and \n        development and production of, oil or natural gas.\n    (b) Coastal Plain of Alaska.--Sections 1002(i) and 1003 of the \nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3142(i) and \n3143) are repealed.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATION OF SUITS UNDER NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OF \n              1969.\n\n    Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \nU.S.C. 4332) is amended by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before the \nfirst sentence, and by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Limitation on Suits.--A statement required under subsection \n(a)(2)(C) is not subject to judicial review.''.\n\nSEC. 5.

For purposes of the \n                preceding sentence, a waiver under the Clean Air Act \n                shall not be taken into account in determining whether \n                the applicable environmental laws have been met.\n                    ``(C) Special rule for mergers and acquisitions.--\n                Such term shall not include any asset with respect to \n                which a deduction was taken under subsection (e)(3)(B) \n                by any other taxpayer in any preceding year.''.\n            (3) Effective date.--\n                    (A) In general.--The amendments made by this \n                subsection shall apply to refineries placed in service \n                after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                    (B) Exception.--The amendments made by this section \n                shall not apply to any refinery with respect to which \n                the taxpayer has entered into a binding contract for \n                the construction thereof on or before the date of the \n                enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. SUSPENSION OF FUEL TAXES ON HIGHWAY MOTOR FUELS WHEN WEEKLY \n              UNITED STATES RETAIL GASOLINE PRICES EXCEED BENCHMARK.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n(relating to imposition of tax on motor and aviation fuels) is amended \nby adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(f) Suspension of Highway Motor Fuel Taxes When Retail Gasoline \nExceeds Benchmark.--\n            ``(1) In general.--During any suspension period, the tax \n        imposed by this section and section 4041 on highway motor fuel \n        shall be suspended.\n            ``(2) Definitions and special rule.--For purposes of this \n        subsection--\n                    ``(A) Suspension period.--The term `suspension \n                period' means the period--\n                            ``(i) beginning on the date on which the \n                        weekly United States retail gasoline price, \n                        regular grade (as published by the Energy \n                        Information Administration, Department of \n                        Energy), inclusive of such tax, is greater than \n                        $3.00 per gallon, and\n                            ``(ii) ending on the date on which such \n                        price (as so published), without regard to this \n                        subsection, does not exceed $3.00 per gallon.\n                    ``(B) Highway motor fuel.--The term `highway motor \n                fuel' means any fuel subject to tax under this section \n                or section 4041 other than aviation gasoline and \n                aviation-grade kerosene.''.\n    (b) Maintenance of Trust Funds Deposits; Amounts Appropriated to \nTrust Funds Treated as Taxes.--\n            (1) In general.--There is hereby appropriated (out of any \n        money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated) to each trust \n        fund which would (but for this subsection) receive reduced \n        revenues as a result of a suspension in a rate of tax by reason \n        of section 4081(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as \n        added by this section) an amount equal to such reduction in \n        revenues.
