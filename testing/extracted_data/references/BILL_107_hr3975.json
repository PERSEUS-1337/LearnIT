FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Surgeon General of the United States, \n        the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune \n        deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) will soon become the worst \n        epidemic of infectious disease in recorded history, eclipsing \n        the bubonic plague of the 1300's and the influenza epidemic of \n        1918-1919, the latter killing more than 20,000,000 people \n        worldwide.\n            (2) The gap between rich and poor countries in terms of \n        transmission of HIV from mother to child has been increasing, \n        threatening to reverse years of steady progress of child \n        survival in developing countries to the point that UNAIDS \n        believes that by the year 2010 AIDS may have increased \n        mortality of children under 5 years of age by more than 100 \n        percent in regions most affected by the virus.\n            (3) At current infection and growth rates for HIV/AIDS, the \n        National Intelligence Council estimates that the number of AIDS \n        orphans worldwide will increase dramatically, potentially \n        increasing threefold or more in the next 10 years, contributing \n        to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political \n        destabilization in already volatile societies as children \n        without care or hope are drawn into prostitution, crime, \n        substance abuse, or child soldiery.\n            (4) A January 2000 United States National Intelligence \n        Estimate (NIE) report on the global infectious disease threat \n        concluded that the economic costs of infectious diseases--\n        especially HIV/AIDS--are already significant and could reduce \n        gross domestic product by 20 percent or more by 2010 in some \n        sub-Saharan African nations.\n            (5) Despite the discouraging statistics on the spread of \n        HIV/AIDS, some developing nations, such as Uganda, Senegal, and \n        Thailand, have implemented prevention programs that have \n        substantially curbed the rate of HIV infection.\n            (6) Accordingly, because infectious diseases do not respect \n        international boundaries, United States financial support for \n        medical research, education, and disease containment as a \n        global strategy has enormous benefits for all Americans.\n            (7) Given the cost of combating AIDS and other infectious \n        diseases worldwide, a contribution to the Global Fund to Fight \n        AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria of all Special Drawing Rights \n        authorized to be allocated to the United States under a \n        proposed Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the \n        International Monetary Fund would be a significant step in \n        combating this epidemic.\n            (8) In September 1997, the international community endorsed \n        the proposed Fourth Amendment, but the amendment has not been \n        implemented because the Executive Branch has not requested \n        Congressional authorization for United States approval of the \n        Fourth Amendment.\n            (9) The proposed Fourth Amendment has been accepted by 109 \n        of the 110 members of the International Monetary Fund, \n        representing 72.18 percent of the total voting power of the \n        International Monetary Fund.\n            (10) Whereas approval of the proposed Fourth Amendment by \n        the United States, which holds 17.16 percent of the voting \n        power at the International Monetary Fund, would enable the \n        Special Drawing Rights to be allocated to the United States.\n            (11) The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n        Malaria is a method for leveraging resources from donor nations \n        to meet the extraordinary need for resources by creating a much \n        stronger multilateral ``burden-sharing'' approach to combating \n        the HIV/AIDS crisis.\n\nSEC. 2. ACCEPTANCE OF FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT OF \n              THE FUND; CONTRIBUTION OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS TO THE \n              GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA.\n\n    The Bretton Woods Agreements Act (22 U.S.C. 286-286nn) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 64. ACCEPTANCE OF FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT \n              OF THE FUND; CONTRIBUTION OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS TO \n              THE GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA.\n\n    ``(a) Acceptance of Fourth Amendment to the Articles of \nAgreement.--The United States Governor of the Fund shall, on behalf of \nthe United States, accept the amendments to the Articles of Agreement \nof the Fund approved in resolution numbered 52-4 of the Board of \nGovernors of the Fund.\n    ``(b) Contribution of Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund To \nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.--\n            ``(1) Instruction to seek agreement to allow the global \n        fund to hold special drawing rights.--The Secretary of the \n        Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director at \n        the Fund to seek an agreement to include the Bank, in its \n        capacity as administrator of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n        Tuberculosis and Malaria, as a prescribed holder of Special \n        Drawing Rights.\n            ``(2) Contributions.--On achieving the agreement described \n        in paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide \n        for the contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n        Tuberculosis and Malaria, in each of fiscal years 2004 through \n        2006, of \\1/3\\ of the Special Drawing Rights received by the \n        United States pursuant to the amendments referred to in \n        subsection (a).\n    ``(c) Negotiations To Urge Other Fund Members To Make Similar \nContributions to the Global Fund.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \nseek to enter into negotiations for the purpose of inducing the member \ncountries of the Fund to contribute to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria the Special Drawing Rights allocated pursuant \nto the amendments referred to in subsection (a).''."
