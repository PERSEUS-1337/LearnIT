FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Delaware River Basin is a national treasure of \n        great cultural, environmental, and ecological importance.\n            (2) The Delaware River Basin contains over 12,500 square \n        miles of land in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and \n        Pennsylvania, nearly 800 square miles of bay, and more than \n        2,000 tributary rivers and streams.\n            (3) The Basin is home to more than 8,000,000 people who \n        depend on the Delaware River and Bay as an economic engine, a \n        place of recreation, and a vital habitat for fish and wildlife.\n            (4) The Basin provides clean drinking water to more than \n        15,000,000 people. New York City relies on the Delaware River \n        Basin for half of its drinking water supply. A study conducted \n        by the City of Philadelphia Water Department determined that \n        the most significant threat to its drinking water supply is \n        forest clearing in the Upper Basin.\n            (5) Almost 180 species of fish and wildlife are considered \n        special status species in the Basin due to habitat loss and \n        degradation. Sturgeon, eastern oyster, and red knots have been \n        identified as unique species in need of habitat improvement.\n            (6) The Basin provides habitat for over 200 fish species, \n        both residents and migrants, and includes significant \n        recreational fisheries. The Basin is also a prolific source of \n        eastern oyster, blue crab, and the largest population of the \n        American horseshoe crab.\n            (7) Current oyster landings in the Delaware Bay are at \n        100,000 bushels, down from 500,000 harvested in the 1980s due, \n        in part, to polluted water and disease.\n            (8) The Delaware Bay has the second largest concentration \n        of shorebirds in North America and is designated as one of the \n        four most important shorebird migration sites in the world.\n            (9) The Basin has 1,000,000 acres of wetlands, more than \n        126,000 acres of which are recognized as internationally \n        important. Fifty percent of the Basin is covered by forest. \n        This landscape provides essential ecosystem services, including \n        recreation, commercial, and water quality benefits.\n            (10) Much of the remaining exemplary natural landscape is \n        vulnerable to further degradation. The Basin gains \n        approximately 14 square miles of developed land annually. With \n        new development, urban watersheds are increasingly covered by \n        impervious surfaces, amplifying the amount of polluted runoff \n        into rivers and streams.\n            (11) The Delaware River is the longest undammed river east \n        of the Mississippi, and a critical component of the National \n        Wild and Scenic River System in the Northeast.\n            (12) Management of water volume in the Basin is critical to \n        flood mitigation and habitat for fish and wildlife. Following \n        three major floods along the River since 2004, the governors of \n        Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, have called \n        for natural flood control measures to combat the problem, \n        including restoring the function of riparian corridors.\n            (13) The Delaware River Port Complex (including docking \n        facilities in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) is the \n        largest freshwater port in the world. The Port of Philadelphia \n        handles the largest volume of international tonnage and 70 \n        percent of the oil shipped to the east coast. The Port of \n        Wilmington, a full-service deepwater port and marine terminal, \n        is the busiest terminal on the Delaware River handling over 400 \n        vessels per year with an annual import/export cargo tonnage of \n        over 4,000,000 tons.\n            (14) The Delaware Estuary, where fresh water from the \n        Delaware River mixes with salt water from the Atlantic Ocean, \n        is one of the largest and most complex of the 28 estuaries in \n        the National Estuary Program, and the Partnership for the \n        Delaware Estuary works to improve the environmental health of \n        the Delaware Estuary.\n            (15) The Delaware River Basin Commission is a Federal-\n        interstate compact government agency charged with overseeing a \n        unified approach to managing the river system and implements \n        important water resources management projects and activities \n        throughout the Basin that are in the national interest.\n            (16) Restoration in the Basin is presently supported \n        through several State and Federal agency programs. Funding for \n        these important programs should continue and complement the \n        establishment of the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program. \n        The Program and associated funding for the Basin is intended to \n        build upon and help coordinate restoration and protection \n        funding mechanisms at the Federal, regional, State, and local \n        level.\n\nSEC. 3.
