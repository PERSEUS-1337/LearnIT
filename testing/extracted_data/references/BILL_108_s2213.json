FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The well-being of children is a paramount concern for \n        our Nation and for every State, and most programs for children \n        and families are managed at the State or local level.\n            (2) Child well-being varies over time and across social, \n        economic, and geographic groups, and can be affected by changes \n        in the circumstances of families, by the economy, by the social \n        and cultural environment, and by public policies and programs \n        at both the Federal and State level.\n            (3) States, including small States, need information about \n        child well-being that is specific to their State and that is \n        up-to-date, cost-effective, and consistent across States and \n        over time.\n            (4) Regular collection of child well-being information at \n        the State level is essential so that Federal and State \n        officials can track child well-being over time.\n            (5) Information on child well-being is necessary for all \n        States, particularly small States that do not have State-level \n        data in other federally supported data bases, such as the \n        Survey of Income and Program Participation.\n            (6) Telephone surveys of parents, on the other hand, \n        represent a relatively cost-effective strategy for obtaining \n        information on child well-being at the State level for all \n        States, including small States.\n            (7) Data from telephone surveys of the population are used \n        to monitor progress toward many important national goals, \n        including immunization of preschool children with the National \n        Immunization Survey, and the identification of health care \n        issues of children with special needs with the National Survey \n        of Children with Special Health Care Needs.\n            (8) A State-level telephone survey can provide information \n        on a range of topics, including children's social and emotional \n        development, education, health, safety, family income, family \n        employment, and child care. Information addressing marriage and \n        family structure can also be obtained for families with \n        children. Information obtained from such a survey would not be \n        available solely for children or families participating in \n        programs but would be representative of the entire State \n        population and consequently, would not only inform welfare \n        policymaking, but policymaking on a range of other important \n        issues, such as child care, child welfare, and education.\n\nSEC. 3. RESEARCH ON INDICATORS OF CHILD WELL-BEING.\n\n    Section 413 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 613) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n    ``(k) Indicators of Child Well-Being.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary, through grants, \n        contracts, or interagency agreements shall develop \n        comprehensive indicators to assess child well-being in each \n        State.\n            ``(2) Requirements.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The indicators developed under \n                paragraph (1) shall include measures related to the \n                following:\n                            ``(i) Education.\n                            ``(ii) Social and emotional development.\n                            ``(iii) Health and safety.\n                            ``(iv) Family well-being, such as family \n                        structure, income, employment, child care \n                        arrangements, and family relationships.\n                    ``(B) Other requirements.--The data collected with \n                respect to the indicators developed under paragraph (1) \n                shall be--\n                            ``(i) statistically representative at the \n                        State level;\n                            ``(ii) consistent across States;\n                            ``(iii) collected on an annual basis for at \n                        least the 5 years preceding the year of \n                        collection;\n                            ``(iv) expressed in terms of rates or \n                        percentages;\n                            ``(v) statistically representative at the \n                        national level;\n                            ``(vi) measured with reliability;\n                            ``(vii) current;
