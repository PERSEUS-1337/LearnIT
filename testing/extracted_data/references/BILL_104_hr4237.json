PROCEDURES GOVERNING THE TERMINATION OR SUBSTANTIAL \n              REDUCTION OF RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS.\n\n    ``(a) Termination or Substantial Reduction of Retiree Health \nBenefits.--A plan or plan sponsor may terminate or substantially reduce \nretiree health benefits under an employee welfare benefit plan, or plan \nor plan sponsor payments in connection with such benefits only in \naccordance with the provisions of this section.\n    ``(b) Proposal Requirement.--\n            ``(1) Prior to terminating or substantially reducing \n        retiree health benefits or plan or plan sponsor payments in \n        connection with such benefits, a plan sponsor shall--\n                    ``(A) petition a court of competent jurisdiction \n                for the appointment of an authorized representative for \n                the retirees whose benefits may be terminated or \n                substantially reduced;\n                    ``(B) make a proposal to the authorized \n                representative of the retirees covered by the plan, \n                based on the most complete and reliable information \n                available at the time of such proposal, which assures \n                that all of the affected parties are treated fairly and \n                equitably; and\n                    ``(C) provide, subject to subsection (c)(2), the \n                representative of the retirees with such relevant \n                information as is necessary to evaluate the proposal.\n            ``(2) During the period beginning on the date of the making \n        of a proposal provided for in paragraph (1) and ending on the \n        date of the hearing provided for in subsection (c)(1), the plan \n        sponsor shall meet, at reasonable times, with the authorized \n        representative to confer in good faith in attempting to reach \n        mutually satisfactory modifications of such plan.\n            ``(3) For purposes of this section the term `authorized \n        representative' means the authorized representative designated \n        pursuant to subparagraph (A) for persons receiving any retiree \n        benefits covered by a collective bargaining agreement or \n        subparagraph (B) in the case of persons receiving retiree \n        benefits not covered by such agreement.\n                    ``(A) A labor organization shall be the authorized \n                representative of those persons receiving any retiree \n                benefits covered by any collective bargaining agreement \n                to which that labor organization is signatory, unless \n                (i) such labor organization elects not to serve as the \n                authorized representative of such person, or (ii) the \n                court, upon a motion by any participant or beneficiary, \n                after notice and hearing, determines that different \n                representation of such persons is appropriate. In cases \n                where the labor organization elects not to serve as the \n                authorized representative of those persons receiving \n                any retiree benefits covered by any collective \n                bargaining agreement to which that labor organization \n                is signatory, or in cases where the court finds \n                different representation of such persons appropriate, \n                the court, upon a motion by any participant or \n                beneficiary, and after notice and a hearing, shall \n                appoint an authorized representative of retired \n                employees if the plan or plan sponsor seeks to \n                terminate or substantially reduce the retiree benefits \n                or if the court otherwise determines that such \n                appointment is appropriate, from among such persons.\n                    ``(B) The court, upon a motion by any participant \n                or beneficiary, and after notice and a hearing, shall \n                appoint an authorized representative of retired \n                employees if the plan or plan sponsor seeks to \n                terminate or substantially reduce the retiree benefits \nor if the court otherwise determines that it is appropriate, to appoint \nan authorized representative of those persons receiving any retiree \nbenefits not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\n            ``(4) The court may order a plan sponsor to pay reasonable \n        expenses to the authorized representative.\n    ``(c) Hearings.--\n            ``(1) If an action is brought by any participant or \n        beneficiary to enjoin or otherwise modify such termination or \n        substantial reduction, the court without requirement of any \n        additional showing shall order the plan and plan sponsor to \n        maintain the retiree health benefits and payments at the level \n        in effect immediately before the termination or substantial \n        reduction while the action is pending in any court. No security \n        or other undertaking shall be required of any participant or \n        beneficiary as a condition for issuance of such relief. In \n        addition, the court shall schedule a hearing to be held not \n        later than fourteen days after the date of the filing of such \n        action. All interested parties may appear and be heard at such \n        hearing. Adequate notice shall be provided to such parties at \n        least ten days before the date of such hearings. The court may \n        extend the time for the commencement of such hearing for a \n        period not exceeding seven days where the circumstances of the \n        case, and the interests of justice require such extension, or \n        for additional periods of time to which the plan sponsor and \n        representative agree.\n            ``(2) The court may enter such protective orders, \n        consistent with the need of the authorized representative of \n        the retiree to evaluate the proposal of the plan sponsor to \n        substantially reduce or terminate retiree health benefits or \n        plan or plan sponsor payments in connection with such benefits.\n            ``(3) If retiree health benefits under an employee welfare \n        benefit plan or plan or plan sponsor payments in connection \n        with such benefits are to be or have been terminated or \n        substantially reduced, and an action is brought by any \n        participant or beneficiary to enjoin or otherwise modify such \n        termination or substantial reduction, the court shall take into \n        account extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the plan.\n            ``(4) If the terms of an employee welfare benefit plan, \n        summary plan description, or other materials distributed to \n        employees at any time before a participant's retirement or \n        disability, are silent or are ambiguous, either on their face \n        or after consideration of extrinsic evidence, as to whether \n        retiree health benefits and payments may be terminated or \n        substantially reduced for a participant and his or her \n        beneficiaries after the participant's retirement or disability, \n        then the benefits and payments shall not be terminated or \n        substantially reduced for the participant and his or her \n        beneficiaries unless the plan or plan sponsor establishes by a \n        preponderance of the evidence that the summary plan description \n        or other materials about retiree benefits--\n                    ``(A) were distributed to the participant at least \n                90 days in advance of retirement or disability;\n                    ``(B) did not promise retiree health benefits for \n                the lifetime of the participant and his or her spouse; \n                and\n                    ``(C) clearly and specifically disclosed that the \n                plan allowed such termination or substantial reduction \n                as to the participant after the time of his or her \n                retirement or disability.\nThe disclosure described in subparagraph (C) must have been made \nprominently and in language which can be understood by the average plan \nparticipant.\n            ``(5) The court shall approve a substantial reduction or \n        termination of retiree health benefits or plan or plan sponsor \n        payments in connection with such benefits only if the court \n        finds that--\n                    ``(A) the collective bargaining agreement \n                explicitly provides for a substantial reduction or \n                termination of such benefits; or\n                    ``(B)(i) the plan sponsor has, prior to the \n                hearing, made a proposal that fulfills the requirements \n                of subsection (b)(1);\n                    ``(ii) the authorized representative of the \n                employees has refused to accept such proposal without \n                good cause; and\n                    ``(iii) the balance of the equities clearly favors \n                substantially reducing or terminating retiree health \n                benefits or plan or plan sponsor payments in connection \n                with such benefits.\n    ``(d) Retiree Health Benefits.--For the purposes of this section, \nthe term `retiree health benefits' means health benefits (including \ncoverage) which are provided to--\n            ``(1) retired or disabled employees who, immediately before \n        the termination or substantial reduction, have a reasonable \n        expectation to receive such benefits upon retirement or \n        becoming disabled; and\n            ``(2) their spouses or dependents.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents in section 1 of \nsuch Act is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 515 \nthe following new item:\n\n``Sec. 516.
