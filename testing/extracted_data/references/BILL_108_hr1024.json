HIGHLY MIGRATORY SPECIES BYCATCH MORTALITY REDUCTION \n              RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment of a Program.--(1) There is established within \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service a pelagic longline highly \nmigratory species bycatch and mortality reduction research program. The \nProgram shall be developed by a design team established by the \nSecretary of Commerce. The Program design shall be submitted to the \nSecretary no later than 120 days after the first meeting of the design \nteam and shall include a statistically significant recommendation for \nthe level of observer coverage on pelagic longline fishing vessels that \nis necessary to monitor the fishery effectively and participate in the \nresearch program. The design team shall be available as a resource to \nthe Secretary throughout the research and the development of the \nrecommendations.\n    (2) The program shall identify and test a variety of pelagic \nlongline fishing gear configurations and uses and determine which of \nthose configurations and uses are the most effective in reducing highly \nmigratory species mortality. The program shall place an emphasis on \ndetermining the gear configurations and uses that are the most \neffective in reducing blue and white marlin mortality in the exclusive \neconomic zone of the United States in the Atlantic Ocean. The program \nshall also include a provision for observers to be placed on pelagic \nlongline fishing vessels for the purposes of monitoring the fishery and \nparticipating in the research program.\n    (3) The highly migratory species program shall conduct research to \ndetermine the impact of existing time and area closures designed to \nreduce the bycatch of longline vessels. The program shall focus on \nwhether existing closures should be modified to decrease bycatch by \nlongline vessels and shall determine what adjustments to the existing \nboundaries and temporal constraints should be made as a result of any \nresearch. Any vessel participating in the program shall be provided an \nobserver by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The full cost of the \nobserver and any incidental costs to the vessel as a result of being \nincluded in the research program shall be paid for by the National \nMarine Fisheries Service. The National Marine Fisheries Service may \nauthorize, without notice and comment, scientific research permits \nauthorizing a vessel to enter and fish in any closed area in the \nAtlantic Ocean so long as there is 100 percent observer coverage and \nthe activities of the vessel are in furtherance of the research \nprogram. Access to any closed area may be granted only after \nconsideration of the scientific need for access.\n    (b) Design Team.--(1) Knowledgeable members of the pelagic longline \nfishing sector, the recreational billfish and tuna sector, and the \nconservation community, along with scientists associated with each such \nentity, shall be appointed by the Secretary to the program design team. \nEach of the sectors shall to the extent practicable be fairly \nrepresented on the design team. The design team shall not exceed nine \nmembers only one of which may be an employee of the Federal Government. \nThe design team shall select a chairman and establish its own rules of \noperation. Each member of the design team who is not employed by the \nFederal Government shall be compensated in the manner provided for \nmembers of a Fishery Management Council under section 302(d) of the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n1852(d)).\n    (2) The design team shall not be considered to be an advisory \ncommittee for the purposes of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 \nU.S.C. App.), but shall hold its deliberations in meetings for which \nprior noticed is published in the Federal Register and that are open to \nthe public.\n    (c) Mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone for Highly Migratory Species.--\nSection 304(g) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act (16 U.S.C. 1854(g)) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n            ``(3) Mid-atlantic conservation zone for highly migratory \n        species.--\n                    ``(A) No person shall engage in pelagic longline \n                fishing--\n                            ``(i) in the lower mid-Atlantic \n                        Conservation Zone in the period beginning \n                        August 15 and ending October 1 each year; or\n                            ``(ii) in the upper mid-Atlantic \n                        Conservation Zone in the period beginning July \n                        15 and ending September 1 each year.\n                    ``(B) In this paragraph the term `lower mid-\n                Atlantic Conservation Zone' means the area that is \n                enclosed by a series of geodesics connecting in \n                succession the points at the following coordinates:\n                            ``(i) 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, \n                        75 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(ii) 37 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, \n                        75 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(iii) 38 degrees 0 minutes north \n                        latitude, 74 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(iv) 38 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, \n                        73 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(v) 37 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, \n                        74 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(vi) 36 degrees 30 minutes north \n                        latitude, 75 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                    ``(C) In this paragraph the term `upper mid-\n                Atlantic Conservation Zone' means the area that is \n                enclosed by a series of geodesics connecting in \n                succession the points at the following coordinates:\n                            ``(i) 38 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, \n                        74 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(ii) 40 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, \n                        72 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(iii) 39 degrees 0 minutes north \n                        latitude, 72 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(iv) 38 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, \n                        73 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                            ``(v) 38 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, \n                        74 degrees 0 minutes west longitude.\n                    ``(D) This paragraph shall not apply after the end \n                of the 4-year period beginning on the date of the \n                enactment of this paragraph.''.\n    (d) Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Commerce shall submit to \nthe Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate--\n            (1) an interim report of the findings of the research \n        conducted under this section within two years after the date of \n        enactment of this Act; and\n            (2) a final report with the necessary regulatory documents \n        to initiate implementation of any adjustments to time and area \n        closures, gear configurations, or fishing techniques warranted \n        as a result of the research.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--For research under this \nsection there is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \nCommerce $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2008."
