FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to a 1995 General Accounting Office report, \n        the unmet need for school construction and renovation in the \n        United States is $112,000,000,000. The National Center for \n        Education Statistics further found that \\3/4\\ of the Nation's \n        schools need funding to bring buildings up to good overall \n        condition.\n            (2) The Department of Education has found that the average \n        age of a public school building is 42 years, an age when \n        schools tend to deteriorate.\n            (3) According to a 1999 report from the National Education \n        Association, at least an additional 2,400 new public schools \n        will be needed by 2003 to accommodate the ``baby boom echo''.\n            (4) In 2000, the General Accounting Office reported that \n        annual school construction expenditures increased nationally by \n        39 percent from fiscal year 1990 through 1997, from \n        $17,800,000,000 to $24,700,000,000.\n            (5) Studies have found a link between school building \n        conditions and student learning. In 1996, Dr. Glenn Earthman of \n        the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University \n        compared test scores in substandard and above standard schools, \n        and found a positive correlation between school conditions and \n        test scores.\n            (6) Rural schools face different and difficult school \n        modernization needs and often have limited financial resources \n        to meet their needs. In 1996, the General Accounting Office \n        reported that 30 percent of small town and rural schools have \n        at least 1 inadequate building and 52 percent have at least 1 \n        building feature, such as a roof, plumbing, heating or air \n        conditioning, needing repair or replacement.\n            (7) Schools in smaller areas have low tax bases that make \n        it difficult to pay for bond financing costs. Also, such \n        schools' bond issues are relatively small and unfamiliar to \n        investors, making them less attractive.\n            (8) In 2000, the General Accounting Office reported that \n        areas with the highest enrollment growth rates also tend to \n        have the highest construction expenditures per pupil.\n            (9) In addition to basic infrastructure, providing students \n        and teachers access to technology will be a critical part of \n        school improvement in the 21st century, and the provision of \n        such access will require renovation.\n            (10) The Federal Government has made a commitment to \n        support the education of students with disabilities and \n        providing such education can require renovation and increased \n        construction costs.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide grants for \nschool renovation, repair, and construction, with priority given to \nserving schools that--\n            (1) have been damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster; \n        or\n            (2) the State determines are high poverty or high growth \n        schools.\n\nSEC. 3.
