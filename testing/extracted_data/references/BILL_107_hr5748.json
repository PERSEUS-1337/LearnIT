FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n    \n            (1) The Constitution of the State of New York (Article XIV, \n        Section I) contains a prohibition on extraction on State-owned \n        public lands, which has served the State and its citizens well \n        and is a good model for the management of the approximately \n        650,000,000 acres of Federal public lands.\n            (2) The Federal agencies responsible for the management of \n        these Federal public lands, primarily the Forest Service of the \n        Department of Agriculture, the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service and Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the \n        Interior, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, currently permit \n        massive corporate extraction on the vast majority of these \n        public lands without accounting for the other assets of these \n        lands.\n            (3) With little or no accounting, let alone honest and \n        fully-costed accounting, vast areas of these Federal public \n        lands, and the rivers and streams and other resources on these \n        lands, are being taken, liquidated, or despoiled by private \n        industry at great, but unaccounted for, public expense.\n            (4) The economic benefits of this coporate extraction are \n        out-weighed by the costs and risks to the public, including \n        risks to human health, welfare, and survivability.\n            (5) National Forest System lands, a component of the \n        Federal public lands, serve as the source of 80 percent of \n        America's fresh drinking water.\n            (6) These forests and other Federal public lands produce \n        much of America's topsoil, replenish oxygen and water, moderate \n        weather, climate, and flooding.\n            (7) Surveys indicate that at least 80 percent of the \n        American public believes that National Forest System lands are \n        protected in the same manner and to the same extent as national \n        parks and wants the Federal public lands, and the rivers and \n        streams and other resources on these lands, protected from \n        harm.\n            (8) The Federal public lands should be fully and completely \n        protected from all further development and harm and should not \n        be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, \n        public or private, and the timber, grazing browse, minerals, \n        oil and gas, and other resource on these lands should not be \n        sold, removed or destroyed.\n\nSEC. 3.
