ESTABLISHMENT OF CENTER FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The ability of the United States to credibly \n        communicate to populations throughout the world is critical for \n        achieving national objectives and is essential for improving \n        national security and foreign policy.\n            (2) Strategic communication describes a variety of \n        instruments used by governments to understand global attitudes \n        and cultures, to engage in a dialogue of ideas between peoples \n        and institutions, to advise policymakers, diplomats, and \n        military leaders on the public opinion implications of policy \n        choices, and to influence attitudes and behavior through \n        communications strategies.\n            (3) There have been dramatic changes in the world--changes \n        in technology, changes in religious, ethnic, and regional \n        conflicts, and changes in economic, political, and military \n        relationships. These dramatic changes necessitate that the \n        departments and agencies within the Federal Government \n        responsible for national security and homeland security work \n        more closely together so they may function more effectively.\n            (4) Since 2001, more than 15 private sector and \n        congressional reports have examined public diplomacy, with each \n        coming to the conclusion that United States efforts in public \n        diplomacy, a subset of strategic communication, are lacking in \n        leadership, strategic direction, interagency coordination, and \n        a culture of measurement and evaluation. Specifically, the \n        Defense Science Board Task Force on Strategic Communication \n        concluded that ``United States strategic communication must be \n        transformed.''.\n    (b) Center for Strategic Communication.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall solicit \n        from organizations whose primary role is research and analysis \n        related to national security and foreign policy offers to \n        establish a Center for Strategic Communication (in this Act \n        referred to as the ``Center'') within such organizations. The \n        Secretary shall select from among such offers one organization \n        to establish the Center.\n            (2) Tax exempt requirement.--To be eligible to make an \n        offer under this subsection, an organization shall be an \n        organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \n        Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) \n        of such Code.\n    (c) Duties.--The Center shall have the following duties:\n            (1) Provide information and analysis on a regular basis to \n        civilian and military decisionmakers in the Department of \n        State, the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, \n        the Department of Homeland Security, and the Director of \n        National Intelligence on issues vital to United States national \n        security and foreign policy to enhance the ability of such \n        decisionmakers to make informed decisions regarding the \n        following:\n                    (A) Global public opinion.\n                    (B) The role of culture, values, and religion in \n                shaping human behavior.\n                    (C) Media trends and influences on audiences.\n                    (D) Information technologies.\n                    (E) The implications of all source intelligence \n                assessments.\n                    (F) Such other subject matters or issues as such \n                decisionmakers request.\n            (2) Develop plans, themes, products, and programs for the \n        creation and implementation of United States communications \n        strategies that promote diplomatic opportunities, provide a \n        positive view of the United States, and respond to national \n        security threats.\n            (3) Support government-wide strategic communication through \n        services provided on a cost-recovery basis.
