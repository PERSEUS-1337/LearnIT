GAO STUDY OF SCIENTIFIC ISSUES REGARDING THE CURRENT REGULATORY \n              PATHWAY FOR REVIEWING GENERIC VERSIONS OF CERTAIN COMPLEX \n              DRUG PRODUCTS.\n\n    (a) Study by GAO.--The Comptroller General of the United States \nshall conduct a study to determine the following:\n            (1) With respect to nonbiologic complex drug products that \n        have not been fully characterized (as defined in subsection \n        (e)(1)), whether the listing of such drugs as reference \n        products in generic drug applications presents unique \n        challenges in meeting approval standards that are significantly \n        different than the challenges presented by generic drug \n        applications that list small-molecule reference products.\n            (2) With respect to biological products that are within the \n        scope of the exception under section 7002(e)(2) of Public Law \n        111-148 (relating to temporary authority for the approval of \n        biological products under section 505 of the Federal Food, \n        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355)), whether the listing of \n        such biological products as reference products in generic drug \n        applications presents unique challenges in meeting approval \n        standards that are significantly different than the challenges \n        presented by generic drug applications that list small-molecule \n        reference products.\n            (3) If the answer to the question under paragraph (1) or \n        (2) is that significantly different challenges are presented \n        for patients when reference products are nonbiologic complex \n        drug products that have not been fully characterized or when \n        reference products are biological products that are within the \n        scope of the exception under section 7002(e)(2) of Public Law \n        111-148:\n                    (A) What degree of characterization of the proposed \n                generic version and the reference product should be \n                required in order to determine the safety and \n                effectiveness of the generic version.\n                    (B) What degree of similarity should be required to \n                deem that the active ingredient of the proposed generic \n                version is the same as the active ingredient of the \n                reference product.\n                    (C) What types of evidence should be required to \n                demonstrate that the proposed generic version is \n                bioequivalent to the reference product.\n                    (D) What requirements should be established with \n                respect to the comparability of the manufacturing \n                process for the proposed generic version and the \n                manufacturing process for the reference product.\n                    (E) Whether and to what extent clinical evidence is \n                needed to demonstrate that there is no difference in \n                immunogenicity between the proposed generic version and \n                the reference product.\n                    (F) Whether and to what extent other clinical \n                evidence is needed to demonstrate that the proposed \n                generic version is as safe and effective for patients \n                as the reference product.\n                    (G) Taking into account the determinations made \n                regarding the issues listed in subparagraphs (A) \n                through (F):\n                            (i) Whether section 505(j) of the Federal \n                        Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)) \n                        should be amended to establish provisions that \n                        expressly address the approval of copy versions \n                        of nonbiologic complex drug products that have \n                        not been fully characterized, provisions that \n                        expressly address the approval of copy versions \n                        of biological products that are within the \n                        scope of the exception under section 7002(e)(2) \n                        of Public Law 111-148, or both.\n                            (ii) Whether section 505(b)(2) of such Act \n                        (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(2)) should be so amended.\n                            (iii) Whether such Act should otherwise be \n                        so amended.\n                            (iv) Whether section 351 of the Public \n                        Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) should be so \n                        amended.\n                    (H) Taking into account the determinations made \n                regarding the issues listed in subparagraphs (A) \n                through (F), and taking into consideration all relevant \n                guidances, draft guidances, and other agency policy \n                documents--\n                            (i) whether the Food and Drug \n                        Administration should develop and provide to \n                        the public a policy document that provides a \n                        comprehensive statement of general principles \n                        on the evidence that is necessary to obtain the \n                        approval of such Administration for proposed \n                        generic versions of reference products that are \n                        nonbiologic complex drug products that have not \n                        been fully characterized or that are biological \n                        products; and\n                            (ii) if so, the date by which such \n                        Administration could reasonably be expected to \n                        issue such comprehensive policy document.\n    (b) Consultation.--The Comptroller
