CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Department of the Treasury--\n                    (A) the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) \n                is designed to ``help as many as 3 to 4 million \n                financially struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure by \n                modifying loans to a level that is affordable for \n                borrowers now and sustainable over the long term''; and\n                    (B) as of February 2011, only 607,600 active \n                permanent mortgage modifications were made under HAMP.\n            (2) Many homeowners whose HAMP modifications were canceled \n        suffered because they made futile payments and some of those \n        homeowners were even forced into foreclosure.\n            (3) The Special Inspector General for TARP reported that \n        HAMP ``benefits only a small portion of distressed homeowners, \n        offers others little more than false hope, and in certain cases \n        causes more harm than good''.\n            (4) Approximately $30 billion was obligated by the \n        Department of the Treasury to HAMP, however, approximately only \n        $840 million has been disbursed.\n            (5) Terminating HAMP would save American taxpayers \n        approximately $1.4 billion, according to the Congressional \n        Budget Office.\n\nSEC. 3. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.\n\n    Section 120 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (12 \nU.S.C. 5230) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubsection:\n    ``(c) Termination of Authority To Provide New Assistance Under the \nHome Affordable Modification Program.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided under paragraph (2), \n        after the date of the enactment of this subsection the \n        Secretary may not provide any assistance under the Home \n        Affordable Modification Program under the Making Home \n        Affordable initiative of the Secretary, authorized under this \n        Act, on behalf of any homeowner.\n            ``(2) Protection of existing obligations on behalf of \n        homeowners already extended an offer to participate in the \n        program.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to \n        assistance provided on behalf of a homeowner who, before the \n        date of the enactment of this subsection, was extended an offer \n        to participate in the Home Affordable Modification Program on a \n        trial or permanent basis.\n            ``(3) Deficit reduction.--\n                    ``(A) Use of unobligated funds.--Notwithstanding \n                any other provision of this title, the amounts \n                described in subparagraph (B) shall not be available \n                after the date of the enactment of this subsection for \n                obligation or expenditure under the Home Affordable \n                Modification Program of the Secretary, but should be \n                covered into the General Fund of the Treasury and \n                should be used only for reducing the budget deficit of \n                the Federal Government.\n                    ``(B) Identification of unobligated funds.--The \n                amounts described in this subparagraph are any amounts \n                made available under title I of the Emergency Economic \n                Stabilization Act of 2008 that--\n                            ``(i) have been allocated for use, but not \n                        yet obligated as of the date of the enactment \n                        of this subsection, under the Home Affordable \n                        Modification Program of the Secretary;
