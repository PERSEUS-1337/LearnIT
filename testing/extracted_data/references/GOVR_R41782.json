    "content": "The procedures for filing information returns with the IRS were not changed by either PPACA or the Small Business Jobs Act; therefore, the repeal of the amendments to \u00a7 6041 has no effect on those procedures. The deadline for filing an information return with the IRS is February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which payments were made, or March 31 if filed electronically. Copies of information returns must be provided to payees no later than January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the payments were made.  Information returns must accurately identify both the payer and the payee of the payments as well as the total amount paid. The payees are required to provide their names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers to payers in order to facilitate information reporting. The information return must include all of these as well as the address and telephone number of the payer. It is the payer's obligation to request information from the payee, and the payee is required to provide it. The payer may use Form W-9 to request the information from U.S. persons. If the payee does not provide a taxpayer identification number, the payer is generally required to collect backup withholding from payments due to the payee. For 2010-2012, the backup withholding rate is 28%. A payee is subject to a penalty of $50 for each failure to provide the correct taxpayer identification number to a payer who has requested it. The IRS recently promulgated regulations governing the reporting of credit card and third party network transactions. These regulations are not affected by the repeal described above, and create an exception to the information reporting requirements of \u00a7 6041. For payments made after December 31, 2010, Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.6041-1(a)(1)(iv) states that any transaction that is subject to reporting under \u00a7 6050W, without regard to the third party network de minimus threshold, will not be reported under \u00a7 6041. Thus, if payments are made by credit card or through a third party network, the payer generally will not be required to report them on an information return. Both the failure to submit an accurate information return to the IRS and the failure to provide a copy of the information return to the payee are subject to monetary penalties assessed by the IRS. As a unique information return is required with respect to each payee, penalties are assessed on each deficient information return. Both \u00a7 6721 (pertaining to failure to file accurate returns with the IRS) and \u00a7 6722 (pertaining to failure to provide payees with correct copies of the information returns) of the IRC have been amended by the Small Business Jobs Act to revise the amounts of the penalties. Section 6722 has been amended to change the structure of the penalty so that it is similar to the structure of the \u00a7 6721 penalty. In so doing, the effect is that the amended penalty may be lower than it previously would have been where corrective action is taken. The changes to both sections are scheduled to become effective for returns required to be filed after December 31, 2010. Thus, the new penalty amounts are expected to apply to returns that report payments made during calendar year 2010. For information returns that are due before the amendments take effect, the penalty for failing to file a correct and timely return with the IRS is $50 for each defective return not to exceed $250,000 for a single payer. If the deficiency is corrected within 30 days of the due date, the penalty is reduced to $15 per return, not to exceed $75,000. If corrected later than 30 days, but before August 1, the penalty is $30 per return, not to exceed $150,000. No penalty will be assessed against a person if defects are corrected by August 1, and the total number of defective returns does not exceed the greater of 10 or one-half percent of the total number of information returns required to be filed by the person. Some small businesses may be able to take advantage of reduced ceilings on aggregate penalties for payers with gross receipts of less than $5 million. For these payers, the ceilings are $100,000 (for uncorrected violations), $25,000 (if corrected within 30 days), and $50,000 (if corrected after 30 days, but on or before August 1). Higher penalties may also be assessed where persons intentionally disregard their duty to file an information return. (See Table 1 .) Failure to provide a correct and timely statement to a payee is also subject to a $50 penalty per return, not to exceed $100,000 per payer. Higher penalties may also be assessed where persons intentionally disregard their duty to provide a payee with a copy of an information return. (See Table 2 .) Section 2102 of the Small Business Jobs Act modified the penalties for failing to provide information returns to the IRS or to the appropriate payee in a timely fashion. These amendments have not been repealed by the 112 th Congress. The penalties for failing to file information returns with the IRS were increased across the board, as described in Table 1 . These amounts will also be updated in 2017, and every five years after, to account for inflation. Section 2102 of the Small Business Jobs Act also modified the penalty scheme for failures to provide copies of information returns to payees. As described in Table 2 , the amended penalties mirror the amounts that would be assessed for a failure to file information returns with the IRS and are similarly indexed for inflation. In addition to raising the base penalty, the amendments also provide reduced penalties if corrective actions are taken. Because the prior penalty scheme did not take corrective action into account, penalties under the amended provision may actually be less than what would have been assessed under the old scheme if corrective action is taken. It is a misdemeanor for any person to willfully fail to make an information return as required by law. Persons convicted of this offense may be punished by a fine of up to $25,000, imprisonment for up to one year, or both. A willful violation occurs when there is \"a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.\" However, a violation that results from a good-faith misunderstanding of the requirements of the IRC is not a willful violation, as that term has been interpreted by the courts. Neither the Small Business Jobs Act nor PPACA changed the criminal penalties applicable to the willful failure to make an information return. Section 6041 was amended twice in 2010: once by \u00a7 9006 of PPACA and a second time by \u00a7 2101 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. Both amendments were subsequently repealed by the Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011. Each repealed amendment is described below. For a more detailed discussion of the repealed expansions, including responses to them by various stakeholders, see CRS Report R41504, 1099 Information Reporting Requirements and Penalties as Modified by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. For payments made after December 31, 2011, \u00a7 9006 of PPACA amended the reporting requirement in IRC \u00a7 6041 in two principal ways. First, payments to corporations would no longer be automatically exempt from reporting requirements by virtue of the payee's corporate status, superseding existing regulations to the contrary. Second, the types of payments that could trigger the reporting requirement were expanded to include amounts paid in consideration of property and other gross proceeds. Although now repealed, the effect of this amendment would have been to require those engaged in a trade or business to report a broader range of payments made to a broader range of payees in order to encourage the voluntary reporting of taxable income and also to facilitate the enforcement and collection of taxes on income that is not voluntarily reported. Section 2101 of the Small Business Jobs Act expanded the payers who would be required to comply with the section's reporting requirements to include landlords. Generally, those receiving rental income from real estate have not been considered to be engaged in a trade or business; however, the recent amendment of \u00a7 6041 would have changed this. Solely for purposes of \u00a7\u00a06041(a), most landlords would have been considered to be engaged in the trade or business of renting real estate and, therefore, might have been required to file Forms 1099 to report payments made in conjunction with their rental properties."
