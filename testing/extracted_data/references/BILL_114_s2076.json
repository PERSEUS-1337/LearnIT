FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) short-lived climate pollutants account for 40 percent \n        of global warming impacting the atmosphere, even though those \n        pollutants account for a much smaller percentage of warming \n        agents, by weight;\n            (2) reducing short-lived climate pollutant emissions \n        could--\n                    (A) prevent more than 2,000,000 premature deaths \n                each year, according to the United Nations Environment \n                Programme (UNEP);\n                    (B) prevent more than 30,000,000 tons of crop \n                losses each year, according to UNEP;\n                    (C) cut the rate of sea-level rise by 25 percent, \n                according to the National Center for Atmospheric \n                Research and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography;\n                    (D) cut the rate of warming by up to 0.6 degrees \n                Celsius by 2050, according to UNEP; and\n                    (E) significantly contribute toward the overall \n                global target of holding increased warming below 2 \n                degrees Celsius;\n            (3) the United States is--\n                    (A) 1 of the largest consumers of \n                hydrofluorocarbons in the world; and\n                    (B) providing significant innovation in the \n                development of low global warming potential (low-GWP) \n                alternatives;\n            (4) the United States could serve as a leader and exemplar \n        of responsibly phasing down hydrofluorocarbon production and \n        consumption;\n            (5)(A) the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the \n        Ozone Layer has been an extraordinarily successful model for \n        protecting the stratospheric ozone layer and achieving \n        significant climate protection cobenefits; and\n            (B) since that treaty was signed in 1987, there has been a \n        98-percent reduction in ozone-depleting substances; and\n            (6) the interagency Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions, \n        released in March 2014, outlines a proactive agenda for \n        reducing methane leakage and waste throughout the United States \n        economy.\n\nSEC. 3.
