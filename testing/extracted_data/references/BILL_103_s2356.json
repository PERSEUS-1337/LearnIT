FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) despite a consistently high presence of women in the \n        professional and total work forces of the United States, women \n        continue to be underrepresented in the science and engineering \n        work forces;\n            (2) women scientists and engineers have higher rates of \n        unemployment and underemployment than their male counterparts, \n        although the number of women receiving degrees in scientific \n        and engineering disciplines has increased since 1981;\n            (3) artificial barriers exist in the recruitment, \n        retention, and advancement of women in the science and \n        engineering work forces;\n            (4) academia, industry, and government are increasingly \n        aware of the necessity of and the advantages derived from \n        diverse science and engineering work forces;\n            (5) initiatives of the White House Task Force on Women, \n        Minorities, and the Handicapped in Science and Technology and \n        of the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, \n        and Technology have been instrumental in raising public \n        awareness of--\n                    (A) the underrepresentation of women in the science \n                and engineering work forces; and\n                    (B) the desirability of eliminating artificial \n                barriers to the recruitment, retention, and advancement \n                of women in such work forces; and\n            (6) the establishment of a commission to examine issues \n        raised by these initiatives would help to--\n                    (A) focus greater attention on the importance of \n                eliminating artificial barriers to the recruitment, \n                retention, and advancement of women in the science and \n                engineering work forces and in all employment sectors \n                of the United States;\n                    (B) promote work force diversity;\n                    (C) sensitize employers to the need to recruit and \n                retain women scientists and engineers in order to \n                overcome projected shortfalls within the science and \n                engineering work forces of the United States during the \n                next 20 years; and\n                    (D) encourage the replication of successful \n                recruitment and retention programs by universities, \n                corporations, and Federal agencies having difficulties \n                in employing women scientists and engineers.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Commission \non the Advancement of Women in the Science and Engineering Work \nForces'' (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4.
