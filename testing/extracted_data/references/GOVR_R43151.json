    "content": "This section provides an overview of the current status of FY2014 legislative branch appropriations, with subsections covering each action from the initial submission of the request on April 10, 2013, to hearings and markups held by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, through the enactment of a continuing resolution ( P.L. 113-46 ) on October 17, 2013. That continuing resolution terminated the funding gap that began October 1 and provided budget authority through January 15, 2014. Another temporary CR ( P.L. 113-73 ), enacted on January 15, provided funding until the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, on January 17 ( P.L. 113-76 ). It is followed by a section on prior year actions and funding, which contains historical figures and tables. The report then addresses the FY2014 budget requests, hearings, and funding issues for individual legislative branch agencies and entities. Finally, Table 4 through Table 8 list FY2012 and FY2013 funding levels and FY2014 budget request and report levels for these accounts, while the Appendix lists House, Senate, and conference bills and reports since FY1998. The FY2014 U.S. Budget submitted on April 10, 2013, contained a request for $4.512 billion in new budget authority for legislative branch activities.  By law, the legislative branch request is submitted to the President and included in the budget without change.   Table 2 lists the dates of hearings of the legislative branch subcommittees in 2013. Prepared statements of witnesses are available on the subcommittee websites. On July 9, 2013, the House subcommittee met to mark up the FY2014 bill. The mark would have provided $3.2 billion (not including Senate items, which are determined by the Senate). No amendments were offered, and it was reported to the full committee by voice vote.  On July 18, 2013, the full House Appropriations Committee held a markup of the FY2014 bill. Seven amendments were considered before it was ordered reported to the House: An amendment offered by Mr. Bishop related to cancelling sequestration, which failed; An amendment offered by Mr. Moran, to restore funding for Open World to the FY2013 post-sequester level, which was withdrawn; An amendment offered by Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz clarifying that the former House page dorm can only be used by the legislative branch and giving the House Appropriations Committee approval for any renovation plans (Section 1302), which was agreed to; An amendment offered by Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz transferring funding proposed for the Stennis Center to the Library, which was agreed to; An amendment offered by Mr. Kingston requiring the Government Accountability Office to study the cost savings associated with privatizing the Capitol Power Plant, which was agreed to; An amendment offered by Ms. Kaptur to increase funding for the Botanic Garden, which was withdrawn; and An amendment offered by Ms. Lee, that added a general provision (Section 214) stating, \"It is the sense of the Congress that Congress should not pass any legislation that authorizes spending cuts that would increase poverty in the United States,\" which was accepted.  The Senate committee held its markup of the FY2014 bill on July 11, 2013. The bill would have provided $2.978 billion (not including House items, which are determined by the House). No amendments were offered, and the bill was ordered reported by a roll call vote of 16-14 ( S. 1283 , S.Rept. 113-70 ). Prior to the beginning of FY2014, congressional action occurred on an interim continuing resolution (CR) that would have provided continuing appropriations for projects and activities for which authority existed during the previous fiscal year. H.J.Res. 59 was introduced on September 10, 2013, and passed the House on September 20. On September 27, the Senate passed H.J.Res. 59 with an amendment. Subsequent actions to resolve differences between the House and Senate, which included the consideration of various House amendments to that Senate amendment, were unsuccessful prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.  Because none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2014 was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, a funding gap ensued on October 1, 2013. Congressional action on FY2014 appropriations between October 2 and October 15 was generally limited to a number of narrow CRs to provide funding for certain programs or classes of individuals, none of which would have provided funding for the legislative branch.  Since the Antideficiency Act generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations, and pursuant to opinions issued in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti further clarifying the need for the federal government to begin terminating regular activities upon the occurrence of a funding gap, a partial shutdown began on October 1, 2013. Many legislative branch activities were restricted to those \"excepted\" pursuant to the act, which include activities necessary to protect life and property. Some activities also continued pursuant to authorities cited in a 1990 GAO nondecision letter, which states: \" ... Congress and its agents may incur obligations to support Congress's exercise of its constitutional powers.\" On October 16, 2013, the Senate passed H.R. 2775 with an amendment that, in part, provided interim continuing appropriations for the previous fiscal year's projects and activities. Later that same day, the House agreed to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2775 . The CR was signed into law on October 17, 2013 ( P.L. 113-46 ), thus terminating the funding gap that same day. With some routine exceptions, the CR provided budget authority through January 15, 2014. The legislative branch previously experienced a funding gap in FY1996 (November 14-18, 1995).  Another temporary CR ( P.L. 113-73 ), introduced on January 10 and enacted on January 15, 2014, provided funding until January 18 so omnibus legislation could be considered.  On January 15, 2014, pursuant to a special rule ( H.Res. 458 ), the House considered the Senate amendment to H.R. 3547 with a House amendment that consisted of the text of the omnibus. Explanatory materials were inserted into the Congressional Record by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers. The House agreed to the amendment the same day, with the Senate following the next day. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, was enacted on January 17 ( P.L. 113-76 ), with legislative branch funding contained in Division I.  According to a CBO estimate of the bill, the legislative branch represents approximately 0.9% of nondefense discretionary appropriations and 0.4% of total discretionary appropriations provided in the act. In addition to some longstanding provisions, Division I of the FY2014 act continued some general provisions added in more recent years\u2014including provisions prohibiting the elimination or restriction of staff-led tours of the Capitol; prohibiting the use of funds for the delivery of printed bills, resolutions, and copies of the Congressional Record to House Member offices unless copies are requested; and limiting the monthly amount available for payments from the House Members' Representational Allowance to lease vehicles\u2014and added new provisions limiting the aggregate number of copies of the U.S. Code available to the House, and authorizing certain commercial activities in Union Square. Both of these new provisions were included in the House-reported FY2014 bill. The Union Square provision, which was also discussed during the FY2013 appropriations cycle, follows the transfer of this parcel of land from the National Park Service to the Architect of the Capitol in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ).  Additionally, some of the government-wide general provisions included in Title VII of Division E (Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act) may affect legislative branch operations.  FY2013 funding of approximately $4.061 billion was provided by P.L. 113-6 , which was signed into law on March 26, 2013. The act funded legislative branch accounts at the FY2012 enacted level, with some exceptions (also known as \"anomalies\"), and less across-the-board rescissions required by Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 . Section 3004 was intended to eliminate any amount by which the new budget authority provided in the act exceeds the FY2013 discretionary spending limits in Section 251(c)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent to the enactment of P.L. 113-6 , OMB calculated that additional rescissions of 0.032% of security budget authority, and 0.2% of nonsecurity budget authority, would be required. The act did not alter the sequestration reductions implemented on March 1, which reduced most legislative branch accounts by 5.0%. The accompanying OMB report indicated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled in each account containing non-exempt funds.  Previously, division G of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ) provided $4.307 billion for the legislative branch. This level was $236.9 million (-5.2%) below the FY2011 enacted level. P.L. 112-10 provided $4.543 billion for legislative branch operations in FY2011. This level represented a $125.1 million decrease from the $4.668 billion provided in the FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-68 ) and the FY2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-212 ). The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $4.402 billion. In FY2009, an additional $25.0 million was provided for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. P.L. 111-32 , the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, also contained funding for a new Capitol Police radio system ($71.6 million) and for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) ($2.0 million).   Figure 1 shows the timing of legislative branch appropriations actions, including the issuance of House and Senate reports, bill passage, and enactment, from FY1993 to FY2014. It shows that a legislative branch bill has been enacted on or before October 1 seven times during this period (FY1994, FY1995, FY1997, FY2000, FY2004, FY2006, and FY2010), with another three bills enacted during the first month of the fiscal year (FY1993, FY1998, and FY1999), two in November (FY1996 and FY2002), four in December (FY2001, FY2005, FY2008, and FY2012), and six in the next calendar year (FY2003, FY2007, FY2009, FY2011, FY2013, and FY2014). It also indicates when, through FY2013, the legislative branch bill has been enacted as a stand-alone measure (12 times) and when it was enacted as a part of a consolidated or omnibus measure (10 times).   Figure 2 compares legislative branch discretionary budget authority with total discretionary budget authority from FY1976 to FY2012. It shows the legislative branch as a proportion of total discretionary budget authority over this period has remained relatively stable at approximately 0.4%. The highest proportional full-year level, 0.48%, was in FY1995, and the lowest, 0.31%, was in FY2009. Figure 3 demonstrates the division of budget authority across the legislative branch in FY2014. Table 3 provides additional information on legislative branch funding provided in annual and supplemental appropriations acts.  The following sections discuss the various legislative branch accounts as well as issues discussed during the hearings on the budget requests.  The Senate requested $892.1 million for FY2014. The Senate reported bill contained $871.99 million, and the FY2014 act provided $859.3 million.  The FY2012 level of $868.6 million represented a decrease of $45.6 million (-5.0%) from the $914.2 million provided in FY2011, and the FY2011 level itself represented a reduction of $12.0 million (-1.3%) from the FY2010 level of $926.2 million.  Additional information on the Senate account is presented in Table 5 . Appropriations for Senate committees are contained in two accounts: The inquiries and investigations account contains funds for all Senate committees except Appropriations. The Senate requested $134.0 million for inquiries and investigations, the level provided by the Senate report. The FY2014 act provided $132.0 million.

The funds may be used for any category of expenses, subject to limitations on official mail.  The Senate requested, and the committee report would have provided, $394.2 million for FY2014. The FY2014 act provided $390.0 million.  The FY2012 level of $396.2 million represented a decrease of $13.0 million (-3.2%) from the FY2011 level of $409.2 million.

The first subheading contains funds for personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of House committees, except the Appropriations Committee, as authorized by the House in a committee expense resolution. The House requested $126.7 million, and the House-reported bill would have provided $119.4 million. The FY2014 act provided $123.9 million. The FY2012 level of $126.0 million was a decrease of $8.6 million from the $134.5 million provided for FY2011.

The second subheading contains funds for the personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of the Committee on Appropriations. The House requested $26.8 million, and the House-reported bill would have provided $25.3 million. The FY2014 act provided $23.3 million. The FY2012 level of $26.7 million was a decrease of $1.8 million from the FY2011 level of $28.5 million, which was a decrease of $2.8 million from the FY2010 level of $31.3 million.  The Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) is available to support Members in their official and representational duties. For FY2014, $577.5 million was requested, and the House-reported bill would have provided $543.9 million. The FY2014 act provided $554.3 million. The $573.9 million provided in FY2012 was $39.1 million less than the $613.1 million provided in FY2011. The FY2011 level was a decrease of nearly $47.0 million from the $660.0 million provided in FY2010.  The U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are responsible for the security of the Capitol Complex including the U.S. Capitol, the House and Senate office buildings, the U.S. Botanic Garden, and the Library of Congress buildings and adjacent grounds.  The USCP requested $363.3 million for FY2014. The House-reported bill would have provided $329.7 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $338.5 million, which was the level contained in the FY2014 act.  Previously, the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $340.1 million, the same level as for FY2011.  Additional information on the USCP is presented in Table 7 . Appropriations for the police are contained in two accounts\u2014a salaries account and a general expenses account. The salaries account contains funds for the salaries of employees; overtime pay; hazardous duty pay differential; and government contributions for employee health, retirement, Social Security, professional liability insurance, and other benefit programs. The general expenses account contains funds for expenses of vehicles; communications equipment; security equipment and its installation; dignitary protection; intelligence analysis; hazardous material response; uniforms; weapons; training programs; medical, forensic, and communications services; travel; relocation of instructors for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; and other administrative and technical support, among other expenses.  Salaries\u2014The Capitol Police requested $297.9 million for salaries. The House-reported bill would have provided $274.5 million, and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $281.5 million. The FY2014 act provided $279.0 million. General Expenses\u2014The Capitol Police requested $65.4 million for general expenses. The House-reported bill would have provided $55.2 million, and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $57.0 million. The FY2014 act provided $59.5 million. Another appropriation relating to the Capitol Police appears within the Architect of the Capitol account for Capitol Police buildings and grounds. The FY2014 request contains $26.9 million, the House-reported bill would have provided $18.9 million, and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $21.3 million. The FY2014 act provided $19.3 million. Previously, $21.5 million was provided in FY2012, and the FY2011 enacted level was nearly $27.0 million.  The Capitol Police requested administrative provisions providing authority to transfer between salaries and expenses (Section 1101) and making \"available balances of expired United States Capitol Police appropriations\" available for \"deposit to the credit of the Employees' Compensation Fund required by section 8147(b) of title 5, United States Code\" (Section 1102). Both of these provisions previously were included in the FY2013 House-passed and Senate-reported bills. The FY2014 bills reported in the House and Senate, as well as the FY2014 act, included both provisions. On April 10, 2013, the House subcommittee discussed the Capitol Police training requests, radio modernization program, district office security, door closures, overtime use, discrimination complaints, and the Capitol Police Board. At a hearing on June 6, 2013, the Senate subcommittee discussed the effects of sequestration. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the United States Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol and its grounds, House and Senate office buildings, Library of Congress buildings and grounds, Capitol power plant, Botanic Garden, Capitol Visitor Center, and Capitol Police buildings and grounds. The Architect is responsible for the Supreme Court buildings and grounds, but appropriations for their expenses are not contained in the legislative branch appropriations bill. Operations of the Architect are funded in the following 10 accounts: general administration, Capitol building, Capitol grounds, Senate office buildings, House office buildings, Capitol power plant, Library buildings and grounds, Capitol Police buildings and grounds, Capitol Visitor Center, and Botanic Garden.  The Architect requested $681.7 million for FY2014. The House-reported bill would have provided $507.99 million, not including funding for the Senate office buildings. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $468.9 million, not including funding for House office buildings. The FY2014 act provided $602.0 million, which includes $15.94 million for the next phase of the Capitol Dome restoration project. The FY2012 level of $567.5 million represented a decrease of $32.9 million (-5.5%) from the FY2011 enacted level of $600.4 million (not including a rescission of $14.6 million in unobligated amounts of prior year appropriations for the Capitol Visitor Center contained in the FY2011 act). The FY2011 level represented a decrease of $1.2 million (-0.2%) from the $601.6 million provided in FY2010. In FY2010, a 21.7% increase (or $644.6 million) was requested, and a 13.6% increase was provided ($601.6 million). In FY2009, a 55.4% increase ($642.7 million) was requested, and a 28% increase ($529.6 million) was provided. The FY2008 budget authority ($413.5 million) represented a decrease of 8.1% from the $449.9 million (including supplemental appropriations) provided in FY2007. The FY2014 request for each of the AOC accounts is presented in Table 8 . The House-reported bill contained administrative provisions requiring a semiannual report of disbursements and related to the use of 501 First Street SE (the former House page dorm). The Senate-reported bill contained a provision extending a law related to the collection and sale of recyclable materials. These three provisions were included in the FY2014 act.  Among the items discussed at the House subcommittee hearing on March 5, 2013, were funding for the Capitol Dome rehabilitation project, the prioritization of projects, transfer authority provided in FY2013, plans for the renovation of the Cannon House Office Building and the condition of the Rayburn building, the effect of the sequester on overtime work, plans for the House page dorm, and the restoration of the Summerhouse on the West Front Lawn of the U.S. Capitol.  At a hearing on June 6, 2013, the Senate subcommittee discussed the effects of sequestration, the restoration of the Capitol Dome, and the prioritization of projects.  CBO is a nonpartisan congressional agency created to provide objective economic and budgetary analysis to Congress. CBO cost estimates are required for any measure reported by a regular or conference committee that may vary revenues or expenditures. CBO requested $45.7 million for FY2014. The House-reported bill would have provided $41.5 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $45.7 million, which was the level contained in the FY2014 act.  The FY2012 level of $43.8 million represented a decrease of 6.4% from the FY2011 level of $46.8 million. CBO received $45.2 million for FY2010; $44.1 million was provided in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-8 ), and $2.0 million, to remain available through FY2010, was provided in the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-32 ).  CBO requested two administrative provisions for FY2014. The requested provisions would  1. allow CBO's appropriation to be used to pay the compensation of certain employees with non-immigrant visas, a provision also requested in FY2012 and FY2013 but not included in the FY2014 reports or act, and 2. allow CBO to accept the use of voluntary student services as part of an agency program established for the purpose of providing educational experiences for the students, a provision also requested in FY2013.The House-reported bill included this provision, as did the FY2014 act. At the House hearing on February 27, 2013, the subcommittee discussed the impact of sequestration and findings and projections in recent CBO products. Among the items discussed at the May 21, 2013, Senate subcommittee hearing were the number of requests received by CBO, its methodologies, and staffing levels with sequestration.  The Library of Congress serves simultaneously as Congress's parliamentary library and the de facto national library of the United States. Its broader services to the nation include the acquisition, maintenance, and preservation of a collection of more than 155 million items in a wide range of traditional and new media; service to the general public and scholarly and library communities; administration of U.S. copyright laws by its Copyright Office; and administration of a national program to provide reading material to the blind and physically handicapped. Its direct services to Congress include the provision of legal research and law-related services by the Law Library of Congress, and a broad range of activities by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), including in-depth and nonpartisan public policy research, analysis, and legislative assistance for Members and committees and their staff; congressional staff training; information and statistics retrieval; and continuing legal education for Members of both chambers and congressional staff. The Library requested $608.7 million for FY2014. The House-reported bill would have provided $558.3 million, and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $600.9 million. The FY2014 act provided $578.98 million.  The FY2012 level of $587.3 million represented a decrease of $41.3 million (-6.6%) from the FY2011 level of $628.7 million. The FY2011 level represented a decrease of $14.7 million (-2.3%) from the $643.3 million provided in FY2010. The FY2010 level represented an increase of 6.0% over the FY2009 level of $607.1 million, and the FY2009 level represented an increase of approximately 7.8% over the $563.0 million provided in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. These figures do not include additional authority to spend receipts. The FY2014 budget contains the following headings: Salaries and expenses\u2014The Library requested $427.5 million. The House-reported bill would have provided $392.3 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $421.6 million. The FY2014 act provided $405.7 million. These figures do not include $6.35 million in authority to spend receipts. The FY2012 level of $413.7 million (also not including $6.35 million in authority to spend receipts) represented a decrease of $18.0 million (-4.2%) from the FY2011 level of $431.8 million. The FY2011 level was an $8.0 million decrease (-1.8%) from the $439.8 million provided for FY2010. Copyright Office\u2014The Library requested $19.3 million for the copyright office. The House-reported bill would have provided $16.6 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $19.0 million. The FY2014 act provided $18.2 million. The FY2012 level of $16.1 million represented a decrease of $1.7 million (-9.5%). The FY2011 level of $17.8 million was a decrease of $3.0 million (-14.6%) from the $20.9 million provided for FY2010. These levels do not include authority to spend receipts. Congressional Research Service\u2014The FY2014 request contained $109.98 million for CRS, and the House-reported bill would have provided $101.4 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $108.8 million. The FY2014 act provided $105.4 million. The FY2012 level of $106.8 million represented a decrease of $4.2 million (-3.8%) from the FY2011 level of $111.0 million. The FY2011 level was a decrease of $1.5 million (-1.3%) from the $112.5 million provided for FY2010. Books for the Blind and Physically Handicapped\u2014The Library requested $51.9 million, and the House-reported bill would have provided $48.0 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $51.4 million. The FY2014 act provided $49.8 million. The FY2012 level of $50.7 million represented a decrease of $17.4 million (-25.5%) from the $68.0 million provided for FY2011. The FY2011 level was a decrease of $2.1 million (-3.0%) from the $70.2 million provided for FY2010.  The Architect's budget also contains funds for the Library buildings and grounds. The FY2014 request would have provided $77.0 million. The House-reported bill would have provided $47.9 million, and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $64.2 million. The FY2014 act provided $53.4 million, including $18.2 million for the requested collection storage module at Ft. Meade. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $46.9 million, an increase of $1.2 million (2.6%) from the $45.7 million provided for FY2011. The FY2011 level represented a 0.2% reduction (-$92,000) from the $45.8 million provided for Library buildings and grounds in FY2010.  The Library requested authority to obligate funds for reimbursable and revolving fund activities and transfer authority. The bills reported in the House and Senate, as well as the FY2014 act, both contained these provisions. At a hearing on February 27, 2013, the House subcommittee addressed the effects of sequestration, the number of congressional requests, exchanges with international libraries, fee structures for certain services, the request for the Ft. Meade Module 5 storage facility, and plans for the Twitter archive.  At a hearing on May 7, 2013, the Senate subcommittee asked about the number of requests from Congress, core services of the Library, and sequestration. GAO responds to requests for studies of federal government programs and expenditures. GAO may also initiate its own work. Formerly the General Accounting Office, the agency was renamed the Government Accountability Office effective July 7, 2004. GAO requested $524.3 million for FY2014, not including offsetting collections. The House-reported bill would have provided $486.2 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $505.4 million, which was the level contained in the FY2014 act.  Previously, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act contained an anomaly for GAO, providing it with $506.3 million, not including sequestration or the across-the-board rescission. The FY2012 level of $511.3 million represented a decrease of $34.96 million (-6.4%) from the $546.3 million provided for FY2011. The FY2011 level was a decrease of $10.6 million (-1.9%) from the $556.9 million GAO received in FY2010. GAO received $531.0 million in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act and an additional $25.0 million in P.L. 111-5 to cover responsibilities under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These levels do not include offsetting collections. In addition to a provision related to deposits for the Employees' Compensation Fund (provided in P.L. 113-6 ), GAO requested language related to the collection of fees for filing protests and changing certain reports required under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act from bimonthly to annual.  As stated above, an amendment adopted at the full committee markup, included in language in the House report, would have required GAO to study the cost savings associated with privatizing the Capitol Power Plant. The House and Senate reports both contained variations of a provision related to the collection of fees related to the establishment and operation of an electronic filing and document dissemination system for protests. The House-reported language was included in the FY2014 act. At the House hearing on February 26, 2013, the subcommittee discussed issues including the number of requests accepted by GAO, sequestration plans, the size of GAO, statutory reporting requirements, and savings achieved from GAO recommendations.  The Senate subcommittee met on May 21, 2013, and discussed the number of requests received from Congress, performance management, and tracking agency implementation of GAO recommendations. GPO requested $128.5 million for FY2014. The House-reported bill would have provided $115.1 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $119.3 million, which was the level contained in the FY2014 act. Previously, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act contained an anomaly for GPO, providing it with $119.1 million, not including sequestration or the across-the-board rescission. The FY2012 level of $126.2 million represented a decrease of $8.9 million (-0.6%) from the $135.1 million provided for FY2011, which was a decrease of $12.4 million (-8.4%) from the $147.5 million for FY2010. The FY2010 level represented an increase of $6.9 million (4.9%) over the $140.6 million provided in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The FY2009 level represented an increase of $15.9 million (12.7%) over the $124.7 million provided in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act.  GPO's budget authority is contained in three accounts: (1) congressional printing and binding, (2) Office of Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses), and (3) the revolving fund. Congressional printing and binding\u2014GPO requested $79.7 million, equivalent to the amount provided in the House-reported bill, the Senate-reported bill, and the FY2014 act. The FY2012 level of $90.7 million represented a decrease of $2.9 million (-3.1%) from the $93.6 million provided for FY2011. The FY2010 appropriations act provided $93.8 million. Office of Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses)\u2014GPO requested $35.8 million. The House-reported bill would have provided $31.4 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $31.5 million, which was the level provided by the FY2014 act. FY2012 level of $35.0 million was a decrease of $4.8 million (-12.1%) from the $39.8 million provided for FY2011. The FY2010 appropriations act provided $40.9 million. Revolving fund\u2014The revolving fund supports the operation and maintenance of the Government Printing Office. GPO requested $12.9 million. The House-reported bill would have provided $3.97 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $8.1 million, which was the level provided by the FY2014 act. Previously, an anomaly in the FY2013 CR provided $4.0 million (not including the sequestration reductions or the rescission), $500,000 was provided in FY2012, the FY2011 act provided $1.66 million, and the FY2010 act provided $12.8 million for the revolving fund.  The congressional printing and binding account pays for expenses of printing and binding required for congressional use, and for statutorily authorized printing, binding, and distribution of government publications for specified recipients at no charge. Included within these publications are the Congressional Record ; Congressional Directory ; Senate and House Journals; memorial addresses of Members; nominations; U.S. Code and supplements; serial sets; publications printed without a document or report number, for example, laws and treaties; envelopes provided to Members of Congress for the mailing of documents; House and Senate business and committee calendars; bills, resolutions, and amendments; committee reports and prints; committee hearings; and other documents. The Office of Superintendent of Documents account funds the mailing of government documents for Members of Congress and federal agencies, as statutorily authorized; the compilation of catalogs and indexes of government publications; and the cataloging, indexing, and distribution of government publications to the Federal Depository and International Exchange libraries, and to other individuals and entities, as authorized by law. The House subcommittee met on February 26, 2013, to discuss GPO's FY2014 budget request. The topics discussed included sequestration preparations, the revolving fund, contracts with vendors, equal employment opportunity complaints, the use of GPO mobile applications, changes to the printing industry, and passport production.  The Senate subcommittee held its FY2013 budget request hearing on May 21, 2013, discussing the operation and use of GPO's revolving fund, as well as GPO's response to recommendations in the study of GPO performed by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). The Office of Compliance is an independent and nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch. It was established to administer and enforce the Congressional Accountability Act, which was enacted in 1995. The act applies various employment and workplace safety laws to Congress and certain legislative branch entities. The Office of Compliance requested $4.5 million for FY2014. The House-reported bill would have provided $3.6 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $3.9 million, which was the level contained in the FY2014 act.  The FY2012 level represented a decrease of $260,000 (-6.4%) from the $4.08 million provided in P.L. 112-10 for FY2011. The FY2011 level represented a decrease of $300,000 (-6.9%) from the $4.4 million provided in FY2010. The FY2010 level represented an increase of 7.5% from the $4.1 million provided in the FY2009 Omnibus, which was an increase of 21.8% over the FY2008 level of $3.3 million. The FY2014 House-reported bill and the FY2014 act contained administrative provisions related to the payment of awards and settlements under the Congressional Accountability Act and requiring semiannual reporting of disbursements for the operations of the Office of Compliance. The Open World Leadership Center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries by inviting their leaders to observe democracy and free enterprise in the United States. The first program was authorized by Congress in 1999 to support the relationship between Russia and the United States. The program encouraged young federal and local Russian leaders to visit the United States and observe its government and society. Established at the Library of Congress as the Center for Russian Leadership Development in 2000, the center was renamed the Open World Leadership Center in 2003, when the program was expanded to include specified additional countries. In 2004, Congress further extended the program's eligibility to other countries designated by the center's board of trustees, subject to congressional consideration. The center is housed in the Library and receives services from the Library through an inter-agency agreement. Open World requested $10.06 million for FY2014.  The House subcommittee mark would have provided $1.0 million. As stated above, an amendment to restore funding for Open World to the FY2013 post-sequester level was debated and withdrawn during the full committee markup. The House report states: For many years the Committee has had concern with the placement of the Open World Leadership Center (OWLC) in the Legislative Branch. The Committee understands the program has some strong champions on the Committee. However, with further reductions being made to every program within the Legislative Branch, the Committee has provided $1,000,000 to cover the cost associated with the shutdown of the OWLC. The Committee directs the Executive Director of the OWLC to retain any necessary prior year funds in the Trust to cover any cost in excess of the $1,000,000 provided in this bill be utilized for the orderly shutdown. The Executive Director is further directed that the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2014 appropriation bill. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $4.0 million, as well as a provision allowing the Librarian of Congress to transfer up to $6.0 million in non-appropriated funds to Open World.  The FY2014 act provided $6.0 million. Previously, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act contained an anomaly for Open World, providing it with $8.0 million, not including sequestration or the across-the-board rescission. FY2012 level was $1.38 million (-12.1%) less than the $11.38 million provided in FY2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ). The FY2011 level represented a decrease of $623,000 (-5.2%) from the $12.00 million provided for FY2010, and the FY2010 level represented a decrease of $1.90 million (-13.7%) from the $13.90 million provided in the FY2009 Omnibus. The FY2009 level was a $4.92 million increase (54.8%) over the $8.98 million provided in FY2008, which was a decrease of $4.88 million (-35.2%) from the $13.86 million provided in FY2007 and FY2006.  The location and future of Open World, as well as its inclusion in the legislative branch budget, have been a topic of discussion at appropriations hearings in recent fiscal years.  The FY2013 House-reported bill would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of $9.0 million (-90.0%), from the $10.0 million provided in FY2012 and requested for FY2013. The House report states that this funding level would \"cover the cost associated with the shutdown\" and directed that \"the program termination is to be finalized within one year of enactment of the Legislative Branch fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill.\" H.Amdt. 1281 , agreed to by recorded vote (204-203, Roll no. 373), eliminated this funding. At the Senate FY2013 budget request hearing on March 1, 2012, the subcommittee discussed potential options for increasing private funding, including the hire of a development professional. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $10.0 million. P.L. 113-6 provided $8.0 million for FY2013, not including the across-the-board rescission or sequestration.  Previously, the House-passed FY2012 bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of 91.2% from the FY2011 level of $11.38 million. The House report stated, \"The program has some strong champions on the Committee, but with reductions being made to most every program within the Federal budget the Committee has elected to shut down the program and recommends $1,000,000 for shutdown expenses.\" The Senate-reported bill, in contrast, would have provided $10.0 million (-12.1% below the FY2011 level). The Senate report stated that \"despite the fiscal constraints of the budget this program is necessary for the promotion of democratic principles in countries with historically oppressive rule.\" The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided the Senate-reported level of $10.0 million. Additionally, the FY2010 House Appropriations Committee report stated that \"the Legislative Branch Subcommittee has been clear that it expects the Open World program to become financially independent of funding in this bill as soon as possible.\" This sentiment was also expressed in the conference report, which stated,  The conferees are fully supportive of expanded efforts of the Open World Center to raise private funding and expect this effort to reduce the requirements for funding from the Legislative Branch appropriations bill in future years. The Committees look forward to a report of progress being made by the Center's fundraising program prior to hearings on its fiscal year 2011 budget request. The location within the legislative branch was discussed during a hearing on the FY2009 budget. Ambassador John O'Keefe, the executive director of Open World, testified that the program may attract different participants if associated with the executive branch rather than the Library of Congress, which may be seen as more neutral and nonpartisan. The FY2009 explanatory statement directed the Open World Leadership Center Board of Trustees to work with the State Department and the judiciary to establish a shared funding mechanism.  The subcommittees also had discussed this issue during the FY2008 appropriations cycle, and language was included in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act requiring Open World to prepare a report by March 31, 2008, on \"potential options for transfer of the Open World Leadership Center to a department or agency in the executive branch, establishment of the Center as an independent agency in the executive branch, or other appropriate options.\" In 2004, GAO issued a report on the Open World program, examining program participation, purpose, and accountability.  The center was created by Congress in 1988 to encourage public service by congressional staff through training and development programs.  The center requested $430,000 for FY2014.  The House subcommittee mark would have provided $407,508. An amendment offered at the full committee reduced this to $0. The FY2014 House report ( H.Rept. 113-173 ) states: The fiscal year 2012 Conference Agreement (House Report 112\u2013331) directed that future budget requests from the John C. Stennis Center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget justification as requested in House Report 112\u2013148. The John C. Stennis Center has repeatedly ignored this directive.  The Senate-reported bill would have provided $430,000, which was the level contained in the FY2014 act. Previously, $430,000, not including the across-board-rescission or sequestration, was provided for the center in FY2013. The FY2013 Senate-reported bill would have provided the requested level of $430,000. The FY2013 House-passed bill did not provide funding for the Stennis Center, and the House report stated:  The fiscal year 2012 Conference Agreement ( H.Rept. 112-331 ) directed that future budget requests from the John C. Stennis Center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget justification as requested in H.Rept. 112-148 . The Committee did not receive such justification and therefore has not provided the requested funding.  The $430,000 and directive for budget justifications included in the FY2012 conference report followed language in H.Rept. 112-148 , the FY2012 House report, which stated:  The Center was created by Congress in 1988 with an appropriation of $7.5 million which subsequently was transferred to the John C. Stennis Trust Fund and invested in non-expendable corpus Special Issue Certificates of Indebtedness with the U.S. Treasury. As reflected in the current Budget of the United States, the Center has $15 million invested with the Treasury, and at a 2 percent return should generate $300,000 that can be utilized for the annual operation of the program. Since the principal of the fund has doubled from the original appropriation and with reduced funding within the Legislative Branch, the Committee has provided zero funding for the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Training and Development.  The Committee directs that any further budget request from the John C. Stennis Center be accompanied by an appropriately detailed budget justification.  The Stennis Center was funded at $430,000 in FY2011 (less 0.2% from an across-the-board rescission), FY2010, FY2009, FY2008 (less 0.25% rescission from an across-the-board rescission), and FY2007. Selected Websites These sites contain information on the FY2014 legislative branch appropriations requests and legislation, and the appropriations process: House Committee on Appropriations http://appropriations.house.gov/  Senate Committee on Appropriations http://appropriations.senate.gov/  CRS Appropriations Products Guide http://www.crs.gov/Pages/AppropriationsStatusTable.aspx?source=QuickLinks Congressional Budget Office http://www.cbo.gov Government Accountability Office http://www.gao.gov Office of Management and Budget http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/  Prior to the beginning of FY2014, congressional action occurred on an interim continuing resolution (CR) that would have provided continuing appropriations for projects and activities for which authority existed during the previous fiscal year. H.J.Res. 59 was introduced on September 10, 2013, and passed the House on September 20. On September 27, the Senate passed H.J.Res. 59 with an amendment. Subsequent actions to resolve differences between the House and Senate, which included the consideration of various House amendments to that Senate amendment, were unsuccessful prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.  Because none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2014 was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, a funding gap ensued on October 1, 2013. Congressional action on FY2014 appropriations between October 2 and October 15 was generally limited to a number of narrow CRs to provide funding for certain programs or classes of individuals, none of which would have provided funding for the legislative branch.  Since the Antideficiency Act generally bars the obligation of funds in the absence of appropriations, and pursuant to opinions issued in 1980 and early 1981 by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti further clarifying the need for the federal government to begin terminating regular activities upon the occurrence of a funding gap, a partial shutdown began on October 1, 2013. Many legislative branch activities were restricted to those \"excepted\" pursuant to the act, which include activities necessary to protect life and property. Some activities also continued pursuant to authorities cited in a 1990 GAO nondecision letter, which states: \" ... Congress and its agents may incur obligations to support Congress's exercise of its constitutional powers.\" On October 16, 2013, the Senate passed H.R. 2775 with an amendment that, in part, provided interim continuing appropriations for the previous fiscal year's projects and activities. Later that same day, the House agreed to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2775 . The CR was signed into law on October 17, 2013 ( P.L. 113-46 ), thus terminating the funding gap that same day. With some routine exceptions, the CR provided budget authority through January 15, 2014."
