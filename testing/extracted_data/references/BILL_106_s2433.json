FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The area of Louisiana known as the Red River Valley, \n        located along the Red River Waterway in Caddo, Bossier, Red \n        River, Natchitoches, and DeSoto Parishes, is of critical \n        importance to over 350 species of birds (including migratory \n        and resident waterfowl, shore birds, and neotropical migratory \n        birds), aquatic life, and a wide array of other species \n        associated with river basin ecosystems.\n            (2) The bottomland hardwood forests of the Red River Valley \n        have been almost totally cleared. Reforestation and restoration \n        of native habitat will benefit a host of species.\n            (3) The Red River Valley is part of a major continental \n        migration corridor for migratory birds funneling through the \n        mid continent from as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far \n        south as South America.\n            (4) There are no significant public sanctuaries for over \n        300 river miles on this important migration corridor, and no \n        significant Federal, State, or private wildlife sanctuaries \n        along the Red River north of Alexandria, Louisiana.\n            (5) Completion of the lock and dam system associated with \n        the Red River Waterway project up to Shreveport, Louisiana, has \n        enhanced opportunities for management of fish and wildlife.\n            (6) The Red River Valley offers extraordinary recreational, \n        research, and educational opportunities for students, \n        scientists, bird watchers, wildlife observers, hunters, \n        anglers, trappers, hikers, and nature photographers.\n            (7) The Red River Valley is an internationally significant \n        environmental resource that has been neglected and requires \n        active restoration and management to protect and enhance the \n        value of the region as a habitat for fish and wildlife.\n\nSEC. 3.
