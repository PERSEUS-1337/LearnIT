FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines are a key \n        component of the energy infrastructure of the United States;\n            (2) many of these pipelines are aging facilities and \n        therefore more susceptible to failure;\n            (3) these facilities, with their unprotected rights-of-way, \n        are also highly vulnerable to terrorist attacks and other \n        disruptions;\n            (4) interruptions in service on major pipelines, whether a \n        result of pipeline failure or purposeful action, can have \n        enormous consequences for the economy and security of the \n        United States;\n            (5) new energy sources such as hydrogen will require a new \n        generation of pipelines; and\n            (6) a more coordinated research, development, \n        demonstration, and standardization program is needed to ensure \n        the use of existing technologies and the development of new \n        technologies to increase the safety and security of these \n        critical facilities.\n\nSEC. 3. PIPELINE INTEGRITY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Cooperative Program.--\n            (1) In general.--The heads of the participating agencies \n        shall develop and implement a program of research, development, \n        demonstration, and standardization to ensure the integrity of \n        pipeline facilities.\n            (2) Elements.--The program shall include research, \n        development, demonstration, and standardization activities \n        related to--\n                    (A) materials research and inspection;\n                    (B) stress and fracture analysis, and detection of \n                cracks, corrosion, abrasion, and other abnormalities \n                inside pipelines that lead to pipeline failure;\n                    (C) leak detection technologies, including \n                detection of leaks at very low volumes;\n                    (D) flow metering and methods of analyzing content \n                of pipeline throughput;\n                    (E) pipeline security, including improving the \n                surveillance of pipeline rights-of-way;\n                    (F) risk assessment methodology;\n                    (G) information systems surety; and\n                    (H) other elements the heads of the participating \n                agencies consider appropriate.\n            (3) Activities and capabilities report.--Not later than 6 \n        months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n        participating agencies shall transmit to the Congress a report \n        on the activities and capabilities of the participating \n        agencies, including the national laboratories, and any other \n        Federal agencies that are relevant to or could contribute to \n        research, development, demonstration, and standardization \n        activities under the program plan prepared under this section.\n    (b) Program Plan.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the participating agencies shall \n        prepare and transmit to Congress a 5-year program plan to guide \n        activities under this section. Such program plan shall be \n        submitted to the Pipeline Integrity Technical Advisory \n        Committee established under subsection (c) for review, and the \n        report to Congress shall include the comments of the Advisory \n        Committee.
