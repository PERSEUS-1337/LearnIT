FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants \n        were enslaved in the United States and colonies that became the \n        United States from 1619 to 1865;\n            (2) the institution of slavery was constitutionally and \n        statutorily sanctioned by the Government of the United States \n        from 1789 through 1865;\n            (3) the slavery that flourished in the United States \n        constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' \n        life, liberty, African citizenship rights, and cultural \n        heritage, and denied them the fruits of their own labor;\n            (4) a preponderance of scholarly, legal, community \n        evidentiary documentation and popular culture markers \n        constitute the basis for inquiry into the on-going effects of \n        the institution of slavery and its legacy of persistent \n        systemic structures of discrimination on living African-\n        Americans and society in the United States; and\n            (5) following the abolition of slavery the United States \n        Government, at the Federal, State, and local level, continued \n        to perpetuate, condone and often profit from practices that \n        continued to brutalize and disadvantage African-Americans, \n        including share cropping, convict leasing, Jim Crow, redlining, \n        unequal education, and disproportionate treatment at the hands \n        of the criminal justice system; and\n            (6) as a result of the historic and continued \n        discrimination, African-Americans continue to suffer \n        debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships \n        including but not limited to; having nearly 1,000,000 Black \n        people incarcerated; an unemployment rate more than twice the \n        current White unemployment rate; and an average of less than \n        \\1/16\\ of the wealth of White families, a disparity which has \n        worsened, not improved over time.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission \nto study and develop Reparation proposals for African-Americans as a \nresult of--\n            (1) the institution of slavery, including both the Trans-\n        Atlantic and the domestic ``trade'' which existed from 1565 in \n        colonial Florida and from 1619 through 1865 within the other \n        colonies that became the United States, and which included the \n        Federal and State governments which constitutionally and \n        statutorily supported the institution of slavery;\n            (2) the de jure and de facto discrimination against freed \n        slaves and their descendants from the end of the Civil War to \n        the present, including economic, political, educational, and \n        social discrimination;\n            (3) the lingering negative effects of the institution of \n        slavery and the discrimination described in paragraphs (1) and \n        (2) on living African-Americans and on society in the United \n        States;\n            (4) the manner in which textual and digital instructional \n        resources and technologies are being used to deny the \n        inhumanity of slavery and the crime against humanity of people \n        of African descent in the United States;\n            (5) the role of Northern complicity in the Southern based \n        institution of slavery;\n            (6) the direct benefits to societal institutions, public \n        and private, including higher education, corporations, \n        religious and associational;\n            (7) and thus, recommend appropriate ways to educate the \n        American public of the Commission's findings;\n            (8) and thus, recommend appropriate remedies in \n        consideration of the Commission's findings on the matters \n        described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6); and\n            (9) submit to the Congress the results of such examination, \n        together with such recommendations.\n\nSEC. 3.
