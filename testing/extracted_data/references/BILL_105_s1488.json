FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) Adak Island is an isolated island located 1,200 miles \n        southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, between the Pacific Ocean and \n        the Bering Sea. The Island, with its unique physical and \n        biological features, including a deep water harbor and abundant \n        marine-associated wildlife, was recognized early for both its \n        natural and military values. In 1913, Adak Island was reserved \n        and set aside as a Preserve because of its value to seabirds, \n        marine mammals, and fisheries. Withdrawals of portions of Adak \n        Island for various military purposes date back to 1901 and \n        culminated in the 1959 withdrawal of approximately half of the \n        Island for use by the Department of the Navy for military \n        purposes.\n            (2) By 1990, military development on Adak Island supported \n        a community of 6,000 residents. Outside of the Adak Naval \n        Complex, there is no independent community on Adak Island.\n            (3) As a result of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment \n        Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 1808), as amended, the Adak Naval \n        Complex has been closed by the Department of Defense.\n            (4) The Aleut Corporation is an Alaskan Native Regional \n        Corporation incorporated in the State of Alaska pursuant to the \n        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), as amended (43 \n        U.S.C. 1601, et seq.). The Aleut Corporation represents the \n        indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands who prior to the \n        Russian exploration and settlement of the Aleutian Islands were \n        found throughout the Aleutian Islands which includes Adak \n        Island.\n            (5) None of Adak Island was available for selection by The \n        Aleut Corporation under section 14(h)(8) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. \n        1613(h)(8)) because it was part of a National Wildlife Refuge \n        and because the portion comprising the Adak Naval Complex was \n        withdrawn for use by the United States Navy for military \n        purposes prior to the passage of ANCSA in December 1971.\n            (6) The Aleut Corporation is interested in establishing a \n        community on Adak and has offered to exchange ANCSA land \n        selections for conveyance of certain lands and interests \n        therein on a portion of Adak formerly occupied by the Navy.\n            (7) Removal of a portion of Adak Island land from refuge \n        status will be offset by the acquisition of high quality \n        wildlife habitat in other Aleut Corporation selections within \n        the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, maintaining a \n        resident human population on Adak to control caribou, and \n        making possible a continued U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n        presence in that remote location to protect the natural \n        resources of the Aleutian Islands Unit of the Alaska Maritime \n        National Wildlife Refuge.\n            (8) It is in the public interest to promote reuse of the \n        Adak Island lands by exchanging certain lands for lands \n        selected by The Aleut Corporation elsewhere in the Alaska \n        Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Experience with \n        environmental problems associated with formerly used defense \n        sites in the State of Alaska suggests that the most effective \n        and efficient way to avoid future environmental problems on \n        Adak is to support and encourage active reuse of Adak.\n\nSEC. 2. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n    The document entitled the ``Agreement Concerning Transfer of Lands \nat Adak Naval Complex'' (hereinafter ``the Agreement''), and dated \n__________, executed by The Aleut Corporation, the Department of the \nInterior and the Department of the Navy, is hereby ratified, confirmed, \nand approved and the terms, conditions, procedures, covenants, \nreservations, and other provisions set forth in the Agreement are \ndeclared to be obligations and commitments of the United States as a \nmatter of Federal law.\n\nSEC. 3. REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM REFUGE.\n\n    Effective on the date of conveyance to The Aleut Corporation of the \nAdak Exchange Lands as described in the Agreement, all such lands shall \nbe removed from the National Wildlife Refuge System and shall neither \nbe considered as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge \nnor subject to any laws pertaining to lands within the boundaries of \nthe Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The conveyance \nrestrictions imposed by section 22(g) of the ANCSA, 43 U.S.C. 1621(g), \non said lands shall then be ineffective and cease to apply. The \nSecretary shall adjust the boundaries of the Refuge so as to exclude \nall interests in lands and land rights, surface and substance, received \nby The Aleut Corporation in accordance with this Act and the Agreement.\n\nSEC. 4. ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT.\n\n    Lands and interests therein exchanged and conveyed by the United \nStates pursuant to this act shall be considered and treated as \nconveyances of lands or interests therein under the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act, except that receipt of such lands and interests \ntherein shall not constitute a sale or disposition of land or interests \nreceived pursuant to such Act."
