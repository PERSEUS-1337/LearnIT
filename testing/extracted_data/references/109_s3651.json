FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research shows that child marriage in developing \n        nations is often associated with adverse economic and social \n        consequences and is dangerous to the health, security, and \n        well-being of girls and detrimental to the economic development \n        of communities.\n            (2) The issue of child marriage is interwoven with broader \n        social and cultural issues and is most effectively addressed as \n        a development challenge through integrated, community-based \n        approaches to promote and support girls' education and skill-\n        building and healthcare, legal rights, and awareness for girls \n        and women.\n            (3) As Charlotte Ponticelli, Senior Coordinator for \n        International Women's Issues for the Department of State, \n        stated on September 14, 2005: ``It is unconscionable that in \n        the 21st century girls as young as 7 or 8 can be sold as \n        brides. There is no denying that extreme poverty is the driving \n        factor that has enabled the practice to continue, even in \n        countries where it has been outlawed...We need to be shining \n        the spotlight on early marriage and its underlying causes...We \n        must continue to do everything we can to ensure that girls have \n        every opportunity to become agents of change and to expand the \n        `realm of what is possible' for their societies and the world \n        at large.''\n            (4) The severity of the adverse impact of child marriage \n        increases as the age at marriage and first childbirth \n        decreases.\n            (5) A Department of State survey in 2005 found that child \n        marriage was a concern in 64 out of 182 countries surveyed and \n        that the practice is especially acute in sub-Saharan Africa and \n        South Asia.\n            (6) According to the United Nations Children's Fund, in \n        Ethiopia and in parts of West Africa marriage at the age of 7 \n        or 8 is not uncommon.\n            (7) In developing countries, girls aged 10 to 14 who become \n        pregnant are 5 times more likely to die in pregnancy or \n        childbirth than women aged 20 to 24.\n            (8) Girls in sub-Saharan Africa are at much higher risk of \n        suffering obstetric fistula.\n            (9) According to the Department of State: ``Pregnancy at an \n        early age often leads to obstetric fistulae and permanent \n        incontinence. In Ethiopia, treatment is available at only 1 \n        hospital in Addis Ababa that performs over 1,000 fistula \n        operations a year. It estimates that for every successful \n        operation performed, 10 other young women need the treatment. \n        The maternal mortality rate is extremely high due, in part, to \n        food taboos for pregnant women, poverty, early marriage, and \n        birth complications related to FGM [Female Genital Mutilation], \n        especially infibulation.''.\n            (10) Adolescents are at greater risk of complications \n        during childbirth that can lead to fistula because they have \n        less access to health care and are subject to other significant \n        risk factors related to the mother's physical immaturity.\n            (11) In nearly every case of obstetric fistula, the baby \n        will be stillborn.\n            (12) The physical symptoms of obstetric fistula include \n        incontinence or constant uncontrollable leaking of urine or \n        feces, frequent bladder infections, infertility, and foul odor. \n        The condition often leads to the desertion of fistula sufferers \n        by husbands and family members and extreme social stigma.\n            (13) Although data on obstetric fistula are scarce, the \n        World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are more \n        than 2,000,000 women living with fistula and 50,000 to 100,000 \n        new cases each year. These figures are based on the number of \n        women who seek medical care. Many more suffer from the \n        disabling condition.\n            (14) Adolescent girls are more susceptible than mature \n        women to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, due to \n        both biological and social factors.\n            (15) Research in several countries with high rates of HIV \n        infection indicates that married girls are at greater risk for \n        HIV than their unmarried peers.\n            (16) Child marriage can have additional long-term \n        consequences when combined with female genital cutting because \n        the girls who have undergone that procedure can experience \n        greater complications during pregnancy, leading to lasting \n        health problems for themselves and their children.\n            (17) Child marriage is a leading barrier to girls' \n        education in certain developing countries.\n            (18) A high incidence of child marriage undermines the \n        efforts of developing countries and donor countries, including \n        the United States, to promote economic and social development.\n            (19) The causes of child marriage include poverty, custom, \n        and the desire to protect girls from violence or premarital \n        sexual relations.\n            (20) Child marriage may also be a product of gender \n        violence in which a man abducts and rapes a girl and then, \n        sometimes through negotiations with traditional leaders, \n        negotiates a settlement with the girl's parents, including \n        marriage to the victim.\n            (21) The practice of child marriage is considered a \n        ``harmful traditional practice'' by the United Nations \n        Children's Fund.\n            (22) The Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for \n        Marriage, and Registration of Marriages, adopted at the United \n        Nations, December 10, 1962, requires the parties to the \n        Convention to overcome all ``customs, ancient laws, and \n        practices by ensuring complete freedom in the choice of a \n        spouse, eliminating completely child marriages and the \n        betrothal of young girls before the age of puberty''.\n            (23) The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the \n        Child, which entered into force in 1990, provides that ``child \n        marriage and the betrothal of girls and boys shall be \n        prohibited and effective action, including legislation, shall \n        be taken to specify the minimum age of marriage to be eighteen \n        years''.\n            (24) In Ethiopia, Girls' Activity Committees, community-\n        based groups formed to support girls in school and advocate for \n        girls' education, have conducted community awareness and \n        informational campaigns, enlisted the assistance of traditional \n        clan and religious leaders, discouraged families from \n        practicing child marriage, encouraged girls' school attendance, \n        and taken steps to reduce gender-based violence and create \n        safer environments for girls en route to or from school and in \n        the classroom.\n            (25) Recognizing the importance of the issue and the \n        effects of child marriage, the Senior Coordinator for \n        International Women's Issues of the Department of State \n        initiated an effort in 2005 to collect and assess information \n        on the incidence of child marriage and on the existence and \n        effectiveness of initiatives funded by the United States to \n        reduce the incidence of child marriage or the negative effects \n        of child marriage and to measure the need for additional \n        programs.\n\nSEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the untapped economic and educational potential of \n        girls and women in many developing nations represent an \n        enormous loss to those societies;\n            (2) expanding educational opportunities for girls and \n        economic opportunities for women and reducing maternal and \n        child mortality are critical to the achievement of \n        internationally recognized health and development goals and of \n        many global health and development objectives of the United \n        States, including efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS;\n            (3) since child marriage is a leading barrier to the \n        continuation of girl's education in many developing countries, \n        it is important to integrate this issue into new and existing \n        United States-funded efforts to promote education, strengthen \n        legal rights and legal awareness, reduce gender-based violence, \n        and promote skill-building and economic opportunities for girls \n        and young women in regions with a high incidence of child \n        marriage; and\n            (4) effective community-based efforts to reduce and move \n        toward the elimination of child marriage as part of an \n        integrated strategy to promote girls' education and empowerment \n        will yield long-term dividends in the health and economic \n        sectors in developing countries.\n\nSEC. 5.
