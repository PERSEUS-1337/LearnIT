FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds--\n            (1) State governments have for a long time played the \n        principal role in financing America's education system and \n        historically such role has involved heavy reliance upon locally \n        administered property taxes in conjunction with State \n        prescribed per pupil spending minima, while the Federal \n        Government has been a junior partner in such role, contributing \n        approximately 7 or 8 percent of the amount spent on \n        kindergarten through twelfth grade schooling;\n            (2) the State and local role described in paragraph (1) has \n        traditionally been decentralized;\n            (3) the rapid evolution of an unusually competitive \n        international economy is altering national education needs and \n        the new strategic resource for nations has become the trained \n        intellect of its citizens;\n            (4) the United States is attempting to respond to the \n        challenge described in paragraph (3) by debating and \n        implementing education reform alternatives and setting national \n        education goals;\n            (5) education reforms may have little chance of sustained \n        success and universal achievement of the national education \n        goals may be jeopardized when such reforms are part of a \n        disparate means by which our Nation finances its schools;\n            (6) the means by which United States schools are financed \n        result in--\n                    (A) spending inequality from school-to-school, \n                district-to-district and State-to-State;\n                    (B) neglected effectiveness such as finance systems \n                paying little heed to outcomes, accountability, or \n                performance, and seldom is an education attainment \n                target posed regarding desired outcomes or performance \n                incentives;\n                    (C) organizational rigidity in which school finance \n                systems are rooted in operational units such as small \n                rural schools, as exemplified by school districts \n                having consolidated in mammoth agencies with cumbersome \n                bureaucratic structures sometimes distant \n                geographically and organizationally from the schools \n                such districts purport to direct; and\n                    (D) confusion caused by school finance system \n                accretion and as a consequence intolerable complexity;\n            (7) the entire context in which United States education now \n        operates has been altered in the last 2 decades and \n        expectations for education are higher, and on crucial \n        dimensions, the capacity of schools to respond is lower; and\n            (8) in the absence of alternative school finance mechanisms \n        with adequate and adequately structured resources, the hope of \n        national education goals, national assessments, and a host of \n        other reform alternatives are in jeopardy of foundering on good \n        intentions and rhetoric.\n\nSEC. 3.
