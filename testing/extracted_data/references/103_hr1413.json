FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) no American should be unfairly discouraged from \n        working;\n            (2) older Americans are currently severely penalized for \n        attempting to continue to work past the Federal retirement age;\n            (3) an older American that earns just $10,560 annually will \n        face an effective Federal marginal tax rate of 56 percent;\n            (4) continued American economic strength and prosperity \n        will require retaining our most experienced and dependable \n        workers;\n            (5) By eliminating the $200,000,000 administrative expense \n        spent each year by the Social Security Administration enforcing \n        the earning penalties, and encouraging more older Americans to \n        continue to work while productive, Federal revenues would be \n        increased by over $140,000,000, and a significant increase in \n        Social Security reserves would accrue as well.\n\nSEC. 3.
