CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is a shortage of qualified individuals willing to \n        adopt or foster a child in the child welfare system. As a \n        result, thousands of foster children lack a permanent and safe \n        home.\n            (2) In order to open more homes to foster children, child \n        welfare agencies should work to eliminate sexual orientation, \n        gender identity, and marital status discrimination and bias in \n        adoption and foster care recruitment, selection, and placement \n        procedures.\n            (3) Of the estimated 500,000 children in the United States \n        foster care system, over 129,000 cannot return to their \n        original families and are legally free for adoption.\n                    (A) 51,000 children were adopted in 2007, while \n                25,000 youth ``aged out'' of the foster care system.\n                    (B) Research shows that youth who ``age out'' of \n                the foster care system are at a high risk for poverty, \n                homelessness, incarceration, and early parenthood.\n                    (C) Increasing adoption rates, in addition to \n                establishing permanency and decreasing risk factors for \n                foster youth, can yield annual national cost savings \n                between $3,300,000,000 and $6,300,000,000.\n            (4) Experts agree that in many States, lesbian, gay, \n        bisexual and transgender youth experience discrimination, \n        harassment, and violence in the foster care system because of \n        their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n            (5) Approximately 60 percent of homeless lesbian, gay, \n        bisexual, and transgender youth were previously in foster care. \n        According to the Urban Justice Center, many of these young \n        people reported that living on the streets felt ``safer'' than \n        living in their group or foster home.\n            (6) According to data taken from the 2000 Census, an \n        estimated 27 percent of same-sex couples have at least 1 child \n        under 18 years of age living in the home.\n            (7) There are approximately 1,000,000 lesbian, gay, \n        bisexual, and transgender couples throughout the United States \n        who are raising approximately 2,000,000 children.\n            (8) As of 2007, gay, lesbian, and bisexual parents were \n        raising 4 percent of all adopted children and fostering for 3 \n        percent of all foster children. A report from the Evan B. \n        Donaldson Institute found that an additional 2,000,000 gay, \n        lesbian, and bisexual individuals are interested in adoption.\n            (9) According to the Urban Institute, same-sex couples \n        raising adopted children tend to be older than, just as \n        educated as, and have access to the same economic resources as \n        other adoptive parents. Studies confirm that children with \n        same-sex parents have the same advantages and same expectations \n        for health, social and psychological adjustment, and \n        development as children whose parents are heterosexual.\n            (10) An Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute study found \n        that one-third of child welfare agencies in the United States \n        currently reject gay, lesbian, and bisexual applicants.\n                    (A) The practice of prohibiting applicants from \n                becoming foster parents or adopting children solely on \n                the basis of sexual orientation or marital status has \n                resulted in reducing the number of qualified adoptive \n                and foster parents overall and denying gay, lesbian, \n                bisexual, and unmarried relatives the opportunity to \n                become foster parents for their own kin, including \n                grandchildren, or to adopt their own kin, including \n                grandchildren, from foster care.\n                    (B) Over 14,000 children are currently in \n                placements with gay, lesbian, and bisexual adoptive and \n                foster parents. If other States followed the minority \n                of States and discriminated against qualified \n                individuals because of their sexual orientation or \n                marital status, foster care expenditures would increase \n                between $87,000,000 and $130,000,000 per year in order \n                to pay for additional institutional and group care, as \n                well as to recruit and train new foster and adoptive \n                parents.\n            (11) Some States allow 1 member of a same-sex couple to \n        adopt, but do not recognize both members of the couple as the \n        child's legal parents. Recognition of joint adoption provides \n        children with the same rights and security that children of \n        heterosexual parents enjoy. These protections include access to \n        both parents' health benefits; survivor's, Social Security, and \n        child support entitlements; legal grounds for either parent to \n        provide consent for medical care, education, and other \n        important decisions; as well as the establishment of permanency \n        for both parents and child.\n            (12) Professional organizations in the fields of medicine, \n        psychology, law, and child welfare have taken official \n        positions in support of the ability of qualified gay, lesbian, \n        bisexual, and unmarried couples to foster and adopt, as \n        supported by scientific research showing sexual orientation as \n        a nondeterminative factor in parental success.\n            (13) Discrimination against potential foster or adoptive \n        parents based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or \n        marital status is not in the best interests of children in the \n        foster care system.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to decrease the length \nof time that children wait for permanency with a loving family and to \npromote the best interests of children in the child welfare system by \npreventing discrimination in adoption and foster care placements based \non sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.\n\nSEC. 3.

or\n                    (C) require different or additional screenings, \n                processes, or procedures for adoptive or foster \n                placement decisions on the basis of the sexual \n                orientation, gender identity, or marital status of the \n                prospective adoptive or foster parent, or the sexual \n                orientation or gender identity of the child involved.\n            (2) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``placement \n        decision'' means the decision to place, or to delay or deny the \n        placement of, a child in a foster care or an adoptive home, and \n        includes the decision of the agency or entity involved to seek \n        the termination of birth parent rights or otherwise make a \n        child legally available for adoptive placement.\n    (b) Equitable Relief.--Any individual who is aggrieved by an action \nin violation of subsection (a) may bring an action seeking relief in a \nUnited States district court of appropriate jurisdiction.\n    (c) Federal Guidance.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nshall publish guidance to concerned entities with respect to compliance \nwith this section.\n    (d) Technical Assistance.--In order to ensure compliance with, and \nensure understanding of the legal, practice, and culture changes \nrequired by, this Act in making foster care and adoption placement \ndecisions, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance to all \nentities covered by this Act, including--\n            (1) identifying laws and regulations inconsistent with this \n        Act and providing guidance and training to ensure the laws and \n        regulations are brought into compliance within the prescribed \n        period of time;\n            (2) identifying casework practices and procedures \n        inconsistent with this Act and providing guidance and training \n        to ensure the practices and procedures are brought into \n        compliance within the prescribed period of time;\n            (3) providing guidance in expansion of recruitment efforts \n        to ensure consideration of all interested and qualified \n        prospective adoptive and foster parents regardless of the \n        sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status of the \n        prospective parent;\n            (4) comprehensive cultural competency training for covered \n        entities and prospective adoptive and foster parents;
