    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom of Speech on Campus Act of \n1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) free speech is a fundamental right and a safeguard \n        against political and intellectual tyranny;\n            (2) curtailment of free speech strikes twice at \n        intellectual freedom, for whoever deprives a person of the \n        right to state unpopular views necessarily deprives other \n        persons of the right to listen to the views;\n            (3) the primary and traditional function of a university is \n        to disseminate knowledge and assist in the search for truth, \n        and, in order to carry out the function, to do everything \n        possible to ensure the free exchange of ideas and the fullest \n        degree of intellectual freedom;\n            (4) therefore, to carry out the function of the university, \n        every member of the university has an obligation to permit free \n        expression, and every university official has a special \n        obligation to foster freedom of speech and to ensure that the \n        speech is not obstructed, at the university; and\n            (5) unfortunately, some universities and other institutions \n        of higher education are using Federal funds to institute prior \n        restraints on speech, by taking action such as instituting \n        behavior codes and harassment policies that require \n        ``politically correct'' speech, with the effect of suppressing \n        unpopular viewpoints.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that students attending universities, \nor other institutions of higher education, that receive Federal funds \nshould be able to exercise full rights to freedom of speech on campus \nfree from official intrusion.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is \namended by inserting after section 901 (20 U.S.C. 1681) the following \nnew section:\n\n``SEC. 901A.
