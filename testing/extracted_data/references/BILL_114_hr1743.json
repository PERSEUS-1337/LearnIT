FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An integral part of the fight for abolition of slavery, \n        Harriet Tubman, was born into slavery as Araminta ``Minty'' \n        Harriet Ross in Dorchester County, Maryland, to Harriet ``Rit'' \n        Green and Ben Ross.\n            (2) Neither an exact year nor exact location of her birth \n        is known as is the case with many slaves in the United States, \n        but historians estimate her birth year to be around 1820.\n            (3) Araminta's hardships began early with the fracturing of \n        her family as three of her eight siblings were sold to distant \n        plantations in addition to enduring physical violence that \n        caused permanent injuries from: scars, seizures, headaches, and \n        narcoleptic episodes with intense dream states.\n            (4) Many historians believe that the story of Araminta's \n        mother, Rit, hiding her younger brother ``Moses'' with the aid \n        of other slaves and free blacks in the community from a Georgia \n        slave trader to be the pivotal example of resistance that would \n        drive her actions in the future.\n            (5) Furthermore, the meaning of freedom was ambiguous and \n        unsecure as Araminta's father, Ben, through an act of \n        manumission in a former owner's will was technically freed at \n        the age of 45.\n            (6) Despite Ben's freedom and the manumission stipulations \n        that applied to his wife and their children, Ben held little \n        clout to challenge the owners that chose not to free his family \n        and had no choice but to continue working for his former \n        owners.\n            (7) Around 1844, Araminta married a freedman named John \n        Tubman, took her mother's first name Harriet, and began \n        planning her escape from slavery.\n            (8) In the cover of night guided by the North Star, Harriet \n        escaped by traveling nearly 90 miles to Pennsylvania in 1849 by \n        means of the Underground Railroad, a well-organized network \n        guided by White abolitionists, freed, and enslaved Blacks.\n            (9) The following year, the U.S. Congress passed the \n        Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 that called for both ``slave'' and \n        ``free'' States' law enforcement to report runaway slaves for \n        capture.\n            (10) Nevertheless, Harriet did not yield to the growing \n        danger and risked her own newly acquired freedom to return to \n        free her family and other slaves while redirecting the \n        Underground Railroad to Canada, which prohibited slavery.\n            (11) Harriet's leadership and courage earned her the \n        nickname of ``Moses'' as she facilitated the freedom of many \n        slaves and would also encounter other historical figures such \n        as abolitionist John Brown and likely Frederick Douglass.\n            (12) During the Civil War, Harriet would have many roles \n        working for the Union Army which included using her experience \n        to act as an armed scout and spy.\n            (13) Harriet was the first woman in the Civil War to lead \n        an armed expedition, which liberated more than 700 slaves \n        during the Combahee River Raid in South Carolina earning her \n        the moniker ``General Tubman''.\n            (14) In 1859, Republican abolitionist U.S. Senator William \n        H. Seward sold Harriet a piece of land on the outskirts of \n        Auburn, New York.\n            (15) Harriet's home in Auburn would remain her haven for \n        family and friends following the war with a portion of the \n        property donated to the African Methodist Episcopal Church \n        where the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged opened in 1908.\n            (16) Harriet's efforts for equality did not cease as she \n        became an advocate to the cause of women's suffrage.\n            (17) In 1913, Harriet's death was commemorated with \n        military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York.\n            (18) In 2014, President Barack Obama signed into law the \n        National Defense Authorization Act for 2015, which included a \n        provision establishing a Harriet Tubman National Historical \n        Park.\n            (19) It is befitting that Congress bestow the highest \n        civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, to Harriet \n        ``Moses'' Tubman, posthumously in honor of her work on behalf \n        of civil rights, her selflessness, resilience to adversity, and \n        actions during the Civil War that would save the lives of \n        hundreds.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make \nappropriate arrangements for the posthumous presentation, on behalf of \nthe Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design in commemoration of \nHarriet Tubman, in recognition of her contributions and lifelong \ncommitment in the fight for freedom of enslaved men, women, and \nchildren in the United States.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation referred \nto in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in \nthis Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with suitable \nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n    (c) Award of Medal.--Following the award of the gold medal in \ncommemoration of Harriet Tubman under subsection (a), the medal shall \nbe given to the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, New \nYork, her final resting place, where it shall be available for display \nor temporary loan to be displayed elsewhere, as appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold \nmedal struck pursuant to section 3 under such regulations as the \nSecretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost \nthereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \noverhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal.\n\nSEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n    (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this Act are \nnational medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States \nCode.\n    (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of title 31, \nUnited States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be \nconsidered to be numismatic items."
