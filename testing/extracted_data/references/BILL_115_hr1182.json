FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The 2014, 2015, and 2016 Department of State reports \n        entitled, ``Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, \n        Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments'', \n        all stated that the United States has determined that ``the \n        Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the \n        INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-\n        launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 \n        km to 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such \n        missiles''.\n            (2) The 2016 report also noted that ``the cruise missile \n        developed by Russia meets the INF Treaty definition of a \n        ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 \n        km to 5,500 km, and as such, all missiles of that type, and all \n        launchers of the type used or tested to launch such a missile, \n        are prohibited under the provisions of the INF Treaty''.\n            (3) Potential consistency and compliance concerns regarding \n        the INF Treaty noncompliant GLCM have existed since 2008, were \n        not officially raised with the Russian Federation until 2013, \n        and were not briefed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        (NATO) until January 2014.\n            (4) The United States Government is aware of other \n        consistency and compliance concerns regarding Russia actions \n        vis-a-vis its INF Treaty obligations.\n            (5) Since 2013, senior United States officials, including \n        the President, the Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the \n        Joint Chiefs of Staff have raised Russian noncompliance with \n        the INF Treaty to their counterparts, but no progress has been \n        made in bringing the Russian Federation back into compliance \n        with the INF Treaty.\n            (6) In April 2014, General Breedlove, the Supreme Allied \n        Commander Europe, correctly stated, ``A weapon capability that \n        violates the INF, that is introduced into the greater European \n        land mass, is absolutely a tool that will have to be dealt with \n        . . . It can't go unanswered.''.\n            (7) The Department of Defense in its September 2013 report, \n        Report on Conventional Prompt Global Strike Options if Exempt \n        from the Restrictions of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces \n        Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of \n        Soviet Socialist Republics, stated that it has multiple \n        validated military requirement gaps due to the prohibitions \n        imposed on the United States as a result of its compliance with \n        the INF Treaty.\n            (8) It is not in the national security interests of the \n        United States to be legally prohibited from developing dual-\n        capable ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges between 500 \n        and 5,500 kilometers, while Russia makes advances in developing \n        and fielding this class of weapon systems.\n            (9) A material breach of the INF Treaty by the Russian \n        Federation affords the United States the right to invoke such \n        breach as grounds for suspending the operation of the treaty in \n        whole or in part.\n\nSEC. 4. COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT REGARDING RUSSIAN VIOLATIONS OF THE INF \n              TREATY.\n\n    (a) Statement of United States Policy.--It is the policy of the \nUnited States as follows:\n            (1) The actions undertaken by the Russian Federation in \n        violation of the INF Treaty constitute a material breach of the \n        treaty.\n            (2) In light of the Russian Federation's material breach of \n        the INF Treaty, the United States is legally entitled to \n        suspend the operation of the INF Treaty in whole or in part for \n        so long as the Russian Federation continues to be in material \n        breach.\n            (3) For so long as the Russian Federation remains in \n        noncompliance with the INF Treaty, the United States should \n        take actions to encourage the Russian Federation return to \n        compliance, including by--\n                    (A) providing additional funds for the capabilities \n                identified in section 1243(d) of the National Defense \n                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-\n                92; 129 Stat. 1062);\n                    (B) establishing a program of record pursuant to \n                section 5 for a dual-capable road-mobile ground-\n                launched cruise missile system with a maximum range of \n                5,500 kilometers; and\n                    (C) aggressively seeking additional missile defense \n                assets in the European theater to protect United States \n                and NATO forces from ground-launched missile systems of \n                the Russian Federation that are in noncompliance with \n                the INF Treaty.\n    (b) Authorization of Additional Appropriations.--\n            (1) In general.--In addition to any other amounts \n        authorized to be appropriated for such purposes, there is \n        authorized to be appropriated $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2018 \n        for--\n                    (A) the development of active defenses to counter \n                ground-launched missile systems with ranges between 500 \n                and 5,500 kilometers;\n                    (B) counterforce capabilities to prevent attacks \n                from these missiles;\n                    (C) facilitating the acquisition and transfer to \n                allied countries of missile systems with ranges between \n                500 and 5,500 kilometers; and\n                    (D) countervailing strike capabilities to enhance \n                the capabilities of the United States identified in \n                section 1243(d) of the National Defense Authorization \n                Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92; 129 Stat. \n                1062).\n            (2) Development.--Of the amount authorized to be \n        appropriated by paragraph (1), $100,000,000 is authorized to be \n        appropriated for activities undertaken to carry out section 5, \n        including with respect to research and development activities.\n            (3) Offset.--Notwithstanding the amounts otherwise \n        authorized to be appropriated for the National Nuclear Security \n        Administration for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation for fiscal \n        year 2018, such authorization of amounts is hereby reduced by \n        $500,000,000.\n\nSEC. 5.
