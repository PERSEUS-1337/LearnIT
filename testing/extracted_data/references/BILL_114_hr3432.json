DEFINITION OF ``INCOME-SHARE AGREEMENT''.\n\n    For purposes of this title, the term ``income-share agreement'' \nmeans an agreement between an individual and any other person under \nwhich the individual commits to pay a specified percentage of the \nindividual's future income, for a specified period of time, in exchange \nfor payments to or on behalf of such individual for use only for costs \nassociated with postsecondary education, as the regulations issued \npursuant to section 104(a) shall provide and which shall include the \ncosts of any items and expenses included as costs of attendance under \nsection 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087ll).\n\nSEC. 102. TAX TREATMENT OF PROCEEDS AND PAYMENTS OF FUTURE INCOME.\n\n    (a) Exclusion From Gross Income of Income-Share Agreement \nProceeds.--Payments made under an income-share agreement that complies \nwith the requirements of section 103 to or on behalf of the individual \nwho commits to pay a specified percentage of such individual's future \nincome to another person under such agreement, and any difference in \nvalue of the payments to or on behalf of such individual and the total \namount paid by such individual, shall not be includible in the gross \nincome of such individual for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986.\n    (b) Treatment of Payments of Future Income.--Payments of future \nincome received by another person under an income-share agreement that \ncomplies with the requirements of section 103 shall be treated for \npurposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986--\n            (1) first, with respect to so much of such payments as does \n        not exceed the amount of the payments to which subsection (a) \n        applies with respect to such agreement, as a repayment of \n        investment in the contract which reduces the holder's basis in \n        such agreement, and\n            (2) second, as income on the contract which is includible \n        in gross income.\n\nSEC. 103. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF INCOME-SHARE AGREEMENT CONTRACTS.\n\n    (a) Terms and Conditions.--An income-share agreement complies with \nthe requirements of this section only if the contract complies with \neach of the following conditions:\n            (1) Specified percentage of income.--The income-share \n        agreement shall specify the percentage of future income that \n        the individual subject to the agreement will be obligated to \n        pay, except that the agreement shall provide that for any year \n        covered by such agreement during which the individual has an \n        income that is less than $18,000 (as such amount is adjusted \n        pursuant to paragraph (8)) the individual shall not be required \n        to pay for such year any portion of the individual's income.\n            (2) Definition of income.--The income-share agreement shall \n        specify the definition of income to be used for purposes of \n        calculating an individual's obligation to pay under the \n        agreement.\n            (3) Annual limitation on obligation.--The percentage of \n        income required under the income-share agreement to be paid by \n        the individual subject to the agreement may not exceed a \n        percentage such that, when multiplied by $15,000 (as such \n        amount is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (8)), the product \n        exceeds the aggregate amount of periodic payments of principal \n        and interest that would be required to be paid during a 12-\n        month period under a comparable loan that bears interest at a \n        fixed annual rate of 20 percent.\n            (4) Aggregate limitation on obligation.--The income-share \n        agreement may not provide for the individual subject to the \n        agreement to pay under the agreement an amount of the future \n        income of such individual that, when added to any other amounts \n        of future income that such individual has agreed to pay under \n        any other income-share agreements to which such individual is \n        subject, equals a sum that at any time exceeds 15 percent of \n        the future income of such individual.\n            (5) Time-based limitation on obligation.--\n                    (A) Limitation.--The income-share agreement may not \n                provide for the individual subject to the agreement to \n                assume a commitment to pay future income having a \n                commitment factor, that when added to the commitment \n                factors for any other income-share agreements to which \n                such individual is subject, equals a sum that exceeds \n                the maximum commitment factor.\n                    (B) Commitment factor.--As used in this paragraph, \n                the term ``commitment factor'' means, with respect to \n                an income-share agreement, the product of--\n                            (i) the percentage (expressed as a decimal) \n                        of such future income required to be paid \n                        during such period;

and\n                    (B) will vary in proportion to the individual's \n                future income;\n            (2) that the obligations of the individual under the \n        agreement are not dischargeable under bankruptcy law, except in \n        a case that would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and \n        the debtor's dependents;\n            (3) whether the obligations of the individual under the \n        agreement may be extinguished by accelerating payments, and, if \n        so, under what terms;\n            (4) the duration of the individual's obligations under the \n        agreement (absent such accelerating payments), including any \n        circumstances under which the duration of the agreement would \n        be extended;\n            (5) the percentage of income the individual is committing \n        to pay under the agreement and the minimum amount of annual \n        income that, pursuant to subsection (b)(1), triggers the \n        individual's obligation under the agreement to make payments \n        for such year;\n            (6) the definition of income to be used for purposes of \n        calculating the individual's obligation under the agreement;
