FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Cancer Institute estimates that \n        approximately 13.7 million Americans with a history of cancer \n        were alive on January 1, 2012.\n            (2) About 8 million of the 13.7 million Americans living \n        with cancer are over age 65, and approximately half of cancer \n        care spending is associated with Medicare beneficiaries.\n            (3) National spending on cancer care in 2010 is estimated \n        at $125 billion.\n            (4) In 2011, the National Cancer Institute released \n        projections of the cost of cancer care in the United States, \n        finding the total cost of cancer care in 2020 is expected to be \n        $206 billion.\n            (5) In a 2010 study, Milliman reported that in 2007 a \n        cancer patient receiving chemotherapy incurred average costs of \n        approximately $111,000, three times the cost of a coronary \n        artery disease patient, and six times the cost of a diabetes \n        patient.\n            (6) Over the last several years, the United States has been \n        touted as world leader in providing high-quality cancer care.\n            (7) United States cancer survival rates are higher than the \n        average in Europe and Canada for 13 of 16 types of cancer.\n            (8) Until recently, over 80 percent of United States cancer \n        patients received care in the community setting.\n            (9) Over the past several years, the country has \n        experienced a significant shift of outpatient cancer care \n        delivery from the physician's office to the hospital outpatient \n        department.\n            (10) Reports show that over the past six years, 43 \n        community practices have started referring all of their \n        patients elsewhere for treatment, 288 oncology office locations \n        have closed, 131 practices have merged or were acquired by a \n        corporate entity other than a hospital, and 469 oncology groups \n        have entered into an employment or professional services \n        agreement with a hospital.\n            (11) Over 1,000 clinics or practices have been impacted \n        over the last 3 years out of a population of only 6,000 \n        oncologists in community practice in the United States.\n            (12) A 2013 study published by The Moran Company (``Moran \n        study'') found that, between 2005 and 2011, there was a 150 \n        percent increase in administered chemotherapy in the hospital \n        outpatient setting for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries \n        (increasing from 13.5 percent in 2005 to 33.0 percent in 2011) \n        as compared to administration in physician community cancer \n        clinics.\n            (13) The Moran study found that, in 2005, almost 87 percent \n        of Medicare patients were receiving their care in the community \n        setting, by 2011 only 67 percent were utilizing the community \n        setting.\n            (14) The Moran study reports that Medicare payments for \n        chemotherapy administered in hospital outpatient settings have \n        more than tripled since 2005 (from $90 million to $300 million) \n        while payments to physician community cancer clinics have \n        actually decreased by 14.5 percent.\n            (15) The Medicare physician fee schedule rate in 2012 for \n        CPT Code 96413 (Chemo, iv infusion, 1 hr), the most common drug \n        administration code billed by oncology practices, is $139 but \n        the payment rate for the same service under the Medicare \n        hospital outpatient prospective payment system (HOPPS) fee \n        schedule in 2012 is 50 percent higher at $208.\n            (16) Utilization-weighted Medicare payment for infusion \n        services is approximately 55 percent higher at the hospital \n        outpatient department than in a physician's office.\n            (17) Medicare proposed in 2012 to pay hospital outpatient \n        departments 25 percent more for radiation therapy services than \n        for the same services performed in physicians' offices, \n        including a 70 percent differential for intensity modulated \n        radiation treatment (IMRT) and a 188 percent differential for \n        stereotactic body radiation therapy delivery (SBRT).\n            (18) One third of hospitals in the United States purchase \n        chemotherapy drugs through the section 340B program at a \n        discount of up to 50 percent, resulting in a net cost to such \n        hospitals that typically is at least 30 percent below \n        reimbursement rate (which is based on 106 percent of the \n        average sales price) for community oncologists for such drugs.\n            (19) Medicare reimburses 70 percent of hospital bad debt \n        (uncollectable coinsurance).\n            (20) According to an October 2011 Milliman study, the cost \n        of treating cancer patients is significantly lower for both \n        Medicare patients (10 percent lower in copayment amounts, more \n        than $650 savings a year) and the Medicare program (14.2 \n        percent less, a savings of $6,500 a year per patient) when \n        provided in community-based cancer settings as compared to the \n        same treatment in hospital outpatient departments.\n            (21) The April 1, 2013, sequestration cuts to Medicare \n        allowed for a 28 percent cut to the services reimbursement in \n        Medicare part B drugs to community oncologists.\n            (22) A recent Community Oncology Alliance survey showed \n        that 69 percent of practices surveyed reported that patient \n        treatment or operational changes already have been made due to \n        the sequester cut to cancer drugs, with 49 percent of practices \n        forced to send Medicare patients elsewhere for treatment, and \n        62 percent of practices reported that they will be forced to \n        send Medicare patients elsewhere for treatment if the \n        sequestration cuts stay in place through July 31, 2013.\n            (23) The June 2013 report of the Medicare Payment Advisory \n        Commission highlighted the large disparities in payment in \n        outpatient settings and noted that the payment variations \n        across settings should be addressed quickly due to the fact \n        that current disparities have created incentives for hospitals \n        to buy physician practices, driving up costs for the Medicare \n        program and for beneficiaries.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, to ensure \nthe future of community cancer care, Medicare reimbursement should be \nequal for the same service provided to a cancer patient regardless of \nwhether the service is delivered in the hospital outpatient department \nor physician's office.\n\nSEC. 3.
