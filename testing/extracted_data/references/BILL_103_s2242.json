FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An appropriate scientific understanding of the diverse \n        physical, biological, engineering, social, and economic issues \n        that underlie the environmental problems facing the United \n        States is essential to finding environmentally and economically \n        sound solutions to the problems.\n            (2) While more than a dozen Federal agencies support \n        environmental research and gather environmental information, \n        there is not a lead Federal agency for environmental research \n        and information.\n            (3) The current approach of the Federal Government to \n        developing a scientific understanding of environmental \n        problems, and of applying that understanding to the problems, \n        lacks coherence and often fails to provide information vital to \n        finding sound solutions to the problems.\n            (4) The United States needs to improve the scientific basis \n        for decisionmaking by Federal, State, and local governments, \n        and private sector entities, on environmental issues.\n            (5) Many environmental issues that will seriously affect \n        the United States in the future are not adequately studied \n        under existing Federal environmental research programs.\n            (6) Existing Federal environmental research programs often \n        do not provide adequate information in a timely manner to \n        enable Federal, State, and local governments, and private \n        sector entities, to engage in well-informed decisionmaking on \n        environmental and related issues.\n            (7) Existing Federal environmental research programs do not \n        adequately address, link, and integrate research in different \n        disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and multidisciplinary \n        environmental sciences.\n            (8) Ongoing study and communication of the existing \n        knowledge about environmental issues, including the assessment \n        of the significance of the knowledge, are needed to strengthen \n        the weak link between scientific knowledge and decisionmaking \n        on environmental issues.\n            (9) Easy and effective access, including access by the \n        scientific community, to the many rapidly growing sources of \n        environmental information would improve the effectiveness of \n        research on, and communication about, environmental issues.\n            (10) To address the complex environmental problems facing \n        the United States, there is a growing need for more education \n        and training of individuals in disciplinary, interdisciplinary, \n        and multidisciplinary sciences related to the environment.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create an \nindependent establishment to improve the scientific basis for making \ndecisions on environmental issues through support for competitive, \npeer-reviewed, extramural research, ongoing knowledge assessments, data \nand information activities, and education and training on environmental \nissues.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n    There is established as an independent establishment an institute \nto be known as the ``National Institute for the Environment'' (referred \nto in this Act as the ``Institute''). The mission of the Institute \nshall be to improve the scientific basis for decisionmaking on \nenvironmental issues.\n\nSEC. 4.
