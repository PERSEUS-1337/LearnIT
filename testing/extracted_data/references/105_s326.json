ABANDONED MINERALS MINE RECLAMATION FUND.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) There is established on the books of the Treasury of \n        the United States an interest-bearing fund to be known as the \n        Abandoned Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund (hereafter referred to \n        in this section as the ``Fund''). The Fund shall be \n        administered by the Secretary.\n            (2) The Secretary shall notify the Secretary of the \n        Treasury as to what portion of the Fund is not, in his \n        judgment, required to meet current withdrawals.
