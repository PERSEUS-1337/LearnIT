FINDINGS.\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) The Central Bank of Venezuela and the National Statistical \n    Institute of Venezuela stated that the annual inflation rate in \n    Venezuela in 2013 was 56.30, the highest level of inflation in the \n    Western Hemisphere and the third highest level of inflation in the \n    world behind South Sudan and Syria.\n        (2) The Central Bank of Venezuela and the Government of \n    Venezuela have imposed a series of currency controls that has \n    exacerbated economic problems and, according to the World Economic \n    Forum, has become the most problematic factor for doing business in \n    Venezuela.\n        (3) The Central Bank of Venezuela declared that the scarcity \n    index of Venezuela reached 29.4 percent in March 2014, which \n    signifies that fewer than one in 4 basic goods is unavailable at \n    any given time. The Central Bank has not released any information \n    on the scarcity index since that time.\n        (4) Since 1999, violent crime in Venezuela has risen sharply \n    and the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, an independent \n    nongovernmental organization, found the national per capita murder \n    rate to be 79 per 100,000 people in 2013.\n        (5) The international nongovernmental organization Human Rights \n    Watch recently stated, ``Under the leadership of President Chavez \n    and now President Maduro, the accumulation of power in the \n    executive branch and the erosion of human rights guarantees have \n    enabled the government to intimidate, censor, and prosecute its \n    critics.''.\n        (6) The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013 of \n    the Department of State maintained that in Venezuela ``the \n    government did not respect judicial independence or permit judges \n    to act according to the law without fear of retaliation'' and ``the \n    government used the judiciary to intimidate and selectively \n    prosecute political, union, business, and civil society leaders who \n    were critical of government policies or actions''.\n        (7) The Government of Venezuela has detained foreign \n    journalists and threatened and expelled international media outlets \n    operating in Venezuela, and the international nongovernmental \n    organization Freedom House declared that Venezuela's ``media \n    climate is permeated by intimidation, sometimes including physical \n    attacks, and strong antimedia rhetoric by the government is \n    common''.\n        (8) Since February 4, 2014, the Government of Venezuela has \n    responded to antigovernment protests with violence and killings \n    perpetrated by its public security forces.\n        (9) In May 2014, Human Rights Watch found that the unlawful use \n    of force perpetrated against antigovernment protesters was ``part \n    of a systematic practice by the Venezuelan security forces''.\n        (10) As of September 1, 2014, 41 people had been killed, \n    approximately 3,000 had been arrested unjustly, and more than 150 \n    remained in prison and faced criminal charges as a result of \n    antigovernment demonstrations throughout Venezuela.\n        (11) Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was arrested on February \n    18, 2014, in relation to the protests and was unjustly charged with \n    criminal incitement, conspiracy, arson, and property damage. Since \n    his arrest, Lopez has been held in solitary confinement and has \n    been denied 58 out of 60 of his proposed witnesses at his ongoing \n    trial.\n        (12) As of September 1, 2014, not a single member of the public \n    security forces of the Government of Venezuela had been held \n    accountable for acts of violence perpetrated against antigovernment \n    protesters.\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ANTIGOVERNMENT PROTESTS IN \nVENEZUELA AND THE NEED TO PREVENT FURTHER VIOLENCE IN VENEZUELA.\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n        (1) the United States aspires to a mutually beneficial \n    relationship with Venezuela based on respect for human rights and \n    the rule of law and a functional and productive relationship on \n    issues of public security, including counternarcotics and \n    counterterrorism;\n        (2) the United States supports the people of Venezuela in their \n    efforts to realize their full economic potential and to advance \n    representative democracy, human rights, and the rule of law within \n    their country;\n        (3) the chronic mismanagement by the Government of Venezuela of \n    its economy has produced conditions of economic hardship and \n    scarcity of basic goods and foodstuffs for the people of Venezuela;\n        (4) the failure of the Government of Venezuela to guarantee \n    minimal standards of public security for its citizens has led the \n    country to become one of the most violent and corrupt in the world;\n        (5) the Government of Venezuela continues to take steps to \n    remove checks and balances on the executive, politicize the \n    judiciary, undermine the independence of the legislature through \n    use of executive decree powers, persecute and prosecute its \n    political opponents, curtail freedom of the press, and limit the \n    free expression of its citizens;\n        (6) Venezuelans, responding to ongoing economic hardship, high \n    levels of crime and violence, and the lack of basic political \n    rights and individual freedoms, have turned out in demonstrations \n    in Caracas and throughout the country to protest the failure of the \n    Government of Venezuela to protect the political and economic well-\n    being of its citizens; and\n        (7) the repeated use of violence perpetrated by the National \n    Guard and security personnel of Venezuela, as well as persons \n    acting on behalf of the Government of Venezuela, against \n    antigovernment protesters that began on February 4, 2014, is \n    intolerable and the use of unprovoked violence by protesters is \n    also a matter of serious concern.\nSEC. 4. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD VENEZUELA.\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n        (1) to support the people of Venezuela in their aspiration to \n    live under conditions of peace and representative democracy as \n    defined by the Inter-American Democratic Charter of the \n    Organization of American States;\n        (2) to work in concert with the other member states within the \n    Organization of American States, as well as the countries of the \n    European Union, to ensure the peaceful resolution of the current \n    situation in Venezuela and the immediate cessation of violence \n    against antigovernment protestors;\n        (3) to hold accountable government and security officials in \n    Venezuela responsible for or complicit in the use of force in \n    relation to antigovernment protests and similar future acts of \n    violence; and\n        (4) to continue to support the development of democratic \n    political processes and independent civil society in Venezuela.\nSEC. 5.

or\n        (3) has knowingly materially assisted, sponsored, or provided \n    significant financial, material, or technological support for, or \n    goods or services in support of, the commission of acts described \n    in paragraph (1) or (2).\n    (b) Sanctions Described.--\n        (1) In general.--The sanctions described in this subsection are \n    the following:\n            (A) Asset blocking.--The exercise of all powers granted to \n        the President by the International Emergency Economic Powers \n        Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to the extent necessary to block \n        and prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in \n        property of a person determined by the President to be subject \n        to subsection (a) if such property and interests in property \n        are in the United States, come within the United States, or are \n        or come within the possession or control of a United States \n        person.\n            (B) Exclusion from the united states and revocation of visa \n        or other documentation.--In the case of an alien determined by \n        the President to be subject to subsection (a), denial of a visa \n        to, and exclusion from the United States of, the alien, and \n        revocation in accordance with section 221(i) of the Immigration \n        and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1201(i)), of any visa or other \n        documentation of the alien.\n        (2) Penalties.--A person that violates, attempts to violate, \n    conspires to violate, or causes a violation of paragraph (1)(A) or \n    any regulation, license, or order issued to carry out paragraph \n    (1)(A) shall be subject to the penalties set forth in subsections \n    (b) and (c) of section 206 of the International Emergency Economic \n    Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1705) to the same extent as a person that \n    commits an unlawful act described in subsection (a) of that \n    section.\n        (3) Exception relating to importation of goods.--The \n    requirement to block and prohibit all transactions in all property \n    and interests in property under paragraph (1)(A) shall not include \n    the authority to impose sanctions on the importation of goods.\n        (4) Exception to comply with united nations headquarters \n    agreement.--Sanctions under paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply to an \n    alien if admitting the alien into the United States is necessary to \n    permit the United States to comply with the Agreement regarding the \n    Headquarters of the United Nations, signed at Lake Success June 26, \n    1947, and entered into force November 21, 1947, between the United \n    Nations and the United States, or other applicable international \n    obligations.\n    (c) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of sanctions \nunder subsection (b) with respect to a person if the President--\n        (1) determines that such a waiver is in the national interest \n    of the United States;
