FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) Crime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, is \n        a pervasive, nationwide problem.\n            (2) Problems with crime at the local level are exacerbated \n        by the interstate movement of drugs, funds, and criminal gangs.\n            (3) Firearms and ammunition, and handguns in particular, \n        move easily in interstate commerce, as documented in numerous \n        hearings in both the Judiciary Committee of the House of \n        Representatives and Judiciary Committee of the Senate.\n            (4) In fact, even before the sale of a handgun, the gun, \n        its component parts, ammunition, and the raw materials from \n        which they are made have considerably moved in interstate \n        commerce.\n            (5) While criminals freely move from State to State, \n        ordinary citizens may fear to travel to or through certain \n        parts of the country due to the concern that violent crime is \n        not under control, and foreigners may decline to travel in the \n        United States for the same reason.\n            (6) Just as the hardened drug kingpins begin their life in \n        the illicit drug culture by exposure to drugs at a young age, \n        violent criminals often start their criminal careers on streets \n        where the ready availability of guns to young people results in \n        the acceptability of their random use.\n            (7) Violent crime and the use of illicit drugs go hand-in-\n        hand, and attempts to control one without controlling the other \n        may be fruitless.\n            (8) Individual States and localities find it impossible to \n        handle the problem by themselves; even States and localities \n        that have made a strong effort to prevent, detect, and punish \n        crime find their effort unavailing due in part to the failure \n        or inability of other States and localities to take strong \n        measures.\n            (9) Inasmuch as illicit drug activity and related violent \n        crime overflow State lines and national boundaries, the \n        Congress has power, under the interstate commerce clause and \n        other provisions of the Constitution, to enact measures to \n        combat these problems.\n            (10) The Congress finds that it is necessary and \n        appropriate to assist the States in controlling crime by \n        stopping the commerce in handguns with juveniles nationwide, \n        and allowing the possession of handguns by juveniles only when \n        handguns are possessed and used for legitimate purposes under \n        appropriate conditions.\n\nSEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF THE POSSESSION OF A HANDGUN OR AMMUNITION BY, OR \n              THE PRIVATE TRANSFER OF A HANDGUN OR AMMUNITION TO, A \n              JUVENILE.\n\n    (a) Definition.--Section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(29) The term `handgun' means--\n            ``(A) a firearm that has a short stock and is designed to \n        be held and fired by the use of a single hand;
