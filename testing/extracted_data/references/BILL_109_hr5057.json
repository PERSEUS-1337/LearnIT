COMMEMORATIVE WORK TO HONOR BRIGADIER GENERAL FRANCIS MARION \n              AND HIS FAMILY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n            (1) Francis Marion was born in 1732 in St. John's Parish, \n        Berkeley County, South Carolina. He married Mary Esther Videau \n        on April 20th, 1786. Francis and Mary Esther Marion had no \n        children, but raised a son of a relative as their own, and gave \n        the child Francis Marion's name.\n            (2) Brigadier General Marion commanded the Williamsburg \n        Militia Revolutionary force in South Carolina and was \n        instrumental in delaying the advance of British forces by \n        leading his troops in disrupting supply lines.\n            (3) Brigadier General Marion's tactics, which were unheard \n        of in rules of warfare at the time, included lightning raids on \n        British convoys, after which he and his forces would retreat \n        into the swamps to avoid capture. British Lieutenant Colonel \n        Tarleton stated that ``as for this damned old swamp fox, the \n        devil himself could not catch him''. Thus, the legend of the \n        ``Swamp Fox'' was born.\n            (4) His victory at the Battle of Eutaw Springs in September \n        of 1781 was officially recognized by Congress.\n            (5) Brigadier General Marion's troops are believed to be \n        the first racially integrated force fighting for the United \n        States, as his band was a mix of Whites, Blacks, both free and \n        slave, and Native Americans.\n            (6) As a statesman, he represented his parish in the South \n        Carolina senate as well as his State at the Constitutional \n        Convention.\n            (7) Although the Congress has authorized the establishment \n        of commemorative works on Federal lands in the District of \n        Columbia honoring such celebrated Americans as George \n        Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, the National \n        Capital has no comparable memorial to Brigadier General Francis \n        Marion for his bravery and leadership during the Revolutionary \n        War, without which the United States would not exist.\n            (8) Brigadier General Marion's legacy must live on. At \n        present, and since 1878, United States Reservation 18 has been \n        officially referred to as Marion Park. Located between 4th and \n        6th Streets, S.E., at the intersection of E Street and South \n        Carolina Avenue, S.E., in Washington, DC, the park lacks a \n        formal commemoration to this South Carolina hero who was \n        important to the initiation of the Nation's heritage.\n            (9) The time has come to correct this oversight so that \n        future generations of Americans will know and understand the \n        preeminent historical and lasting significance to the Nation of \n        Brigadier General Marion's contributions. Such a South Carolina \n        hero deserves to be given the proper recognition.\n    (b) Authority to Establish Commemorative Work.--The Marion Park \nProject, a committee of the Palmetto Conservation Foundation, may \nestablish a commemorative work on Federal land in the District of \nColumbia and its environs to honor Brigadier General Francis Marion and \nhis service.\n    (c) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The \ncommemorative work authorized by subsection (b) shall be established in \naccordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code (commonly \nknown as the Commemorative Works Act).\n    (d) Use of Federal Funds Prohibited.--Federal funds may not be used \nto pay any expense of the establishment of the commemorative work \nauthorized by subsection (b). The Marion Park Project, a committee of \nthe Palmetto Conservation Foundation, shall be solely responsible for \nacceptance of contributions for, and payment of the expenses of, the \nestablishment of that commemorative work.\n    (e) Deposit of Excess Funds.--If, upon payment of all expenses of \nthe establishment of the commemorative work authorized by subsection \n(b) (including the maintenance and preservation amount provided for in \nsection 8906(b) of title 40, United States Code), or upon expiration of \nthe authority for the commemorative work under chapter 89 of title 40, \nUnited States Code, there remains a balance of funds received for the \nestablishment of that commemorative work, the Marion Park Project, a \ncommittee of the Palmetto Conservation Foundation, shall transmit the \namount of the balance to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in \nthe account provided for in section 8906(b)(1) of such title.\n    (f) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the terms \n``commemorative work'' and ``the District of\nColumbia and its environs'' have the meanings given to such terms in \nsection 8902(a) of title 40, United States Code.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives July 24, 2006.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,\n\n                                                                 Clerk."
