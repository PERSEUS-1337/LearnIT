This Act recognizes the need \nto continue such management actions so long as such management actions \nare conducted in accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et \nseq.) and existing inter-agency agreements.\n    (j) Maintenance of Existing Communications Facilities.--The \nprovisions of the Wilderness Act shall not be construed to prevent--\n            (1) the maintenance of communications facilities, in \n        existence on the date of the enactment of this Act and located \n        in a covered wilderness area; or\n            (2) limited motorized access to such facilities when \n        nonmotorized access means are not reasonably available or when \n        time is of the essence, subject to such conditions as the \n        Secretary of Agriculture considers to be desirable."
