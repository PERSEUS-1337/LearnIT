The assessments for the other harbors shall be initiated by January 1, 2020.\n(3) The assessment shall consider, but not be limited to, data from available United States Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Systems, relevant incident and accident data, any relevant simulation models, and identification of any transit areas where risks are higher.\n(4) The assessment shall consider the condition of tank and nontank vessels calling on harbors, including the United States Coast Guard\u2019s marine inspection program and port state control program regarding risks due to a vessel\u2019s hull or engineering material deficiencies, or inadequate crew training and professionalism.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 8670.13.3 is added to the Government Code, to read:\n8670.13.3.\nIf dispersants are used in response to an oil spill in state waters, the administrator shall provide written notification of their use to the Legislature within three days of the use. The administrator shall provide the Legislature with written justification of their use, including copies of key supporting documentation used by the federal on-scene coordinator and the federal Regional Response Team as soon as those material are released. Within two months of the use of dispersants in state waters, the administrator shall also provide a report to the Legislature on the effectiveness of the dispersants used, including, but not limited to, results of any available monitoring data to determine whether the dispersant use resulted in overall environmental benefit or harm. The written notification, justification, and report shall be submitted pursuant to Section 9795.\nSEC. 5.\nSection 8670.28 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n8670.28.\n(a) The administrator, taking into consideration the facility or vessel contingency plan requirements of the State Lands Commission, the Office of the State Fire Marshal, the California Coastal Commission, and other state and federal agencies, shall adopt and implement regulations governing the adequacy of oil spill contingency plans to be prepared and implemented under this article. All regulations shall be developed in consultation with the Oil Spill Technical Advisory Committee, and shall be consistent with the California oil spill contingency plan and not in conflict with the National Contingency Plan. The regulations shall provide for the best achievable protection of waters and natural resources of the state. The regulations shall permit the development, application, and use of an oil spill contingency plan for similar vessels, pipelines, terminals, and facilities within a single company or organization, and across companies and organizations. The regulations shall, at a minimum, ensure all of the following:\n(1) All areas of state waters are at all times protected by prevention, response, containment, and cleanup equipment and operations.\n(2) Standards set for response, containment, and cleanup equipment and operations are maintained and regularly improved to protect the resources of the state.\n(3) All appropriate personnel employed by operators required to have a contingency plan receive training in oil spill response and cleanup equipment usage and operations.\n(4) Each oil spill contingency plan provides for appropriate financial or contractual arrangements for all necessary equipment and services for the response, containment, and cleanup of a reasonable worst case oil spill scenario for each area the plan addresses.\n(5) Each oil spill contingency plan demonstrates that all protection measures are being taken to reduce the possibility of an oil spill occurring as a result of the operation of the facility or vessel. The protection measures shall include, but not be limited to, response to disabled vessels and an identification of those measures taken to comply with requirements of Division 7.8 (commencing with Section 8750) of the Public Resources Code.\n(6) Each oil spill contingency plan identifies the types of equipment that can be used, the location of the equipment, and the time taken to deliver the equipment.\n(7) Each facility, as determined by the administrator, conducts a hazard and operability study to identify the hazards associated with the operation of the facility, including the use of the facility by vessels, due to operating error, equipment failure, and external events.
