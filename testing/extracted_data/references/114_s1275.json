PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to encourage widespread deployment of \nenergy efficiency and onsite renewable energy technologies in \nmanufacturing and industrial facilities throughout the United States \nthrough the establishment of a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing \nProgram that would--\n            (1) encourage the widespread availability of financial \n        products and programs with attractive rates and terms that \n        significantly reduce or eliminate upfront expenses to allow \n        manufacturing and industrial businesses to invest in energy \n        efficiency measures, onsite clean and renewable energy systems, \n        smart grid systems, and alternative vehicle fleets by providing \n        credit support, credit enhancement, secondary markets, and \n        other support to originators of the financial products and \n        sponsors of the financing programs; and\n            (2) help building owners to invest in measures and systems \n        that reduce energy costs, in many cases creating a net cost \n        savings that can be realized in the short-term, and may also \n        allow manufacturing and industrial business owners to defer \n        capital expenditures, save money to hire new workers, and \n        increase the value, comfort, and sustainability of the property \n        of the owners.\n\nSEC. 3.
