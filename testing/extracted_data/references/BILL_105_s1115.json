FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) unintentional damage to underground facilities during \n        excavation is a significant cause of disruptions in \n        telecommunications, water supply, electric power and other \n        vital public services, such as hospital and air traffic control \n        operations, and is a leading cause of natural gas and hazardous \n        liquid pipeline accidents;\n            (2) excavation that is performed without prior notification \n        to an underground facility operator or with inaccurate marking \n        of such a facility prior to excavation can cause damage that \n        results in fatalities, serious injuries, harm to the \n        environment and disruption of vital services to the public; and\n            (3) protection of the public and the environment from the \n        consequences of underground facility damage caused by \n        excavations will be enhanced by a coordinated national effort \n        to improve one-call notification programs in each State and the \n        effectiveness and efficiency of one-call notification systems \n        that operate under such programs.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ONE-CALL PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle III of title 49, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n\n                              ``CHAPTER 61--ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION \n                                        PROGRAM\n``Sec.\n``6101.
