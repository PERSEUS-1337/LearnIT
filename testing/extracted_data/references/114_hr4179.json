FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On May 9, 2013, President Barack Obama issued an \n        Executive order that made open and machine-readable data the \n        new default for Government information.\n            (2) Open data principles are essential for transparency and \n        efficiency in government.\n            (3) In 2012, the Federal Communications Commission required \n        television stations to place on the Internet website of the \n        Commission certain materials in the files such stations are \n        required to maintain and make available for public inspection, \n        including important information about the purchasing of \n        political advertisements.\n            (4) The Commission declined to require such materials to be \n        machine-readable, deciding at the time that it was more \n        important to get the information online faster.\n            (5) Machine readability is a critical component of open \n        government and provides interested parties with the necessary \n        access to evaluate data in a more comprehensive way.\n\nSEC. 3.
