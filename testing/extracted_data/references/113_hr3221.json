FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One in 6 people in the United States lives with a \n        neurological disease or condition that can often result in \n        disability, and which may require the individual to seek \n        assistance in carrying out the activities of daily living. \n        Neurological diseases or conditions such as multiple sclerosis \n        (MS), early-onset Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain \n        injury (TBI) can also typically affect younger adults in the \n        middle of their lives.\n            (2) Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling \n        disease that attacks the central nervous system with symptoms \n        ranging from numbness in limbs to paralysis and loss of vision. \n        Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 \n        years of age. MS is a leading cause of disability in young \n        adults. Persons living with MS who experience more severe forms \n        of the disease are likely to require either home care or \n        nursing home placement, though the vast majority would prefer \n        to remain at home to receive the care they need. Where home \n        care is concerned, approximately 80 percent of such care is \n        provided by informal, unpaid caregivers who are generally \n        family members.\n            (3) Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive \n        neurological disease. The four primary symptoms of Parkinson's \n        disease are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, and \n        face; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; \n        bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural \n        instability, or impaired balance and coordination. Other \n        symptoms may include cognitive changes; difficulty in \n        swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or \n        constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions. As these \n        symptoms become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty \n        walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks. It is \n        estimated that nearly 500,000 to 1,500,000 people live with \n        Parkinson's and of those 5 to 10 percent are diagnosed younger \n        than 60 and deemed ``early-onset''.\n            (4) Traumatic brain injury is a neurological condition that \n        typically results from a blow or jolt to the head or a \n        penetrating head injury and that can impact one or more parts \n        of the brain, thereby temporarily or permanently disrupting \n        normal brain function. The Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention estimates that 1,400,000 TBIs occur annually, \n        resulting in disabilities affecting up to 90,000 people among a \n        broad range of age groups. Traumatic brain injury is also a \n        serious issue that affects military servicemembers. Estimates \n        in prior military conflicts indicate that TBI was present in \n        14-20 percent of surviving casualties.\n            (5) Family caregivers are a crucial source of support and \n        assistance for individuals suffering with disabilities. Family \n        caregivers, the majority of whom are women, provide an \n        estimated $450,000,000,000 in ``free'' services annually. The \n        current pool of potential family caregivers is dwindling, from \n        11 potential caregivers for each person needing care today to a \n        projected 4 to 1 ratio by 2050.\n            (6) Recent studies indicate that the total estimated cost \n        to employers for full-time employees with intensive caregiving \n        responsibilities is $17,100,000,000. The total estimated cost \n        to employers for all full-time, employed caregivers is \n        $33,600,000,000 annually.\n            (7) Currently more than half of care recipients (56 \n        percent) are under age 75, and almost one-third (28 percent) \n        are under age 50 reflecting the need to offer age-appropriate \n        services.\n            (8) Adult day programs can offer services, including \n        medical care, rehabilitation therapies, dignified assistance \n        with the activities of daily living, nutrition therapy, health \n        monitoring, social interaction, stimulating activities, and \n        transportation to seniors, people with disabilities, and \n        younger adults with chronic diseases.\n            (9) Adult day programs geared toward people living with \n        neurological diseases or conditions such as MS, Parkinson's \n        disease, TBI, or other similar diseases or conditions provide \n        an important response to the needs of people living with these \n        conditions and their caregivers. Adult day programs can help to \n        ameliorate symptoms, reduce dependency, provide important \n        socialization opportunities, and maintain quality of life.\n            (10) Adult day programs have been shown to provide a range \n        of documented benefits including improvements in functional \n        status, social support, and reductions in fatigue, depression \n        and pain. Adult day programs also reduce ongoing medical care \n        and hospital costs and decrease admissions to nursing home \n        facilities, which can be costly for many families, by allowing \n        individuals to receive health and social services while \n        continuing to live at home.\n            (11) There are currently few adult day programs focused on \n        younger adult populations in the United States. Although young \n        people living with neurological diseases or conditions may be \n        able to access existing adult day programs, such programs are \n        not typically intended for younger adults living with chronic \n        diseases or conditions, and may not provide the appropriate \n        services to meet the age-related or disability status of these \n        individuals.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADULT DAY PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Survey of Existing Adult Day Programs.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this section, the Assistant Secretary for \n        Aging shall initiate a comprehensive survey of current adult \n        day programs that provide care and support to individuals \n        including young adults living with neurological diseases or \n        conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, \n        traumatic brain injury, or any similar disease or condition.\n            (2) Survey elements.--In carrying out the survey under \n        paragraph (1), the Assistant Secretary for Aging may utilize \n        existing publicly available research on adult day programs, and \n        shall--\n                    (A) identify ongoing successful adult day programs, \n                including by providing a brief description of how such \n                programs were initially established and funded;\n                    (B) identify which adult day programs are serving \n                young adults living with neurological diseases or \n                conditions;\n                    (C) develop a set of best practices to help guide \n                the establishment and replication of additional \n                successful adult day programs, including--\n                            (i) program guidelines;\n                            (ii) recommendations on the scope of \n                        services that should be provided to individuals \n                        with neurological diseases or conditions \n                        including young adults (which may include \n                        rehabilitation therapy, psychosocial support, \n                        social stimulation and interaction, and \n                        spiritual, educational, or other such \n                        services); and\n                            (iii) performance goals and indicators to \n                        measure and analyze the outcomes generated by \n                        the services provided and to evaluate the \n                        overall success of the program; and\n                    (D) evaluate the extent to which the Administration \n                for Community Living supports adult day programs, \n                either directly or indirectly, through current Federal \n                grant programs.\n            (3) Report.--Not later than 180 days after initiating the \n        survey under paragraph (1), the Assistant Secretary for Aging \n        shall produce and make publicly available a summary report on \n        the results of the survey. Such report shall include each of \n        the elements described in paragraph (2).\n    (b) Establishment of Grant Program.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after producing the \n        report required by subsection (a)(3), the Assistant Secretary \n        for Aging shall establish within the Administration for \n        Community Living a competitive grant program for awarding \n        grants annually to eligible entities, based on the best \n        practices developed under subsection (a), to fund adult day \n        programs serving younger people with neurological diseases or \n        conditions.\n            (2) Eligible entities.--In order to be eligible for a grant \n        under this subsection, an entity shall demonstrate the \n        following:\n                    (A) Understanding of the special needs of younger \n                people living with neurological diseases or conditions \n                such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, \n                traumatic brain injury, or other similar diseases or \n                conditions, including their functional abilities and \n                the potential complications across all types of cases \n                and stages of such diseases or conditions.\n                    (B) Understanding of the issues experienced by \n                family caregivers who assist a family member with \n                neurological diseases or conditions such as multiple \n                sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, \n                or other similar diseases or conditions.\n                    (C) A capacity to provide the services recommended \n                by the best practices developed under subsection (a).\n            (3) Additional selection requirement.--The Assistant \n        Secretary for Aging shall not award a grant to an entity under \n        this subsection if the amount of the award would constitute \n        more than 40 percent of the operating budget of the entity in \n        the fiscal year for which funds for the grant are authorized to \n        be expended. For purposes of this subsection, the fair market \n        value of annual in-kind contributions of equipment or services \n        shall be considered as part of the operating budget of the \n        entity.\n            (4) Selection of grant recipients.--Not later than 90 days \n        after establishing the grant program under this subsection, the \n        Assistant Secretary for Aging shall award the first annual \n        series of grants under the program.
