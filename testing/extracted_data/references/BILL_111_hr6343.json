The Secretary shall conduct 3 \n        auctions over a period of 2 years. The 3 auctions shall be \n        structured in order to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, \n        that number of projects awarded under each auction is the same.\n            (3) Loan disbursements.--A loan made under this section \n        shall be disbursed during the primary term of the loan \n        agreement whenever the market price falls below the strike \n        price. The amount of such disbursement shall be equal to the \n        excess of the strike price over the market price in each given \n        week, times the sales of the project for the following week \n        (but not more than a total level of disbursements specified in \n        the agreement).\n            (4) Loan repayments.--The Secretary shall establish terms \n        and conditions, including interest rates and amortization \n        schedules, for the repayment of such loan within the full term \n        of the loan agreement, subject to the following limitations:\n                    (A) In any calendar quarter during the primary term \n                of the agreement the loan recipient may elect to defer \n                some or all of its repayment obligations due in that \n                quarter if any new loan disbursements have been made in \n                that quarter.
