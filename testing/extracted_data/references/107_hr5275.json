    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``External Regulation of the \nDepartment of Energy Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Energy has studied external \n        regulation for nine years.\n            (2) The Department has already conducted a successful pilot \n        program that demonstrated the utility of moving to external \n        regulation of the nonmilitary energy laboratory complex.\n            (3) Managers of the nonmilitary energy laboratories, the \n        General Accounting Office, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \n        and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration all agree \n        that external regulation is both workable and desirable.\n            (4) The safety of the Department of Energy's nonmilitary \n        energy laboratories, both for the workers in the laboratories \n        and the people that live near them, is of paramount importance.\n            (5) Putting the Department of Energy out of the self-\n        regulation business would free up more resources in the \n        nonmilitary energy laboratories to conduct the critical \n        scientific missions for which those laboratories have been \n        established.\n            (6) It is time to terminate the Department of Energy's \n        self-regulation of nuclear and worker safety in the nonmilitary \n        energy laboratory complex and move to external regulation by \n        the experts in these issues, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n        and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nSEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AUTHORITY.\n\n    Effective October 1, 2003, the Department of Energy shall have no \nregulatory or enforcement authority with respect to nuclear safety and \noccupational safety and health responsibilities assumed by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission under section 4 or by the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration under section 5 at any nonmilitary energy \nlaboratory owned or operated by the Department.\n\nSEC. 4. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION AUTHORITY.\n\n    (a) Nuclear Safety Regulatory and Enforcement Responsibilities.--\nEffective October 1, 2003, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall \nassume the nuclear safety regulatory and enforcement responsibilities \nof the Department of Energy under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 with \nregard to nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the \nDepartment.\n    (b) Licensed Entities.--For the purposes of carrying out at \nnonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the Department of \nEnergy regulatory and enforcement responsibilities described in \nsubsection (a), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may regulate, through \nlicensing, certification, or other appropriate means, the Department, \nthe Department's contractors, or both.\n    (c) Decommissioning.--A contractor operating a nonmilitary energy \nlaboratory owned by the Department of Energy shall not be responsible \nfor the costs of decommissioning that facility. No enforcement action \nmay be taken against such contractor for any violation of Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission decommissioning requirements, if such violation \nis the result of a failure of the Department to authorize or fund \ndecommissioning activities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the \nDepartment shall, not later than January 1, 2004, enter into a \nmemorandum of understanding establishing decommissioning procedures and \nrequirements for nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by \nthe Department.\n    (d) Administration.--The responsibilities assumed by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission under this section shall be administered by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, not by States.\n    (e) Judicial Review.--Section 189 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954 (42 U.S.C. 2239(b)) is amended by adding the following paragraph \nafter paragraph (4):\n            ``(5) Any final order or regulation of the Commission \n        establishing standards to govern nonmilitary energy \n        laboratories owned or operated by the Department of Energy that \n        are issued to implement the Commission's responsibilities under \n        the External Regulation of the Department of Energy Act, and \n        any final determination of the Commission relating to whether a \n        nonmilitary energy laboratory owned or operated by the \n        Department is in compliance with such standards and all \n        applicable Commission regulations or orders.''.\n    (f) Employee Protection.--Any Department of Energy contractor \noperating a nonmilitary energy laboratory that is regulated by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission under this section shall be subject to \nsection 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (41 U.S.C. 5851) \nto the same extent as any other employer subject to such section 211.\n    (g) Conflict of Interest.--Section 170A of the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210a) applies to contracts, agreements, or other \narrangements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed or entered \ninto pursuant to its responsibilities assumed under this section.\n\nSEC. 5. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH.\n\n    (a) OSHA Jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding section 4(b)(1) of the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 653(b)(1)) and \nany other provision of law, effective October 1, 2003, the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration shall assume the regulatory and \nenforcement responsibilities of the Department of Energy relating to \nmatters covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 with \nregard to all nonmilitary energy laboratories owned or operated by the \nDepartment, except as provided in subsection (b). Any Department \ncontractor operating such a laboratory shall, with respect to matters \nrelating to occupational safety and health, be considered to be an \nemployer for purposes of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970.\n    (b) Regulation of Hazards Containing Radiological and Non-\nRadiological Component.--If a hazard at a nonmilitary energy laboratory \nowned or operated by the Department presents a risk of occupational \nexposure and contains both a radiological and non-radiological \ncomponent, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission shall, effective October 1, 2003, share \nregulatory and enforcement responsibilities with respect to the hazard \nin accordance with the memorandum of understanding entered into \npursuant to section 6.\n\nSEC. 6. MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING.\n\n    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration shall, before January 1, 2003, enter into and \ntransmit to the Congress a memorandum of understanding to govern the \nexercise of their respective authorities over nuclear safety and \noccupational safety and health at nonmilitary energy laboratories owned \nor operated by the Department of Energy.\n\nSEC. 7. CIVIL PENALTIES.\n\n    The Department of Energy's contractor operating a nonmilitary \nenergy laboratory owned or operated by the Department shall not be \nliable for civil penalties under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 or the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 for any actions taken before \nOctober 1, 2003, pursuant to the instructions of a Federal agency in \npreparation for the transfer of regulatory and enforcement \nresponsibilities required by this Act.\n\nSEC. 8.
