WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND EXTENSION OF OTHERWISE \n              APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN ACTIONS \n              UNDER THE USEC PRIVATIZATION ACT.\n\n    Section 3110(a)(7) of the USEC Privatization Act (42 U.S.C. 2297h-\n8(a)(7)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubparagraph:\n                    ``(D)(i) Any individual who, as of immediately \n                before any transfer of plan assets and liabilities as \n                required by paragraph (2) to a pension plan sponsored \n                by the private corporation referred to in paragraph (2) \n                which occurred on or before December 31, 2000, was an \n                active or retired participant (or a beneficiary) under \n                a pension plan maintained by an operating contractor of \n                a gaseous diffusion plant referred to in paragraph (1) \n                and who is an active or retired participant (or a \n

over the \n                parties, without regard to the amount in controversy or \n                the citizenship of the parties, against the Department \n                of Energy for relief described in clause (ii) from any \n                grievance in connection with such a transfer.\n                    ``(ii) For purposes of clause (i), relief is a one-\n                time lump sum payment, payable to such individual from \n                the appropriation made by section 1304 of title 31, \n                United States Code (popularly known as the Judgment \n                Fund), in an amount equal to not more than the amount \n                which bears the same ratio to the total recoverable \n                amount described in clause (iii) as the actuarial \n

paragraph (2) was made) if such \n                successor plan received assets in excess of the \n                actuarial present value of accrued benefits under such \n                plan upon succession.\n                    ``(vii) Notwithstanding section 1658 of title 28, \n                United States Code, an action authorized by this \n                subparagraph may be brought on
