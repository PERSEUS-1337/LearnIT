FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in \n        the United States.\n            (2) Obesity-related diseases cost the United States economy \n        more than $117,000,000,000 every year.\n            (3) The prevalence of overweight children between the ages \n        of 6 and 11 years increased from 4.0 percent in 1971-1974 to \n        17.5 percent in 2001-2004, and the prevalence of overweight \n        adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19 years increased from \n        6.1 percent to 17.0 percent.\n            (4) More than 9,000,000 children and adolescents between \n        the ages of 6 and 19 years are considered overweight on the \n        basis of being in the 95th percentile or higher of BMI values \n        in the 2000 CDC growth chart for the United States.\n            (5) If children do not become more active and healthy, one-\n        third of all children born in 2000 or later will suffer from \n        diabetes at some point in their lives.\n            (6) Of all United States deaths from major chronic disease, \n        23 percent are linked to sedentary lifestyles that now begin at \n        childhood.\n            (7) Adolescents who are overweight have a 70-80 percent \n        chance of becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for \n        chronic disease, disability, and death.\n            (8) A recent study showed that plaque build-up in the neck \n        arteries of children who are obese or those with high \n        cholesterol is similar to those levels seen in middle-aged \n        adults.\n            (9) A decline in physical activity has contributed to the \n        unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity.\n            (10) The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \n        recommend that children engage in 60 minutes or more of \n        physical activity each day.\n            (11) In a 2005 Government Accountability Office report on \n        key strategies to include in programs designed to target \n        childhood obesity, ``increasing physical activity'' was \n        identified as the most important component in any such program.\n            (12) Part of the decline in physical activity has been in \n        our Nation's schools, where physical education programs have \n        been cut back in the past 2 decades.\n            (13) The national standard for physical education frequency \n        is 150 minutes per week in elementary school and 225 minutes \n        per week in middle school and high school.\n            (14) Only 3.8 percent of elementary school, 7.9 percent of \n        middle school, and 2.1 percent of high schools provide daily \n        physical education or its equivalent for the entire school \n        year, and 22 percent of schools do not require students to take \n        any physical education at all.\n            (15) Among children ages 9 to 13, 61.5 percent do not \n        participate in any organized physical activity during out-of-\n        school hours.\n            (16) Regular physical activity is associated with a \n        healthier, longer life and a lower risk of cardiovascular \n        disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and some \n        cancers.\n            (17) Research suggests a strong correlation between \n        children's fitness and their academic performance as measured \n        by grades in core subjects and standardized test scores.\n            (18) Approximately 81 percent of adults believe daily \n        physical education should be mandatory in schools.\n\nSEC. 3.
