FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Colonel Charles Young was--\n                    (A) a distinguished African-American officer in the \n                United States Army;\n                    (B) the third African-American to graduate from \n                West Point;\n                    (C) a commander of troops in combat in--\n                            (i) the Spanish-American War; and\n                            (ii) the Mexican Punitive Expedition \n                        against Pancho Villa;\n                    (D) the first Black United States military attache \n                to a foreign government; and\n                    (E) the highest ranking Black Officer in the United \n                States Armed Forces at the outbreak of World War I.\n            (2) Charles Young was born in 1864 into slavery to Gabriel \n        Young and Arminta Bruen in Mays Lick, Kentucky, a small town \n        near Maysville.\n            (3) Following West Point, Young began his service with the \n        Ninth Cavalry in the American West. From 1889 to 1890 he served \n        at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, and from 1890 to 1894 at Fort \n        Duchesne, Utah.\n            (4) In 1894, Lieutenant Young was assigned to Wilberforce \n        College in Ohio, a historically black college (HBCU), to lead \n        the new military sciences department, established under a \n        special Federal grant.\n            (5) As the commander of an Army unit assigned to protect \n        and develop Sequoia National Park and General Grant National \n        Park in the State of California, Colonel Young is recognized as \n        the first African-American to be the Superintendent of a \n        National Park.\n            (6) During his 32 years of honorable military service, \n        Colonel Young proved to be a valuable asset in the field of \n        military intelligence.\n            (7) With the Army's founding of the Military Intelligence \n        Department, in 1904 it assigned Young as one of the first \n        military attaches, serving in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n            (8) In 1908 Young was sent to the Philippines to join his \n        Ninth Regiment and command a squadron of two troops. It was his \n        second tour there. After his return to the United States, he \n        served for 2 years at Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming.\n            (9) In 1912 Young was assigned as the military attache to \n        Liberia, the first African-American to hold that post. For 3 \n        years, he served as an expert adviser to the Liberian \n        government and also took a direct role, supervising \n        construction of the country's infrastructure.\n            (10) In 1912 Young published The Military Morale of Nations \n        and Races, a remarkably prescient study of the cultural sources \n        of military power.\n            (11) During the 1916 Punitive Expedition by the United \n        States into Mexico, then-Major Young commanded the 2nd squadron \n        of the 10th United States Cavalry. While leading a cavalry \n        pistol charge against Pancho Villa's forces at Agua Caliente, \n        he routed the opposing forces without losing a single man.\n            (12) Because of his exceptional leadership of the 10th \n        Cavalry in the Mexican theater of war, Young was promoted to \n        Lieutenant Colonel in September 1916. He was assigned as \n        commander of Fort Huachuca, the base in Arizona of the Tenth \n        Cavalry, nicknamed the ``Buffalo Soldiers'', until mid-1917. He \n        was the first African-American to achieve the rank of colonel \n        in the United States Army.\n\nSEC. 3.
