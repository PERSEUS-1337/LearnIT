FINDINGS; DEFINITION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) All claims of United States citizenship and nationality \n        must be treated with the utmost respect and care, with \n        adherence to procedures necessary and sufficient to guard \n        against the serious risk of United States citizens and \n        nationals being deprived of the rights, privileges, and \n        benefits attendant to such citizenship and nationality or the \n        denial of valid claims thereto.\n            (2) The right to travel abroad and return home is an \n        important and protected element of United States citizenship. \n        This right should not be denied on the basis of race or \n        ancestry or for reasons that are arbitrary and capricious.\n            (3) Millions of United States citizens live in United \n        States border communities and regularly cross the border for \n        family, work, business, and personal reasons. With the Western \n        Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) scheduled to be fully \n        implemented on June 1, 2009, virtually all United States \n        citizens will be required to possess a passport, passport card, \n        or other WHTI-compliant document to cross the land borders of \n        the United States or enter through sea ports of entry. At that \n        time, a passport--already required for international travel by \n        air--will become a fundamental necessity of everyday life for \n        those United States citizens who live along or near United \n        States land borders.\n            (4) In recent years, certain United States citizens living \n        or born in States bordering Mexico have been formally or \n        effectively denied United States passports as a result of a \n        process that often lacks due process, imposes a heightened \n        burden of proof on certain passport applicants, and results in \n        decisions that are inadequately supported by an evidentiary \n        record.\n    (b) Definitions.--\n            (1) Applicant.--The term ``applicant'' means a person who \n        submits a United States passport application.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of State and any individual designated by the Secretary of \n        State to adjudicate United States passport applications under \n        An Act To regulate the issue and validity of passports, and for \n        other purposes (July 3, 1926; 22 U.S.C. 211a).\n\nSEC. 3. CONFIRMATION AND CLARIFICATION OF STANDARDS FOR ADJUDICATION OF \n              UNITED STATES PASSPORT APPLICATIONS BY SECRETARY OF \n              STATE.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall adjudicate United \n        States passport applications in an individualized, evidence-\n        based manner.\n            (2) Individualized assessment.--At every stage of the \n        passport application adjudicatory process under paragraph (1), \n        including any requests for additional evidence and rulings on \n        the merits of an application, the Secretary's decisions \n        respecting United States passport applications shall be based \n        on an assessment of individual circumstances and evidence.\n            (3) Prohibition.--An applicant's race, ethnicity, or \n        ancestry may not be a factor taken into account in the passport \n        application adjudicatory process under paragraph (1).\n    (b) Proceedings.--\n            (1) In general.--An applicant shall establish by a \n        preponderance of the evidence at all stages of the passport \n        application adjudicatory process, including in proceedings \n        under section 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n        U.S.C. 1503), that such applicant is a United States citizen or \n        national.\n            (2) Prohibition.--The Secretary shall not utilize or apply \n        any heightened burden of proof when evaluating the citizenship \n        or nationality of an applicant and shall apply such \n        preponderance of the evidence standard required under paragraph \n        (1) in a uniform and consistent manner to all passport \n        applications.\n            (3) Writing.--Any determination by the Secretary that an \n        applicant has not met the burden of proving United States \n        citizenship or nationality by a preponderance of the evidence \n        shall be made in writing, state the reasons for the Secretary's \n        determination, and be provided to the applicant in a timely \n        manner.\n    (c) Acceptance of Certain Evidence.--A birth certificate signed by \na midwife, doctor, or other person authorized under State law to sign \nsuch a document, or a previously-issued United States passport, shall \nconstitute prima facie evidence of United States citizenship or \nnationality and, absent individualized evidence that a birth did not \ntake place in the United States, shall satisfy the preponderance of the \nevidence standard for demonstrating an applicant's United States \ncitizenship or nationality."
