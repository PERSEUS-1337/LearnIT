SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Humanitarian \nRelief to Cuba Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Hurricane Gustav, which struck Cuba on September 1, \n        2008, was the worst hurricane to hit the island of Cuba in over \n        50 years. The Category Four storm displaced over 400,000 Cubans \n        and damaged or destroyed 130,000 homes and caused severe damage \n        to infrastructure.\n            (2) Hurricane Ike, which made landfall on Cuba on September \n        7, 2008, forced the evacuation of over 2,500,000 Cubans, \n        damaged an additional 100,000 structures, and damaged local \n        infrastructure.\n            (3) The number of Cubans left homeless is expected to reach \n        100,000, and the total economic losses of Hurricanes Gustav and \n        Ike are expected to reach upwards of $10,000,000,000, with \n        serious damage done to the island's agricultural industry.\n            (4) In the wake of past natural disasters, the United \n        States eased restrictions to mobilize the generous spirit of \n        many thousands of Americans by allowing humanitarian aid \n        originating from the United States to be transported directly \n        to Cuba to the benefit of the Cuban people.\n            (5) Allowing the people of the United States to assist the \n        Cuban people in reclaiming their lives and livelihoods \n        following a major natural disaster just 90 miles from the \n        United States is an important aspect of United States national \n        security and defense policy.\n\nSEC. 2.
