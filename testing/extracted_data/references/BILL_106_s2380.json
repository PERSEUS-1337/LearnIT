FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) International family planning funds provide assistance \n        that saves the lives of women by providing vital reproductive \n        health care, including family planning and maternal health \n        programs that include prenatal, postpartum, HIV/AIDS, and other \n        sexually transmitted disease education that results in safe \n        pregnancies and safe motherhood.\n            (2) Each year more than 585,000 women die from \n        complications with pregnancy and childbirth. In addition, each \n        year at least 7,000,000 women suffer serious health problems, \n        and as many as 50,000,000 women suffer some adverse health \n        consequences, after childbirth, many of which could be \n        prevented with safe motherhood practices used in reproductive \n        health programs.\n            (3) More than 5,800,000 people were infected with HIV/AIDS \n        in 1998. Without funding from international family planning \n        programs for education and prevention, most governments would \n        not have the resources to combat the physical, social, and \n        economic devastation inflicted by that disease.\n            (4) The health of the planet is connected to the health of \n        women and their families. Rapid population growth exacerbates \n        many environmental problems, including air and water pollution, \n        loss of wildlife habitat, fisheries depletion, and climate \n        change--global problems that transcend national boundaries. \n        Family planning programs give women the option to choose the \n        number and spacing of their children, which contributes to \n        slowing global population growth. International family planning \n        improves the ability of families worldwide to manage their \n        lives and their natural resources more sustainably.\n            (5) When families have access to family planning resources \n        and are able to space their children, delay the timing of their \n        first child, and have longer intervals between each child, \n        there is a decrease in the risk of mortality in both women and \n        children.\n            (6) Voluntary family planning services allow women and men \n        to exercise their fundamental human right to plan the size of \n        their families and ensure that every pregnancy is planned and \n        every child is wanted. Data from around the world provide \n        conclusive evidence that increased access to family planning \n        reduces the incidence of abortion.\n            (7) At the International Conference on Population and \n        Development in 1994, it was estimated that making quality \n        family planning and related health services available to all in \n        need of such planning and services would cost $17,000,000,000 \n        in the year 2000. The United States and other donor countries \n        agreed to provide \\1/3\\ of those funds. Based on the size of \n        its economy, the United States share of the total donor \n        population assistance should be almost $1,900,000,000 for \n        fiscal year 2001. While falling short of that funding goal, \n        restoring funding for population assistance to fiscal year 1995 \n        levels would be a significant step toward ensuring access to \n        family planning and reproductive health care for couples around \n        the world.\n            (8) With world population exceeding 6,000,000,000 people, \n        international family planning providers and related \n        nongovernmental organizations play a critical role in meeting \n        the physical, social, environmental, and economic needs in \n        their societies and in expanding participation in the \n        democratic process. Those organizations should be provided with \n        adequate funding to fully and actively offer the best and most \n        informative care to the citizens involved without restrictions \n        on free speech. United States assistance should be provided to \n        those organizations under the same terms as to the governments \n        involved.\n\nSEC. 3. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Funding.--There is authorized to be appropriated, and there is \nappropriated (out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \nappropriated), for fiscal year 2001 $366,000,000 to carry out the \nprovisions of section 301 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and \nsection 2 of the United Nations Environment Program Participation Act \nof 1973.\n    (b) Availability of Amounts for UNFPA.--Of the amount appropriated \nfor fiscal year 2001 to carry out the provisions of law described in \nsubsection (a), $35,000,000 shall be made available for the United \nNations Population Fund (UNFPA).\n\nSEC. 4. POPULATION PLANNING ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) Funding.--There is authorized to be appropriated, and there is \nappropriated (out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise \nappropriated), for fiscal year 2001 $541,600,000 for population \nplanning activities and other population assistance under part I of the \nForeign Assistance Act of 1961.\n    (b) Eligibility of Nongovernmental and Multilateral Organizations \nfor Population Planning Assistance.--Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by adding at \nthe end the following:\n\n``SEC. 130. ELIGIBILITY OF NONGOVERNMENTAL AND MULTILATERAL \n              ORGANIZATIONS FOR POPULATION PLANNING ASSISTANCE.\n\n    ``In determining eligibility of nongovernmental and multilateral \norganizations for population planning assistance or other population \nassistance under this part, the Administrator of the United States \nAgency for International Development may not apply requirements to such \norganizations that are more restrictive than requirements applicable to \nforeign governments for such assistance.''."
