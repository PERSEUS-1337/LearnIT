FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Gulf of Mexico is a valuable resource of national \n        and international importance, continuously serving the people \n        of the United States and other countries as an important source \n        of food, economic productivity, recreation, beauty, and \n        enjoyment;\n            (2) over many years, the resource productivity and water \n        quality of the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed have been \n        diminished by point and nonpoint source pollution resulting \n        largely from the impacts of agricultural runoff, increasing \n        population growth and development in the Gulf of Mexico \n        watershed, and other factors;\n            (3) the United States should seek to attain the protection \n        and restoration of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem as a \n        collaborative regional goal of the Gulf of Mexico Program; and\n            (4) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency, in consultation with other Federal agencies and State \n        and local authorities, should coordinate the effort to meet \n        those goals.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to restore \n        and protect the Gulf of Mexico;\n            (2) to expand Federal support for monitoring, management, \n        and restoration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and its \n        watershed;\n            (3) to commit the United States to a comprehensive \n        cooperative program to achieve improved water quality in, and \n        improvements in the productivity of living resources of, the \n        Gulf of Mexico; and\n            (4) to establish a Gulf of Mexico Program to serve as a \n        national and international model for the collaborative \n        management of large marine ecosystems.\n\nSEC. 3. GULF OF MEXICO RESTORATION AND PROTECTION.\n\n    Title I of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 \net seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating the second section 121 (33 U.S.C. \n        1274) (relating to wet weather watershed pilot projects) as \n        section 122; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 122 (as designated by \n        paragraph (1)) the following:\n\n``SEC. 123.
