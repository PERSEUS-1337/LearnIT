FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) older Americans are among the most rapidly growing \n        segments of our society;\n            (2) currently, the elderly comprise 15 percent of our \n        society, and predictions are that by the turn of the century \n        they will constitute 18 percent of our Nation's population;\n            (3) older Americans find themselves uniquely situated in \n        our society, environmentally and physically;\n            (4) many elderly Americans are experiencing increased \n        social isolation due to fragmented and distant familial \n        relations, scattered associations, limited access to \n        transportation, and other insulating factors;\n            (5) physical conditions such as hearing loss, poor \n        eyesight, lessened agility, and chronic and debilitating \n        illnesses often contribute to an older person's susceptibility \n        to criminal victimization;\n            (6) our elders are too frequently the victims of abuse and \n        neglect, violent crime, property crime, consumer fraud, medical \n        quackery, and confidence games;\n            (7) studies have found that elderly victims of violent \n        crime are more likely to be injured and require medical \n        attention than are younger victims;\n            (8) victimization data on crimes against the elderly are \n        incomplete and out of date, and data sources are partial, \n        scattered, and not easily obtained;\n            (9) although a few studies have attempted to define and \n        estimate the extent of elder abuse and neglect, both in their \n        homes and in institutional settings, many experts believe that \n        this crime is substantially underreported and undetected;\n            (10) similarly, while some evidence suggests that the \n        elderly may be targeted in a range of fraudulent schemes, \n        neither the Uniform Crime Report nor the National Crime Survey \n        collects data on individual- or household-level fraud;\n            (11) law enforcement officers and social service providers \n        come from different disciplines and frequently bring different \n        perspectives to the problem of crimes against the elderly;\n            (12) these differences, in turn, can contribute to \n        inconsistent approaches to the problem and inhibit a genuinely \n        effective response;\n            (13) there are, however, a few efforts currently under way \n        that seek to forge partnerships to coordinate criminal justice \n        and social service approaches to victimization of the elderly;\n            (14) the Triad program, sponsored by the National Sheriffs' \n        Association (NSA), the International Association of Chiefs of \n        Police (IACP), and the American Association of Retired Persons \n        (AARP), is one such effort;\n            (15) recognizing that older Americans have the same \n        fundamental desire as other members of our society to live \n        freely, without fear or restriction due to the criminal \n        element, the Federal Government seeks to expand efforts to \n        reduce crime against this growing and uniquely vulnerable \n        segment of our population; and\n            (16) our goal is to support a coordinated effort among law \n        enforcement and social service agencies to stem the tide of \n        transgenerational violence against the elderly and to support \n        media and nonmedia strategies aimed at increasing both public \n        understanding of the problem and the elderly person's skills in \n        preventing crime against themselves and their property.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to address the problem of crime against \nthe elderly in a systematic and effective manner with a program of \npractical and focused research, development, and dissemination designed \nto assist States and units of local government in implementing specific \nprograms of crime prevention, victim assistance, citizen involvement, \nand public education that offer a high probability of improving the \ncoordinated effectiveness of law enforcement and social service \nefforts. The efforts of local coalitions, such as the Triad model being \npiloted in a number of areas by National Sheriffs' Association, \nInternational Association of the Chiefs of Police, and American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, are of particular interest.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND DISSEMINATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director of the National Institute of Justice \n(referred to as the ``Director'') shall conduct a national assessment \nof--\n            (1) the nature and extent of crimes against the elderly;\n            (2) the needs of law enforcement, health, and social \n        service organizations in working to prevent, identify, \n        investigate, and provide assistance to victims of those crimes; \n        and\n            (3) promising strategies to respond effectively to those \n        challenges.\n    (b) Matters to be Addressed.--The national assessment made pursuant \nto subsection (a) shall address--\n            (1) the analysis and synthesis of data from a range of \n        sources in order to develop accurate information on the nature \n        and extent of crimes against the elderly, including identifying \n        and conducting such surveys and other data collection efforts \n        as are needed and designing a strategy to keep such information \n        current over time;\n            (2) the problem of the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach \n        elderly who are in poor health, are living alone or without \n        family nearby, or are living in high crime areas;\n            (3) the problem of elderly who are abused and neglected, \n        sometimes in the home and sometimes in health care facilities, \n        sometimes subjected to physical abuse and at other times to \n        verbal aggression and neglect;\n            (4) the problem of fear of victimization, which inhibits \n        the freedom of the elderly and can make them prisoners in their \n        homes;\n            (5) the identification of strategies and techniques that \n        have been shown to be effective, or appear to hold promise of \n        being effective, in responding to the problems described in \n        this subsection and in preventing, reducing, and ameliorating \n        the impact of crime against the elderly;\n            (6) the analysis of the factors that enhance or inhibit \n        development of a coordinated response by law enforcement, \n        health care, and social service providers to crimes against the \n        elderly and the treatment of elderly victims; and\n            (7) the research agenda needed to develop a comprehensive \n        understanding of the problems of crimes against the elderly, \n        including the changes anticipated in the crimes themselves and \n        appropriate responses as our society increasingly ages, and the \n        identification and evaluation of effective and fiscally \n        feasible approaches to prevent and reduce victimization of our \n        Nation's elderly citizens.\n    (c) Dissemination.--Based on the results of the national assessment \nand analysis of successful or promising strategies in dealing with the \nproblems described in subsection (b) and other problems, including \ncoalition efforts such as the Triad programs referred to in sections 2 \nand 3, the Director shall disseminate the results through reports, \npublications, clearinghouse services, public service announcements, and \nprograms of evaluation, demonstration, training, and technical \nassistance.\n\nSEC. 5. PILOT PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Awards.--The Director may make awards to coalitions of local \nlaw enforcement agencies, victim service providers, and organizations \nrepresenting the elderly for pilot programs and field tests of \nparticularly promising strategies and models for forging partnerships \nfor crime prevention and service provision based on the concepts of the \nTriad model, which can then be evaluated and serve as the basis for \nfurther demonstration and education programs.\n    (b) Eligibility.--Pilot programs funded under this section may \ninclude existing general service coalitions of law enforcement, victim \nservice, and elder advocate organizations that wish to use additional \nfunds to work at a particular problem in their community, such as \nfraud, burglary, or abuse and neglect, or to target a particular \ngeographic area in need of intensive services.\n\nSEC. 6. EVALUATION AND DISSEMINATION AWARDS.\n\n    In conjunction with the national assessment under section 4 and the \npilot programs under section 5, the Director may make awards to--\n            (1) coalitions of national law enforcement, victim service, \n        and elder advocate organizations, for the purposes of providing \n        training and technical assistance in implementing pilot \n        programs, including programs based on the concepts of the \n        Triad;\n            (2) research organizations, for the purposes of--\n                    (A) investigating the types of elder victimization \n                shown by the national assessment to present \n                particularly critical problems or to be emerging crimes \n                about which little is known;\n                    (B) evaluating the effectiveness of selected pilot \n                programs; and\n                    (C) conducting the research and development \n                identified through the national assessment as being \n                critical; and\n            (3) public service advertising coalitions, for the purposes \n        of mounting a program of public service advertisements to \n        increase public awareness and understanding of the issues \n        surrounding crimes against the elderly and promoting ideas or \n        programs to prevent them.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    Of amounts authorized to be appropriated to the National Institute \nof Justice under section 1001(a)(2) of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3793(a)(2)), $5,000,000 shall be \navailable to carry out this Act, of which--\n            (1) up to $2,000,000 may be used to fund up to 20 pilot \n        programs;\n            (2) up to $1,000,000 may be used to fund a national \n        training and technical assistance effort;\n            (3) up to $1,000,000 may be used to develop public service \n        announcements; and\n            (4) up to $1,000,000 may be used for the national \n        assessment, the evaluation of pilot programs, and the carrying \n        out of the research agenda."
