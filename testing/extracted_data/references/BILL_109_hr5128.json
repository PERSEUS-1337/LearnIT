FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The State of California is a preeminent producer of \n        more than 350 different agricultural commodities, including \n        more than 90 percent of all of the tomatoes and grapes produced \n        in the United States, all of the commercial almonds, dates, \n        figs, olives, cling peaches, prunes and raisins produced in the \n        United States, and one out of every five glasses of milk \n        consumed in the United States.\n            (2) California is the leading State in terms of \n        agricultural exports, annually shipping more than $7 billion \n        dollars worth of agricultural commodities around the world.\n            (3) The total investment by California's 78,500 farms in \n        terms of direct and indirect economic impact is staggering, \n        and, if California is going to keep its agricultural industry \n        strong and vibrant, it must focus on the needs of farmers who \n        are valuable contributors to the economic, social, and cultural \n        life of the State and the United States.\n            (4) Since 1945, agricultural land has been rapidly \n        disappearing across California, as soil erosion, urbanization, \n        the growth of deserts, and salinization have all contributed to \n        loss of productive farmland. If these trends continue, \n        California will no longer be able to supply food for its \n        population, let alone the United States, and will be unable to \n        export food to the rest of the world.\n            (5) As Americans grow more and more detached from the great \n        agrarian history of the United States, fewer Americans \n        understand the fundamental importance of agriculture to \n        American society.\n            (6) Educating young Americans about agriculture and its \n        importance to the United States nation is an investment that \n        will pay off in future benefits.\n            (7) Greater public understanding and appreciation of the \n        importance of agriculture to California, the United States, and \n        the world is needed to secure a positive future, in which the \n        United States can rely on healthy food that is produced \n        domestically. Citizens of all ages, especially youth, must play \n        a meaningful, hands-on role in determining the future of \n        California agriculture.\n            (8) As planners, conservationists, and other interested \n        persons around the State of California organize to help protect \n        agricultural resources, the proposed National Ag Science Center \n        in Stanislaus County, California, is preparing to educate and \n        alert future generations about the need to preserve \n        agricultural land and to foster an understanding of the \n        importance of agriculture. The mission of the National Ag \n        Science Center will be to provide exciting and fun agricultural \n        learning opportunities and resources in order for young people \n        to learn how a vibrant agricultural economy is necessary for a \n        vibrant society, and to assure a bright future for all aspects \n        of the agriculture industry. The National Ag Science Center \n        will prepare young Americans for career and leadership \n        opportunities in agriculture.\n            (9) According to findings of the Center for Public Policy \n        Studies at California State University, Stanislaus, the \n        National Ag Science Center will create or support up to 359 new \n        local jobs, create or support up to $57,500,000 in economic \n        activity and $15,200,000 in labor income through construction \n        of the new facility, generate as much as $8,500,000 in total \n        annual economic activity, and result in as much as $3,400,000 \n        in total annual labor income.\n            (10) On September 14, 2005, the Yosemite Community College \n        District Board, in Stanislaus County, California, voted \n        unanimously to approve the dedication of a 3.5 acre site on the \n        West Campus of Modesto Community College for the National Ag \n        Science Center.\n            (11) Establishment of the National Ag Science Center is in \n        the national interest, as the proposed Center will enable \n        future generations to help assure a healthy and profitable \n        place for agriculture in the economy of California and the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL AG SCIENCE CENTER, \n              STANISLAUS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.\n\n    (a) Assistance Authorized.--Using such funds as may be appropriated \npursuant to the authorization of appropriations in subsection (d), the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall make \ngrants to the Ag Science Center, Inc., in Stanislaus County, \nCalifornia, to cover a portion of the costs of establishing the \nNational Ag Science Center, including costs relating to the design, \nplanning, construction, furnishing, equipping, and expansion of the \nCenter.\n    (b) Grant Proposal.--To receive a grant under subsection (a), the \nAg Science Center, Inc. shall submit to the Secretary of the Interior \nor the Secretary of Agriculture, or to both Secretaries, a proposal for \nthe use of the grant funds, which shall include detailed plans for the \ndesign, construction, furnishing, equipping, and expansion of the \nNational Ag Science Center.\n    (c) Limitation on Grant Amounts.--The portion of the costs \ndescribed in subsection (a) covered by grants made under this section \nshall not exceed 33 percent of the total costs to establish the Center.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture $10,000,000 to make grants under this section. Amounts so \nappropriated shall remain available until expended."
