FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Each day about 5 million children walk into 274,000 \n        classrooms nationwide and find a substitute teacher. Students \n        will spend the equivalent of one full year with a substitute \n        teacher before they graduate from high school.\n            (2) Virtually every State in the country is facing a \n        substitute teacher shortage, a problem that has been \n        exacerbated by increased demand for professional development \n        opportunities for teachers.\n            (3) In 73 percent of school districts, there is an \n        immediate, urgent need for substitute teachers.\n            (4) Nationwide, substitute teacher salaries average only \n        $65 per day. In rural areas, rates are often as low as $40. \n        Rarely do substitutes receive benefits.\n            (5) This shortage is likely to grow to a crisis level \n        within the next 10 years, as an acute shortage of substitute \n        teachers develops because an unprecedented number of children \n        will enter our schools.\n            (6) The substitute teacher shortage has lead schools to \n        relax their requirements and hire substitute teachers that are \n        often underqualified. In all but one State, substitute teachers \n        need no teaching certification.\n            (7) In 28 States, principals may hire anyone with a high \n        school diploma or a general equivalency diploma (GED) who is \n        age 18 years or older.\n            (8) Nearly 12 percent of districts do not require \n        substitute teachers to fill out a job application.\n            (9) Over half (56 percent) of school districts never have a \n        face-to-face interview with potential substitutes.\n            (10) In 30 percent of all school districts, no background \n        checks are conducted on applicants for substitute teaching \n        positions, and only half the districts check applicants' \n        references.\n            (11) Poorly trained substitute teachers have a negative \n        impact on student academic performance.\n            (12) States with lower academic achievement are twice as \n        likely to allow less qualified substitutes in the classroom. \n        Nine out of the ten lowest-ranked States in National Assessment \n        of Educational Progress (NAEP) testing allowed substitute \n        teachers with only a high school diploma to teach in their \n        schools. In each of those States, education spending is \n        thousands of dollars below the national average.\n            (13) Of the top 25 States in education spending, 9 require \n        at least a college degree for substitute teachers.\n            (14) In 77 percent of school districts across the country, \n        substitute teachers are given no training at all.\n            (15) Alleviating the substitute teacher crisis would free \n        up precious time for other teachers to spend in professional \n        development programs.\n\nSEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION GRANT PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of \nEducation shall establish a competitive demonstration grant program to \nprovide grants for a single academic year directly to not fewer than 50 \nnor more than 100 local educational agencies (as that term is defined \nin section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965), \nor to regional consortia of such agencies acting together, that vary \ngeographically and socioeconomically, to enable such agencies or \nconsortia to experiment with ways to alleviate the substitute teacher \nshortage described in section 2.\n\nSEC. 4. SELECTION OF GRANT RECIPIENTS.\n\n    In selecting grant recipients under section 3, the Secretary of \nEducation shall select applicants that, collectively, will explore a \nrange of options for addressing the substitute teacher shortage, such \nas--\n            (1) developing a public relations campaign targeted at \n        likely substitute teacher candidates (such as retired \n        teachers);\n            (2) establishing permanent substitute teacher pools;\n            (3) addressing issues that hinder the ability of \n        administrators to find qualified substitute teachers; or\n            (4) increasing the availability of content and skills \n        training for substitute teachers.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date the last grant made under \nsection 3 expires, the Secretary of Education shall submit a report to \nthe Congress describing the findings and results of the demonstration \nprogram under this Act, including--\n            (1) the programs or methods that best alleviated the \n        substitute teacher shortage, and where those programs or \n        methods worked best; and\n            (2) the impact of economic conditions on the quality and \n        availability of substitute teachers.\n\nSEC. 6. RULEMAKING AUTHORITY.\n\n    The Secretary of Education may prescribe rules to carry out this \nAct.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act \n$5,000,000 for fiscal year 2003."
