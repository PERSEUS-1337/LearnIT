    "content": "The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270 ) is the main federal law supporting the development of career and technical skills among students in secondary and postsecondary education. Perkins IV, the most recent reauthorization of federal law targeting career and technical education (CTE), was passed in 2006 and authorized appropriations through FY2012. The authorization was extended through FY2013 under the General Education Provisions Act, and Perkins IV has continued to receive fairly constant appropriations through FY2016.  During the 114 th Congress, the House Education and the Workforce Committee marked up and unanimously passed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21 st Century Act ( H.R. 5587 ), which would provide for a comprehensive reauthorization of Perkins IV and authorize appropriations through FY2022. H.R. 5587 was passed by the House on September 13, 2016, by a vote of 405-5. This report highlights the major provisions in H.R. 5587 , and explains the major differences between H.R. 5587 and current law.
