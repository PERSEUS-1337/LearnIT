FINDING.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Secretary of Agriculture, in the \n        school year beginning July 2007, the school lunch program under \n        the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. \n        1751 et seq.) and the school breakfast program under the Child \n        Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) provided more \n        than 31 million lunches and more than 10 million breakfasts.\n            (2) The calories and nutrients consumed at school and \n        school-related activities are an important component of dietary \n        intake of all school-age children, and for most students, \n        comprise of over half of daily caloric intake.\n            (3) Commercially prepared products, including processed \n        commodities, account for 40 percent of the available lunch \n        entrees and were major sources of fat, sodium and calories in \n        lunches.\n            (4) Childhood obesity rates have tripled among kids ages 12 \n        to 19 since 1980, with one-third of America's youth now \n        overweight or obese; impacting students in school, the \n        readiness of the military, and rising health care costs.\n            (5) Recently, States like West Virginia, have sought to \n        exceed school meal guidelines set forth by Secretary of \n        Agriculture by decreasing the amount of fat and sodium served \n        and increasing the servings of fruits and vegetables.\n            (6) The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published in June \n        2010 under section 301 of the National Nutrition Monitoring and \n        Related Research Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5341) recommends that \n        Americans improve nutrition literacy and cooking skills, and \n        learn to prepare foods; schools have the opportunity to do the \n        same for children.\n\nSEC. 3. SCHOOL EATS GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    Section 18 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1769) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(j) School EATS Grant Program.--\n            ``(1) In general.--From the amounts appropriated under \n        paragraph (10), the Secretary shall award grants, on a \n        competitive basis, to eligible entities for the purpose of \n        carrying out a program to reduce the amount of processed food \n        served each day under the school lunch program established \n        under this Act and the school breakfast program established \n        under section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n        1773).\n            ``(2) Deadline for awards.--The Secretary shall award \n        grants under this subsection not later than 90 days after the \n        date funds are appropriated under paragraph (10) for each \n        fiscal year.\n            ``(3) Priority.--In awarding grants under this subsection, \n        the Secretary shall give priority to eligible entities--\n                    ``(A) in which at least 50 percent of the students \n                enrolled in schools under the jurisdiction of such \n                eligible entities are eligible for free or reduced \n                price meals;
