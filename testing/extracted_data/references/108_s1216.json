FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Consumers rely increasingly on wireless telephone \n        service for personal, business, and emergency communications. \n        There are currently more than 137,000,000 wireless telephone \n        users in the United States. This is more than a 121 percent \n        increase in the number of such users in the past five years \n        alone. In the future this number is projected to grow as \n        consumers switch from wireline to wireless telephone service \n        for their primary telephone service.\n            (2) The lack of wireless telephone number portability--the \n        capacity of a consumer to retain a wireless telephone number \n        when changing wireless telephone service providers--is a \n        barrier to competition in the market for wireless telephone \n        service. The lack of number portability acts as a disincentive \n        for wireless telephone service providers to improve the quality \n        of their wireless telephone service.\n            (3) The lack of wireless telephone number portability \n        imposes significant costs on individual consumers and \n        businesses looking to change wireless telephone service \n        providers. More than half of business wireless telephone users \n        report that number portability would make them more likely to \n        change wireless telephone service providers.\n            (4) Consumers cannot easily compare offers for wireless \n        telephone service because information on terms, pricing, and \n        service plans for such service is not presented in a uniform \n        manner. Current wireless telephone service contracts do not \n        clearly display the information consumers need to make an \n        informed choice regarding a wireless telephone service \n        contract. Consumers may not be aware of the deficiencies in \n        wireless telephone service quality until after they have signed \n        a contract, and exorbitant early termination penalties \n        effectively lock consumers into undesired, long-term contracts.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to improve quality of wireless telephone service; and\n            (2) to promote consumer choice in the wireless telephone \n        service market.\n\nSEC. 3. TELEPHONE NUMBER PORTABILITY FOR WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICE.\n\n    (a) Requirement in Largest Markets.--\n            (1) Requirement.--Commencing not later than six months \n        after the date of the enactment of this Act, or November 24, \n        2003, whichever is earlier, the Federal Communications \n        Commission shall require each wireless telephone service \n        provider offering service in one of the 100 largest \n        Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), as defined by the Bureau \n        of the Census, to provide consumers with the option to port \n        telephone numbers between wireless telephone service providers \n        by implementing wireless telephone number portability \n        throughout the networks of wireless telephone service providers \n        in each of such 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas.\n            (2) Requirement not dependent on other carrier request.--\n        The requirement in paragraph (1) shall be implemented in each \n        Metropolitan Statistical Area referred to in that paragraph \n        without regard to the receipt of a request from any \n        telecommunications carrier in such Metropolitan Statistical \n        Area for wireless telephone number portability.\n    (b) Other Markets.--\n            (1) Requirement.--Commencing not later than 18 months after \n        the date of the enactment of this Act, or November 24, 2004, \n        whichever is earlier, the Commission shall require each \n        wireless telephone service provider in a Metropolitan \n        Statistical Area described in paragraph (2) to provide \n        customers with the option to port their telephone number \n        between wireless telephone service providers by implementing \n        wireless telephone number portability throughout the networks \n        of wireless telephone service providers in such Metropolitan \n        Statistical Area.\n            (2) Covered metropolitan statistical areas.--A Metropolitan \n        Statistical Area described in this paragraph is a Metropolitan \n        Statistical Area not covered by subsection (a) in which three \n        or more wireless telephone services providers provide wireless \n        telephone service.\n\nSEC. 4.
