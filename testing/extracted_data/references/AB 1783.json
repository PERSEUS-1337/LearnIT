    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Following significant damage to school buildings in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, the Field Act was enacted to mandate the earthquake-resistant construction of schools.\n(b) The Division of the State Architect (DSA) reviews the design, construction, alteration, addition, and rehabilitation of K\u201312 public schools and community colleges.\n(c) The DSA also monitors the safety of nonstructural components installed in school facilities.\n(d) Implementation of the Field Act, as defined pursuant to Section 17281 of the Education Code, depends upon a complex interrelationship with dispersed responsibilities among state departments and agencies, school districts, local government building departments, educational institutions, and the construction industry.\n(e) The South Napa earthquake struck in the early morning on August 24, 2014. Structural damage to schools was minimal. However, nonstructural damage was significant and could have been life threatening had the earthquake occurred during school hours.\n(f) The earthquake highlighted dangers posed by light fixtures, unrestrained bookcases, storage units, furniture, and other similar school contents that are not subject to the Field Act\u2019s requirements.\n(g) The DSA has issued guidelines for nonstructural earthquake hazards in California schools, which include furniture and equipment. However, there are no requirements in state law similar to the requirements of the Field Act that require the DSA, local fire agencies, or school districts to inspect schools to ensure that school contents comply with the DSA nonstructural component guidelines.\n(h) School classrooms should be examined to ensure that furnishings and equipment are properly located, anchored, and braced to prevent harm to pupils and school personnel, and to ensure egress from any room after an earthquake.\nSEC. 2.\nChapter 8 (commencing with Section 17660) is added to Part 10.5 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  8.
