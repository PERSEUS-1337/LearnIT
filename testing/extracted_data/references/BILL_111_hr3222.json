FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internet is an invaluable tool that is critical to \n        the ability of the Nation to compete in a global economy. The \n        Internet provides instant access to research and boundless \n        information and connects individuals around the world.\n            (2) About 93 percent of youth ages 12 through 17 years use \n        online services regularly and nearly 45 percent of children \n        ages 3 to 11 years will use the Internet on a monthly basis in \n        2009. Eighty-nine percent of teens have a profile on social \n        networking sites. Eighty percent of teens ages 13 through 17 \n        years use cell phones, most of which have built-in cameras.\n            (3) Bullying in schools can take many forms, including \n        sending insulting, threatening, or offensive messages via \n        Internet sites, email, instant messaging, cell phone text \n        messaging, telephone, or any other electronic messaging system.\n            (4) In a recent survey, 1 in 5 teenagers stated that they \n        had used their cell phones to send explicit photos of \n        themselves to a peer, a practice commonly known as ``sexting''. \n        In most States, such conduct can subject young adults to felony \n        child pornography charges and the potential punishment of \n        registering as a sex offender.\n            (5) The Internet has facilitated the growth of a \n        multibillion dollar global market for child pornography, far \n        exceeding the capacity of law enforcement to respond at the \n        Federal, State, and local level.\n            (6) Internet safety education, coupled with technology \n        tools, is the most effective way to resolve and prevent these \n        crimes and other dangers committed on the Internet and in other \n        new media.\n            (7) According to an empirical study of 1,379 fourth grade \n        students in Virginia, the first State to mandate Internet \n        safety education in its schools, the students improved their \n        responses to 8 of 10 Internet safety scenarios after completing \n        an Internet safety education program, with the greatest \n        improvement in uncomfortable content and cyberbullying.\n            (8) The enactment of the Children's Internet Protection Act \n        (Public Law 106-554; 114 Stat. 2763A-336) mandated that schools \n        implement Internet safety policies and technology protection \n        measures in order to receive discounts to obtain affordable \n        telecommunications and Internet access. Most schools have now \n        developed acceptable use policies and have implemented \n        filtering and other technology-based solutions to help protect \n        children.\n            (9) However, less than 25 percent of educators feel \n        comfortable teaching students how to protect themselves from \n        online predators, bullies, and identity thieves, according to a \n        recent study by the National Cyber Security Alliance and \n        Educational Technology Policy, Research, and Outreach. The same \n        study found that 90 percent of educators have received less \n        than 6 hours of professional development on issues related to \n        online security in the past year. As a result, many students \n        receive little or no education on safe and responsible use of \n        the Internet and other new media.\n            (10) The widespread use of the Internet, cell phones, \n        interactive gaming, and other electronic communication devices \n        by children both inside and outside of schools suggests that \n        acceptable use policies and filtering alone cannot resolve \n        Internet safety concerns and that a greater focus on education \n        would be beneficial.\n            (11) In a national poll on children's health, parents \n        ranked Internet safety fifth among their top health concerns \n        for children. Yet according to a Common Sense Media poll \n        conducted in 2006, almost 90 percent of parents say that they \n        lack the knowledge about how to protect their children online. \n        For this reason, educating parents about Internet safety is key \n        to empowering them to understand actual risks and to take an \n        active role in protecting their children.\n            (12) The problem of online harassment, or cyberbullying, of \n        youth by other youths is widespread and results in a range of \n        children's experiences from minor irritation to severe \n        emotional harm. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has found that \n        online harassment tends to begin in third and fourth grade, \n        peaks in seventh and eighth grade, and continues in reduced \n        amounts throughout high school, college, and professional \n        school.\n            (13) Gang members increasingly are using the Internet as a \n        recruitment tool to entice would-be members and as an \n        intimidation tool to threaten rival gangs. Gang members use the \n        Internet, in particular, to promote their message.\n            (14) More research is needed in several areas of youth \n        online safety, including--\n                    (A) the prevention of minor-to-minor solicitation \n                and other inappropriate use of the Internet;\n                    (B) the prevention of the creation of problematic \n                content by youths;\n                    (C) the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \n                transgender youth and youth with disabilities that may \n                be particularly vulnerable;\n                    (D) the interplay between socioeconomic class and \n                risk factors;\n                    (E) the role that pervasive digital image and video \n                capture devices play in harassment of youth by other \n                youth and youth production of problematic content;\n                    (F) the intersection of different mobile and \n                Internet-based technologies; and\n                    (G) the online activities of registered sex \n                offenders.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) facilitate research and identify best practices in \n        Internet safety education for youth, parents, and education \n        officials; and\n            (2) establish a competitive grant program for State \n        education agencies, local educational agencies, and nonprofit \n        organizations to institute best practices relating to Internet \n        education and the research-based recommendations derived from \n        the study conducted under this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
