CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) since the devastation of Hurricane Hugo on September \n        17, 1989, insurance against windstorm damage has been difficult \n        to obtain at reasonable premium rates for many residents of the \n        United States;\n            (2) an unusual number of other catastrophic events, such as \n        Hurricane Andrew in Florida, Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii, the \n        Northridge earthquake, and more recently, Hurricanes Bertha and \n        Fran in Gulf and Atlantic Coast States, Puerto Rico, and the \n        Virgin Islands, have nearly collapsed the worldwide reinsurance \n        market, seriously limiting the ability of local insurance \n        companies to meet existing demands for continued coverage, much \n        less expand their capacity for additional coverage;\n            (3) major hurricanes and earthquakes pose substantial long-\n        term consequences for the country;\n            (4) the National Hurricane Center reports that 60 percent \n        of the United States population live in coastal States or \n        regions subject to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and \n        earthquakes;\n            (5) private sector insurance protection against property \n        damages caused by the peril of wind is generally excluded under \n        standard homeowners insurance policies sold in 7 States along \n        the Gulf and Atlantic Coast States, the Virgin Islands, and \n        Puerto Rico, and property and casualty insurers are withdrawing \n        underwriting capacity from the market by refusing to issue new \n        policies or renew existing policies, or by increasing premiums \n        to unaffordable levels; and\n            (6) new and innovative programs are required to provide a \n        limited program of property insurance protection from \n        windstorm.\n\nSEC. 3. RESIDENTIAL WINDSTORM INSURANCE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Director'') shall \nstudy the advisability and feasibility of establishing a Residential \nWindstorm Insurance Program designed to provide windstorm insurance to \nresidential property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private \nmarket.\n    (b) Purpose of Program.--The Residential Windstorm Insurance \nProgram shall--\n            (1) amend the ``Write Your Own'' Program under the National \n        Flood Insurance Program to explicitly provide insurance \n        protection against the windstorm peril;\n            (2) allow residents in wind-exposed localities across \n        America and United States territories to purchase federally \n        subsidized insurance to supplement standard homeowners \n        insurance policies sold by private insurers;\n            (3) provide windstorm insurance protection only to \n        residents in communities that have adopted and enforced the \n        land use and flood plain management provisions of the National \n        Flood Insurance Program;\n            (4) encourage the private insurance industry to sell, \n        service, and adjust Federal windstorm insurance claims under \n        their own corporate name under a nonrisk bearing arrangement \n        with the Federal Insurance Administration; and\n            (5) outline requirements under which the private sector, \n        including insurance companies, banks, and other financial \n        sector firms, could become involved in the Residential \n        Windstorm Insurance Program.\n    (c) Contents.--The Residential Windstorm Insurance Program required \nunder subsection (a) shall be designed--\n            (1) to supplement Federal disaster relief and emergency \n        assistance provided pursuant to the Robert T.
