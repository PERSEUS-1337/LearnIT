FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Wetlands perform a number of valuable functions which \n        are important to the ecological and economic well-being of the \n        Nation, including--\n                    (A) providing contributions to food and water \n                supplies, flood control, and wildlife resources;\n                    (B) maintaining biological diversity; and\n                    (C) providing natural habitats for many migratory \n                and resident fish and wildlife species, including \n                migratory birds, endangered species, and fish species \n                in commercial and recreational fisheries.\n            (2) Over two-thirds of the wetlands that once existed in \n        the State of California have been severely degraded or no \n        longer exist.\n            (3) Over nine-tenths of the wetlands that once existed in \n        the city of Los Angeles, California, have been severely \n        degraded or no longer exist.\n            (4) The Ballona Wetlands constitute the last remaining \n        wetlands ecosystem of significant proportion located in the \n        city of Los Angeles.\n            (5) The Ballona Wetlands, though significantly degraded, \n        support 185 species of birds along the Pacific Flyway.\n            (6) The Ballona Wetlands are in imminent danger of an \n        ecosystem collapse.\n            (7) If fully restored, the Ballona Wetlands could--\n                    (A) provide a major fish nursery habitat for the \n                adjoining Santa Monica Bay;\n                    (B) improve the water quality of Santa Monica Bay \n                by acting as a natural filtration system;\n                    (C) provide increased habitat for endangered \n                species and migratory birds; and\n                    (D) provide significant educational opportunities \n                regarding wetlands functions for persons in surrounding \n                urban areas.\n            (8) It should be a high priority of the Federal Government \n        to encourage the full restoration of degraded wetlands.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \ndemonstration program to encourage the full tidal restoration of the \nBallona Wetlands.\n\nSEC. 3.

Such scale shall take into account the degree \n                to which an activity will contribute to the full \n                restoration of the Ballona Wetlands and the \n                availability of other mitigation options.\n                    (B) Guidelines for use of credits.--Guidelines for \n                determining how mitigation credits awarded under the \n                demonstration program may be used in obtaining permits \n                under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution \n                Control Act. Such guidelines shall take into account \n                the relation between the ecological and economic \n                benefits of an activity for which mitigation credits \n                are to be awarded under the demonstration program and \n                the loss of habitat associated with the issuance of a \n                permit for an activity on the basis of such mitigation \n                credits.\n    (d) Limitation.--The award of mitigation credits under the \ndemonstration program to be established under subsection (a) shall not \nbe construed to constitute prior approval by any Federal or State \nagency of any application for a permit for which such credits may \nultimately be used.\n\nSEC. 5.
