FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The muscular dystrophies are devastating diseases that \n        have a significant impact on quality of life, not only for the \n        individual who experiences its painful symptoms and resulting \n        disability, but also for family members and caregivers.\n            (2) Duchenne muscular dystrophy (referred to in this \n        section as ``DMD'') is the most common lethal genetic disorder \n        of childhood worldwide, affecting approximately 1 in every \n        3,500 boys born each year around the globe. It is characterized \n        by a rapidly progressive muscle weakness that almost always \n        results in death from respiratory or cardiac failure, typically \n        in the late teens or twenties.\n            (3) Myotonic muscular dystrophy is the second most \n        prominent form of muscular dystrophy and the type most commonly \n        found in adults, affecting an estimated 1 in 8,000 people. \n        However, it can affect people of any age, from birth to old \n        age. Described as the most variable disease known in medicine, \n        it is multisystemic and can cause not only muscle atrophy and \n        myotonia, but also serious cardiac, respiratory, endocrine, \n        gastrointestinal, skeletal and central nervous system \n        complications, as well as problems with the eyes, teeth, and \n        hair. As it passes from one generation to the next, it \n        generally worsens with earlier onset. Congenital myotonic \n        muscular dystrophy is the most severe form of myotonic muscular \n        dystrophy affecting infants and causing severe cognitive \n        delays. It often causes sudden death; however, others can live \n        for many years with this slowly degenerative disorder.\n            (4) Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (referred to in \n        this section as ``FSHD'') is the second most prevalent adult \n        muscular dystrophy and the third most prevalent muscular \n        dystrophy of men, women and children. It is inherited \n        genetically and has an estimated incidence of 1 in 20,000 \n        persons. Many leading FSHD scientists note that the prevalence \n        may be 3 times higher due to undiagnosed and misdiagnosed \n        cases. FSHD, affecting between 15,000 to 40,000 persons, causes \n        a lifelong progressive and severe loss of all skeletal muscles \n        gradually bringing weakness and reduced mobility. It is \n        genetically transmitted to children, can occur spontaneously, \n        and may affect entire families. Persons with FSHD may also \n        experience hearing loss, vision problems, and respiratory \n        insufficiency; some may become severely physically disabled and \n        spend decades in a wheelchair and on a ventilator. FSHD is \n        caused by a novel epigenetic phenomenon not found in other \n        forms of muscular dystrophy and is caused by a contraction of \n        repetitive DNA previously thought to be ``junk DNA''. The \n        unique epigenetic structure of FSHD is unprecedented in other \n        muscular dystrophies and genetic disorders and demands novel \n        approaches and new research groups. Understanding this \n        mechanism will have great benefit to other areas of biomedical \n        research including cancer and other disease of epigenetic \n        origin.\n            (5) Congenital muscular dystrophies represent a group of \n        distinct diseases, which begin at birth, with varying severity \n        and involvement of both muscle strength and brain. These \n        diseases often lead to premature infant death, or severely \n        disabled young children who require 24-hour care given their \n        developmental delay compounded by muscle weakness. Other \n        children live to young adulthood and typically require the use \n        of a wheelchair for mobility.\n            (6) Forms of muscular dystrophy affecting children and \n        adults include Becker, congenital, distal, Duchenne, Emery-\n        Dreifuss, facioscapulohumeral, limb-girdle, myotonic, and \n        oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophies. The limb-girdle muscular \n        dystrophies are of 15 known different types.\n            (7) Each of the muscular dystrophies, though distinct in \n        progressivity and severity of symptoms, has a devastating \n        impact on hundreds of thousands of children and adults \n        throughout the United States and worldwide, as well as imposes \n        severe physical and economic burdens on those affected. In many \n        of the muscular dystrophies, there are associated medical \n        problems arising from pulmonary issues, respiratory \n        insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, which in many cases is the cause \n        of death for persons with muscular dystrophy.\n            (8) In the 5 years since enactment of the Muscular \n        Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research and Education \n        Amendments of 2001 (the MD-CARE Act (Public Law 107-84)), and \n        due directly to the momentum established by such Act, progress \n        has been made in the battle against the muscular dystrophies.\n            (9) Investments made by the Federal Government as a result \n        of the MD-CARE Act include the creation of the MD Coordinating \n        Committee (MDCC), the development of the MDCC Action Plan, \n        expansion of the National Institutes of Health (referred to in \n        this section as the ``NIH'') research portfolios, establishment \n        of 6 Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research \n        Centers, funding of a $15,400,000 National Institutes of Health \n        U54 grant and others focused on DMD, development of the \n        Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking and Research Network \n        (MD STARnet), and the launch of a comprehensive education and \n        outreach initiative.\n            (10) In the past few years, the NIH program in \n        translational research in muscular dystrophy has grown \n        significantly and funded a number of large-scale projects to \n        further the development of therapies for muscular dystrophy. As \n        part of this program, the National Institute of Neurological \n        Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute of \n        Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) of the \n        National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a $15,400,000, 5-\n        year cooperative agreement to develop new small molecule drugs \n        for the treatment of DMD and potentially other forms of \n        muscular dystrophy as well. The project is a unique research \n        collaboration between private, public, and nonprofit partners \n        to build upon previous research and discovery work originally \n        initiated by non-profit partners to identify new treatments for \n        muscular dystrophy. Also through the translational program, 3 \n        other major cooperative agreements have been awarded for highly \n        targeted therapy development projects in the muscular \n        dystrophies.\n            (11) Due to the initiatives made possible through the MD-\n        CARE Act, national nonprofit organizations have joined in model \n        strategic collaborations with academic research institutions, \n        public funders of muscular dystrophy research, and industry to \n        expand investments in muscular dystrophy research activities \n        and to create new platforms for translational research. These \n        have led to the development of the first potential therapies \n        for DMD, myotonic, facioscapulohumeral, limb-girdle, and other \n        conditions that are proceeding through clinical trials.\n            (12) Advancements in care have helped prolong life and \n        quality of life for patients with muscular dystrophy.\n            (13) Notwithstanding these promising developments, the \n        majority of the directions envisioned by the Action Plan for \n        the Muscular Dystrophies, developed pursuant to the MD-CARE \n        Act, have not been realized. Where recent momentum has been \n        achieved, its sustainability is fragile and directly dependent \n        upon continued Federal support for the early phase planning and \n        programs created through the MD-CARE Act.\n            (14) There remains a shortage of qualified researchers in \n        the field of muscular dystrophy research. Many family \n        physicians and health care professionals still lack the \n        knowledge and resources to detect and properly diagnose \n        muscular dystrophy as early as possible, thus delaying \n        management of symptoms in cases that go undetected or \n        misdiagnosed.\n            (15) As new understandings of the genetic basis for disease \n        and potential treatment has emerged, the public and health care \n        communities are in urgent need of education and outreach to \n        ensure competent, informed engagement in genetic testing and \n        counseling and appropriate patient characterization so that \n        patients are able to participate in new avenues of research and \n        clinical trials.\n            (16) As basic research into the muscular dystrophies points \n        the way to new therapeutic targets, there is an urgent need to \n        support the clinical research infrastructure necessary to bring \n        these therapeutic leads to human trials; these infrastructure \n        needs include validated endpoints, current natural history \n        studies, biomarkers, clinical research networks, patient \n        registries, and databases.\n            (17) In order to improve lives and develop effective \n        treatments for individuals with muscular dystrophy, there must \n        be improved communications and partnerships between patients, \n        patient advocacy, researchers, and clinical care providers. To \n        that end, renewed effort to work together by all parties is a \n        critical element for successful outcomes in the years to come.\n            (18) Continued focus and investment are required to build \n        on the current momentum, respond to public need, and ensure \n        that federally funded research and other innovation is \n        translated to therapeutic targets as quickly as possible.\n\nSEC. 3.
