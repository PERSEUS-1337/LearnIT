FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAY RUNOFF MANAGEMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 3 of title 23, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 330. Federal-aid highway runoff management program\n    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions \napply:\n            ``(1) Covered project.--The term `covered project' means a \n        reconstruction, rehabilitation, reconfiguration, renovation, \n        major resurfacing, or new construction project on a Federal-aid \n        highway carried out under this title that results in--\n                    ``(A) a 10-percent or greater increase in \n                impervious surface of the aerial extent within the \n                right-of-way of the project limit on a Federal-aid \n                highway or associated facility; or\n                    ``(B) an increase of 1 acre or more in impervious \n                surface coverage.\n            ``(2) Erosive force.--The term `erosive force' means the \n        flowrate within a stream or channel in which channel bed or \n        bank material becomes detached, which in most cases is less \n        than or equal to the flowrate produced by the 2-year storm \n        event.\n            ``(3) Highway runoff.--The term `highway runoff ', with \n        respect to a Federal-aid highway, associated facility, or \n        management measure retrofit project, means a discharge of peak \n        flow rate or volume of runoff that exceeds flows generated \n        under preproject conditions.\n            ``(4) Impacted hydrology.--The term `impacted hydrology' \n        means stormwater runoff generated from all areas within the \n        site limits of a covered project.\n            ``(5) Management measure.--The term `management measure' \n        means a program, structural or nonstructural management \n        practice, operational procedure, or policy on or off the \n        project site that is intended to prevent, reduce, or control \n        highway runoff.\n    ``(b) State Highway Stormwater Management Programs.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this section, each State shall--\n                    ``(A) develop a process for analyzing the erosive \n                force of highway runoff generated from covered \n                projects; and\n                    ``(B) apply management measures to maintain or \n                restore impacted hydrology associated with highway \n                runoff from covered projects.\n            ``(2) Inclusions.--The management measures established \n        under paragraph (1) may include, as the State determines to be \n        appropriate, management measures that--\n                    ``(A) minimize the erosive force of highway runoff \n                from a covered project on a channel bed or bank of \n                receiving water by managing highway runoff within the \n                area of the covered project;\n                    ``(B) manage impacted hydrology in such a manner \n                that the highway runoff generated by a covered project \n                is below the erosive force flow and volume;\n                    ``(C) to the maximum extent practicable, seek to \n                address the impact of the erosive force of hydrologic \n                events that have the potential to create or exacerbate \n                downstream channel erosion, including excess pier and \n                abutment scour at bridges and channel downcutting and \n                bank failure of streams adjacent to highway \n                embankments;\n                    ``(D) ensure that the highway runoff from the post-\n                construction condition does not increase the risk of \n                channel erosion relative to the preproject condition; \n                and\n                    ``(E) employ simplified approaches to determining \n                the erosive force of highway runoff generated from \n                covered projects, such as a regionalized analysis of \n                streams within a State.\n    ``(c) Guidance.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n        of enactment of this section, the Secretary, in consultation \n        with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall \n        publish guidance to assist States in carrying out this section.\n            ``(2) Contents of guidance.--The guidance shall include \n        guidelines and technical assistance for the establishment of \n        State management measures that will be used to assist in \n        avoiding, minimizing, and managing highway runoff from covered \n        projects, including guidelines to help States integrate the \n        planning, selection, design, and long-term operation and \n        maintenance of management measures consistent with the design \n        standards in the overall project planning process.\n            ``(3) Approval.--The Secretary, in consultation with the \n        heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall--\n                    ``(A) review the management measures program of \n                each State;
