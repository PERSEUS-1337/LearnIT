SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act''.\n\n          TITLE I--STATE CRIMINAL ALIEN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM II\n\nSEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram II Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Federal policies and strategies aimed at curbing \n        illegal immigration and criminal alien activity implemented \n        along our Nation's southwest border influence the number of \n        crossings, especially their location.\n            (2) States and local governments were reimbursed \n        approximately 60 percent of the costs of the incarceration of \n        criminal aliens in fiscal year 1996 when only 90 jurisdictions \n        applied for such reimbursement. In subsequent years, the number \n        of local jurisdictions receiving reimbursement has increased. \n        For fiscal year 2000, approximately 360 local jurisdictions \n        applied, and reimbursement amounted to only 40 percent of the \n        costs incurred by those jurisdictions.\n            (3) Certain counties, often with a small taxpayer base, \n        located on or near the border across from sometimes highly \n        populated areas of Mexico, suffer a substantially \n        disproportionate share of the impact of criminal illegal aliens \n        on its law enforcement and criminal justice systems.\n            (4) A University of Arizona/U.S.-Mexico Border Counties \n        Coalition study released in November 2000 reported that the 4 \n        counties located on Arizona's border of Mexico, Pima, Yuma, \n        Santa Cruz, and Cochise Counties, are burdened with this \n        problem--\n                    (A) for example, in 1999, Arizona's four border \n                counties' combined population was 1.1 million, or 17.5 \n                percent of the total population along the U.S.-Mexico \n                border, but accounted for 11 percent of alien crossings \n                and nearly 40 percent of illegal alien apprehensions \n                along the border; Santa Cruz County had 43 percent of \n                alien crossings and 16.3 percent of illegal \n                apprehensions in the State of Arizona and Cochise \n                County had 21 percent of alien crossings and 56 percent \n                of illegal apprehensions in the State of Arizona.\n                    (B) for fiscal year 1999, it is estimated that, of \n                its total criminal justice budget of $6,000,000, Santa \n                Cruz County spent $1,978,863 (33 percent) to process \n                criminal illegal aliens, of which over half was not \n                reimbursed by Federal monies; and of Cochise County's \n                total law enforcement and criminal justice budget of \n                $14.2 million, Cochise County spent an estimated $4.6 \n                million (32 percent) to apprehend and process criminal \n                illegal aliens, of which over half was not reimbursed \n                by Federal monies; and\n                    (C) Santa Cruz County and Cochise County have not \n                obtained relief from this burden, despite repeated \n                appeals to Federal and State officials.\n            (5) In the State of Texas, the border counties of Cameron, \n        Dimmit, El Paso, Hidalgo, Kinney, Val Verde, and Webb bore the \n        unreimbursed costs of apprehension, prosecution, indigent \n        defense, and other related services for criminal aliens who \n        served more than 142,000 days in county jails.\n            (6) Throughout Texas nonborder counties bore similar \n        unreimbursed costs for apprehension, prosecution, indigent \n        defense, and other related services for criminal aliens who \n        served more than 1,000,000 days in county jails.\n            (7) The State of Texas has incurred substantial additional \n        unreimbursed costs for State law enforcement efforts made \n        necessary by the presence of criminal illegal aliens.\n            (8) The Federal Government should reimburse States and \n        units of local government for the related costs incurred by the \n        State for the imprisonment of any illegal alien.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is--\n            (1) to assist States and local communities by providing \n        financial assistance for expenditures for illegal juvenile \n        aliens, and for related costs to States and units of local \n        government that suffer a substantially disproportionate share \n        of the impact of criminal illegal aliens on their law \n        enforcement and criminal justice systems; and\n            (2) to ensure equitable treatment for those States and \n        local governments that are affected by Federal policies and \nstrategies aimed at curbing illegal immigration and criminal alien \nactivity implemented on the Southwest border of the United States.\n\nSEC. 103.
