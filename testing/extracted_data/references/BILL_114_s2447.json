FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The relationship between the United States and the \n        Socialist Republic of Vietnam has grown substantially since the \n        end of the trade embargo in 1994, with annual trade between the \n        countries reaching more than $36,000,000,000 in 2014.\n            (2) However, the transition by the Government of Vietnam \n        toward greater economic activity and trade, which has led to \n        increased bilateral engagement between the United States and \n        Vietnam, has not been matched by greater political freedom or \n        substantial improvements in basic human rights for the people \n        of Vietnam.\n            (3) Vietnam remains an authoritarian state ruled by the \n        Communist Party of Vietnam, which continues to deny the right \n        of the people of Vietnam to participate in free and fair \n        elections.\n            (4) According to the Department of State's 2014 Country \n        Reports on Human Rights Practices, Vietnam's ``most significant \n        human rights problems . . . were severe government restrictions \n        of citizens' political rights, particularly their right to \n        change their government through free and fair elections; limits \n        on citizens' civil liberties, including freedom of assembly and \n        expression; and inadequate protection of citizens' due process \n        rights, including protection against arbitrary detention''.\n            (5) The Country Reports also state that the Government of \n        Vietnam ``continued to restrict speech that criticized \n        individual government leaders; promoted political pluralism or \n        multi-party democracy; or questioned policies on sensitive \n        matters, such as human rights, religious freedom, or \n        sovereignty disputes with China'' and ``sought to impede \n        criticism by monitoring meetings and communications of \n        political activists''.\n            (6) Furthermore, the Department of State documents that \n        ``arbitrary arrest and detention, particularly for political \n        activists, remained a problem'', with the Government of Vietnam \n        sentencing 29 arrested activists during 2014. Of those, 6 \n        activists were convicted on national security charges in the \n        penal code for ``undermining the unity policy'', 17 for \n        ``causing public disorder'', and 6 for ``abusing democratic \n        freedoms''.\n            (7) At the end of 2014, the Government of Vietnam \n        reportedly held more than 125 political prisoners.\n            (8) On September 24, 2012, 3 prominent Vietnamese \n        bloggers--Nguyen Van Hai (also known as Dieu Cay), Ta Phong \n        Tan, and Phan Thanh Hai (also known as Anh Ba Saigon)--were \n        sentenced to prison based on 3-year-old blog postings \n        criticizing the Government and leaders of Vietnam and the \n        Communist Party of Vietnam. Nguyen Van Hai served 2 years of a \n        12-year prison sentence on charges of ``conducting propaganda \n        against the state'' but was later released and departed from \n        Vietnam. If he were to return, he would likely have to complete \n        his prison sentence.\n            (9) United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi \n        Pillay responded to the sentencing of the bloggers on September \n        25, 2012, stating that ``[t]he harsh prison terms handed down \n        to bloggers exemplify the severe restrictions on freedom of \n        expression in Vietnam'' and calling the sentences an \n        ``unfortunate development that undermines the commitments \n        Vietnam has made internationally . . . to protect and promote \n        the right to freedom of expression''.\n            (10) On March 21, 2013, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State \n        for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Daniel B. Baer testified \n        before the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of \n        the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that ``in \n        Vietnam we've been disappointed in recent years to see \n        backsliding, particularly on . . . freedom of expression issues \n        . . . people are being prosecuted for what they say online \n        under really draconian national security laws . . . that is an \n        issue that we continue to raise, both in our human rights \n        dialogue with the Vietnamese as well as in other bilateral \n        engagements''.\n            (11) Although the Constitution of Vietnam provides for \n        freedom of religion, the Department of State's 2013 \n        International Religious Freedom Report maintains, ``Government \n        practices and bureaucratic impediments restricted religious \n        freedom. Unregistered and unrecognized religious groups were \n        often subject to harassment, as well as coercive and punitive \n        actions by authorities.''.\n            (12) Likewise, the United States Commission on \n        International Religious Freedom 2015 Annual Report states, \n        ``The Vietnamese government continues to control all religious \n        activities through law and administrative oversight, restrict \n        severely independent religious practice, and repress \n        individuals and religious groups it views as challenging its \n        authority, including independent Buddhists, Hoa Hao, Cao Dai, \n        Catholics, and Protestants.''.\n            (13) The 2013 Annual Report notes that in 2004 the United \n        States designated Vietnam as a country of particular concern \n        for religious freedom pursuant to section 402(b)(1) of the \n        International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. \n        6442(b)(1)), and that Vietnam responded at that time by \n        releasing prisoners, prohibiting the policy of forced \n        renunciations of faith, and expanding protections for religious \n        groups, and that ``[m]ost religious leaders in Vietnam \n        attributed these positive changes to the [country of particular \n        concern] designation and the priority placed on religious \n        freedom concerns in U.S.-Vietnamese bilateral relations''.\n            (14) However, the 2013 Annual Report concludes that since \n        the designation as a country of particular concern was lifted \n        from Vietnam in 2006, ``religious freedom conditions in Vietnam \n        remain mixed'', and therefore recommends to the Department of \n        State that Vietnam should be redesignated as a country of \n        particular concern.\n            (15) Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Baer likewise \n        testified that ``[i]n Vietnam the right to religious freedom, \n        which seemed to be improving several years ago, has been \n        stagnant for several years''.\n\nSEC. 3.
