    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Joint Antitrust Consultative \nCommission Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Antitrust laws are an important legal tool for opening \n        markets to international competition and defusing trade \n        tension.\n            (2) All nations should make it a priority to enact and \n        vigorously enforce strong competition laws to benefit \n        consumers, encourage international competition and foster \n        growth in jobs, productivity, and investment.\n            (3) Japanese antimonopoly law is similar to United States \n        antitrust law, partly as a result of its formulation during \n        America's post-World War II occupation of Japan. However, there \n        are observable differences in the respective antitrust \n        enforcement environments of Japan and the United States.\n            (4) In Japan--\n                    (A) the lenient interpretation and enforcement of \n                the antimonopoly law is insufficient to prevent \n                business practices which result in significant barriers \n                to foreign entry into the Japanese market;\n                    (B) private antitrust lawsuits are very difficult \n                to file and virtually impossible to win in Japan \n                because of strict requirements stipulating proof of \n                damages;\n                    (C) due to political and bureaucratic pressures, \n                criminal prosecution of antitrust violations rarely \n                occurs in Japan;\n                    (D) many cartels are exempted and legal under the \n                antimonopoly law in Japan. The large number of exempted \n                and legal cartels contributes to an environment in \n                which illegal cartels become less subject to criticism \n                and scrutiny; and\n                    (E) the Japan Fair Trade Commission's capacity to \n                enforce antimonopoly law is limited by the small size \n                of its staff and the status of the Commission in the \n                hierarchy of Japanese bureaucracies.\n            (5) In the United States--\n                    (A) corporations may be apprehensive about \n                participating in certain business activities such as \n                joint ventures or exclusive distributorship \n                arrangements due to uncertainties concerning the \n                enforcement of antitrust law; and\n                    (B) the cost of antitrust litigation, including the \n                risk of treble damages, may have a negative impact on \n                United States corporate competitiveness.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to encourage a review of the antitrust policies of \n        Japan and the United States in the context of a changing global \n        economy and to foster ways of improving competition in both \n        countries;\n            (2) to encourage the Japan Fair Trade Commission and the \n        United States Department of Justice and United States Federal \n        Trade Commission toward more comparable levels of enforcement \n        activity;\n            (3) to ensure that the Japan Fair Trade Commission \n        increasingly enforces the antimonopoly law based upon antitrust \n        principles of protecting competition;\n            (4) to encourage Japan to end unfair business practices \n        that result in market foreclosure to foreign competition;\n            (5) to increase awareness of criminal antitrust enforcement \n        as a means of addressing anticompetitive business behavior in \n        Japan;\n            (6) to encourage the government of Japan to increase the \n        investigative power of the Japan Fair Trade Commission; and\n            (7) to encourage the government of Japan to reduce the \n        number of cartels exempted from the antimonopoly law.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            ``antimonopoly law'' means codes enforced by the Japan Fair \n        Trade Commission to promote fair and free competition by \n        prohibiting private monopolization, unreasonable restraint of \n        trade, and unfair business practices.\n            ``antitrust policy'' means the general principles by which \n        government is guided in maintaining competition in commercial \n        activities.\n            ``antitrust law'' means the body of statutes, court \n        decisions, and other law designed to ensure the existence of \n        competition in commercial activities. Antitrust law in the \n        United States protects trade and commerce from unlawful \n        restraints such as price fixing, exclusive dealings, and \n        monopolies.\n            ``Commission'' means the United States-Japan Joint \n        Antitrust Consultative Commission established by section 5.\n\nSEC. 5.
