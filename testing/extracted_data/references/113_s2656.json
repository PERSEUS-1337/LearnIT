PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the uses of chemical \nsubstances, for which there is evidence of persistence, \nbioaccumulation, toxicity, and exposure to humans or the environment, \nare limited to those uses that are critical or essential.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Chemical substance.--The term ``chemical substance'' \n        has the meaning given the term in section 3 of the Toxic \n        Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2602).\n\nSEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION AND RESTRICTION OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE, \n              AND TOXIC CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES.\n\n    (a) Identification.--\n            (1) Criteria.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the \n                date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall \n                establish, by rule, criteria to identify chemical \n                substances that--\n                            (i)(I) are persistent, bioaccumulative, and \n                        toxic; or\n                            (II) are transformed through metabolism or \n                        environmental degradation into chemical \n                        substances that are persistent, \n                        bioaccumulative, and toxic; and\n                            (ii) for which there is evidence of \n                        exposure or likely exposure to humans or the \n                        environment.\n                    (B) Considerations.--In establishing the criteria \n                pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall \n                consider a chemical substance--\n                            (i) to be bioaccumulative if, based on \n                        monitoring data or other evidence, the \n                        Administrator determines that a chemical \n                        substance significantly accumulates or is \n                        likely to significantly accumulate in biota;\n                            (ii) to be persistent if the Administrator \n                        determines that the chemical substance \n                        significantly persists or is likely to \n                        significantly persist in 1 or more \n                        environmental media, including the indoor \n                        environment; and\n                            (iii) to be toxic if the Administrator \n                        determines that the chemical substance \n                        demonstrates or is likely to demonstrate 1 or \n                        more toxicological properties in humans or \n                        animals.\n                    (C) Revisions.--The Administrator may, by rule, \n                revise the criteria established pursuant to this \n                paragraph to reflect the best available science and \n                provide for equal or greater protection of human health \n                and the environment.\n            (2) List.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the \n                date on which the rule under paragraph (1) is \n                finalized, the Administrator shall, by order, publish a \n                list of all chemical substances that meet those \n                criteria, based on information available to the \n                Administrator.\n                    (B) Updates.--Not less frequently than once every 3 \n                years after the initial publication of the list under \n                subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall update and \n                republish the list to incorporate new information that \n                becomes available to the Administrator.\n            (3) Prior evidence.--The following chemical substances are \n        considered, on the basis of existing evidence, to meet the \n        criteria established under paragraph (1):\n                    (A) Anthracene, pure.\n                    (B) Asbestos.\n                    (C) Cadmium and cadmium compounds.\n                    (D) Chloroalkanes, C10-13 (short-chain chlorinated \n                paraffins).\n                    (E) p-Dichlorobenzene.\n                    (F) Hexabromocyclododecane, including all major \n                diastereomers.\n                    (G) Hexachlorobutadiene.\n                    (H) Lead and lead compounds.\n                    (I) Mercury and mercury compounds.\n                    (J) Musk xylene.\n                    (K) Pentachlorobenzene.\n                    (L) Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, its salts, and \n                perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride.\n                    (M) Phenanthrene.\n                    (N) Polybrominated biphenyls.\n                    (O) Polybrominated diphenylethers.\n                    (P) Polychlorinated terphenyls.\n                    (Q) Tetrabromobisphenol A.\n                    (R) 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene.\n                    (S) 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene.\n                    (T) 1,2,3,4-Tetrachlorobenzene.\n                    (U) 1,2,4,5-Tetrachlorobenzene.\n    (b) Restrictions.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, for chemical substances listed in subsection \n(a)(3), and not later than 1 year after the date on which the \nAdministrator identifies a chemical substance pursuant to subsection \n(a)(2), the Administrator shall by order--\n            (1) identify the allowed uses, if any, of each such \n        chemical substance, pursuant to subsection (c);\n            (2) specify an effective date by which manufacture, \n        processing, and distribution in commerce of the chemical \n        substance for any uses not identified in paragraph (1) are \n        required to cease, with such effective date not to exceed 5 \n        years from the date of the allowable use determination;\n            (3) identify any conditions on the manufacture, processing, \n        use, distribution in commerce, and disposal of the chemical \n        substance applicable to the allowed uses that the Administrator \n        determines are needed to protect public health and the \n        environment, with which manufacturers and processors of the \n        chemical substance must comply as of the effective date \n        specified by the Administrator under paragraph (2); and\n            (4) make public the determination of the Administrator \n        under this subsection, including--\n                    (A) the basis for the determination;\n                    (B) a list of allowed uses of the chemical \n                substance;
