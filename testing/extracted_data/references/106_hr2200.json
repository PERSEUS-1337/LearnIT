EMERGENCY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE, RIGHT OF EGRESS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 41717. Airline passenger rights\n    ``(a) Right to In-Flight Emergency Medical Care.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n        issue regulations to establish minimum standards for \n        resuscitation, emergency medical, and first-aid equipment and \n        supplies to be carried on board an aircraft operated by an air \n        carrier in air transportation that is capable of carrying at \n        least 30 passengers.\n            ``(2) Considerations.--In issuing regulations under \n        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider--\n                    ``(A) the weight and size of the equipment \n                described in paragraph (1);\n                    ``(B) the need for special training of air carrier \n                personnel to operate the equipment safely and \n                effectively;\n                    ``(C) the space limitations of each type of \n                aircraft;\n                    ``(D) the effect of the regulations on aircraft \n                operations;\n                    ``(E) the practical experience of airlines in \n                carrying and operating similar equipment; and\n                    ``(F) other relevant factors.\n            ``(3) Consultation.--Before issuing regulations under \n        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the Surgeon \n        General.\n    ``(b) Right To Exit Aircraft.--No air carrier or foreign air \ncarrier operating an aircraft in air transportation shall prevent or \nhinder (including by failing to assist) any passenger from exiting the \naircraft (under the same circumstances as any member of the flight crew \nis permitted to exit the aircraft) if--\n            ``(1) the aircraft is parked at an airport terminal gate \n        with access to ramp or other facilities through which \n        passengers are customarily boarded and deplaned;\n            ``(2) the aircraft has remained at the gate more than 1 \n        hour past its scheduled departure time;\n            ``(3) the captain of the aircraft has not been informed by \n        air traffic control authorities that the aircraft can be \n        cleared for departure within 15 minutes.''.\n\nSEC. 5. ENSURING CONSUMER ACCESS TO TRAVEL INFORMATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The continued success of a deregulated airline system \n        requires that consumers have full access to complete \n        information concerning airline fares, routes, and other \n        services.\n            (2) The means of distributing information about the \n        products and services of the airline industry are changing; \n        during the past four years, airlines have begun selling a \n        larger percentage of their products and services directly to \n        consumers, and Internet businesses are now offering services \n        that allow consumers to compare prices for these products and \n        services.\n            (3) Airline policies with respect to travel agencies, who \n        historically have sold a majority of the airline industry's \n        products and services, threaten the ability of consumers to \n        gather the information necessary to evaluate market prices, \n        routes, and services.\n            (4) Further reductions in the number of travel agents and \n        greater marketplace reliance on direct airline sales may result \n        in a marketplace in which consumers lack sufficient information \n        and are thereby forced to pay higher prices.\n    (b) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be known \nas the ``National Commission to Ensure Consumer Information and Choice \nin the Airline Industry'' (hereinafter in this section referred to as \nthe ``Commission'').\n    (c) Duties.--\n            (1) Study.--The Commission shall undertake a study of--\n                    (A) consumer access to information about the \n                products and services of the airline industry;\n                    (B) the effect on the marketplace of the emergence \n                of new means of distributing such products and \n                services;\n                    (C) the effect on consumers of the declining \n                financial condition of travel agents in the United \n                States; and\n                    (D) the impediments imposed by the airline industry \n                on distributors of the industry's products and \n                services, including travel agents and Internet-based \n                distributors.\n            (2) Policy recommendations.--Based on the results of the \n        study described in paragraph (1), the Commission shall \n        recommend to the President and Congress policies necessary--\n                    (A) to ensure full consumer access to complete \n                information concerning airline fares, routes, and other \n                services;\n                    (B) to ensure that the means of distributing the \n                products and services of the airline industry, and of \n                disseminating information about such products and \n                services, is adequate to ensure that competitive \n                information is available in the marketplace;\n                    (C) to ensure that distributors of the products and \n                services of the airline industry have adequate relief \n                from illegal, anticompetitive practices that occur in \n                the marketplace; and\n                    (D) to foster healthy competition in the airline \n                industry and the entry of new entrants.\n    (d) Specific Matters To Be Addressed.--In carrying out the study \nauthorized under subsection (c)(1), the Commission shall specifically \naddress the following:\n            (1) Consumer access to information.--With respect to \n        consumer access to information regarding the services and \n        products offered by the airline industry:\n                    (A) The state of such access.\n                    (B) The effect in the next 5 years of the making of \n                alliances in the airline industry.\n                    (C) Whether and to what degree the trends regarding \n                such access will produce benefits to consumers.\n            (2) Means of distribution.--With respect to the means of \n        distributing the products and services of the airline industry:\n                    (A) The state of such means of distribution.\n                    (B) The roles played by travel agencies and \n                Internet-based providers of travel information and \n                services in distributing such products and services.\n                    (C) Whether the policies of the United States \n                promote the access of consumers to multiple means of \n                distribution.\n            (3) Airline reservation systems.--With respect to airline \n        reservation systems:\n                    (A) The rules, regulations, policies, and practices \n                of the industry governing such systems.\n                    (B) How trends in such systems will affect \n                consumers, including--\n                            (i) the effect on consumer access to flight \n                        reservation information; and\n                            (ii) the effect on consumers of the use by \n                        the airline industry of penalties and \n                        promotions to convince distributors to use such \n                        systems, and the degree of consumer awareness \n                        of such penalties and promotions.\n            (4) Legal impediments to distributors seeking relief for \n        anticompetitive actions.--The policies of the United States \n        with respect to the legal impediments to distributors seeking \n        relief for anticompetitive actions, including--\n                    (A) Federal preemption of civil actions against \n                airlines; and\n                    (B) the role of the Department of Transportation in \n                enforcing rules against anticompetitive practices.\n    (e) Membership.--\n            (1) Appointment.--The Commission shall be composed of 15 \n        voting members and 11 nonvoting members as follows:\n                    (A) 5 voting members and 1 nonvoting member \n                appointed by the President.\n                    (B) 3 voting members and 3 nonvoting members \n                appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n                Representatives.\n                    (C) 2 voting members and 2 nonvoting members \n                appointed by the minority leader of the House of \n                Representatives.\n                    (D) 3 voting members and 3 nonvoting members \n                appointed by the majority leader of the Senate.\n                    (E) 2 voting members and 2 nonvoting members \n                appointed by the minority leader of the Senate\n            (2) Qualifications.--Voting members appointed pursuant to \n        paragraph (1) shall be appointed from among individuals who are \n        experts in economics, service product distribution, or \n        transportation, or any related discipline, and who can \n        represent consumers, passengers, shippers, travel agents, \n        airlines, or general aviation.\n            (3) Terms.--Members shall be appointed for the life of the \n        Commission.\n            (4) Vacancies.--A vacancy in the Commission shall be filled \n        in the manner in which the original appointment was made.\n            (5) Travel expenses.--Members shall serve without pay but \n        shall receive travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of \n        subsistence, in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 57 of \n        title 5, United States Code.\n            (6) Chairman.--The President, in consultation with the \n        Speaker of the House of Representatives and the majority leader \n        of the Senate, shall designate the Chairman of the Commission \n        from among its voting members.\n    (f) Commission Panels.--The Chairman shall establish such panels \nconsisting of voting members of the Commission as the Chairman \ndetermines appropriate to carry out the functions of the Commission.\n    (g) Staff.--The Commission may appoint and fix the pay of such \npersonnel as it considers appropriate.\n    (h) Staff of Federal Agencies.--Upon request of the Commission, the \nhead of any department or agency of the United States may detail, on a \nreimbursable basis, any of the personnel of that department or agency \nto the Commission to assist it in carrying out its duties under this \nsection.\n    (i) Other Staff and Support.--Upon the request of the Commission, \nor a panel of the Commission, the Secretary of Transportation shall \nprovide the Commission or panel with professional and administrative \nstaff and other support, on a reimbursable basis, to assist the \nCommission or panel in carrying out its responsibilities.\n    (j) Obtaining Official Data.--The Commission may secure directly \nfrom any department or agency of the United States information (other \nthan information required by any statute of the United States to be \nkept confidential by such department or agency) necessary for the \nCommission to carry out its duties under this section.
