EPA STUDIES.\n\n    (a) Study of State Health-Based Cleanup Laws.--\n            (1) Study.--The Administrator shall conduct a study of \n        State laws and standards that are based on health for the \n        cleanup of sites at which any hazardous substance was released \n        or disposed of. In conducting the study, the Administrator \n        shall consider reports prepared by the Association of State \n        Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials and the \n        Environmental Law Institute.\n            (2) Recommendations to states.--As part of the study, the \n        Administrator shall make recommendations to the States on \n        health-based cleanup standards. Such recommendations shall \n        include guidance to the States on the development of health-\n        based standards for sites located in urban areas which are more \n        or less restrictive depending on the future use of the site. \n        Such guidance shall address the issue of whether facilities to \n        be used for parking lots, warehouses, industrial parks, or \n        other similar purposes need to be cleaned up as extensively as \n        sites to be used for residential and retail purposes. In \n        developing the guidance, the Administrator shall consider \n        programs in Michigan that place different restrictions on \n        different kinds of development at sites. The guidance also \n        shall encourage States to place restrictions on future uses of \n        sites to those uses which are consistent with whatever health-\n        based standards are applied at the sites.\n            (3) Report to congress.--The Administrator shall submit to \n        Congress a report on the study and the recommendations to \n        States not later than 12 months after the date of the enactment \n        of this Act.\n    (b) Study on State Property Transfer Laws.--\n            (1) Study.--The Administrator shall conduct a study on \n        property transfer laws of the States to evaluate such laws and \n        assess the merits of such laws. In conducting the study, the \n        Administrator shall address the issue of whether such laws \n        promote better land management practices, whether such laws \n        help locate sites on which hazardous substances have been \n        released or disposed of, and whether such laws provide better \n        protection for the buyer.\n            (2) Recommendations to states.--As part of the study, the \n        Administrator shall make recommendations to the States on \n        property transfer laws.\n            (3) Report to congress.--The Administrator shall submit to \n        Congress a report on the study not later than 12 months after \n        the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. EPA SUPERFUND INVENTORY DATA BASE.\n\n    (a) Requirement.--The Administrator shall establish and maintain in \na computer data base a national superfund site inventory. The data \nshall be available by computer at local libraries.\n    (b) Information To Be Included.--The data to be made available in \nthe data base shall include information on any Federal action at a site \nor facility at which a hazardous substance was released or disposed of. \nSuch information shall indicate, at a minimum, whether the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has conducted a preliminary site \nevaluation with respect to each site listed in the inventory, whether \nfurther Federal action has been determined to be warranted, and whether \nthe site is on the National Priorities List.\n\nSEC. 4. SPECIAL SUPERFUND PROGRAM FOR TARGETED INDUSTRIAL SITES.\n\n    (a) Targeted Sites.--For purposes of this section, the \nAdministrator shall prepare a list of superfund sites located in urban \nareas that would be suitable for economic development. Such sites shall \nbe referred to in this section as ``targeted sites''.\n    (b) Pilot Study of Use of Innovative Technology.--Not later than \none year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator \nshall develop and begin to carry out a pilot study of the effectiveness \nof innovative and cost effective technologies for conducting response \nactions at targeted sites. The Administrator shall include in the pilot \nstudy only those targeted sites that are vacant and not likely to be \nused in the near future.\n    (c) Covenant Not To Sue for Sites Purchased for Economic \nDevelopment.--(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), in any case in \nwhich a person, including a city, purchases a targeted site for the \npurpose of economic development, the Administrator may provide a \ncovenant not to sue such person concerning any liability to the United \nStates under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \nand Liability Act of 1980, including future liability, resulting from a \nrelease or threatened release of a hazardous substance at such site. \nAny such covenant not to sue shall not apply with respect to any \nrelease or threatened release which is caused by conduct of the person \nwhich is negligent.\n    (2) A covenant not to sue with respect to a site shall not take \neffect under paragraph (1) unless the person enters into an agreement \nwith the Administrator to complete remedial action at the site in \naccordance with the National Contingency Plan.\n    (3) A covenant not to sue a person concerning future liability to \nthe United States under paragraph (1) shall include an exception to the \ncovenant that allows the Administrator to sue such person concerning \nfuture liability resulting from the release or threatened release that \nis the subject of the covenant where such liability arises out of \nconditions which are unknown at the time the Administrator enters into \nan agreement under paragraph (2) with respect to completion of remedial \naction at the site concerned.\n    (d) Preference for Cleanup at Targeted Sites.--In determining which \nsites to give priority for response action under the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the \nAdministrator shall give preference to targeted sites that are located \nin the most populous areas, pose the greatest threat to human health, \nand have the greatest potential for economic development.\n\nSEC. 5. EXPEDITED DECISIONS ON SUPERFUND SITES IN CERTAIN DISTRESSED \n              CITIES.\n\n    (a) Right to Petition.--Any city within whose jurisdiction is \nlocated a targeted site (contained on the list prepared pursuant to \nsection 4(a)) may petition the Administrator for an expedited decision \non whether a targeted site within the city will be placed on the \nNational Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental \nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980.\n    (b) Requirements.--After a city submits a petition under subsection \n(a) with respect to a site, the Administrator shall require the owner \nor other potentially responsible party at the site concerned to \nprepare, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, a \npreliminary assessment and evaluation of the site. Not later than 12 \nmonths after such assessment and evaluation are completed, the \nAdministrator shall review the assessment and evaluation and determine \nwhether the site should be placed on the National Priorities List. If \nthe Administrator determines the site should not be placed on the List, \nthe Administrator shall issue a certificate stating that the site is \nnot a Superfund site.\n\nSEC. 6.
