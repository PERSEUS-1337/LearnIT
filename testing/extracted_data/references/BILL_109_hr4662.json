FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) telephone records can be of great use to criminals \n        because the information contained in call logs listed in such \n        records include a wealth of personal information;\n            (2) many call logs reveal the names of many users' doctors, \n        public and private relationships, business associates, and \n        more;\n            (3) although other personal information, such as social \n        security numbers may appear in public documents, which can be \n        accessed by data brokers, the only warehouse of telephone \n        records is located at the telephone companies themselves; and\n            (4) telephone records may be accessed without authorization \n        of the customer by--\n                    (A) an employee of the telephone company selling \n                the data;\n                    (B) ``pretexting'', whereby a data broker or other \n                person pretends to be the owner of the phone and \n                convinces the telephone company's employees to release \n                the data to them; or\n                    (C) unauthorized access of accounts via the \n                Internet; and\n            (5) because telephone companies encourage customers to \n        manage their accounts online, many set up the online capability \n        in advance. Many customers never access their Internet \n        accounts, however. If someone seeking the information activates \n        the account before the customer, he or she can gain unfettered \n        access to the telephone records and call logs of that customer.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OF \n              TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Obtaining Customer Information by False \nPretenses.--It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain or attempt to \nobtain, or cause to be disclosed or attempt to cause to be disclosed to \nany person, customer proprietary network information relating to any \nother person by--\n            (1) making a false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or \n        representation to an officer, employee, or agent of a \n        telecommunications carrier; or\n            (2) by providing, through any means including the Internet, \n        any document or other information to a telecommunications \n        carrier or an officer, employee, or agent of a \n        telecommunications carrier, knowing that the document or other \n        information is forged, counterfeit, lost, or stolen, was \n        obtained fraudulently or without the customer's consent, or \n        contains a false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or \n        representation.\n    (b) Prohibition on Solicitation of a Person to Obtain Customer \nInformation Under False Pretenses.--It shall be unlawful to request a \nperson to obtain customer proprietary network information of a \ntelecommunications carrier, knowing that the person will obtain, or \nattempt to obtain, the information from the telecommunications carrier \nin the manner described in subsection (a).\n    (c) Prohibition on Sale or Other Disclosure of Customer Information \nObtained Under False Pretenses.--It shall be unlawful for any person to \nsell customer proprietary network information relating to any other \nperson, knowing that such information was obtained in the manner \ndescribed in subsection (a).\n    (d) Nonapplicability to Law Enforcement Agencies.--No provision of \nthis section shall be construed so as to prevent any action by a law \nenforcement agency, or any officer, employee, or agent of such agency, \nto obtain customer proprietary network information of a \ntelecommunications carrier in connection with the performance of \nofficial duties of the agency.\n\nSEC. 4. TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT.\n\n    Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 222) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i); and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (g) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(h) Notice of Violations.--The Commission shall by regulation \nrequire each telecommunications carrier to notify the customer of any \nincidents in which such telecommunications carrier becomes or is made \naware in which customer proprietary network information relating to \nsuch customer is disclosed to someone other than the customer in \nviolation of this section or section 3 of the Consumer Telephone \nRecords Protection Act of 2006.''.\n\nSEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.\n\n    A violation of section 3 shall be treated as an unfair or deceptive \nact or practice in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade \nCommission Act (15 U.S.C. 45). All of the functions and powers of the \nFederal Trade Commission under that Act are available to the Commission \nto enforce compliance by any person with such section, irrespective of \nwhether that person is engaged in commerce or meets any other \njurisdictional tests in the Federal Trade Commission Act, including the \npower to enforce the provisions of such section in the same manner as \nif the violation had been a violation of a Federal Trade Commission \ntrade regulation rule.\n\nSEC. 6. CRIMINAL PENALTY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Whoever knowingly and intentionally violates \nsection 3 shall be fined in accordance with title 18, United States \nCode, or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both.\n    (b) Enhanced Penalties for Aggravated Cases.--Whoever violates \nsection 3 while violating another law of the United States or as part \nof a pattern of any illegal activity involving more than $100,000, or \nmore than 50 customers of a telecommunications carrier, in a 12-month \nperiod shall be fined twice the amount provided in section 3571 of \ntitle 18, or imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both.\n\nSEC. 7.
