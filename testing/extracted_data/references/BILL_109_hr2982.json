FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Communications Act of 1934 grants the Federal \n        Communications Commission permission to organize ``integrated \n        bureaus'' and ``other divisional organizations'' for the \n        purpose of assisting the Commission in its principal workload.\n            (2) The Federal Communications Commission originally \n        created and organized its bureaus at a time when individual \n        companies offered single, discreet telecommunications services.\n            (3) New communications technologies enable a single company \n        to offer a variety of services (such as cable companies \n        offering video, voice, and data).\n            (4) The organization of the Federal Communications \n        Commission's bureaus based on the type of technology is an \n        obsolete model and is no longer relevant since new technologies \n        provide multiple services.\n\nSEC. 3.
