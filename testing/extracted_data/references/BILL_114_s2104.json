FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the IMPACT Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-185), \n        Congress recognized the potential effects of socioeconomic \n        status and dual eligible populations on the Medicare Advantage \n        STARS rating system by requesting the Assistant Secretary of \n        Planning and Evaluation in the Department of Health and Human \n        Services undertake studies on this population and the Medicare \n        program.\n            (2) Studies published in the past year have shown the need \n        for an interim policy until the comprehensive results of the \n        studies undertaken as part of the IMPACT Act of 2014 are \n        published. An adjustment for 2016 is necessary while Congress \n        continues to work to achieve an appropriate policy for a \n        temporary bridge until the results from the studies undertaken \n        by the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Evaluation in the \n        Department of Health and Human Services under such Act are \n        finalized.\n\nSEC. 3.
