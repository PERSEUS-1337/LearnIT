    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) California relies on private nonprofit colleges and universities accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) to help meet the state\u2019s higher education needs.\n(b) The maximum award for Cal Grant students attending WASC accredited private nonprofit colleges and universities has not increased since its maximum of $9,708 in 1999:\n(1) It was cut by almost 15 percent for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 cohorts.\n(2) It was cut by 5 percent for new and renewal students for the 2012\u201313 award year, and by an additional 1.5 percent in the 2013\u201314 award year. It is scheduled for an additional cut of 11.3 percent in the 2015\u201316 award year for new awardees.\n(3) If the 2000 Cal Grant maximum award had kept up with the rate of inflation, the 2014 award level would be $13,346.\n(4) The proposed maximum award for the 2015\u201316 award year will be the lowest amount California has invested in academically qualified, low-income students that attend private nonprofit WASC accredited institutions since the 1997\u201398 academic year.\n(c) The Cal Grant Program effectively and successfully helps California\u2019s private nonprofit colleges and universities to recruit, retain, and graduate historically underrepresented students from low-income California families.\n(d) Predictable and stable funding formulas and eligibility requirements ensure that the state maximizes its investment by allowing families to better plan and pay for higher education, in addition to incentivizing private nonprofit colleges and universities to enroll more low-income Californians.\n(e) Legislative action is needed to adopt a reasonable and viable formula that supports predictability and parity for California students at private nonprofit colleges.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 66021.2 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n66021.2.\nConsistent with the state\u2019s historic commitment to provide educational opportunity by ensuring both student access to and
