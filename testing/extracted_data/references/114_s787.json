FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Technical Information Service (referred to \n        in this Act as ``NTIS''), the National Archives and Records \n        Administration, the Government Accountability Office (referred \n        to in this Act as ``GAO''), and the Library of Congress all \n        collect, categorize, and distribute government information.\n            (2) NTIS was established in 1950, more than 40 years before \n        the creation of the Internet.\n            (3) NTIS is tasked with collecting and distributing \n        government-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and \n        business-related information and reports.\n            (4) GAO found that NTIS sold only 8 percent of the \n        2,500,000 reports in its collection between 1995 and 2000.\n            (5) A November 2012 GAO review of NTIS made the following \n        conclusions:\n                    (A) ``Of the reports added to NTIS's repository \n                during fiscal years 1990 through 2011, GAO estimates \n                that approximately 74 percent were readily available \n                from other public sources.''.\n                    (B) ``These reports were often available either \n                from the issuing organization's website, the Federal \n                Internet portal (http://www.USA.gov) or from another \n                source located through a web search.''.\n                    (C) ``The source that most often had the report \n                [GAO] was searching for was another website located \n                through http://www.Google.com.''.\n                    (D) ``95 percent of the reports available from \n                sources other than NTIS were available free of \n                charge.''.\n            (6) No Federal agency should use taxpayer dollars to \n        purchase a report from the National Technical Information \n        Service that is available through the Internet for free.\n            (7) In 1999, Secretary of Commerce William Daley--\n                    (A) admitted that the National Technical \n                Information Service would eventually outlive its \n                usefulness and be unable to sustain its revenue-losing \n                profit model;\n                    (B) explained that ``declining sales revenues soon \n                would not be sufficient to recover all of NTIS' \n                operating costs''; and\n                    (C) attributed this ``decline to other agencies' \n                practice of making their research results available to \n                the public for free through the Web''.\n            (8) According to the November 2012 GAO report referred to \n        in paragraph (5)--\n                    (A) ``NTIS product expenditures exceeded revenues \n                for 10 out of the past 11 fiscal years.'';\n                    (B) ``The agency lost, on average, about $1.3 \n                million over the last 11 years on its products.''; and\n                    (C) ``The decline in revenue for its products \n                continues to call into question whether NTIS's basic \n                statutory function of acting as a self-financing \n                repository and disseminator of scientific and technical \n                information is still viable.''.\n            (9) NTIS has compensated for its lost revenue by charging \n        other Federal agencies for various services that are not \n        associated with NTIS's primary mission.\n            (10) Future technological advances will ensure that the \n        services offered by NTIS are even more superfluous for \n        essential government functions than they are today.\n\nSEC. 3.

and\n                            (ii) provides the rationale for determining \n                        that such activities or functions are critical \n                        to the national economy.\n            (3) Defined term.--As used in this subsection, an activity \n        or function that is ``critical to the national economy'' \n        promotes the economic growth of the United States by providing \n        access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery.\n    (c) Repository of Nonclassified Information.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to \n        continue to maintain a permanent repository of nonclassified \n        scientific, technical, and engineering information that \n        contains reports that are scientific, technical, or engineering \n        in nature.\n            (2) Item to be included.--\n                    (A) In general.--All Federal entities shall send \n                electronic copies of all nonclassified scientific, \n                technical, and engineering reports and information to \n                the Department of Commerce for inclusion in the \n                repository referred to in paragraph (1).\n                    (B) Notification requirement.--If any Federal \n                entity regularly fails to comply with the requirement \n                under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Commerce shall \n                notify--\n                            (i) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n                        Transportation of the Senate;
