FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) for over 40 years, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization has helped guarantee the security, freedom, and \n        prosperity of the United States and our partners in the \n        alliance;\n            (2) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has expanded its \n        membership on 3 different occasions since its founding in 1949;\n            (3) the steadfast and sustained commitment of the member \n        countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to mutual \n        defense against the threat of communist domination played a \n        significant role in precipitating the collapse of the Iron \n        Curtain and the demise of the Soviet Union;\n            (4) in the place of that threat, new security threats are \n        emerging to the shared interests of the member countries of the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n            (5) although these new threats are more geographically and \n        functionally diverse and less predictable, they still imperil \n        shared interests of the United States and our North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization allies;\n            (6) Western interests must be protected on a cooperative \n        basis without an undue burden falling upon the United States;\n            (7) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the only \n        multilateral organization that is capable of conducting \n        effective military operations to protect Western interests;\n            (8) the valuable experience gained from ongoing military \n        cooperation within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was \n        critical to the success of joint military operations in the \n        1991 liberation of Kuwait;\n            (9) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an important \n        diplomatic forum for discussion of issues of concern to its \n        member states and for the peaceful resolution of disputes;\n            (10) admission of Central and East European countries that \n        have recently been freed from Communist domination to the North \n        Atlantic Treaty Organization could contribute to international \n        peace and enhance the security of those countries;\n            (11) a number of countries, including the Visegrad \n        countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) \n        and the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), have \n        expressed interest in North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        membership; and\n            (12) in recognition of this interest, the ``Partnership for \n        Peace'' proposal offers limited military cooperation to many \n        European countries not currently members of the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization, without establishing benchmarks or \n        guidelines for eventual North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        membership.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n    It should be the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to continue our commitment to and active leadership \n        role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n            (2) to join with our North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        allies to redefine the role of the alliance in the post-Cold \n        War world, taking into account--\n                    (A) the fundamentally changed security environment \n                of Central and Eastern Europe,\n                    (B) the need to assure all countries of the \n                defensive nature of the alliance and the desire of its \n                members to work cooperatively with all former \n                adversaries,\n                    (C) the emerging security threats posed by the \n                proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological \n                weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \n                them,\n                    (D) the continuing challenges to the interests of \n                all North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries \n                posed by unstable and undemocratic regimes harboring \n                hostile intentions, and\n                    (E) the dependence of the global economy on a \n                stable energy supply and the free flow of commerce;\n            (3) to urge the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to \n        support the eventual expansion of alliance membership to \n        European countries that meet appropriate standards, including--\n                    (A) shared values and interests,\n                    (B) democratic governments,\n                    (C) free market economies,\n                    (D) civilian control of the military,\n                    (E) adherence to the values, principles, and \n                political commitments embodied in the Helsinki Final \n                Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \n                Europe, and\n                    (F) commitment to further the principles of the \n                North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to contribute to \n                the security of the North Atlantic area;\n            (4) to urge the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--\n                    (A) to extend membership to countries that meet the \n                standards set forth by the North Atlantic Treaty \n                Organization, and\n                    (B) to establish benchmarks and a timetable for \n                eventual membership for selected countries in \n                transition; and\n            (5) to affirm that North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        military planning should include joint military operations \n        beyond the geographic bounds of the alliance under Article 4 of \n        the North Atlantic Treaty when the shared interests of the \n        United States and other member countries require such action to \n        defend vital interests."
