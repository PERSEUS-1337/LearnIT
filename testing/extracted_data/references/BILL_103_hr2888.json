FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) To the fullest extent possible, parents should be \n        empowered with the technology to choose to block the display on \n        their televisions of programs they consider too violent for \n        their children.\n            (2) Violence now touches the lives of American children \n        more than adults. From 1982 through 1984, teenagers were the \n        victims of 1,800,000 violent crimes, twice the annual rate of \n        the adult population over age 20. According to the American \n        Academy of Pediatrics, one of every 8 deaths among children age \n        10-14 years old in 1990 was caused by a shooting. Among \n        teenagers and young adults, that figure rose to one of every \n        four deaths.\n            (3) Children watch an extensive amount of television. It is \n        estimated that a child watches approximately 22,000 hours of \n        television before finishing high school, almost twice the \n        amount of time spent in the classroom.\n            (4) The amount of violence on television has reached \n        epidemic levels. The American Psychological Association \n        estimates that the average child witnesses 8,000 murders and \n        100,000 acts of violence before finishing elementary school.\n            (5) Three Surgeon Generals, the National Institute of \n        Mental Health, the Centers for Disease Control, the American \n        Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and \n        the American Psychological Association have concurred for \n        nearly 20 years as to the deleterious effects of television \n        violence on children.\n            (6) Despite periodic television industry efforts to reduce \n        the amount of television violence, reductions in the level of \n        televised violence have never been long lasting.\n            (7) Parents who are working are unable to constantly \n        monitor the television viewing habits of their children. \n        Advanced television technologies such as channel compression \n        and digitization will allow the expansion of channel capacity \n        to levels even more unmanageable for parents who want to \n        protect their children from televised violence.\n            (8) The major broadcast networks and a large number of \n        cable channels have agreed to place parental advisories on \n        programs they consider to be too violent for children. These \n        parental advisories are of limited use to parents if they are \n        not watching television with their children.\n            (9) The technology currently exists to equip television \n        sets at a nominal cost to permit parents to block the display \n        of television programs they consider too violent for children. \n        However, this technology will only be effective (A) if all \n        television programmers send any adopted rating or warning \n        system electronically with the program signal, and (B) parents \n        are able to block the display not only of individual programs \n        but to block out automatically and simultaneously all programs \n        with such rating.\n            (10) Congress calls upon the broadcast networks, \n        independent television stations, cable programmers, and \n        satellite programmers to protect the parental right to guide \n        the television viewing habits of children by sending any \n        adopted rating or warning system electronically with the \n        program signal.\n\nSEC. 3. EQUIP TELEVISIONS TO BLOCK PROGRAMS.\n\n    Section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 303) is \namended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n    ``(v) Require that (1) apparatus designed to receive television \nsignals be equipped with circuitry designed to enable viewers to block \nthe display of channels, programs, and time slots; and (2) such \napparatus enable viewers to block display of all programs with a common \nrating. The requirements of this subsection shall apply when such \napparatus is manufactured in the United States or imported for use in \nthe United States, and its television picture screen is 13 inches or \ngreater in size, measured diagonally.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SHIPPING OR IMPORTING.\n\n    (a) Regulations.--Section 330 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \nU.S.C. 330) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and\n            (2) by adding after subsection (b) the following new \n        section:\n    ``(c) No person shall ship in interstate commerce, manufacture, \nassemble, or import from any foreign country into the United States, \nany apparatus described in section 303(v) of this Act except in \naccordance with rules prescribed by the Commission pursuant to the \nauthority granted by that section. Such rules shall provide performance \nstandards for such blocking technology. Such rules shall further \nrequire that all such apparatus be able to receive the rating signals \nwhich have been transmitted by way of line 21 of the vertical blanking \ninterval and which conform to the signal and blocking specifications \nestablished by the Commission. As new video technology is developed, \nthe Commission shall take such action as the Commission determines \nappropriate to ensure that blocking service continues to be available \nto consumers. This subsection shall not apply to carriers transporting \nsuch apparatus without trading it.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 330(d) of such Act, as \nredesignated by this Act, is amended by striking ``section 303(s), and \nsection 303(u)'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``and sections 303(s), \n303(u), and 303(v)''.\n\nSEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    The amendments made by sections 3 and 4 of this Act shall take \neffect one year after enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. RULES.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall promulgate rules to \nimplement the amendments made by this Act within 180 days after the \ndate of its enactment."
