FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Tiahrt Amendments severely limit the authority of \n        the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) \n        to disclose crime gun trace data to the public.\n            (2) The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collection of \n        valuable information, and the establishment of effective \n        policies to prevent illegal guns from being used in crimes.\n            (3) The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforcement of the gun \n        laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed \n        within 24 hours, and by barring the Government from requiring \n        annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops.\n            (4) A 2012 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg \n        School of Public Health found that the Tiahrt Amendments \n        dramatically increased gun sales to criminals.\n            (5) A 2016 study from the University of Pittsburgh Graduate \n        School of Public Health found that in 2008, 79 percent of all \n        guns recovered by police from crime scenes belonged to someone \n        other than the perpetrator--30 percent had been stolen.\n            (6) A gun is stolen in the United States every 2 minutes.\n            (7) Every year, nearly 115,000 Americans are shot.\n            (8) In 2016, 38,658 Americans were killed with a gun.\n            (9) In 2016, 289,223 firearms were recovered and traced in \n        the United States, of which 211,384 were traced to a final \n        retail purchaser.\n            (10) Having effective policies to prevent illegal gun \n        trafficking makes our families and communities safer.\n            (11) Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law \n        enforcement efforts and give the public vital information \n        needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal \n        guns.\n\nSEC. 3.
