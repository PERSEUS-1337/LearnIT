FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Paraprofessionals are not substitutes for certified \n        teachers.\n            (2) Small class size is fundamental to all learning, but \n        particularly in the early grades.\n            (3) Putting more adults in the classroom helps to increase \n        the attention paid to each student and to improve discipline.\n            (4) Expanding the availability of entry-level classroom \n        jobs that include opportunities for training and professional \n        development should encourage more adults to enter teacher \n        training and careers in education.\n\nSEC. 2.
