FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) existing information regarding the abundance and \n        distribution of biological resources is inadequate and often \n        inaccessible;\n            (2) the loss of biological resources may have serious \n        consequences for human welfare as raw material for research and \n        agricultural, medicinal, and industrial development are \n        irretrievably lost;\n            (3) existing laws and programs relevant to the loss of \n        indigenous biological resources in the United States are \n        largely uncoordinated and inadequate, and sometimes result in \n        duplication of efforts, conflicts in goals, and gaps in \n        geographic and taxonomic coverage; and,\n            (4) increased research in biological resources is needed to \n        provide adequate knowledge to maintain and to ensure the \n        sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``biological resources'' means the full range \n        of variety and variability within and among living organisms \n        (including both terrestrial and aquatic) and the ecological \n        complexes in which they occur, and encompasses ecosystem or \n        community diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity;\n            (2) the term ``genetic diversity'' means the differences in \n        genetic composition within and among populations of a given \n        species;\n            (3) the term ``species diversity'' means the richness and \n        variety of indigenous species in a particular location of the \n        world;\n            (4) the term ``community diversity'' means the variety \n        between different integrated assemblages of species inhabiting \n        different locales; and\n            (5) the term ``United States'' means all of the several \n        States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n        Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth \n        of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and any other \n        commonwealth, territory, possession, or area of legal or \n        economic jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to undertake a nationally coordinated effort to survey, \n        collect, inventory, synthesize, and disseminate adequate data \n        and information for--\n                    (A) the understanding of the full range of \n                biological resources;\n                    (B) assessing the rate and scale of change in \n                biological resources;\n                    (C) developing tests and making available cost \n                effective methodologies for scientific and economic \n                inventories of biological resources; and\n                    (D) evaluating the potential economic implications \n                of the sustainable use of biological resources.\n            (2) to support basic and applied research necessary for a \n        full understanding of the nation's biological resources; and\n            (3) to promote better understanding of the importance of \n        biological resources and foster actions that prevent biological \n        impoverishment and sustainably preserve biological resources.\n\nSEC. 5. NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES (RESEARCH AND \n              DEVELOPMENT).\n\n    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--There is established within the \nSmithsonian Institution, in cooperation with the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the National Science Foundation, a National \nCenter for Biological Resources (Research and Development) (the \nCenter), whose purpose shall be to set research priorities, to provide \nleadership and coordination for the understanding and promotion of \nknowledge of the biota within the United States with respect to its \ncomposition, systematics, distribution, status, biological properties, \necological relationships (including environmental significance), and \neconomic value, and the effect of human activities on the biota, and to \nmake this knowledge accessible to the people of the United States and \nothers working on research and development in biological resources \nthroughout the world. The Center shall be administered by a Director.\n    (b) Functions.--The functions of the Center shall be--\n            (1) to summarize and enhance the knowledge of the \n        distribution, status, and characteristics of the biota in a \n        manner that can be used in the sustainable development of \n        natural products;\n            (2) to prepare, with the assistance of agencies and other \n        sources, lists and, where appropriate, maps of--\n                    (A) indigenous biotic communities, species, and \n                populations that appear to be in significant decline or \n                in imminent danger of loss of viability;\n                    (B) areas of outstanding indigenous biotic \n                importance;
