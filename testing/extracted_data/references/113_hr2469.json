DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE \n              PROGRAM.\n\n    The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the organization of the \nmilitia of the District of Columbia'', approved March 1, 1889 (sec. \n49--101 et seq., D.C. Official Code) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new title:\n\n               ``TITLE II--EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n``SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    ``(a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the `Major General \nDavid F. Wherley, Jr. District of Columbia National Guard Retention and \nCollege Access Act'.\n    ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) The District of Columbia National Guard is under the \n        exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the United States as \n        Commander-in-Chief and, unlike other National Guards, is \n        permanently federalized.\n            ``(2) The District of Columbia National Guard is unique and \n        differs from the National Guards of the several States in that \n        the District of Columbia National Guard is responsible, not \n        only for residents of the District of Columbia, but also for a \n        special and unique mission and obligation as a result of the \n        extensive presence of the Federal Government in the District of \n        Columbia.\n            ``(3) Consequently, the President of the United States, \n        rather than the chief executive of the District of Columbia, is \n        in command of the District of Columbia National Guard, and only \n        the President can call up the District of Columbia National \n        Guard even for local emergencies.\n            ``(4) The District of Columbia National Guard has been \n        specifically trained to address the unique emergencies that may \n        occur regarding the presence of the Federal Government in the \n        District of Columbia.\n            ``(5) The great majority of the members of the District of \n        Columbia National Guard actually live in Maryland or Virginia, \n        rather than in the District of Columbia.\n            ``(6) The District of Columbia National Guard has been \n        experiencing a disproportionate decline in force in comparison \n        to the National Guards of Maryland and Virginia.\n            ``(7) The States of Maryland and Virginia provide \n        additional recruiting and retention incentives, such as \n        educational benefits, in order to maintain their force, and \n        their National Guards have drawn recruits from the District of \n        Columbia at a rate that puts at risk the maintenance of the \n        necessary force levels for the District of Columbia National \n        Guard.\n            ``(8) Funds for an educational benefit for members of the \n        District of Columbia National Guard would provide an incentive \n        to help reverse the loss of members to nearby National Guards \n        and allow for maintenance and increase of necessary District of \n        Columbia National Guard personnel.\n            ``(9) The loss of members of the District of Columbia \n        National Guard could adversely affect the readiness of the \n        District of Columbia National Guard to respond in the event of \n        a terrorist attack on the capital of the United States.\n\n``SEC. 202.
