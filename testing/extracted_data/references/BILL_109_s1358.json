FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) America has for its history served as a world leader of \n        scientific innovation and research.\n            (2) Multiple policy and legislative decisions affecting the \n        health and safety of the American public and the state of the \n        environment depend upon comprehensive, accurate scientific \n        information.\n            (3) The Federal Government plays a key role in fostering \n        and supporting scientific research.\n            (4) The conduct of such research depends on free \n        investigation and open exchange of ideas.\n            (5) Scientific advisory committees must be comprised of \n        individuals with the appropriate expertise regardless of \n        political affiliation.\n            (6) Over the past four years, leading scientific \n        associations and scientific journals, Inspectors General, \n        senior scientists within the Federal Government, former \n        scientific officials from both Republican and Democratic \n        administrations, and 48 Nobel Laureates have raised concerns \n        about political interference with science in the executive \n        branch of the Federal Government.\n            (7) This interference has included tampering with the \n        conduct of research, gagging of government scientists, \n        distortion of scientific information presented to Congress and \n        the public, and manipulation of Federal scientific advisory \n        committees.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect scientific \nintegrity in Federal research and policymaking.\n\nSEC. 3.
