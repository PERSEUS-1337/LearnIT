FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n        citizenship and regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n        offenders into free society. The right to vote may not be \n        abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on \n        account of race, color, gender, or previous condition of \n        servitude. Basic constitutional principles of fairness and \n        equal protection require an equal opportunity for United States \n        citizens to vote in Federal elections.\n            (2) Since the founding of the Nation, most States have \n        enacted laws disenfranchising convicted felons and ex-felons. \n        In the last 30 years, due to the dramatic expansion of the \n        criminal justice system, these laws have significantly affected \n        the political voice of many American communities. The momentum \n        toward reform of these policies has been based on a \n        reconsideration of their wisdom in meeting legitimate \n        correctional objectives and the interests of full democratic \n        participation. Forty-eight States and the District of Columbia \n        prohibit inmates from voting while incarcerated for a felony \n        offense.\n            (3) Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal \n        elections, an authority that has repeatedly been upheld by the \n        Supreme Court.\n            (4) Although State laws determine the qualifications for \n        voting in Federal elections, Congress must ensure that those \n        laws are in accordance with the Constitution. Currently, those \n        laws vary throughout the Nation, resulting in discrepancies \n        regarding which citizens may vote in Federal elections.\n            (5) Only two States (Maine and Vermont) permit inmates to \n        vote. Thirty-five States prohibit felons from voting while they \n        are on parole and 30 of these States exclude felony \n        probationers as well. Two States deny the right to vote to all \n        ex-offenders who have completed their sentences. Nine others \n        disenfranchise certain categories of ex-offenders or permit \n        application for restoration of rights for specified offenses \n        after a waiting period (e.g., 5 years in Delaware and Wyoming, \n        and 2 years in Nebraska). Each State has developed its own \n        process of restoring voting rights to ex-offenders but most of \n        these restoration processes are so cumbersome that few ex-\n        offenders are able to take advantage of them.\n            (6) An estimated 5,300,000 million Americans, or one in 41 \n        adults, have currently or permanently lost their voting rights \n        as a result of a felony conviction.\n            (7) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n        ethnic minorities.\n            (8) Thirteen States disenfranchise some or all ex-offenders \n        who have fully served their sentences, regardless of the nature \n        or seriousness of the offense.\n            (9) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders who \n        have fully served their sentences, the right to vote can be \n        regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often \n        illusory.\n            (10) In eight States, a pardon or order from the Governor \n        is required for an ex-offender to regain the right to vote. In \n        two States, ex-offenders must obtain action by the parole or \n        pardon board to regain that right.\n            (11) Offenders convicted of a Federal offense often have \n        additional barriers to regaining voting rights. In at least 16 \n        States, Federal ex-offenders cannot use the State procedure for \n        restoring their voting rights. The only method provided by \n        Federal law for restoring voting rights to ex-offenders is a \n        Presidential pardon.\n            (12) Few persons who seek to have their right to vote \n        restored have the financial and political resources needed to \n        succeed.\n            (13) Thirteen percent of the African-American adult male \n        population, or 1,400,000 African-American men, are \n        disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, 3 in 10 \n        African-American men in the next generation will be \n        disenfranchised at some point during their lifetimes. Hispanic \n        citizens are also disproportionately disenfranchised, since \n        those citizens are disproportionately represented in the \n        criminal justice system.\n            (14) An estimated 676,730 women are currently ineligible to \n        vote as a result of a felony conviction. More than 2,000,000 \n        White Americans (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) are disenfranchised \n        as a result of a felony conviction. In five States that deny \n        the vote to ex-offenders, one in four Black men is permanently \n        disenfranchised.\n            (15) Given current rates of incarceration, three in ten of \n        the next generation of Black men can expect to be \n        disenfranchised at some point in their lifetime. In States that \n        disenfranchise ex-offenders, as many as 40 percent of Black men \n        may permanently lose their right to vote. Two million one \n        hundred thousand disenfranchised persons are ex-offenders who \n        have completed their sentences.\n            (16) The discrepancies described in this subsection should \n        be addressed by Congress, in the name of fundamental fairness \n        and equal protection.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to restore fairness in the \nFederal election process by ensuring that ex-offenders who have fully \nserved their sentences are not denied the right to vote.\n\nSEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n    (a) Protecting Right To Vote in Federal Elections.--The right of an \nindividual who is a citizen of the United States to vote in any \nelection for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because \nthat individual has been convicted of a criminal offense unless, at the \ntime of the election, such individual is serving a felony sentence in a \ncorrectional institution or facility.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) Correctional institution or facility.--The term \n        ``correctional institution or facility'' means any prison, \n        penitentiary, jail, or other institution or facility for the \n        confinement of individuals convicted of criminal offenses, \n        whether publicly or privately operated, except that such term \n        does not include any residential community treatment center (or \n        similar public or private facility).\n            (2) Election.--The term ``election'' means--\n                    (A) a general, special, primary, or runoff \n                election;\n                    (B) a convention or caucus of a political party \n                held to nominate a candidate;\n                    (C) a primary election held for the selection of \n                delegates to a national nominating convention of a \n                political party; or\n                    (D) a primary election held for the expression of a \n                preference for the nomination of persons for election \n                to the office of President.\n            (3) Federal office.--The term ``Federal office'' means the \n        office of President or Vice President, or of Senator or \n        Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, \n        Congress.\n\nSEC. 4.
