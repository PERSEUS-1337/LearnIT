Any study conducted under this subdivision shall include consideration of all of the following:\n(1) Whether the wetland is so severely degraded and its natural processes so substantially impaired that it is not capable of recovering and maintaining a high level of biological productivity without major restoration activities.\n(2) Whether a substantial portion of the degraded wetland, but in no event less than 75 percent, can be restored and maintained as a highly productive wetland in conjunction with a boating facilities project.\n(3) Whether restoration of the wetland\u2019s natural values, including its biological productivity and wildlife habitat features, can most feasibly be achieved and maintained in conjunction with a boating facility or whether there are other feasible ways to achieve these values.\n(c) The Legislature finds and declares that salt water or brackish water aquaculture is a coastal-dependent use which should be encouraged to augment food supplies and to further the policies set forth in Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 825) of Division 1.

If the Department of Fish and Wildlife identifies these sites, it shall transmit information identifying the sites to the commission and the relevant local government agency.

In cases where the Division of Boating and Waterways within the Department of Parks and Recreation desires to make any comment, it shall be made within 30 days of the commission\u2019s request. The commission shall include the comment in its decision regarding a coastal development permit or local coastal program or any amendment thereto."
