FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) animals are live, sentient creatures, with the ability \n        to feel pain and suffer;\n            (2) it is inappropriate for animals transported by air to \n        be treated as baggage;\n            (3) according to the Air Transport Association, over \n        500,000 animals are transported by air each year and as many as \n        5,000 of those animals are lost, injured, or killed;\n            (4) most injuries to animals traveling by airplane are due \n        to mishandling by baggage personnel, severe temperature \n        fluctuations, insufficient oxygen in cargo holds, or damage to \n        kennels;\n            (5) there are no Federal requirements that airlines report \n        incidents of animal loss, injury, or death;\n            (6) members of the public have no information to use in \n        choosing an airline based on its record of safety with regard \n        to transporting animals;\n            (7) the last congressional action on animals transported by \n        air was conducted over 22 years ago; and\n            (8) the conditions of cargo holds of airplanes must be \n        improved to protect the health, and ensure the safety, of \n        transported animals.\n\n                        TITLE I--ANIMAL WELFARE\n\nSEC. 101.
