FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The State and Federal courts together comprise an \n        intertwined system for the delivery of justice in the United \n        States. The 2 court systems have played different but equally \n        significant roles in the Federal system. The State courts have \n        served as the chief tribunals for trials of criminal law cases.\n            (2) The Federal courts have a more limited jurisdiction \n        than the State courts with respect to criminal matters because \n        of the fundamental constitutional principle that the Federal \n        Government is a government of delegated power in which the \n        residual power remains in the States. In criminal matters, the \n        jurisdiction of the Federal courts should complement, not \n        supplant, that of the State courts.\n            (3) There is no sound justification for having 2 parallel \n        justice systems.\n            (4) Citizens should not be subject to different, competing \n        law enforcement systems, different penalties depending on which \n        system brings them to trial, and an ever-lengthening \n        possibility that they might be tried for the same offense more \n        than once.\n\nSEC. 3.
