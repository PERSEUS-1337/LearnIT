SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO ASSISTANT UNITED STATES TRADE \n              REPRESENTATIVE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Office of Advocacy of the Small \n        Business Administration, small business concerns (as that term \n        is defined in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n        632)) represent 97 percent of all exporters in the United \n        States and account for 29 percent of the total exporting \n        volume. Despite the overwhelming majority of exporters that are \n        small business concerns, fewer than 1 percent of all small \n        business concerns in the United States are engaged in trade-\n        related business activities.\n            (2) According to the Office of Advocacy of the Small \n        Business Administration, more than 72 percent of all exporters \n        in the United States employ fewer than 20 employees. Small \n        business concerns often do not have the sales volume or \n        resources to overcome the costs of trade barriers and overhead \n        expenses in international transactions, nor can small business \n        concerns afford to maintain employees with international trade \n        expertise to resolve trade problems.\n            (3) Small business advocacy groups often lack political \n        influence in foreign countries, which hinders efforts to solve \n        problems outside the legal process. Small business advocates \n        are not as visible or vocal on issues relating to international \n        trade as are the advocates for other issues, due to a lack of \n        resources for advocacy.\n            (4) In 1988, Congress passed section 8012 of the Omnibus \n        Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 631 note), \n        which expressed the sense of Congress that the United States \n        Trade Representative should appoint a special trade assistant \n        for small business. As of June 2009, the position has not been \n        established by the United States Trade Representative.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \nStates Trade Representative should establish the position of Assistant \nUnited States Trade Representative for Small Business, to--\n            (1) promote the trade interests of small business concerns;\n            (2) identify and address foreign trade barriers that impede \n        the exportation of goods by small business concerns;\n            (3) ensure that small business concerns are adequately \n        represented during trade negotiations by the United States \n        Trade Representative; and\n            (4) coordinate with other Federal agencies that are \n        responsible for providing information or assistance to small \n        business concerns."
