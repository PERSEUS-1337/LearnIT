INPATIENT HEALTH CARE FACILITY AT DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n              AFFAIRS MEDICAL FACILITY IN HARLINGEN, TEXAS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The current and future health care needs of veterans \n        residing in Far South Texas are not being fully met by the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (2) According to recent census data, more than 108,000 \n        veterans reside in Far South Texas.\n            (3) Travel times for veterans from the Valley Coastal Bend \n        area from their homes to the nearest Department of Veterans \n        Affairs hospital for acute inpatient health care can exceed six \n        hours.\n            (4) Even with the significant travel times, veterans from \n        Far South Texas demonstrate a high demand for health care \n        services from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (5) Ongoing overseas deployments of members of the Armed \n        Forces from Texas, including members of the Armed Forces on \n        active duty, members of the Texas National Guard, and members \n        of the other reserve components of the Armed Forces, will \n        continue to increase demand for medical services provided by \n        the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n            (6) The Department of Veterans Affairs employs an annual \n        Strategic Capital Investment Planning process to ``enable the \n        VA to continually adapt to changes in demographics, medical and \n        information technology, and health care delivery'', which \n        results in the development of a multi-year investment plan that \n        determines where gaps in services exist or are projected and \n        develops an appropriate solution to meet those gaps.\n            (7) According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, final \n        approval of the Strategic Capital Investment Planning priority \n        list serves as the ``building block'' of the annual budget \n        request for the Department.\n            (8) Arturo ``Treto'' Garza, a veteran who served in the \n        Marine Corps, rose to the rank of Sergeant, and served two \n        tours in the Vietnam War, passed away on October 3, 2012.\n            (9) Treto Garza, who was also a former co-chairman of the \n        Veterans Alliance of the Rio Grande Valley, tirelessly fought \n        to improve health care services for veterans in the Rio Grande \n        Valley, with his efforts successfully leading to the creation \n        of the South Texas VA Health Care Center at Harlingen, located \n        in Harlingen, Texas.\n    (b) Redesignation of South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs \nHealth Care Center.--\n            (1) In general.--The South Texas Department of Veterans \n        Affairs Health Care Center at Harlingen, located in Harlingen, \n        Texas, is redesignated as the ``Treto Garza South Texas \n        Department of Veterans

of the Department of Veterans Affairs referred \n        to in paragraph (1) shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n        ``Treto Garza South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health \n        Care Center''.\n    (c) Requirement of Full-Service Inpatient Facility.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n        ensure that the Treto Garza South Texas Department of Veterans \n        Affairs Health Care Center includes a full-service inpatient \n        health care facility of the Department and shall modify the \n        existing facility as
