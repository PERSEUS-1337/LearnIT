FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the most important domestic function of the Federal \n        Government is the protection of the personal security of \n        individual Americans through the enactment and enforcement of \n        laws against criminal behavior; and\n            (2) tough Federal laws, such as mandatory minimum prison \n        sentences for violent crimes committed with a firearm and \n        truth-in-sentencing, would serve as deterrents to persons who \n        might be disposed to commit violent crimes.\n\nSEC. 3.
