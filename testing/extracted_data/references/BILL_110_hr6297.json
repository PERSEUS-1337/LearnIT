FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the consensus among climate scientists is overwhelming \n        that climate change is occurring more rapidly than can be \n        attributed to natural causes, and that significant impacts to \n        the water supply are already occurring;\n            (2) among the first and most critical of those impacts will \n        be change to patterns of precipitation around the world, which \n        will affect water availability for the most basic drinking \n        water and domestic water needs of populations in many areas of \n        the United States;\n            (3) drinking water utilities throughout the United States, \n        as well as those in Europe, Australia, and Asia, are concerned \n        that extended changes in precipitation will lead to extended \n        droughts;\n            (4) supplying water is highly energy-intensive and will \n        become more so as climate change forces more utilities to turn \n        to alternative supplies;\n            (5) energy production consumes a significant percentage of \n        the fresh water resources of the United States;\n            (6) since 2003, the drinking water industry of the United \n        States has sponsored, through a nonprofit water research \n        foundation, various studies to assess the impacts of climate \n        change on drinking water supplies;\n            (7) those studies demonstrate the need for a comprehensive \n        program of research into the full range of impacts on drinking \n        water utilities, including impacts on water supplies, \n        facilities, and customers;\n            (8) that nonprofit water research foundation is also \n        coordinating internationally with other drinking water \n        utilities on shared research projects and has hosted \n        international workshops with counterpart European and Asian \n        water research organizations to develop a unified research \n        agenda for applied research on adaptive strategies to address \n        climate change impacts;\n            (9) research data in existence as of the date of enactment \n        of this Act--\n                    (A) summarize the best available scientific \n                evidence on climate change;\n                    (B) identify the implications of climate change for \n                the water cycle and the availability and quality of \n                water resources; and\n                    (C) provide general guidance on planning and \n                adaptation strategies for water utilities; and\n            (10) given uncertainties about specific climate changes in \n        particular areas, drinking water utilities need to prepare for \n        a wider range of likely possibilities in managing and delivery \n        of water.\n\nSEC. 3.
