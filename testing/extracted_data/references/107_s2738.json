    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``South Dakota Tribal Nursing \nFacilities Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The highest rate of poverty in South Dakota occurs on \n        Indian reservations.\n            (2) According to the 2000 United States Census, nine \n        counties that encompass Indian reservations are among the 100 \n        poorest counties in the United States.\n            (3) There are no nursing facilities on the Indian \n        reservations in South Dakota.\n            (4) The lack of nursing facilities on the larger Indian \n        reservations is a barrier that prevents Indian elders from \n        accessing long-term health care.\n            (5) The elderly poor constitute a growing portion of the \n        membership of the Indian tribes and tribal organizations of \n        South Dakota.\n            (6) The great distances between Indian reservations and \n        off-reservation nursing facilities--\n                    (A) deter the Indian elderly from using such \n                facilities; and\n                    (B) if the Indian elderly do use such facilities, \n                prevent visitation from family and relatives that is \n                essential to the well-being of the Indian elderly.\n            (7) There is a critical need for nursing facilities on the \n        Indian reservations located in South Dakota to meet the elderly \n        and assisted-living needs of tribal members.\n            (8) A South Dakota law imposes a moratorium on the \n        licensing of new nursing facilities in the State.\n            (9) The medicaid program requires State licensure of \n        nursing facilities to qualify such facility for reimbursement \n        for care provided to individuals eligible for medical \n        assistance under such program.\n            (10) The impact of the South Dakota moratorium on nursing \n        facility licensure and the requirements of the medicaid program \n        prevent Indian tribes and tribal organizations in South Dakota \n        from developing and operating these badly needed facilities on \n        Indian reservations.\n            (11) It is the responsibility and goal of the United \n        States, in the fulfillment of its responsibility to provide and \n        facilitate adequate health care for elderly and needy members \n        of Indian tribes and tribal organizations, to protect the right \n        of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to provide nursing \n        facilities for those members.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are, notwithstanding any \nimpediment imposed by State law--\n            (1) to facilitate the development and operation of nursing \n        facilities that are owned or operated by an Indian tribe or \n        tribal organization on Indian reservations that are located in \n        the State of South Dakota; and\n            (2) to protect the right of members of Indian tribes and \n        tribal organizations to access health care provided by nursing \n        facilities in the exercise of those members' entitlement to \n        medical assistance under the medicaid program.\n\nSEC. 3.
