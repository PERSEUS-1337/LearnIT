For the purpose of this section any period of rehabilitation afforded by the United States or the state following active duty shall be considered as military service and termination of the state military emergency by the Governor shall be considered termination of military service.\n(b) Within 30 days of the employee\u2019s return to state service, the appointing authority shall inform the employee of his or her rights pursuant to Section 20997, and provide the member with the form provided pursuant to subdivision (f) of that section.\n(c) Prior to April 1, 2017, every appointing authority shall provide a letter or electronic communication to all employees informing them of the rights provided by Section 20997.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 20997 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n20997.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, for each member other than a National Guard member absent without compensation due to military service pursuant to Section 20990, the employer shall contribute an amount equal to the contributions that would have been made by the employer and the employee during the absence. The employer\u2019s contribution pursuant to this section shall be based upon the member\u2019s compensation earnable and the contribution rates in effect at the commencement of the absence, if any of the following apply:\n(1) The member returns to state service within six months after receiving a discharge from military service other than dishonorable.\n(2) The member returns to state service within six months after completion of any period of rehabilitation offered by the United States government, except that for purposes of this section, rehabilitation solely for education purposes shall not be considered.\n(3) The member is granted a leave of absence from the state employer as of the same date the member was reinstated to that employment from military service, provided that the member returns to state service at the conclusion of the leave.\n(4) The member is placed on a state civil service reemployment list within six months after receiving a discharge from military service other than dishonorable and returns to state service upon receipt of an offer of reemployment.\n(5) The member retires from this system for service or disability during the course of an absence from state service for military service.\n(6) The member dies during the course of an absence from state service for military service.\n(b) Any member on leave from state service for military service who elects to continue contributing to this system shall be entitled to a refund of those contributions upon request.\n(c) Any member who withdrew contributions during or in contemplation of his or her military service is entitled to the benefits of this section irrespective of whether the contributions are redeposited.
