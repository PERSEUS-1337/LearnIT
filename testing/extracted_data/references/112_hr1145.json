FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The construction, architectural, and engineering \n        industries provide a valuable service in times of disasters and \n        emergencies.\n            (2) The construction, architectural, and engineering \n        industries answered the call on September 11, 2001, and the \n        days afterwards to assist in the search, recovery, and clean-up \n        efforts in New York City and Arlington, Virginia, as well as in \n        the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n            (3) The expertise and equipment brought forth for the \n        search, recovery, and other efforts greatly advanced and \n        improved the efficiency of these efforts.\n            (4) Such efforts by the construction, architectural, and \n        engineering industries make it safer for police, firefighters, \n        and other rescue workers to work on search and recovery \n        efforts.\n            (5) The services provided by the construction, \n        architectural, and engineering industries improve the safety of \n        the public by the assessment, containment, and mitigation of \n        conditions that threaten life and property.\n            (6) Construction companies and architectural and \n        engineering entities were faced with lawsuits as a result of \n        their voluntary efforts on behalf of their fellow citizens in \n        New York City and the Gulf Coast.\n            (7) Providing construction contractors and architectural \n        and engineering entities qualified immunity from liability when \n        providing services in this type of volunteer activity helps to \n        ensure that such services will be available in the future in \n        times of need.\n\nSEC. 3.
