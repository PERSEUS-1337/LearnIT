FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Certain small businesses and labor organizations are at \n        a great disadvantage in terms of expertise and resources when \n        facing actions brought by the National Labor Relations Board or \n        by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n            (2) The attempt to ``level the playing field'' for small \n        businesses and labor organizations by means of the Equal Access \n        to Justice Act has proven ineffective and has been \n        underutilized by these small entities in their actions before \n        the National Labor Relations Board and before the Occupational \n        Safety and Health Review Commission.\n            (3) The greater expertise and resources of the National \n        Labor Relations Board and the Occupational Safety and Health \n        Administration as compared with those of small businesses and \n        labor organizations necessitate a standard that awards fees and \n        costs to certain small entities when they prevail against the \n        National Labor Relations Board or against the Occupational \n        Safety and Health Administration.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to ensure that certain small businesses and labor \n        organizations will not be deterred from seeking review of, or \n        defending against, actions brought against them by the National \n        Labor Relations Board or by the Occupational Safety and Health \n        Administration because of the expense involved in securing \n        vindication of their rights;\n            (2) to reduce the disparity in resources and expertise \n        between certain small businesses and labor organizations and \n        the National Labor Relations Board and the Occupational Safety \n        and Health Administration; and\n            (3) to make the National Labor Relations Board and the \n        Occupational Safety and Health Administration more accountable \n        for their enforcement actions against certain small businesses \n        and labor organizations by awarding fees and costs to these \n        entities when they prevail against the National Labor Relations \n        Board or in proceedings before the Occupational Safety and \n        Health Review Commission.\n\nSEC. 3.
