FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Drinking alcohol under the age of 21 is illegal in each \n        of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Enforcement of \n        current laws and regulations in States and communities, such as \n        minimum age drinking laws, zero tolerance laws, and laws and \n        regulations which restrict availability of alcohol, must \n        supplement other efforts to reduce underage drinking.\n            (2) Data collected by the Department of Health and Human \n        Services and the Department of Transportation indicate that \n        alcohol use by youth has many negative consequences, such as \n        immediate risk from acute impairment; traffic fatalities; \n        violence; suicide; and unprotected sex.\n            (3) A significant percentage of the total alcohol \n        consumption in the United States each year is by underage \n        youth. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n        Administration reports that the percentage is over 11 percent.\n            (4) College and university presidents have cited alcohol \n        abuse as the number one health problem on college and \n        university campuses.\n            (5) According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \n        and Alcoholism, two of five college students are binge \n        drinkers; 1,400 college students die each year from alcohol-\n        related injuries, a majority of which involve motor vehicle \n        crashes; more than 70,000 students are victims of alcohol-\n        related sexual assault; and 500,000 students are injured under \n        the influence of alcohol each year.\n            (6) Research shows that school-based and community-based \n        interventions can reduce underage drinking and associated \n        problems, and that positive outcomes can be achieved by \n        combining environmental and institutional change with theory-\n        based health education--a comprehensive, community-based \n        approach.\n\nSEC. 3.
