FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Our Nation's economy and society are increasingly \n        dependent on Internet services.\n            (2) The Internet is an essential infrastructure that is \n        comparable to roads and electricity in its support for a \n        diverse array of economic, social, and political activity.\n            (3) Internet technologies and services hold the promise of \n        advancing economic growth, fostering investment, creating jobs, \n        and spurring technological innovation.\n            (4) As the Nation becomes more reliant upon such Internet \n        technologies and services, unfettered access to the Internet to \n        offer, access, and utilize content, services, and applications \n        is vital.\n            (5) The global leadership in high technology that the \n        United States provides today stems directly from historic \n        policies that embraced competition and openness and that have \n        ensured that telecommunications networks are open to all lawful \n        uses by all users.\n            (6) The Internet was enabled by those historic policies and \n        provides an open architecture medium for worldwide \n        communications, providing a low barrier to entry for Internet-\n        based content, applications, and services.\n            (7) Due to legal and marketplace changes, these features of \n        the Internet are no longer certain, and erosion of these \n        historic policies permits telecommunications network operators \n        to control who can and who cannot offer content, services, and \n        applications over the Internet utilizing such networks.\n            (8) The national economy would be severely harmed if the \n        ability of Internet content, service, and application providers \n        to reach consumers was frustrated by interference from \n        broadband telecommunications network operators.\n            (9) The overwhelming majority of residential consumers \n        subscribe to Internet access service from 1 of only 2 wireline \n        providers: the cable operator or the telephone company.\n            (10) Internet access service providers have an economic \n        interest to discriminate in favor of their own services, \n        content, and applications and against other providers.\n            (11) A network neutrality policy based upon the principle \n        of nondiscrimination and consistent with the history of the \n        Internet's development is essential to ensure that Internet \n        services remain open to all consumers, entrepreneurs, \n        innovators, and providers of lawful content, services, and \n        applications.\n            (12) A network neutrality policy is also essential to give \n        certainty to small businesses, leading global companies, \n        investors, and others who rely upon the Internet for commercial \n        reasons.\n            (13) A network neutrality policy can also permit Internet \n        service providers to take action to protect network \n        reliability, prevent unwanted electronic mail, and thwart \n        illegal uses in the same way that telecommunications network \n        operators have historically done consistent with the \n        overarching principle of non-discrimination.\n            (14) Because of the essential role of Internet services to \n        the economic growth of the United States, to meet other \n        national priorities, and to our right to free speech under the \n        First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the \n        United States should adopt a clear policy preserving the open \n        nature of Internet communications and networks.\n\nSEC. 3.
