MOTIONS TO MODIFY CONSENT DECREES.\n\n    If an agency moves a court to modify a covered settlement agreement \nand the basis of the motion is that the terms of the covered settlement \nagreement are no longer fully in the public interest due to the \nobligations of the agency to fulfill other duties or due to changed \nfacts and circumstances, the court shall review the motion and the \ncovered settlement agreement de novo.\n\nSEC. 5.
