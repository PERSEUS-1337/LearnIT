FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congestion on our roadways is hampering American's \n        daily lives, slowing down commerce, polluting the environment \n        we live in, and wasting fuel. It is estimated that in our \n        metropolitan communities, the average commuter wasted 34 hours \n        in 2009 sitting in traffic, resulting in 3,900,000,000 gallons \n        of wasted fuel and costing more than $115,000,000,000 annually. \n        With our growing population and demand for freight \n        transportation expected to double by 2035, failure to address \n        traffic congestion adds to the cost of goods movement and \n        threatens the Nation's economic competitiveness and quality of \n        life.\n            (2) Even with a record decline in traffic fatalities in \n        2009, nearly 34,000 people were killed on United States roads, \n        the equivalent of more than 200 fully loaded 737 airliners. The \n        economic cost alone of traffic fatalities and injuries has been \n        estimated at $230,000,000,000 each year.\n            (3) The transportation sector contributes nearly one-third \n        of the Nation's carbon dioxide emissions, while wasted fuel \n        from idling vehicles and stop-and-go traffic puts family \n        budgets in the red, drives up the cost of goods and services, \n        and increases our Nation's dependence on foreign oil.\n            (4) The United States cannot continue to simply build our \n        way into a safer, cleaner, and more efficient transportation \n        system. We must make better use of the tools that are \n        available, including intelligent transportation systems (ITS), \n        to actively manage our transportation network to improve \n        safety, efficiency, and multimodal connectivity.\n            (5) Technology solutions are available today to help cities \n        and States reduce congestion and emissions, make our roads and \n        transit systems safer, and provide the public with improved \n        access to transportation options and real-time information to \n        make efficient travel decisions.\n            (6) Transitioning to electric and other alternative fueled \n        vehicles requires the integration of intelligent transportation \n        systems with the Smart Grid and other energy distribution and \n        charging systems.\n            (7) ITS technologies are cost effective and quick to \n        deploy, with solutions like synchronized and adaptive traffic \n        signals yielding a $40 return in time and fuel savings for \n        every $1 invested while also reducing carbon dioxide emissions \n        up to 22 percent and travel delays by 25 percent. The \n        Government Accountability Office found the benefit-cost ratio \n        of a nationwide real-time traffic information system to be 25 \n        to 1, with a $1,200,000,000 investment returning more than \n        $30,000,000,000 in safety, mobility, and environmental \n        benefits. The overall benefit-cost ratio of ITS-enabled \n        operational improvements is estimated at 9 to 1, a significant \n        return on investment when compared to the addition of new \n        highway capacity which has an estimated benefit-to-cost ratio \n        of 2.7 to 1.\n            (8) An estimated 31 percent of traffic crashes could be \n        prevented or have their impact reduced through the deployment \n        of collision avoidance technologies, according to the Insurance \n        Institute for Highway Safety. Moreover, the Department of \n        Transportation estimates that a comprehensive vehicle-to-\n        vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications network \n        could potentially prevent or reduce the impact of 81 percent of \n        all unimpaired vehicle crashes. For ITS technologies like \n        vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure \n        communications, a national coordinated deployment structure is \n        important for ensuring uniform standards and regulations that \n        ensure interoperability and stability.\n            (9) Transitioning to a more efficient, performance-based \n        transportation network requires ITS technologies to provide \n        accurate, real-time traffic and multimodal transportation \n        system information necessary for measuring performance, as well \n        as for actively managing the transportation network to optimize \n        capacity and meet or exceed system performance goals.\n            (10) Effective transportation financing mechanisms of today \n        and tomorrow depend on ITS to be viable, including electronic \n        toll collection, dynamic pricing, integrated payment systems \n        for transit, tolls, parking and other services, and potential \n        future alternatives such as variable mileage-based user fees.\n            (11) Investing in ITS creates good jobs, with an average of \n        50 percent of ITS project spending going directly to wages and \n        salaries as compared to 20 percent for new highway \n        construction. Researchers from the London School of Economics \n        and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation \n        (referred to in this section as ``ITIF'') have found that \n        investing in ITS creates a network effect throughout the \n        economy and stimulates job creation across multiple sectors, \n        including green jobs, high-tech, automotive, information \n        technology, consumer electronics, and related industries. In \n        addition, investing in ITS provides a foundation for long-term \n        benefits including government cost savings, economy-wide \n        productivity, and an improved quality of life.\n            (12) The lack of national investment in ITS has caused the \n        Nation to fall behind other world innovation leaders. A 2010 \n        ITIF report found that the United States is lagging behind \n        Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and other leading Asian and \n        European nations in the deployment of ITS technologies with \n        countries like China beginning to invest heavily in the \n        deployment of transportation technology. These countries have \n        generated significant benefits for their citizens, economy, and \n        environment by investing heavily in ITS solutions. In order to \n        strengthen the Nation's economic competitiveness and quality of \n        life, it is in the interest of the United States to encourage \n        the accelerated development and deployment of intelligent \n        transportation systems.\n\nSEC. 3.
