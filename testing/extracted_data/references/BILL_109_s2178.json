FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) telephone records can be of great use to criminals \n        because the information contained in call logs listed in such \n        records include a wealth of personal data;\n            (2) many call logs reveal the names of telephone users' \n        doctors, public and private relationships, business associates, \n        and more;\n            (3) although other personal information such as social \n        security numbers may appear on public documents, which can be \n        accessed by data brokers, the only warehouse of telephone \n        records is located at the phone companies themselves;\n            (4) telephone records may be accessed without authorization \n        of the customer by--\n                    (A) an employee of the telephone company selling \n                the data;\n                    (B) ``pretexting,'' whereby a data broker or other \n                person pretends to be the owner of the phone and \n                convinces the telephone company's employees to release \n                the data to them; or\n                    (C) unauthorized access of accounts via the \n                Internet; and\n            (5) because telephone companies encourage customers to \n        manage their accounts online, many set up the online capability \n        in advance. Many customers never access their Internet \n        accounts, however. If someone seeking the information activates \n        the account before the customer, he or she can gain unfettered \n        access to the telephone records and call logs of that customer.\n\nSEC. 3. FRAUD AND RELATED ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH OBTAINING \n              CONFIDENTIAL PHONE RECORDS INFORMATION FROM A COVERED \n              ENTITY.\n\n    Chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting \nafter section 1038 the following:\n\n``SEC. 1039.
