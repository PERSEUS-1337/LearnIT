MODEL LICENSING ACT.\n\n    To promote the policy of robust consumer protection for and more \nefficient interstate adjusting of property, casualty, disability, or \nworkers' compensation claims, the Congress hereby urges the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners to adopt a model independent \nclaims adjuster licensing Act that--\n            (1) contains basic standards for the integrity, personal \n        qualifications, education, training, and experience required of \n        independent claims adjusters, including continuing education \n        requirements and ethics course requirements; and\n            (2) does not impose any limitation or condition upon any \n        independent claims adjuster to be licensed or otherwise \n        authorized to do business in a State because of his or her \n        status as a non-resident of that State.\n\nSEC. 3. MULTI-STATE EXAMINATION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Congress hereby urges the NAIC to adopt and \nadminister a multi-State examination for an independent claims adjuster \nseeking to adjust claims in a jurisdiction other than his or her home \nState.\n    (b) Examinee Eligibility.--The NAIC may require that, as a \ncondition for taking a multi-State examination administered pursuant to \nthis section, the examinee shall--\n            (1) be duly licensed as an independent claims adjuster by \n        his or her home State;\n            (2) meet such integrity, degree, training, and experience \n        requirements as the NAIC considers necessary; and\n            (3) meet any continuing education requirements as \n        established by his or her home State.\n    (c) Cross-Jurisdiction Competency.--Any multi-State examination \nadministered pursuant to this section shall require adjusters to \ndemonstrate essential competence with cross-jurisdictional legal and \nregulatory concepts, and shall include such ethics and other testing as \nthe NAIC deems necessary.\n\nSEC. 4. STATE AUTHORITIES.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to--\n            (1) require a State that does not have licensing \n        requirements for independent claims adjusters to adopt any such \n        requirements;\n            (2) subject to section 6, limit the right of a State to \n        establish licensing fees or enforce its laws regarding the \n        adjusting of insurance claims, provided that such fee is \n        uniform regardless of the State of residence of the licensee; \n        or\n            (3) affect the jurisdiction and authority of a State \n        insurance regulator to prescribe and enforce its insurance \n        laws, rules, and regulations regulating independent claims \n        adjuster activity in its jurisdiction.\n\nSEC. 5.
