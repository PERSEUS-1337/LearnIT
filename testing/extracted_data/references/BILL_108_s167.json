(C) cost-competitive;\n            (2) to develop an inorganic white light emitting diode that \n        has an efficiency of 160 lumens per watt and a 10-year \n        lifetime; and\n            (3) to develop an organic white light emitting diode with \n        an efficiency of 100 lumens per watt with a 5-year lifetime \n        that--\n                    (A) illuminates over a full color
