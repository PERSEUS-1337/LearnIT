FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The international traffic in illicit drugs, \n        particularly along the Southwest Border, poses a serious threat \n        to the national security of the United States and to every \n        nation where the production, transit, or consumption of such \n        drugs occurs.\n            (2) The United States considers combating international \n        drug cartels to be one of its highest national security and \n        foreign policy priorities.\n            (3) In order to reduce and eliminate the illicit drug \n        trade, the United States and countries where substantial \n        production or transit of such drugs occurs must cooperate to \n        eradicate and interdict supplies of such drugs and to penetrate \n        the operations of major drug traffickers.\n            (4) It is in the national interest that the President \n        explore all possible mechanisms, including bilateral agreements \n        and other plans on counternarcotics matters, in order to \n        facilitate cooperation in joint counternarcotics programs and \n        to better assist other governments in developing effective \n        counternarcotics programs within their territories.\n            (5) The bilateral agreements and other plans on \n        counternarcotics matters to which the United States is a party \n        should establish concrete and measurable goals with transparent \n        benchmarks for measuring progress in the achievement of such \n        goals.\n\nSEC. 2.
