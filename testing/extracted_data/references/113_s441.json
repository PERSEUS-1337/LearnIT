FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Through careful development, teachers can build their \n        effectiveness over time, thus improving student achievement.\n            (2) Ongoing professional development of teachers in the \n        subjects they teach is essential for improved student learning.\n            (3) United States teachers generally spend more time \n        instructing students and less time in professional learning \n        opportunities with their peers than teachers in top-performing \n        countries.\n            (4) It takes time, resources, and support for teachers to \n        become highly effective in their classrooms. Teachers \n        participating in quality teacher professional development must \n        be given time to implement what they have learned.\n\nSEC. 3.
