FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) law enforcement officials, including members of the \n        International Association of Chiefs of Police, recognize that \n        violent crime represents the greatest threat to the safety and \n        security of citizens and that dedicated, ethical law \n        enforcement professionals, and lawful initiatives and \n        participation by members of the community represent the best \n        hope of responding to the challenges of violent crime;\n            (2) the International Association of Chiefs of Police \n        acknowledges that a few officers choose to violate the public \n        trust by abusing their authority or by breaking the law and \n        that such officers should not be permitted to seek police \n        employment in another State or jurisdiction with the \n        expectation that they will be able to conceal their history of \n        misconduct;\n            (3) there have been numerous documented cases of officers \n        who have obtained officer employment and certification in a \n        State after revocation of officer certification or dishonorable \n        discharge in another State;\n            (4) a national clearinghouse of officer employment \n        histories would enable each criminal justice agency to conduct \n        thorough background checks on officer applicants and to assure \n        that only honest ethical officers are permitted to serve; and\n            (5) Federal legislation is needed that would require \n        Federal registration of employment termination data of law \n        enforcement officers and correctional officers.\n\nSEC. 3. REGISTRATION.\n\n    Subpart 1 of part E of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3781 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n\n ``registration of employment data of law enforcement and correctional \n                                officers\n\n    ``Sec. 509a.

Such terms do not include citizens who are \ncalled to assist an officer in the performance of the officer's duties \nunless such citizen received a deputation or commission of appointment \nlasting longer than 30 days.\n    ``(d)(1) As a condition of employment, each State, territory, or \npolitical subdivision thereof, that employs law enforcement officers or \ncorrectional officers shall require all applicants for appointment to \nor employment in such positions before beginning employment--\n            ``(A) to disclose all prior service or employment as a law \n        enforcement or correctional officer; and\n            ``(B) to submit a written authorization and request for \n        release of information, on a form prescribed by the Attorney \n        General or designee.\n    ``(2) When a prospective law enforcement or correctional employer \nobtains an officer's required written authorization and request for \nrelease of information, the Attorney General (or designee) is directed \nto release all data collected under subsections (a) and (b) of this \nsection to such prospective employer.\n    ``(3) Upon receipt of a completed written authorization and request \nfor release of information and not later than 30 days after such \nofficer is first appointed or employed or at any time prior to the \nappointment or employment of an applicant, each State, territory, and \npolitical subdivision thereof shall notify the Attorney General (or \ndesignee).\n    ``(e) The Attorney General shall issue regulations for the \nimplementation of this section and the operation of the employment data \nclearinghouse.\n    ``(f) Agencies or agency administrators who submit employment or \nofficer certification data pursuant to this section are presumed to be \nacting in good faith and, unless lack of good faith is shown by clear \nand convincing evidence, are immune from civil liability for such \ndisclosure or its consequences.
