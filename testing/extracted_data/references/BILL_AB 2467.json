    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThis act shall be known and may be cited as the Hospital Executive Compensation Transparency Act of 2016.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The public has a direct and immediate interest in ensuring its money is spent efficiently and wisely. Through direct cash payments and exemptions from paying taxes, nonprofit hospitals receive billions in taxpayer funds.\n(b) The compensation packages of chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators of hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities that operate under nonprofit corporate status are often excessive, unnecessary, and inconsistent with the corporations\u2019 charitable purposes, as revealed by compensation surveys and other sources.\n(c) Payment of excessive compensation to executives, managers, and administrators undermines the purposes of nonprofit corporations because it results in fewer funds being available for their charitable purposes, and it is often the case that the hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities that pay the most excessive compensation also provide less charitable care than comparable institutions that pay reasonable compensation to their executives, managers, and administrators.\n(d) Existing requirements of law do not adequately ensure that assets held for charitable purposes are not instead used to enrich executives, managers, and administrators of nonprofit hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities through payment of excessive compensation.\n(e) The compensation packages for chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators of for-profit hospitals in California are often excessive, unnecessary, and inconsistent with the provision of high-quality, affordable medical care, by diverting funds that could be used to expand access to affordable medical care for all Californians.\n(f) Chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators at hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities who are also compensated for their positions on boards of directors of publicly traded companies, privately held companies, and nonprofit organizations risk spending time away from their primary responsibilities to the detriment of high-quality, affordable medical care.\n(g) In order to properly assess the scope of excessive compensation packages in the nonprofit hospital sector and to inform policy decisions related to escalating health care costs, it is necessary to understand excessive compensation among private hospitals.\n(h) In order to ensure equal opportunity and compensation among health care workers in California, it is necessary to understand compensation by job classification and by race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\n(i) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to ensure that compensation packages for chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators of for-profit and nonprofit hospitals are consistent with the goal of providing affordable, high-quality medical care to all Californians.\n(j) The intent of the Legislature in enacting this act is also to ensure that compensation packages for chief executive officers, executives, managers, and administrators of nonprofit hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities are consistent with the charitable purposes of those nonprofits and are reasonable and not excessive in light of the substantial public benefit that the state tax exemption for nonprofit organizations conveys.\n(k) It is also the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to ensure that compensation packages for employees of for-profit and nonprofit hospitals are not discriminatory based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\nSEC. 3.\nChapter 2.17 (commencing with Section 1339.85) is added to Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  2.17.
