MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR DRUG ADMINISTRATION SERVICES.\n\n    (a) General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereafter \nin this Act referred to as ``the Secretary'') shall revise the practice \nexpense relative value units for drug administration services for years \nbeginning with the year 2005 in accordance with this section. For \npurposes of this section, ``drug administration services'' includes \nchemotherapy administration services, therapeutic and diagnostic \ninfusions and injections, and such other services as the Secretary \nspecifies.\n    (b) Direct Costs Equal to 100 Percent of CPEP Estimates.--Using the \ninformation, including estimates of clinical staff time, developed in \nthe clinical practice expert panel process, including refinements by \nAmerican Medical Association committees, the Secretary shall estimate \nthe costs of the nursing and other clinical staff, supplies, and \nprocedure-specific equipment (exceeding a cost specified by the \nSecretary) used in furnishing each type of drug administration service. \nThe Secretary shall utilize without revision the minutes of clinical \nstaff time determined in such process. The Secretary shall convert the \ninformation from such process to estimated costs by applying the most \ncurrent available data on staff salary, supply, and equipment costs, \nand such costs shall be updated to 2005 based on estimated changes in \nprices since the date of such data.\n    (c) Total Practice Expenses.--The Secretary shall estimate the \ntotal practice expenses of each drug administration service by assuming \nthat the direct costs for the service determined under subsection (b) \nare 33.2 percent of such total practice expenses.\n    (d) Conversion to Relative Value Units.--The Secretary shall \nconvert the total practice expenses determined under subsection (c) to \npractice expense relative value units for each drug administration \nservice by dividing such expenses by the conversion factor that will be \nin effect for the physician fee schedule for 2005. The relative value \nunits as so determined shall be used in determining the fee schedule \namounts paid for drug administration services under section 1848 of the \nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4).\n    (e) Updates.--For years after 2005, the relative values determined \nunder subsection (d) shall continue in effect except that the Secretary \nshall revise them as necessary to maintain their accuracy, provided \nthat such revisions are consistent with the methodology set forth in \nthis section.\n    (f) Multiple Pushes.--In establishing the payment amounts under \nthis section, the Secretary shall establish the payment amount for \nintravenous chemotherapy administration by push technique based on the \nadministration of a single drug. The Secretary shall make the same \npayment for each additional drug administered by push technique during \nthe same encounter, except to the extent that the Secretary finds that \nthe cost of administering additional drugs is less than the cost of \nadministering the first drug.\n\nSEC. 4. PAYMENTS FOR CHEMOTHERAPY SUPPORT SERVICES.\n\n    (a) General.--Beginning in the year 2005, the Secretary shall \nrecognize and make payments under section 1848 of the Social Security \nAct (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4) for chemotherapy support services furnished \nincident to physicians' services. For the purposes of this section, \n``chemotherapy support services'' are services furnished by the staff \nof physicians to patients undergoing treatment for cancer that were not \nincluded in the computation of clinical staff costs under section 3(b). \nSuch services include social worker services, nutrition counseling, \npsychosocial services, and similar services.\n    (b) Direct Costs.--The Secretary shall estimate the cost of the \nsalary and benefits of staff furnishing chemotherapy support services \nas they are provided in oncology practices that furnish these services \nto cancer patients in a manner that is considered to be high quality \ncare. The estimate shall be based on the weekly cost of such services \nper patient receiving chemotherapy.\n    (c) Total Costs.--The Secretary shall estimate the total practice \nexpenses of chemotherapy support services by assuming that the direct \ncosts for the service determined under subsection (b) are 33.2 percent \nof such total practice expenses.\n    (d) Conversion to Relative Value Units.--The Secretary shall \nconvert the total practice expenses determined under subsection (c) to \npractice expense relative value units for chemotherapy support services \nby dividing such expenses by the conversion factor that will be in \neffect for the physician fee schedule for 2005. The relative value \nunits as so determined shall be used in determining the fee schedule \namounts paid for chemotherapy support services under such section 1848.\n    (e) Updates.--For the years after 2005, the relative values \ndetermined under subsection (d) shall continue in effect except that \nthe Secretary shall revise them as necessary to maintain their \naccuracy, provided that such revisions are consistent with the \nmethodology set forth in this section.\n\nSEC. 5. CANCER THERAPY MANAGEMENT SERVICES.\n\n    The Secretary shall recognize and establish a payment amount for \nthe service of cancer therapy management to account for the greater \npre-service and post-service work associated with visits and \nconsultations conducted by physicians treating cancer patients compared \nto typical visits and consultations. The payment amount may vary by the \nlevel and type of the related visit or consultation.\n\nSEC. 6. OTHER SERVICES WITHOUT PHYSICIAN WORK RELATIVE VALUE UNITS.\n\n    The Secretary shall develop a revised methodology for determining \nthe payment amounts for services that are paid under the fee schedule \nestablished by section 1848 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395w-4) and that do not have physician work relative value units, \nincluding radiation oncology services. Such methodology shall result in \npayment amounts that fully cover the costs of furnishing such services. \nUntil such time as the methodology for such services is revised and \nimplemented, all such services shall be protected from further payment \ncuts due to factors such as shifts in utilization or removal of any one \nspecialty's services that are paid under the fee schedule established \nby such section 1848 and that do not have physician work relative value \nunits.\n\nSEC. 7. PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION OF SERVICES.\n\n    Section 1834 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395m), as \namended by section 2, is further amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new subsection:\n    ``(o) Supervision Requirements.--If the Secretary requires direct \nsupervision of a service by a physician, that supervision requirement \nmay be fulfilled by one or more physicians other than the physician who \nordered the service. If the supervising physician is different from the \nordering physician for a particular service, the ordering physician may \nnevertheless bill for such service provided that the medical records \nfor the service involved identify the supervising physician or \nphysicians.''.\n\nSEC. 8. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    No later than April 1, 2004, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \na report on the payment amounts that are projected to be adopted under \nsections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Act.\n\nSEC. 9.
