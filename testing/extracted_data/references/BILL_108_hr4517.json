FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It serves the national interest to increase refinery \n        capacity for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel \n        wherever located within the United States, to bring more supply \n        to the markets for use by the American people. Forty-eight \n        percent of the crude oil in the United States is used for the \n        production of gasoline. Production and use of refined petroleum \n        products has a significant impact on interstate commerce.\n            (2) United States demand for refined petroleum products, \n        such as gasoline and heating oil, currently exceeds our \n        domestic capacity to produce them. By 2025, United States \n        gasoline consumption is projected to rise from 8,900,000 \n        barrels per day to 13,300,000 barrels per day. Diesel fuel and \n        home heating oil are becoming larger components of an \n        increasing demand for refined petroleum supply. With the \n        increase in air travel, jet fuel consumption is projected to be \n        760,000 barrels per day higher in 2025 than today.\n            (3) The refinery industry is operating at nearly 100 \n        percent of capacity during the peak gasoline consumption season \n        and is producing record levels of needed products at other \n        times. The excess demand has recently been met by increased \n        imports. The United States currently is importing 7 percent of \n        its refined petroleum products but few foreign refiners can \n        produce the clean fuels required in the United States.\n            (4) Refiners are subject to significant environmental and \n        other regulations and face several new Clean Air Act \n        requirements over the next decade. Today 153 refineries operate \n        in the United States, down from 324 in 1981. Almost 25 percent \n        of our Nation's refining capacity is controlled by foreign \n        ownership. Easily restored capacity at idled refineries \n        amounted to 539,000 barrels a day in 2002, or 3.3 percent of \n        the total operating capacity. No new refineries have been built \n        in the United States since 1976. Most refineries are located on \n        century-old sites. New Clean Air Act requirements will benefit \n        the environment but will also require substantial capital \n        investment and additional government permits.\n            (5) Refiners have met growing demand by increasing the use \n        of existing equipment and increasing the efficiency and \n        capacity of existing plants. But refining capacity has begun to \n        lag behind peak summer demand.\n            (6) Heavy industry and manufacturing jobs have closed or \n        relocated due to barriers to investment, burdensome regulation, \n        and high costs of operation, among other reasons.\n            (7) More regulatory certainty for refinery owners is needed \n        to stimulate investment in increased refinery capacity.\n            (8) Required procedures for Federal, State, and local \n        regulatory approvals need to be streamlined to ensure that \n        increased refinery capacity can be developed and operated in a \n        safe, timely, and cost-effective manner.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF REFINERY REVITALIZATION ZONES.\n\n    The Secretary of Energy shall designate as a Refinery \nRevitalization Zone any area--\n            (1) that--\n                    (A) has experienced mass layoffs at manufacturing \n                facilities, as determined by the Secretary of Labor; or\n                    (B) contains an idle refinery; and\n            (2) that has an unemployment rate of at least 20 percent \n        above the national average, as set forth by the Department of \n        Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, at the time of designation \n        as a Refinery Revitalization Zone.\n\nSEC. 4. COMPLIANCE WITH ALL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS REQUIRED.\n\n    The best available control technology, as appropriate, shall be \nemployed on all refineries located within a Refinery Revitalization \nZone to comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local \nenvironmental regulations. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \nwaive or diminish in any manner the applicability to any refinery \nfacility located within a Refinery Revitalization Zone existing or \nfuture environmental regulations.\n\nSEC. 5. COORDINATION AND EXPEDITIOUS REVIEW OF PERMITTING PROCESS.\n\n    (a) Department of Energy Lead Agency.--Upon request of an applicant \nfor a Federal authorization related to the siting and operation of a \nrefinery facility within a Refinery Revitalization Zone, the Department \nof Energy shall be the lead agency for coordinating all applicable \nFederal authorizations and related environmental reviews of the \nfacility. To the maximum extent practicable under applicable Federal \nlaw, the Secretary of Energy shall coordinate this Federal \nauthorization and review process with any Indian Tribes and State and \nlocal agencies responsible for conducting any separate permitting and \nenvironmental reviews of the facility, to ensure timely and efficient \nreview and approval of any permit decisions.\n    (b) Authority to Set Deadlines.--As lead agency, the Department of \nEnergy, in consultation with agencies responsible for Federal \nauthorizations and, as appropriate, with Indian Tribes and State or \nlocal agencies willing to coordinate their own separate permitting and \nenvironmental reviews with the Federal authorization and environmental \nreviews, shall establish prompt and binding intermediate and ultimate \ndeadlines for the review of, and Federal authorization decisions \nrelating to, the refinery facility. The Secretary of Energy shall \nensure that once an application has been submitted with such data as \nthe Secretary considers necessary, all permit decisions and related \nenvironmental reviews under all applicable Federal laws shall be \ncompleted within 6 months or, where circumstances require otherwise, as \nsoon thereafter as is practicable. The Secretary of Energy also shall \nprovide an expeditious preapplication mechanism for prospective \napplicants to confer with the agencies involved to have each such \nagency determine and communicate to the prospective applicant within 60 \ndays after the prospective applicant submits a request for the \ninformation concerning--\n            (1) the likelihood of approval for a potential facility; \n        and\n            (2) key issues of concern to the agencies and public.\n    (c) Consolidated Environmental Review and Record of Decision.--As \nlead agency, the Department of Energy, in consultation with the \naffected agencies, shall prepare a single environmental review \ndocument, which shall be used as the basis for all decisions on the \nproposed project under Federal law. The document may be an \nenvironmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 if warranted, or such other \nform of analysis as may be warranted, in the discretion of the \nSecretary. Such document shall include consideration by the relevant \nagencies of any applicable criteria or other matters as required under \napplicable laws.\n    (d) Appeals.--In the event any agency has denied a Federal \nauthorization required for a refinery facility within a Refinery \nRevitalization Zone, or has failed to act by the deadline established \nby the Secretary pursuant to this section for deciding whether to issue \nthe authorization, the applicant or any State in which the facility \nwould be located may file an appeal with the Secretary. Based on the \noverall record and in consultation with the affected agency, the \nSecretary may then either issue the necessary authorization with \nappropriate conditions, or deny the application. The Secretary shall \nissue a decision within 60 days after the filing of the appeal. In \nmaking a decision under this subsection, the Secretary shall comply \nwith applicable requirements of Federal law, including any requirements \nof the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, \nthe Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Historic Preservation \nAct, and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Any judicial \nappeal of the Secretary's decision shall be to the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n    (e) Conforming Regulations and Memoranda of Understanding.--Not \nlater than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary of Energy shall issue any regulations necessary to implement \nthis section. Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary and the heads of all Federal agencies with \nauthority to issue Federal authorizations shall enter into Memoranda of \nUnderstanding to ensure the timely and coordinated review and \npermitting of refinery facilities within a Refinery Revitalization \nZone. The head of each Federal agency with authority to issue a Federal \nauthorization shall designate a senior official responsible for, and \ndedicate sufficient other staff and resources to ensure, full \nimplementation of the Department of Energy regulations and any \nMemoranda under this subsection. Interested Indian Tribes and State and \nlocal agencies may enter such Memoranda of Understanding.\n\nSEC. 6.
