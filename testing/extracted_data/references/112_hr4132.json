    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Faster Access to Specialized \nTreatments Act'' or ``FAST Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) serves a \n        critical role in helping to assure that new medicines are safe \n        and effective. Regulatory innovation is one element of the \n        Nation's strategy to address serious and life-threatening \n        diseases or conditions by promoting investment in and \n        development of innovative treatments for unmet medical needs.\n            (2) Over the previous two decades, since the accelerated \n        approval mechanism was established, advances in medical \n        sciences, including genomics, molecular biology, and \n        bioinformatics, have provided an unprecedented understanding of \n        the underlying biological mechanism and pathogenesis of \n        disease. A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is \n        currently under development to treat serious and life-\n        threatening diseases, some applying drug development strategies \n        based on biomarkers or pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, \n        clinical trial enrichment techniques, and novel clinical trial \n        designs, such as adaptive clinical trials.\n            (3) As a result of these remarkable scientific and medical \n        advances, FDA should be encouraged to implement more broadly \n        effective processes for the expedited development and review of \n        innovative new medicines intended to address unmet medical \n        needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, \n        including those for rare diseases or conditions, using a broad \n        range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and modern scientific \n        tools earlier in the drug development cycle when appropriate. \n        This may result in fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials \n        for the intended patient population or targeted subpopulation \n        without compromising or altering FDA's existing high standards \n        for the approval of drugs.\n            (4) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and \n        effective innovative therapies to treat unmet medical needs for \n        serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n            (5) For these reasons, the existing statutory authority \n        governing expedited approval of drugs or serious or life-\n        threatening conditions should be amended in order to enhance \n        FDA's authority to consider appropriate scientific data, \n        methods, and tools, and to expedite development and access to \n        novel treatments for patients with a broad range oofserious or \n        life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Food \nand Drug Administration should apply the accelerated approval and the \nfast track provisions set forth in section 506 of the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356), as amended by section 3, to the \ngreatest extent possible to help expedite the development and \navailability to patients of treatments for serious or life-threatening \ndiseases or conditions while maintaining appropriate safety and \neffectiveness standards for such treatments.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING \n              DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.\n\n    Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n356) is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 506. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING \n              DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.\n\n    ``(a) Designation of Drug as a Fast Track Product.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, at the request of \n        the sponsor of a new drug, facilitate the development and \n        expedite the review of such drug if it is intended, whether \n        alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the \n        treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or \n        condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet \n        medical needs for such a disease or condition. (In this \n        section, such a drug is referred to as a `fast track product'.)\n            ``(2) Request for designation.--The sponsor of a new drug \n        may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast track \n        product. A request for the designation may be made concurrently \n        with, or at any time after, submission of an application for \n        the investigation of the drug under section 505(i) or section \n        351(a)(3) of the Public Health Service Act.\n            ``(3) Designation.--Within 60 calendar days after the \n        receipt of a request under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall \n        determine whether the drug that is the subject of the request \n        meets the criteria described in paragraph (1). If the Secretary \n        finds that the drug meets the criteria, the Secretary shall \n        designate the drug as a fast track product and shall take such \n        actions as are appropriate to expedite the development and \n        review of the application for approval of such product.\n    ``(b) Accelerated Approval of a Drug for a Serious or Life-\nThreatening Disease or Condition, Including a Fast Track Product.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may approve an application \n        for approval of a product for a serious or life-threatening \n        disease or condition, including a fast track product, under \n        section 505(c) or section 351(a) of the Public Health Service \n        Act upon making a determination (taking into account the \n        severity or rarity of the disease or condition and the \n        availability of alternative treatments) that the product has an \n        effect on--\n                    ``(A) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably \n                likely to predict clinical benefit; or\n                    ``(B) a clinical endpoint, including an endpoint \n                that can be measured earlier than irreversible \n                morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to \n                predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or \n                mortality or other clinical benefit.\n        The evidence to support that an endpoint is reasonably likely \n        to predict clinical benefit may include epidemiological, \n        pathophysiologic, pharmacologic, therapeutic or other evidence \n        developed using, for example, biomarkers, or other scientific \n        methods or tools.\n            ``(2) Limitation.--Approval of a product under this \n        subsection may, as determined by the Secretary, be subject to \n        the following requirements--\n                    ``(A) that the sponsor conduct appropriate post-\n                approval studies to verify and describe the predicted \n                effect of the product on irreversible morbidity or \n                mortality or other clinical benefit; and\n                    ``(B) that the sponsor submit copies of all \n                promotional materials related to the product, at least \n                30 days prior to dissemination of the materials \n                during--\n                            ``(i) the preapproval review period; and\n                            ``(ii) following approval, for a period \n                        that the Secretary determines to be \n                        appropriate.\n            ``(3) Expedited withdrawal of approval.--The Secretary may \n        withdraw approval of a product approved pursuant to this \n        subsection using expedited procedures (as prescribed by the \n        Secretary in regulations, which shall include an opportunity \n        for an informal hearing) if--\n                    ``(A) the sponsor fails to conduct any required \n                post-approval study of the product with due diligence;\n                    ``(B) a study required to verify and describe the \n                predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality \n                or other clinical benefit of the product fails to \n                verify and describe such effect or benefit;\n                    ``(C) other evidence demonstrates that the product \n                is not safe or effective under the conditions of use; \n                or\n                    ``(D) the sponsor disseminates false or misleading \n                promotional materials with respect to the product.\n    ``(c) Review of Incomplete Applications for Approval of a Fast \nTrack Product.--\n            ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary determines, after \n        preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the \n        sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective, the \n        Secretary shall evaluate for filing, and may commence review of \n        portions of, an application for the approval of the product \n        before the sponsor submits a complete application.
