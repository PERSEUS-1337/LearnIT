FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The problem of family violence does not necessarily \n        cease when the victimized family is legally separated, \n        divorced, or otherwise not sharing a household. During \n        separation and divorce, family violence often escalates, and \n        child custody and visitation become the new forum for the \n        continuation of abuse.\n            (2) Current child custody and visitation laws are based on \n        incorrect assumptions that divorcing parents are in relatively \n        equal positions of power and that such parents always act in \n        the children's best interest. These laws often work against the \n        protection of the children and the abused spouse or intimate \n        partner in families with a history of family violence.\n            (3) Some perpetrators use the children as pawns to control \n        the abused party after the couple is separated.\n            (4) Every year an estimated 1,000 to 5,000 children are \n        killed by their parents in the United States.\n            (5) In 1988, the Department of Justice reported that \n        354,100 children were abducted by family members who violated \n        custody agreements or decrees. Most victims were children from \n        ages 2 to 11 years.\n            (6) Approximately 160,000 children are seriously injured or \n        impaired by abuse or neglect each year.\n            (7) Studies by the American Humane Association indicate \n        that reports of child abuse and neglect have increased by over \n        200 percent from 1976 to 1986.\n            (8) Approximately 90 percent of children in homes in which \n        their mothers are abused witness the abuse.\n            (9) Data indicates that women and children are at elevated \n        risk for violence during the process of and after separation.\n            (10) Fifty to 70 percent of men who abuse their spouses or \n        partners also abuse their children.\n            (11) Up to 75 percent of all domestic assaults reported to \n        law enforcement agencies were inflicted after the separation of \n        the couples.\n            (12) In one study of spousal homicide, over half of the \n        male defendants were separated from their victims.\n            (13) Seventy-three percent of battered women seeking \n        emergency medical services do so after separation.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to authorize funding to enable \nsupervised visitation centers to provide the following:\n            (1) Supervised visitation in cases where there is \n        documented sexual, physical or emotional abuse as determined by \n        the appropriate court.\n            (2) Supervised visitation in cases where there is suspected \n        or elevated risk of sexual, physical or emotional abuse, or \n        where there have been threats of parental abduction of the \n        child.\n            (3) Supervised visitation for children who have been placed \n        in foster homes as a result of abuse.\n            (4) An evaluation of visitation between parents and \n        children for child protection social services to assist such \n        service providers in making determinations of whether the \n        children should be returned to a previously abusive home.\n            (5) A safe location for custodial parents to temporarily \n        transfer custody of their children with non-custodial parents, \n        or to provide a protected visitation environment, where there \n        has been a history of domestic violence or an order for \n        protection is involved.\n            (6) An additional safeguard against the child witnessing \n        abuse or a safeguard against the injury or death of a child or \n        parent.\n            (7) An environment for families to have healthy interaction \n        activities, quality time, non-violent memory building \n        experiences during visitation to help build the parent/child \n        relationship.\n            (8) Parent and child education and support groups to help \n        parents heal and learn new skills, and to help children heal \n        from past abuse.\n\nSEC. 4.
