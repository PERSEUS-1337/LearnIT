    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Voluntary Alcohol Advertising \nStandards for Children Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Television advertising influences children's perception \n        of the values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n        society.\n            (2) Television station operators and cable television \n        system operators should follow practices in connection with the \n        advertising of alcoholic beverages that take into consideration \n        that television broadcast and cable advertising have \n        established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of \n        American children.\n            (3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of \n        television each week and some children are exposed to as much \n        as 11 hours of television a day.\n            (4) In 1995, alcohol producers, led by brewers, spent \n        $682,600,000 advertising their products in the broadcast media. \n        Much of that advertising appeared on sports programming, in \n        prime time, or at other times when substantial numbers of \n        underage persons were in the viewing and listening audience. \n        Many of the themes used in the ads--humor, parties, athletic \n        pursuits--have great appeal for young people. The most popular \n        beer ads use animated characters, animals, or music which also \n        amuse and attract children and teens.\n            (5) The current advertising codes of brewers and \n        distillers, even when observed by industry members, provide \n        inadequate standards to restrain most of the current \n        advertising messages that reach young people and teach them to \n        drink. These codes are unenforceable, do not apply to all \n        alcohol companies, and institutionalize, rather than restrict, \n        advertising practices that subject young people to massive, \n        continuous, and persuasive inducements to drink. Although \n        individual broadcast networks and independent stations have \n        adopted standards governing the acceptance of advertising for \n        alcoholic beverages, those standards lack uniformity, do not \n        apply to all broadcasters, nor do they help shield large \n        audiences of underage persons from alcohol promotions.\n            (6) Alcohol producers claim to have no interest in \n        attracting underage persons, for whom the purchase and use of \n        their products are illegal. The development of voluntary \n        broadcast industry alcohol advertising standards to protect \n        children would avoid broader government restrictions on alcohol \n        advertising and permit alcohol producers to continue to \n        legitimately promote their products to adult consumers. \n        Therefore, enforceable voluntary broadcast standards provide a \n        minimally restrictive, necessary condition on alcohol producer \n        marketing activities, one that is consistent with their \n        business missions and social responsibility.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TELEVISION ADVERTISING \n              CODES.\n\n    Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 337.
