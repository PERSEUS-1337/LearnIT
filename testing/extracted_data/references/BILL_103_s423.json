FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the activities of investment advisers are of continuing \n        national concern;\n            (2) increased supervision of investment advisers by the \n        Securities and Exchange Commission (hereafter in this Act \n        referred to as the ``Commission'') is necessary to protect \n        investors from fraud and other illegal conduct;\n            (3) additional resources are necessary to recover the \n        Commission's costs of an enhanced program for the oversight of \n        investment advisers and their activities, including the costs \n        of registration and inspections; and\n            (4) because the direct beneficiaries of these activities \n        are investment advisers, it is appropriate for investment \n        advisers to pay fees for such activities.\n\nSEC. 3.
