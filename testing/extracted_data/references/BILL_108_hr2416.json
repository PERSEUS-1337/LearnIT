FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Paleontological resources are nonrenewable. Such \n        resources on Federal lands are an accessible and irreplaceable \n        part of the heritage of the United States and offer significant \n        educational opportunities to all citizens.\n            (2) Existing Federal laws, statutes, and other provisions \n        that manage paleontological resources are not articulated in a \n        unified national policy for Federal land management agencies \n        and the public. Such a policy is needed to improve scientific \n        understanding, to promote responsible stewardship, and to \n        facilitate the enhancement of responsible paleontological \n        collecting activities on Federal lands.\n            (3) Consistent with the statutory provisions applicable to \n        each Federal land management system, reasonable access to \n        paleontological resources on Federal lands should be provided \n        for scientific, educational, and recreational purposes.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a comprehensive national \npolicy for preserving and managing paleontological resources on Federal \nlands.\n\nSEC. 4.
