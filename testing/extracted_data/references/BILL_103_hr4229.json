Nothing in \nthis section shall be construed to allow Indian tribes to assume or \nmaintain primary enforcement responsibility for programs under this \nsubtitle in a manner less protective of human health and the \nenvironment than such responsibility may be assumed or maintained by a \nState. An Indian tribe shall not be required to exercise criminal \njurisdiction for purposes of complying with the preceding sentence.\n    ``(d) Cost Share.--An Indian tribe shall not be required to pay any \nportion of the cost of corrective actions undertaken by either the \nAdministrator or by the Indian tribe under a cooperative agreement if, \nin the judgment of the Administrator, such requirement would impose an \nundue burden on the Indian tribe or be inappropriate, administratively \ninfeasible, or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of this \nsubtitle or the Federal trust responsibility to Indian tribes.\n    ``(e) Cooperative Agreements.--In order to ensure the consistent \nimplementation of the requirements of this subtitle, an Indian tribe \nand the State or States in which the lands of such Indian tribe are \nlocated may enter into a cooperative agreement, subject to the review \nand approval of the Administrator, to jointly plan and administer the \nrequirements of this subtitle in Indian country.\n    ``(f) Study of Underground Storage Tanks Within Indian Country.--\n(1) Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this \nsection, the Administrator shall complete a study and inventory of all \nunderground storage tanks located within Indian country.
