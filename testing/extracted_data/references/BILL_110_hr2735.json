FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Wildlife Refuge System is a unique network \n        of Federal lands that provides wildlife dependent recreational \n        opportunities to the overwhelming majority of the 40 million \n        people who visit at least one refuge in a year.\n            (2) There are 547 national wildlife refuges comprised of 96 \n        million acres of Federal land. These refuges are located in \n        every State, island possession, and territory of the United \n        States. These lands are a national treasure.\n            (3) A decade ago, the Congress enacted the National \n        Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-\n        97), which was a landmark law that established for the first \n        time an organic statute and mission statement for the System.\n            (4) Four years ago, the National Wildlife Refuge System \n        celebrated the 100th anniversary of the designation of the \n        first refuge by President Theodore Roosevelt at Pelican Island, \n        Florida on March 14, 1903.\n            (5) In commemoration of that historic event, the Congress \n        created the National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial \n        Commission and appropriated the highest level of funding ever \n        for refuge operations.\n            (6) Since the end of that anniversary celebration, however, \n        funding for refuge operations has significantly declined, and \n        the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has not received \n        adequate funding to offset either inflation or uncontrollable \n        fixed costs like salary and benefit increases, energy costs, \n        and General Services Administration rent adjustments.\n            (7) The net result is that the United States Fish and \n        Wildlife Service now has 600 vacant positions with a total \n        workforce of only 9,000 full-time employees. There are also now \n        86 refuges that are closed to the public and 188 refuges that \n        are unstaffed.\n            (8) According to the Cooperative Alliance for Refuge \n        Enhancement, a coalition of 20 conservation and hunting \n        organizations including Ducks Unlimited, the National Audubon \n        Society, and the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, ``[t]he \n        National Wildlife Refuge System faces a crippling conservation \n        deficit''.\n            (9) According to the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service with respect to the Northeast Region of the Service, \n        ``[i]n three years, 74 percent of the national wildlife refuges \n        (70 refuges) would be operating either `in the red' or at \n        crisis levels, in 5 years, 89 percent, and in 7 years, 93 \n        percent''. This funding crisis is being felt throughout the \n        National Wildlife Refuge System.\n            (10) It is essential that the Congress appropriate \n        additional funds for refuge operations and enact new funding \n        mechanisms that alleviate some, if not all, of these staggering \n        operational deficits.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish new funding \nmechanisms to pay for the otherwise unfunded costs of operating and \nmaintaining the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\n                 TITLE I--MIGRATORY BIRD HUNTING STAMPS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE OF STAMP.\n\n    (a) Increase in Price.--\n            (1) In general.--Sections 2(b) of the Act of March 16, 1934 \n        (chapter 71; 16 U.S.C. 718b(b)), popularly known as the Duck \n        Stamp Act, is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(b) Price of Stamp.--A person authorized to sell stamps under \nthis section shall collect, for each stamp sold--\n            ``(1) $20 for a stamp for any of hunting years 2008 through \n        2010; and\n            ``(2) $25 for a stamp for each hunting year after hunting \n        year 2010.''.\n            (2) Limitation on application.--This subsection shall not \n        affect the application of section 2 of such Act before July 1, \n        2008.\n    (b) Use of Additional Funds.--Section 4(b) of such Act (16 U.S.C. \n718d(b)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``So much'' and inserting \n        ``Subject to paragraph (3), so much'';\n            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``paragraph (3) and \n        subsection (c)'' and inserting ``paragraphs (3) and (4)''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(4) Refuge operations.--The amount received for each \n        stamp sold in excess of $15.00 shall be used by the Secretary \n        for the costs of national wildlife refuge operations.''.\n\nSEC. 102.
