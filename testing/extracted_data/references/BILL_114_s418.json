FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in \n        the United States.\n            (2) Researchers estimate that the medical costs of the \n        obesity epidemic in the United States may total \n        $270,000,000,000 annually.\n            (3) More than one-third of children and adolescents are \n        estimated to be overweight or obese.\n            (4) Of all United States deaths from major chronic disease, \n        23 percent are linked to sedentary lifestyles that now begin at \n        childhood.\n            (5) Overweight adolescents have a 70- to 80-percent chance \n        of becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for \n        chronic disease, disability, and death.\n            (6) Studies show that children born today, for the first \n        time in 2 centuries, have a shorter life expectancy than their \n        parents.\n            (7) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, in 2006--\n                    (A) 1 in 5 students in grades 9-12 seriously \n                considers suicide;\n                    (B) 1 in 3 12th graders, 1 in 4 10th graders, and 1 \n                in 10 8th graders binge drink; and\n                    (C) 1 in 10 children suffer mental illness causing \n                some level of impairment.\n            (8) Studies show that--\n                    (A) students who receive social-psychological \n                support and prevention have improved academic \n                achievement;\n                    (B) instruction in personal and social skills \n                improves decisionmaking and reduces risky health \n                behaviors; and\n                    (C) comprehensive programs linking rigorous \n                instruction with health, education, social services, \n                and health services in schools can reduce absenteeism.\n            (9) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        recommends that students receive a minimum of 50 hours of \n        health education per year in order to ensure health literacy.\n            (10) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, only 6.4 percent of elementary schools, 20.6 \n        percent of middle schools, and 35.8 percent of high schools \n        require health instruction in all 14 recommended health topics \n        and only 3.8 percent of elementary schools, 7.8 percent of \n        middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high schools provide daily \n        physical education or its equivalent.\n            (11) The Institute of Medicine in 2004 reported that \n        enhanced school health education programs are essential to \n        developing a health literate society in the United States as \n        the Nation faces increasing health care challenges. In 2013, \n        the Institute of Medicine recommended elevating physical \n        education to a ``core subject'' in an effort to combat \n        childhood obesity.\n            (12) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, studies suggest that physical activity can impact \n        cognitive skills and attitudes, and important components of \n        improved academic performance, including enhanced concentration \n        and attention as well as improved classroom behavior.\n            (13) The White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report \n        recommends increasing the quality and frequency of sequential, \n        age, and developmentally appropriate physical education for all \n        students, taught by certified physical education teachers.\n            (14) The Society of Health and Physical Educators \n        recommends that elementary school students receive 150 minutes \n        per week of physical education and that middle school and high \n        school students receive 225 minutes per week of physical \n        education.\n            (15) The American school system is already situated to \n        reach 50,000,000 children and youth to provide the health and \n        physical education they need and a place for them to engage in \n        these behaviors, such as nutritious eating and participating in \n        physical activity.\n            (16) Military readiness is vulnerable, as almost 30 percent \n        of 17-24 year olds are too overweight to serve in the U.S. \n        military.\n            (17) Physical education and health education are critical \n        to combating these harmful trends and are key components to \n        educating the whole child.\n\nSEC. 3. HEALTH EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 9101(11) of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801(11)) is amended by striking ``and \ngeography'' and inserting ``geography, physical education, and health \neducation''.\n    (b) Assessments.--Section 1111(b)(3) of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n                    ``(E) Assessments for health education and physical \n                education.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n                Act, each State shall determine the most feasible \n                measure for assessing students in health education and \n                physical education, including the use of adaptive \n                assessments, to measure student knowledge and \n                performance according to State standards and \n                benchmarks.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
