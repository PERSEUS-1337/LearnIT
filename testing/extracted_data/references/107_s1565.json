    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) On May 26, 1972, President Nixon and General Secretary \n        Brezhnev signed the Treaty Between the United States of America \n        and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation \n        of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems. The ABM Treaty was ratified \n        by the Senate on August 3, 1972, by a vote of 88-2, and entered \n        into force on October 3, 1972.\n            (2) The ABM Treaty sought to end an emerging competition in \n        defensive systems between the United States and the Soviet \n        Union that threatened to spur an offensive nuclear arms race, \n        and to create more favorable conditions to further limit \n        strategic nuclear weapons.\n            (3) The ABM Treaty was designed to address the major threat \n        to the United States at that time, the threat of a nuclear arms \n        race with the Soviet Union, and did not contemplate the \n        potential emergence of other strategic missile threats.\n            (4) The ABM Treaty remains important to arms control, \n        nuclear nonproliferation, and United States national security \n        because it promotes strategic stability, facilitates reductions \n        in offensive nuclear weapons, and encourages movement toward \n        more secure and stable nuclear alert postures.\n            (5) The ABM Treaty is of unlimited duration, but each party \n        to the treaty has the right to withdraw on six months notice if \n        the party decides that its supreme interests are jeopardized by \n        ``extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this \n        Treaty''.\n            (6) The mid-course hit-to-kill national missile defense \n        system is currently in the early stages of research and \n        development. The fourth research and development intercept test \n        of the system was conducted on July 14, 2001. A total of \n        twenty-one developmental intercept tests are planned, and \n        subsequent operational testing of the system is not scheduled \n        to begin until fiscal year 2005.\n            (7) On July 12, 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld stated \n        that ``[t]he United States is not going to violate the [ABM] \n        Treaty. If we get to the point where we need to get beyond the \n        treaty and we haven't been able to negotiate something, \n        obviously, there's a provision you can withdraw in six months \n        and that's what you'd have to do.''.\n            (8) Unilateral abrogation or withdrawal from the ABM Treaty \n        by the United States will have profound implications for global \n        security and stability and for United States national security \n        interests, and is viewed with apprehension by United States \n        allies as well as other states.\n            (9) While unilateral abrogation or withdrawal from the ABM \n        Treaty would have negative consequences for United States \n        security, negotiated modest modifications of the Treaty could \n        preserve the essential effectiveness of the Treaty with respect \n        to Russia, and allow the United States to address threats that \n        have emerged since the ABM Treaty was drafted in 1972.\n            (10) At their July 22, 2001 meeting in Geneva, Presidents \n        Bush and Putin agreed ``that major changes in the world require \n        concrete discussion of both offensive and defensive systems. We \n        already have some strong and tangible points of agreement. We \n        will shortly begin intensive consultations on the interrelated \n        subjects of offensive and defensive systems.''.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF SENATE ON UNITED STATES ADHERENCE TO THE ABM TREATY.\n\n    It is the sense of the Senate that--\n            (1) all research, development, test, and evaluation \n        programs and activities of the United States for missile \n        defense purposes should remain consistent with United States \n        commitments to and obligations under the ABM Treaty;\n            (2) the United States should pursue good faith \n        consultations with Russia to address such modest modifications \n        of the ABM Treaty as may be necessary to address threats which \n        have emerged since the Treaty was signed and lead to an \n        agreement on appropriate limits on strategic nuclear offensive \n        and defensive systems that is in the national security interest \n        of the United States;\n            (3) the United States should not unilaterally abrogate or \n        withdraw from the ABM Treaty; and\n            (4) the United States should not deploy a national missile \n        defense system until--\n                    (A) operational tests of a fully integrated version \n                of the system have been conducted utilizing realistic \n                test parameters; and\n                    (B) the operational tests have demonstrated, in a \n                manner consistent with the provisions of section 2399 \n                of title 10, United States Code, that the system, \n                whether part of a fully integrated system or an \n                emergency deployment, is operationally effective and \n                suitable for use in combat.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS AND \n              ACTIVITIES.\n\n    (a) Limitation on Use To Abrogate ABM Treaty.--Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law, no funds may be obligated or expended for any \ntest, evaluation, or deployment of a National Missile Defense system, \nor any program or activity relating to a National Missile Defense \nsystem, that would result in the abrogation of or withdrawal from the \nABM Treaty.\n    (b) Limitation on Use Inconsistent With Future Agreements.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, if an agreement with Russia \nto amend the ABM Treaty, or an agreement with Russia governing \nstrategic nuclear offensive and defensive systems, comes into force \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act, no funds may be obligated \nor expended after the date such agreement comes into force for any \ntest, evaluation, or deployment of a National Missile Defense system, \nor any program or activity relating to a National Missile Defense \nsystem, that would by inconsistent with such agreement.\n    (c) Scope of Limitation.--For purposes of this section, a test, \nevaluation, or deployment of a system shall include any construction \nrequired to carry out the test, evaluation, or deployment of the \nsystem.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORTS ON DECISIONS RELATING TO DEPLOYMENT OF A NATIONAL \n              MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Report by Secretary of State Before Decisions.--Not later than \n120 days before any decision by the President described in subsection \n(c), the Secretary of State shall submit to Congress a report, in \nwriting, containing the following:\n            (1) A description of the specific national security threat \n        that justifies such decision.\n            (2) An assessment of the extent to which testing not \n        compliant with the ABM Treaty, and the deployment of an \n        integrated missile defense system or emergency capability using \n        test assets, will enhance overall United States national \n        security, which assessment shall take into account--\n                    (A) the likelihood of the missile threat that the \n                testing or deployment, as the case may be, is designed \n                to counter;\n                    (B) the impact of the testing or deployment, as the \n                case may be, on United States relations with our \n                allies, and with Russia and China; and\n                    (C) the impact of the testing or deployment, as the \n                case may be, on existing nuclear arms control \n                agreements, nuclear risk reduction objectives, and \n                United States nonproliferation goals and treaty \n                commitments.\n    (b) Certification by Secretary of Defense Before Decisions.--(1) \nNot later than 120 days before a decision by the President described in \nsubsection (c)(1), the Secretary of Defense shall certify to Congress, \nin writing, that--\n            (A) operational tests of a fully integrated version of the \n        missile system or emergency capability concerned have been \n        conducted utilizing realistic test parameters, including \ncountermeasures and decoys; and\n            (B) such operational tests have demonstrated, in a manner \n        consistent with the provisions of section 2399 of title 10, \n        United States Code, that the missile system or emergency \n        capability, as the case may be, whether part of a fully \n        integrated system or an emergency deployment, is operationally \n        effective and suitable for use in combat.\n    (2) A certification under this subsection shall be submitted in \nboth classified and unclassified form.\n    (c) Covered Decisions.--The decisions described in this subsection \nare as follows:\n            (1) A decision to deploy a missile system designated to \n        defend the territory of the United States against ballistic \n        missile attack, including the deployment of an emergency \n        capability utilizing missile defense assets.\n            (2) A decision to notify Russia of the intention of the \n        United States to withdraw from the ABM Treaty.\n\nSEC. 5.
