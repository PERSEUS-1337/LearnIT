Additional facilities projected to be operating at the site at a time beyond the forthcoming 12-year period shall not be considered in the determination of conformity with the\nelectric power\nelectricity\ndemand forecast.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 25516 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n25516.\n(a)\nThe approval of the notice by the commission shall be based upon findings pursuant to Section 25514.

If a notice is approved based on one site and related facility, the commission may require a new notice to be filed to identify acceptable alternative sites and related facilities for the one site and related facility approved unless suitable alternative sites and related facilities have been approved by the commission in previous notice of intention proceedings.\n(c)\nIf the commission finds that additional\nelectric\nelectrical\ngenerating capacity is needed to accommodate the\nelectric power\nelectricity\ndemand forecast pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 25305 and, after the commission finds that a good faith effort was made by the person submitting the notice to propose an acceptable site and related facility, it fails to find any proposed site and related facility to be acceptable, the commission shall designate, at the request of and at the expense of the person submitting the notice, a feasible site and related facility for providing the needed\nelectric\nelectrical\ngenerating capacity.\nSEC. 5.\nSection 740.3 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:\n740.3.\n(a) The commission, in cooperation with the\nState Energy Conservation and Development\nEnergy\nCommission, the State Air Resources Board, air quality management districts and air pollution control districts, regulated electrical and gas corporations, and the motor vehicle industry, shall evaluate and implement policies to promote the development of equipment and infrastructure needed to facilitate the use of\nelectric power\nelectricity\nand natural gas to fuel low-emission vehicles. Policies to be considered shall include both of the following:\n(1) The sale-for-resale and the rate-basing of low-emission vehicles and supporting equipment such as batteries for electric vehicles and compressor stations for natural gas fueled vehicles.\n(2) The development of statewide standards for electric vehicle charger connections and compressed natural gas vehicle fueling connections, including installation procedures and technical assistance to installers.\n(b) The commission shall hold public hearings as part of its effort to evaluate and implement the new policies considered in subdivision (a), and shall provide a progress report to the Legislature by January 30, 1993, and every two years thereafter, concerning policies on rates, equipment, and infrastructure implemented by the commission and other state agencies, federal and local governmental agencies, and private industry to facilitate the use of\nelectric power\nelectricity\nand natural gas to fuel low-emission vehicles.\n(c) The commission\u2019s policies authorizing utilities to develop equipment or infrastructure needed for electric-powered and natural gas-fueled low-emission vehicles shall ensure that the costs and expenses of those programs are not passed through to electric or gas ratepayers unless the commission finds and determines that those programs are in the ratepayers\u2019 interest. The commission\u2019s policies shall also ensure that utilities do not unfairly compete with nonutility enterprises."
