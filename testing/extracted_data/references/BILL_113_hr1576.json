DIRECTIVES TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE \n              SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Before the end of the 30-day period beginning on \nthe date of the enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System shall designate a specific week (the ``Target \nWeek'') starting no earlier than 90 days from the date of the enactment \nof this Act and ending no later than 120 days from the enactment of \nthis Act. After designating the Target Week, the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System shall then employ a random process to select \na specific day, hour, minute, and second during the Target Week (the \n``Target Moment''), which shall not be publicly disclosed. At the \nTarget Moment, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \nshall make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on \nthe exchange operated by the Commodities Exchange, Inc. (COMEX) of the \nNew York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., as of the Target Moment and \nmaintain the value of the United States dollar within plus or minus 2 \npercent of such price (the ``Target Range'') thereafter.\n    (b) Target.--The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \nshall maintain the value of the United States dollar within the Target \nRange directly, via open market operations, and not indirectly, as in \nthe current practice of targeting the Federal Funds rate.\n    (c) Promotion of Stable and Effective Financial Markets.--The Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall use the banking and \nbank regulatory powers of the Board to maintain and promote stable and \neffective financial markets during and after the transition to a \ndefined value for the United States dollar.\n\nSEC. 4. TAX DEPRECIATION.\n\n    Effective January 1, 2013, all entities that depreciate capital \nassets for tax purposes shall be entitled to 100 percent expensing of \nall capital investment for tax purposes in the year that the investment \nis made.\n\nSEC. 5. DIRECTIVE TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.\n\n    In addition to the scoring that the Congressional Budget Office \nwill do of the tax changes provided in this Act in the normal course of \nevents, the Congressional Budget Office shall also calculate the impact \non Federal revenues on a present value basis. This calculation shall be \ndone in the manner that such calculations are done by the Social \nSecurity Trustees, and shall take into account the following:\n            (1) That first year expensing of capital investment \n        accelerates, but does not change the total amount of the \n        depreciation that taxpayers take based upon their investments.\n            (2) Capital investments by businesses have historically \n        earned much higher returns than the interest rate on government \n        bonds.\n\nSEC. 6. CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISION.\n\n    In the event that any provisions of this Act are found to be in \nconflict with those of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of \n1978, the provisions of this Act shall supersede the provisions of such \nAct to the extent of the conflict.\n\nSEC. 7.
