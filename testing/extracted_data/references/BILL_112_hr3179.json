AUTHORIZATION FOR STATES TO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF SALES AND USE \n              TAXES.\n\n    (a) Grant of Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw, a State electing, individually or through an agreement with one or \nmore of the several States, to satisfy the requirements of subsection \n(b) is authorized to require all sellers not qualifying for the small \nseller exception to collect and remit sales and use taxes with respect \nto remote sales into the State without regard to the location of the \nseller.\n    (b) Requirements for Authority.--The authorization provided under \nparagraph (1) shall be granted once the State implements a simplified \nsystem for administration of sales and use tax collection with respect \nto remote sellers, which includes the following minimum requirements:\n            (1) Small seller exception.--An exception for remote \n        sellers with gross annual receipts in the preceding calendar \n        year from remote sales of items, services, and other products \n        in the United States not exceeding $1,000,000 (or such greater \n        amount as determined by the State involved) or in the State not \n        exceeding $100,000 (or such greater amount as determined by the \n        State).\n            (2) Form and filing.--A sales and use tax return for use by \n        remote sellers and a single revenue authority within the State \n        with which remote sellers are required to file the return. A \n        State may not require that remote sellers submit any other \n        sales and use tax return other than the sales and use tax \n        return applicable to remote sellers. A remote seller may not be \n        required to file sales and use tax returns any more frequently \n        than returns are required for other sellers. No local \n        jurisdiction may require a remote seller to submit a sales and \n        use tax return or to collect sales and use tax other than as \n        provided by this paragraph.\n            (3) Definition of tax base.--With respect to remote \n        sellers--\n                    (A) products and services subject to tax must be \n                identical throughout the State, and\n                    (B) any exemptions must be identical throughout the \n                State and may not include exemptions for products and \n                services that are not exempt when sold by other than \n                remote sellers.\n            (4) Sales and use tax rate structure.--\n                    (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this \n                paragraph, remote sellers must collect sales and use \n                tax under one of three rate structures--\n                            (i) a single State-wide blended rate that \n                        includes both the State rate and applicable \n                        rates of local jurisdictions, as determined by \n                        the State;\n                            (ii) the maximum State rate, which is the \n                        highest rate at which sellers are required by \n                        the State to collect tax, exclusive of tax \n                        imposed by or for the specific benefit of local \n                        jurisdictions; or\n                            (iii) the applicable destination rate, \n                        which is the sum of the State rate and any \n                        applicable rate for the local jurisdiction into \n                        which the sale was made. If a State requires \n                        that remote sellers collect at the applicable \n                        destination rate, the State must make available \n                        adequate software to remote sellers that \n                        substantially eases the burden of collecting at \n                        multiple rates within the State, and any State \n                        providing such software must relieve remote \n                        sellers from liability to that State for \n                        collection of the incorrect amount of sales or \n                        use tax, including any penalties or interest, \n                        provided that collection of the improper amount \n                        is the result of relying on information \n                        provided by that State.\n                    (B) A State that generally imposes a lower sales \n                and use tax rate for sales of food or drugs and \n                medicine, or both, may require remote sellers to \n                collect sales and use tax at such rates.\n                    (C) The rates described in clause (i) and (ii) must \n                not exceed the respective average State and locality \n                rates applicable to sellers other than remote sellers.\n    (c) Commencement of Authority.--\n            (1) In general.--A State satisfying the requirements of \n        subsection (b) may exercise the authority granted in subsection \n        (a) beginning on the first day of the calendar quarter at least \n        six months after the date that the State publishes the public \n        notice described in paragraph (2).\n            (2) Notice requirements.--The public notice required in \n        paragraph (1) must include the following information for remote \n        sellers:\n                    (A) The title and reference to the legislation that \n                the State has enacted requiring remote sellers to \n                collect sales and use tax.\n                    (B) The criteria under which remote sellers are \n                required to collect sales and use tax under the State \n                legislation.\n                    (C) The rate or rates at which affected remote \n                sellers will be required to collect sales and use tax.\n                    (D) The date upon which affected remote sellers \n                will be required to begin collecting sales and use tax.\n                    (E) References to compliance information and the \n                form to be filed by remote sellers.\n    (d) Termination of Authority.--The authorization provided under \nsubsection (a) shall terminate for a State that no longer satisfies the \nrequirements of subsection (b) on the date that--\n            (1) a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the \n        State's simplified system of administration no longer meets the \n        minimum requirements set forth in subsection (b); and\n            (2) the determination of such court is no longer subject to \n        appeal.\n\nSEC. 3. PREEMPTION.\n\n    Except as otherwise provided in this Act, this Act shall not be \nconstrued to preempt or limit any power exercised or to be exercised by \na State or local jurisdiction under the law of such State or local \njurisdiction or under any other Federal law.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as--\n            (1) subjecting a seller to franchise taxes, income taxes, \n        or licensing requirements of a State or political subdivision \n        thereof;\n            (2) affecting the application of such taxes or requirements \n        or enlarging or reducing the authority of any State to impose \n        such taxes or requirements;\n            (3) requiring any State or any local taxing jurisdiction to \n        exempt, or to impose a tax on any product, or to adopt any \n        particular type of tax, or to impose the same rate of tax as \n        any other taxing jurisdiction; or\n            (4) permitting or prohibiting a State from--\n                    (A) licensing or regulating any person;\n                    (B) requiring any person to qualify to transact \n                intrastate business;\n                    (C) subjecting any person to State taxes not \n                related to the sale of goods or services; or\n                    (D) exercising authority over matters of interstate \n                commerce.\n    (b) No Effect on Nexus.--No obligation imposed by virtue of the \nauthority granted by section 2 shall be considered in determining \nwhether a seller has a nexus with any State for any other tax purpose.\n\nSEC. 5.
