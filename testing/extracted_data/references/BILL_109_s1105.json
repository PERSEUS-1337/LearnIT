FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In recent years, foreign language needs have \n        significantly increased throughout the Federal Government due \n        to the presence of a wider range of security threats, the \n        emergence of new nation states, and the globalization of the \n        United States economy.\n            (2) Likewise, American businesses increasingly need \n        internationally and multiculturally experienced employees to \n        compete in the global economy and to manage a culturally \n        diverse workforce.\n            (3) In 2005, the Federal Government requires 34,000 \n        employees with foreign language skills across more than 70 \n        Federal agencies.\n            (4) Federal agency officials have stated that, over the \n        years, translator and interpreter shortfalls have adversely \n        affected agency operations and hindered United States military, \n        law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic \n        efforts.\n            (5) In a 2002 General Accounting Office report, the United \n        States Army reported that it was experiencing serious \n        shortfalls of translators and interpreters in 5 of its 6 \n        critical languages: Arabic, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Persian-\n        Farsi, and Russian.\n            (6) The number of Foreign Language and Area Studies \n        Fellowships awarded in 2003 was 30 percent less than the number \n        awarded at its high point in 1967.\n            (7) In the 2000-2001 school year, the number of foreign \n        language degrees conferred was 1 percent of the total number of \n        undergraduate degrees conferred, less than .05 percent of the \n        total number of masters degrees conferred, and 1 percent of the \n        total number of doctoral degrees conferred.\n            (8) In the 2004 National Survey of Student Engagement, \n        almost \\1/3\\ of undergraduates reported taking foreign language \n        coursework, while only 11 percent reported having studied \n        abroad.\n            (9) According to the American Council on Education, in \n        recent studies, \\1/2\\ of all students surveyed had taken not \n        less than 1 international course during the 2000-2001 school \n        year, but foreign language enrollment remained static.\n            (10) In 2002, 79 percent of Americans agreed that students \n        should have a study-abroad experience sometime during college.\n            (11) More than 40 percent of Americans said they were more \n        likely to favor an increase in State-level funding for foreign \n        language education at their local college or university after \n        September 11, 2001.\n\nSEC. 3.
