FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Developing medical products targeted for important \n        public health needs, less common diseases, prevalent third \n        world diseases, prevention indications, or individualized \n        therapy is increasingly challenging.\n            (2) A typical compound that is discovered today may not be \n        approved by the Food and Drug Administration for 12 to 15 \n        years.\n            (3) Current costs of bringing new medicines to market are \n        estimated to be as high as $800,000,000 to $1,700,000,000 and \n        are a major barrier to innovation and investment in higher-risk \n        areas such as rare diseases and genetic conditions.\n            (4) Product development in areas crucial to public health, \n        such as antibiotics, has slowed significantly in the past \n        decade.\n            (5) Approximately 50 percent of new drug candidates fail to \n        produce adequate evidence of safety or effectiveness in the \n        late stages of clinical studies and cannot be approved. The \n        resulting overall investments are raising the cost of \n        developing an approved therapy to approximately $1,700,000,000.\n            (6) Problems in physical design, characterization, \n        manufacturing scale-up, and quality control routinely derail or \n        delay development programs and delay patient access to new \n        treatments.\n            (7) Many product failures during development are ultimately \n        attributable to problems relating to the transition from \n        laboratory prototype to industrial product.\n            (8) Recent data suggests that the investment required to \n        launch a new therapy has risen 55 percent during the last 5 \n        years. Pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device \n        productivity appears to be declining at the same time that the \n        costs to develop treatments are rising.\n            (9) During the last several years, the number of new drug \n        and biologic applications submitted to the Food and Drug \n        Administration has declined significantly. The number of \n        innovative medical device applications to the Food and Drug \n        Administration also has decreased.\n            (10) Industry has been hesitant to introduce state-of-the-\n        art science and technology into its manufacturing processes due \n        to concern about potential regulatory impact. This led to high \n        in-process inventories, low factory utilization rates, \n        significant product waste, and compliance problems, driving up \n        the costs and decreasing productivity.\n            (11) It is crucial that improved methods for design, \n        characterization, and production manufacture are available to \n        improve predictability.\n            (12) United States academic institutions have the capacity \n        to assist in discovering and introducing science-based \n        standards for product characterization and manufacturing to \n        help reduce the cost of new therapies.\n            (13) Federal investments in a major pharmaceutical \n        technology and education initiative led by the Food and Drug \n        Administration in collaboration with university research \n        partners will produce multiple benefits in health care quality \n        and access.\n\nSEC. 3.
