FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress of the United States finds the following:\n            (1) To provide for the national security of the United \n        States in the 21st century, the U.S. military must be able to \n        dominate the full range of military operations, from \n        humanitarian assistance to full-scale conflict. The keys to \n        achieving this ``Full Spectrum Dominance,'' as described in the \n        Department of Defense's ``Joint Vision 2010,'' are \n        technological innovation and information superiority.\n            (2) The global spread of advanced technology is \n        transforming the military threats faced by the United States \n        and will challenge our ability to achieve Full Spectrum \n        Dominance. Some of the major technological challenges our \n        military face include information warfare; proliferating \n        weapons of mass destruction; inexpensive, precise, cruise \n        missiles; and increasingly difficult operations in urban \n        environments.\n            (3) The United States is now in a relatively secure \n        interlude in its international relations, but the future \n        security environment is very uncertain. Thus, now is the time \n        to focus our Defense investments on the research and \n        experimentation needed to meet new and undefined threats and \n        achieve Full Spectrum Dominance.\n            (4) The Department of Defense has been the preeminent \n        Federal agency supporting research in engineering, mathematics, \n        and computer science, and a key supporter of research in the \n        physical and environmental sciences. These disciplines remain \n        critical to achieving information superiority and maintaining \n        technological innovation in our military. The Department of \n        Energy has played a critical role in supporting the research \n        needed to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction. No \n        other organizations, public or private, can be expected to \n        substitute for the role of the Department of Defense and \n        Department of Energy in these research areas.\n            (5) However, the current budget plan for the Defense \n        Science and Technology Program is essentially flat in real \n        terms through fiscal year 2003. The planned budget for \n        nonproliferation science and technology activities at the \n        Department of Energy will decline.\n            (6) These budget plans are not consistent with the vision \n        of Full Spectrum Dominance, the threats or uncertainties on the \n        horizon, or the opportunity presented by the current state of \n        international relations. The planned level of investment could \n        pose a serious threat to our national security in the next 15 \n        years, given the usual time it takes from the start of Defense \n        research to achieving new military capabilities.\n            (7) Consequently, the Congress must act to establish a \n        long-term vision for the Defense Science and Technology \n        Program's funding if the United States is to encourage the \n        research and experimentation needed to seize the current \n        opportunity and begin transforming our military to meet the new \n        threats and achieve Full Spectrum Dominance early in the next \n        century.\n            (8) The Congress must also act to establish a robust long-\n        term vision and funding plan in support of nonproliferation \n        science and technology activities at the Department of Energy.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a ten-year \nbudget plan to support the disciplines, research, and concept of \noperations experimentation that will transform our military and reduce \nthe threat from weapons of mass destruction early in the next century.\n    (b) Funding Requirements.--\n            (1) Defense science and technology program budget.--For \n        each year from fiscal year 2000 until fiscal year 2008, it \n        shall be an objective of the Secretary of Defense to increase \n        the Defense Science and Technology Program budget by no less \n        than 2.0 percent over inflation greater than the previous \n        fiscal year's budget request.\n            (2) Nonproliferation science and technology activities \n        budget.--For each year from fiscal year 2000 until fiscal year \n        2008, it shall be an objective of the Secretary of Energy to \n        increase the budget for nonproliferation science and technology \n        activities by no less than 2.0 percent a year over inflation \n        greater than the previous fiscal year's budget request.\n\nSEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR THE DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Synergistic Management of Research and Development.--The \nSecretary of Defense may allocate a combination of funds from \nDepartment of Defense 6.1, 6.2, or 6.3 accounts in supporting any \nindividual project or program of the Defense Science and Technology \nProgram.\n    (b) Relationship of the Defense Science and Technology Program to \nCommercial Research and Technology.--\n            (1) In supporting projects within the Defense Science and \n        Technology Program, the Secretary of Defense shall attempt to \n        leverage commercial research, technology, products, and \n        processes for the benefit of the Department of Defense to the \n        maximum extent practicable.\n            (2) Funds made available to the Defense Science and \n        Technology Program must only be used to benefit the Department \n        of Defense, which includes--\n                    (A) the development of defense unique technology;\n                    (B) the development of military useful, commercial \n                viable technology; or\n                    (C) the adaption of commercial technology, \n                products, or processes for military purposes.\n    (c) Relationship of Defense Science and Technology Program to \nUniversity Research.--The following shall be key objectives of the \nDefense Science and Technology Program--\n            (1) the sustainment of research capabilities in scientific \n        and engineering disciplines critical to the Department of \n        Defense;\n            (2) the education and training of the next generation of \n        scientists and engineers in disciplines relevant to future \n        Defense systems, particularly through the conduct of basic \n        research; and\n            (3) the continued support of the Defense Experimental \n        Program to Stimulate Competitive Research and research programs \n        at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority \n        Institutions.\n\nSEC. 5.
