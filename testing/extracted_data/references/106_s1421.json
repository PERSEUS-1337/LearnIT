FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Available scientific evidence demonstrates that regular \n        cigar smoking causes cancer, including cancers of the lip, \n        tongue, mouth, throat, esophagus, larynx, and lung.\n            (2) That same evidence demonstrates that cigar smokers \n        increase their risk of pulmonary heart disease by 27 percent \n        and coronary heart disease by 45 percent.\n            (3) Cigar use in the United States has risen dramatically \n        by nearly 50 percent over the last 5 years. Premium cigar sales \n        have tripled in the same time period.\n            (4) Data from the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention 1997 Youth Risk Behavior Survey indicates that among \n        high school students over 30 percent of the males and 10 \n        percent of the females are current cigar smokers.\n            (5) Smoking cigars is not a safe alternative to smoking \n        cigarettes. Compared to a cigarette, a large cigar emits up to \n        20 times more ammonia, 5 to 10 times more cadmium (cancer \n        causing metal) and methylethylnitrosamine (cancer causing \n        agent), 80 to 90 times more nitrosamines (a highly carcinogenic \n        tobacco-specific agent), 2 to 3 times more tar, and 9 to 12 \n        times more nicotine.\n\nSEC. 3.
