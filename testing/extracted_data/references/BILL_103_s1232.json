FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many States do not have specific requirements regarding \n        the disclosure of a motor vehicle's history and even fewer \n        States require that the motor vehicle's title be stamped or \n        branded to indicate that it is a salvage vehicle or a \n        manufacturer buyback vehicle.\n            (2) The State disclosure requirements that do exist \n        regarding a motor vehicle's history are inconsistent with one \n        another in scope and language, require the use of various and \n        different forms and administrative procedures, and are \n        duplicative, burdensome on interstate commerce, and confusing \n        to consumers.\n            (3) The fact that a motor vehicle is a salvage vehicle or a \n        manufacturer buyback vehicle is material to any subsequent sale \n        of the vehicle.\n            (4) Many salvage vehicles and manufacturer buyback vehicles \n        are subsequently resold at auction or by used motor vehicle \n        dealers and thus recycled back into the marketplace, back onto \n        the streets, and back into repair shops.\n            (5) Rebuilt motor vehicles may not have passed a rigorous \n        safety inspection and may pose a safety risk, according to the \n        National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and consumers \n        who unknowingly buy these motor vehicles face an increased risk \n        of death or serious injury in motor vehicle accidents.\n\nSEC. 3. MOTOR VEHICLE DAMAGE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    The Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 1901 \net seq.) is amended by inserting at the end the following new title:\n\n       ``TITLE VII--MOTOR VEHICLE DAMAGE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\n\n``SEC. 701.
