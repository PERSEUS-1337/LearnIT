    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Online Market Protection Act of \n2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. MORATORIUM.\n\n    (a) Neither the Federal Government nor any State or political \nsubdivision thereof shall impose any statutory restrictions or \nregulations specifically identifying and governing the creation, use, \nexploitation, possession or transfer of any algorithmic protocols \ngoverning the operation of any virtual, non-physical, algorithm or \ncomputer source code-based medium for exchange (collectively, \n``cryptocurrency'' as defined herein) for a period beginning June 1, \n2015, and extending five years after the enactment of this Act (such \nperiod, the ``moratorium period''), except for statutes already enacted \nand effective prior to the date of enactment of this Act, and further \nsuspending the enactment and effectiveness of any and all pending \nstatutes and regulations until the end of the aforementioned moratorium \nperiod, except as otherwise provided in this section.\n    (b) During the moratorium period, the Federal Government and all \nState governments and political subdivisions thereof shall not impose \nany further statutory restrictions or regulations affecting Smart \nContract platforms such as cryptographic escrow services, multi-\nsignature transactions, and oracles, so as to allow for the growth and \nfacilitation of these important facets of cryptological technology.\n    (c) Federal and State Agencies shall consider cryptocurrencies \n``exempt commodities'' akin to gold and silver, rather than ``excluded \ncommodities'' such as national fiat currencies. The Bitcoin \ncryptological protocol is not strictly a currency, but is a broad \nmultifaceted protocol which allows for myriad novel applications.\n    (d) Federal and State Agencies shall have no jurisdiction over \nCryptocurrency Economy Transactions or Bitcoin Economy Transactions. \nThe financial regulations authorizing these agencies are designed to \nprotect users of financial instruments from fraud, manipulation, and \nother types of misconduct that result in real economic losses; not \nvirtual losses solely within a cryptographic network.\n    (e) Nothing in this Act shall prevent, impair or impede the \noperation of any government agency, authority or instrumentality, \nwhether of the Federal Government or of any State or political \nsubdivision thereof, to enforce currently existing criminal, civil or \ntaxation statutes and regulations.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) ``Algorithm'' is defined as a procedure for solving a \nmathematical problem in a finite number of steps performed by a \ncomputer.\n    (b) ``Algorithmic chain'' is a series or chain of bits of data \ncomprising a unique string of data which is the basis for the \ncryptographic proof of a valid transfer or transaction of \ncryptocurrencies. The algorithmic chain for a cryptocurrency is \ncommonly referred to as a ``blockchain''.\n    (c) The ``cryptographic proof'' for each transaction or transfer is \nbased on one unique algorithmic chain, distinct from all previously \nexisting algorithms and neither replicable nor reusable yet sharing \nwith all other units at least one common source code element in the \nalgorithmic chain (or ``blockchain'') in the transferor's existing \nBitcoin or bitcoins.\n    (d) ``Protocol'' refers to procedures or guidelines governing the \ncreation, development and operation of a cryptocurrency.\n    (e) ``Service'' is defined as the Internal Revenue Service.\n    (f) The phrase ``using the Internet or other electronic, non-\nphysical medium'' means by placement of material in a computer server-\nbased file archive so that it is publicly accessible on, through, or \nover the Internet, using hypertext transfer protocol, file transfer \nprotocol, or other similar protocols.\n    (g) ``Cryptocurrency'' is a popular term encompassing code-based \nprotocols supporting an electronic, non-physical media for the exchange \nof value, and for the sake of both clarity and the avoidance of \nconfusion in the mind of the public, based on the prior use of this \nterm by the Internal Revenue Service in its initial guidance (see \nNotice 2014-21, released March 26, 2014) this term is used herein. \nHowever, it is believed ``cryptocurrency'' encompasses the same \nprotocols as those covered by terms such as ``digital currency'', \n``virtual currency'' or ``electronic currency''.\n    (h) ``Agencies'' is defined as the regulatory bodies of the Federal \nGovernment and the State governments or political subdivision thereof, \nincluding but not limited to the Commodity and Futures Trading \nCommittee (``CFTC''), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''), \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Financial Crimes \nEnforcement Network (``FinCEN''), and the New York State Department of \nFinancial Services (``NYSDFS'').\n    (i) ``Smart Contracts'' are cryptographically encoded agreements, \noften utilizing multi-signature technology, which allow for automatic \nor multi-party execution and public recording of transactions or \nproperty transfers when certain predetermined parameters are met.\n    (j) ``Multi-Signature Transactions'' are cryptographic contracts \nencoded in the blockchain, often involving third-party arbitrators or \noracles, which are finalized when a pre-set number of involved parties \nsign off. In a three-party multi-signature transaction involving an \narbitrator, the transaction may be finalized only when two (2) out of \nthe three (3) parties--a buyer, a seller, and/or the arbitrator--sign \noff on the transaction.\n    (k) ``Cryptographic Escrow Services'' are services that allow for \nfund transfers subject to the authorization of an arbitrator or other \nintermediary. These transactions can utilize multi-signature \ntechnology, allowing for the possibility of arbitration without \nrequiring any actual transfer of funds through the intermediary.\n    (l) ``Oracles'' are automated programs or algorithms acting as \nsignatories to multi-signature transactions. Utilizing databases and \ninformation amalgamators, an oracle automatically executes its \nsignature when predetermined threshold is met.\n    (m) ``Cryptocurrency Economy Transactions'' or ``Bitcoin Economy \nTransactions'' are transactions involving financial instruments \ndenominated in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency underlying a \ntransaction which is also denominated in Bitcoin or another \ncryptocurrency. A Bitcoin-denominated credit default swap that \nreferences a Bitcoin-denominated loan would be a Bitcoin Economy \nTransaction.\n\nSEC. 4. DECLARATION OF MORATORIUM.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is the public policy of the United States that \nno new statutes, regulations or advisory opinions be passed, \nimplemented, enforced or issued governing the creation, use, possession \nor taxation of cryptocurrencies, the protocols governing each and the \ndata, codes, algorithms or other calculations comprising each, until \nthe expiration of the moratorium as provided in this Act.\n    (b) Public Interest.--It is further the public policy of the United \nStates that the development and use of any medium of exchange which \nutilizes cryptographic proof of and for a transaction of cryptocurrency \nwithout the need for or reliance upon third-party intermediaries or \nverification will enhance the economic well-being of the American \npeople and result in significant economic growth. Given the \nblockchain's capacity to serve as a public ledger, software developers \nare creating mechanisms for ``smart'' technologies that will eliminate \nthe need for many forms of costly intermediation ranging from third-\nparty arbitration in legal disputes to key-exchanges in car and hotel \nrentals. The capacity for publicly recorded multi-signature \ntransactions will allow for the seamless property transfers that are \ncertifiable, public and secure without the use of an intermediary. \nThese and other uses increase market efficiency and facilitate economic \nactivity and growth. Moreover, these advances promote the autonomy and \nliberty of individuals and small businesses at the expense of needless \nbureaucracy.\n\nSEC. 5. DECLARATION OF NEUTRAL TAX TREATMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is the public policy of the United States that \nthe production, possession or use of cryptocurrency, whether in trade, \ncommerce or personal non-commercial transfers, should not be disfavored \nor discouraged by the Federal tax code or other Federal or State \nstatute or regulation.\n    (b) Tax Treatment.--It is the public policy of the United States \nthat the current guidance just promulgated and released by the Service \nin its Notice 2014-21 is advisory, subject to public comment and not in \nfinal form pending the expiration of the comment period. As such, \nCongress believes that the current guidance is less than optimal for \nthe American people and economy, and directs the Service to issue or \nrevise interim regulations consistent with the following.\n    (c) Treatment as Currency.--It is the public policy of the United \nStates that virtual currencies should be treated as currency instead of \nproperty in order to foster an equitable tax treatment and prevent a \ntax treatment that would discourage the use of any cryptocurrency. Tax \ntreatment of cryptocurrency as property does not account for the \nsubstantial illiquidity and highly limited acceptance and use of \ncryptocurrency, and substantially and unfairly discourages taxpayers \nengaging in a trade or business from using cryptocurrency in commerce. \nThis circumstance is likely to discourage economic activity and stifle \ninnovation and growth. At present, a taxpayer accepting cryptocurrency \nfor goods or services will be taxed on the fair market value of the \ncryptocurrency despite the fact that exchange rates (from \ncryptocurrency to conventional currency) are both highly volatile and \npublished or available only on a small number of proto-exchanges in the \nearly stages of development, acceptance and awareness by cryptocurrency \nusers. As a result, current tax treatment will measure income on the \nbasis of an illiquid and likely inaccurate fair market value that \nexceeds the taxpayer's true fair market value and hence income, \nresulting in the risk of a consistent overtaxation or overpayment that \nwill act as a strong deterrent to or penalty for accepting \ncryptocurrency in payment. Such tax treatment is inconsistent with the \ntax treatment of secured notes for payment in trade or commerce, which \nrecognizes a discount from the face value of the note due to the \nilliquid nature of the payment. (Note: See IRS Pub. 525 at 4.)\n    (d) Revenue in Trade or Business; Taxation Upon Monetizing Event.--\nIt is the public policy of the United States that taxpayers accepting \ncryptocurrency in trade or commerce should be deemed to realize actual \nincome only when cryptocurrency is monetized through conversion or \nexchange into dollars or any official government currency, and that \nfair market value should be calculated as net proceeds from the \nconversion. (Note: This treatment seeks to achieve the most accurate \nand fair measure of actual income received, as distinguished from \ntheoretical income in the form of cryptocurrency which, until its \nconversion to dollars, remains under substantial risk of diminution \nfrom illiquidity or other conversion risks or inefficiencies. This \ntreatment is consistent with tax treatment of statutory stock options \nwhere the taxable event is not the receipt or exercise of the option, \nbut the sale of the underlying stock for proceeds in cash. The goal \nhere is to have income taxed when the income is actual instead of \ntheoretical and subject to substantial if not total risk of loss \nthrough liquidity problems, exchange problems or other barriers to \nmonetization.) Accordingly, as it is the further public policy of the \nUnited States that income on cryptocurrency received in trade or \nbusiness should be defined as the net proceeds from conversion of the \nreceived cryptocurrency into dollars, the Service is hereby directed to \nrevise or issue interim regulations consistent herewith.\n    (e) Revenue From Mining or Creation of Cryptocurrency.--It is the \npublic policy of the United States that the Service's guidance that \ntaxpayers should have the fair market value of the cryptocurrency they \nsuccessfully ``mine'' or produce included in gross income is \ninequitable, overstates actual income by overstating fair market value \nby not accounting for the liquidity risk or the risk that substantial \neffort may yield no production, and strongly and unfairly penalizes or \ndiscourages such income producing efforts and deters economic growth, \nactivity and innovation. Accordingly, as it is the further public \npolicy of the United States that mined produced cryptocurrency should \nbe taxed as income only when actual a transfer and conversion of \nproceeds into dollars realize income, the Service is hereby directed to \nrevise or issue interim regulations consistent herewith.\n\nSEC. 6. SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this title, or any amendment made by this \ntitle, or the application of that provision to any person or \ncircumstance, is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to violate \nany provision of the Constitution of the United States, then the other \nprovisions of that title, and the application of that provision to \nother persons and circumstances, shall not be affected."
