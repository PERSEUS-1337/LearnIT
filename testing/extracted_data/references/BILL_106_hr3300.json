FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress should focus more resources on and work with \n        physicians and providers to combat fraud in the medicare \n        program. Although the Federal government has reduced improper \n        fee-for-service payments from 14 percent (or $23 billion) from \n        fiscal year 1996 to 7.1 percent (or $12.6 billion) in fiscal \n        year 1998, Congress must work hard to continue this trend.\n            (2) The overwhelming majority of physicians in the United \n        States are law-abiding citizens who provide important services \n        and care to patients each day.\n            (3) Congress greatly appreciates the important role \n        physicians play in providing high-quality health care to our \n        nation's senior citizens under the medicare program.\n            (4) Due to the overly complex nature of medicare \n        regulations and the risk of being the subject of an aggressive \n        government investigation, many physicians are leaving the \n        medicare program.\n            (5) The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), and \n        especially carriers administering the medicare program, should \n        focus more attention on educational approaches to reducing \n        billing error rates.\n            (6) Keeping track of the morass of medicare regulations \n        detracts from the time that physicians have to treat patients.\n\nSEC. 3.
