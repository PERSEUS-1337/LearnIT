FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians are \n        descendants and political successors to the signatories of the \n        1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty of Detroit.\n            (2) The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, \n        the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, and the Bay \n        Mills Band of Chippewa Indians, whose members are also \n        descendants of the signatories to the 1836 Treaty of Washington \n        and the 1855 Treaty of Detroit, have been recognized by the \n        Federal Government as distinct Indian tribes.\n            (3) The Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians \n        consists of over 600 eligible members who continue to reside \n        close to their ancestral homeland as recognized in the \n        Cheboygan Reservation in the 1836 Treaty of Washington and 1855 \n        Treaty of Detroit, which area is now known as Cheboygan County, \n        Michigan.\n            (4) The Band continues its political and social existence \n        with a viable tribal government. The Band, along with other \n        Michigan Odawa/Ottawa groups, including the tribes described in \n        paragraph (2), formed the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association \n        in 1948. The Association subsequently pursued a successful land \n        claim with the Indian Claims Commission.\n            (5) Between 1948 and 1975, the Band carried out many of \n        their governmental functions through the Northern Michigan \n        Ottawa Association, while retaining individual Band control \n        over local decisions.\n            (6) In 1975, the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association \n        petitioned under the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et \n        seq.; commonly referred to as the ``Indian Reorganization \n        Act''), to form a government on behalf of the Band. Again, in \n        spite of the Band's eligibility, the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n        failed to act.\n            (7) The United States Government, the government of the \n        State of Michigan, and local governments have had continuous \n        dealings with the recognized political leaders of the Band from \n        1836 to the present.\n\nSEC. 3.
