    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 2356.5 of the Probate Code is amended to read:\n2356.5.\n(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares:\n(1) That people with dementia, as defined in the last published edition of the \u201cDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\u201d should have a conservatorship to serve their unique and special needs.\n(2) That, by adding powers to the probate conservatorship for people with dementia, their unique and special needs can be met. This will reduce costs to the conservatee and the family of the conservatee, reduce costly administration by state and county government, and safeguard the basic dignity and rights of the conservatee.\n(3) That it is the intent of the Legislature to recognize that the administration of psychotropic medications has been, and can be, abused by caregivers and, therefore, granting powers to a conservator to authorize these medications for the treatment of dementia requires the protections specified in this section.\n(b) Notwithstanding any other law, a conservator may authorize the placement of a conservatee in a secured perimeter residential care facility for the elderly operated pursuant to Section 1569.698 of the Health and Safety Code, and which has a care plan that meets the requirements of Section 87705 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, upon a court\u2019s finding, by clear and convincing evidence, of all of the following:\n(1) The conservatee has dementia, as defined in the last published edition of the \u201cDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\u201d\n(2) The conservatee lacks the capacity to give informed consent to this placement and has at least one mental function deficit pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 811, and this deficit significantly impairs the person\u2019s ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 811.\n(3) The conservatee needs or would benefit from a restricted and secure environment, as demonstrated by evidence presented by the physician or psychologist referred to in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f).\n(4) The court finds that the proposed placement in a locked facility is the least restrictive placement appropriate to the needs of the conservatee.\n(c) Notwithstanding any other law, a conservator of a person may authorize the administration of medications appropriate for the care and treatment of dementia, upon a court\u2019s finding, by clear and convincing evidence, of all of the following:\n(1) The conservatee has dementia, as defined in the last published edition of the \u201cDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\u201d\n(2) The conservatee lacks the capacity to give informed consent to the administration of medications appropriate to the care of dementia, and has at least one mental function deficit pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 811, and this deficit or deficits significantly impairs the person\u2019s ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 811.\n(3) The conservatee needs or would benefit from appropriate medication as demonstrated by evidence presented by the physician or psychologist referred to in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f).\n(d) Pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 2355, in the case of a person who is an adherent of a religion whose tenets and practices call for a reliance on prayer alone for healing, the treatment required by the conservator under subdivision (c) shall be by an accredited practitioner of that religion in lieu of the administration of medications.\n(e) A conservatee who is to be placed in a facility pursuant to this section shall not be placed in a mental health rehabilitation center as described in Section 5675 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, or in an institution for mental disease as described in Section 5900 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n(f) A petition for authority to act under this section is governed by Section 2357, except:\n(1) The conservatee shall be represented by an attorney pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 1470) of Part 1. Upon granting or denying authority to a conservator under this section, the court shall discharge the attorney or order the continuation of the legal representation, consistent with the standard set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 1470.\n(2) The conservatee shall be produced at the hearing, unless excused pursuant to Section 1893.\n(3) The petition shall be supported by a declaration of a licensed physician, or a licensed psychologist within the scope of his or her licensure, regarding each of the findings required to be made under this section for any power requested, except that the psychologist has at least two years of experience in diagnosing dementia.\n(4) The petition may be filed by any of the persons designated in Section 1891.\n(g) The court investigator shall annually investigate and report to the court every two years pursuant to Sections 1850 and 1851 if the conservator is authorized to act under this section.
