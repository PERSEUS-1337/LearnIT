COMPREHENSIVE HIV/AIDS POLICY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Bureau of Prisons (hereinafter in this section \nreferred to as the ``Bureau'') shall develop a comprehensive policy to \ncoordinate HIV/AIDS testing, treatment, and prevention for inmates \nwithin the correctional setting and upon reentry.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this policy shall be as follows:\n            (1) To stop the spread of HIV/AIDS among inmates.\n            (2) To protect prison guards and other personnel from HIV/\n        AIDS infection.\n            (3) To provide comprehensive, timely, and compassionate \n        medical treatment to inmates who are living with HIV/AIDS.\n            (4) To promote HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention among \n        inmates.\n            (5) To encourage inmates to take personal responsibility \n        for their health, find out if they have been infected with HIV/\n        AIDS, and reward behavior that reduces the risks of HIV/AIDS \n        transmission.\n            (6) To reduce the risk that inmates will transmit HIV/AIDS \n        to their spouses or other persons in the community following \n        their release from prison.\n    (c) Consultation.--The Bureau shall consult with appropriate \nofficials of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, and the Centers for Disease Control \nregarding the development of this policy.\n    (d) Time Limit.--The Bureau shall draft appropriate regulations to \nimplement this policy within not more than 1 year from the enactment of \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR POLICY.\n\n    The policy created under section 2 shall do the following:\n            (1) Testing and counseling upon intake.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall provide routine HIV/\n                AIDS testing to all inmates as a part of a \n                comprehensive medical examination immediately following \n                admission to a facility.\n                    (B) Medical personnel shall provide immediate \n                confidential, post-test counseling to all inmates who \n                test positive for HIV/AIDS.\n            (2) HIV/AIDS prevention education.--Medical personnel shall \n        educate all inmates on the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission; \n        promote HIV/AIDS awareness; and encourage behavior that reduces \n        the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission through frequent and \n        appropriate educational programs. This education shall include \n        the risks of HIV/AIDS transmission through tattooing, sexual \n        contact, and intravenous drug use.\n            (3) Voluntary hiv/aids testing.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall allow inmates to obtain \n                HIV/AIDS tests upon request once per year or whenever \n                an inmate has a reason to believe the inmate may have \n                been exposed to HIV/AIDS. Inmates shall be informed of \n                their right to obtain these tests.\n                    (B) Medical personnel shall encourage inmates to \n                request HIV/AIDS tests if the inmate is sexually \n                active, uses intravenous drugs, or if the inmate is \n                concerned that the inmate may have been exposed to HIV/\n                AIDS.\n            (4) Protection of confidentiality.--In order to ensure \n        inmate confidentiality and encourage inmates to seek HIV/AIDS \n        tests without the knowledge or suspicion of other inmates, the \n        Bureau of Prisons shall develop procedures for inmates \n        confidentially to request HIV/AIDS counseling and tests. HIV/\n        AIDS counseling and tests shall be provided in a setting where \n        other routine health services are provided and in a manner that \n        allows the inmate to request and obtain these services as \n        routine medical services.\n            (5) Comprehensive treatment.--Medical personnel shall \n        provide all inmates who test positive for HIV/AIDS--\n                    (A) comprehensive medical treatment; and\n                    (B) confidential counseling on managing their \n                medical condition and preventing its transmission to \n                other persons.\n            (6) Testing, counseling, and referral prior to reentry.--\n                    (A) Medical personnel shall provide routine HIV/\n                AIDS testing to all inmates prior to their release and \n                reentry into the community. (Inmates who are already \n                known to be infected need not be tested again.)\n                    (B) To all inmates who test positive for HIV/AIDS \n                and all inmates who already are known to have HIV/AIDS, \n                BOP medical personnel shall provide--\n                            (i) confidential prerelease counseling on \n                        managing their medical condition in the \n                        community, accessing appropriate treatment and \n                        services in the community, and preventing the \n                        transmission of their condition to family \n                        members and other persons in the community; and\n                            (ii) referrals to appropriate health care \n                        providers and social service agencies in the \n                        community that meet the inmate's individual \n                        needs.\n            (7) Opt-out provision.--If an inmate refuses a routine test \n        for HIV/AIDS, medical personnel shall make a note of the \n        inmate's refusal in the inmate's confidential medical records. \n        However, the inmate's refusal shall not be considered a \n        violation of prison rules or result in disciplinary action.\n\nSEC. 4. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW.\n\n    (a) Screening in General.--Section 4014(a) of title 18, United \nStates Code, is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``for a period of 6 months or more'';\n            (2) by striking ``, as appropriate,''; and\n            (3) by striking ``if such individual is determined to be at \n        risk for infection with such virus in accordance with the \n        guidelines issued by the Bureau of Prisons relating to \n        infectious disease management'' and inserting ``unless the \n        individual declines. The Attorney General shall also cause such \n        individual to be so tested before release unless the individual \n        declines.''.\n    (b) Screening as Part of Routine Screening.--Section 4014(e) of \ntitle 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing: ``Such rules shall also provide that the initial test under \nthis section be performed as part of the routine health screening \nconducted at intake.''."
