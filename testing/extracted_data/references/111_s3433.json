    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Coasts and Efficient Cars Act \nof 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) according to the Energy Information Administration, \n        opening all areas in the Pacific, Atlantic, Eastern Gulf of \n        Mexico, and Central Gulf of Mexico Regions of the outer \n        Continental Shelf that were subject to a moratorium that \n        expired in 2008 to drilling would--\n                    (A) save consumers only 3 cents per gallon of gas \n                in 2030; and\n                    (B) produce an estimated 500,000 barrels of oil per \n                day by 2030;\n            (2) fuel economy standards that achieve 35.5 miles per \n        gallon by 2016, are projected to save--\n                    (A) consumers the equivalent of $1 per gallon of \n                gas by 2030; and\n                    (B) 2,000,000 barrels per day of oil by 2030;\n            (3) increasing fuel economy to 55 miles per gallon by 2030 \n        would--\n                    (A) save consumers the equivalent of $1.43 or more \n                per gallon of gas by 2030; and\n                    (B) save 3,900,000 barrels of oil per day by 2030, \n                and 1,423,500,000 barrels of oil annually in 2030;\n            (4) the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico stemming from \n        the incident at the Deepwater Horizon rig has led to--\n                    (A) the loss of life;\n                    (B) the release of an estimated hundreds of \n                thousands of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico \n                every day since the April 20, 2010, disaster; and\n                    (C) an environmental cleanup and economic damages \n                estimated to cost tens of billions of dollars;\n            (5) the limited benefits of continued offshore drilling are \n        outweighed by the substantial risks of offshore drilling;\n            (6) there are cleaner and safer ways to reduce the price of \n        gasoline than offshore drilling, such as strong fuel economy \n        standards;\n            (7) China--\n                    (A) already achieves a fuel economy standard of \n                36.8 miles per gallon for new passenger vehicles; and\n                    (B) is raising fuel economy to more than 42 miles \n                per gallon by 2015; and\n            (8) in Japan and in Europe current fuel economy standards \n        are higher than 42 miles per gallon.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF OIL AND GAS LEASING IN THE PACIFIC, ATLANTIC, \n              EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO, AND CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO \n              REGIONS.\n\n    Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(q) Prohibition of Oil and Gas Leasing in the Atlantic, Pacific, \nEastern Gulf of Mexico, and Central Gulf of Mexico Regions.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any other law, the \nSecretary shall not issue a lease or permit for the exploration, \ndevelopment, or production of oil or natural gas in--\n            ``(1) the Pacific Region of the outer Continental Shelf;\n            ``(2) the Atlantic Region of the outer Continental Shelf; \n        or\n            ``(3) the areas in the Gulf of Mexico described in section \n        104(a) of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (43 \n        U.S.C. 1331 note; Public Law 109-432).''.\n\nSEC. 4. FUEL ECONOMY AND MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) Fuel Economy Standards.--Section 32902(b)(2)(B) of title 49, \nUnited States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n                    ``(B) Automobile fuel economy average for model \n                years 2017 through 2030.--The Secretary shall prescribe \n                an average fuel economy standard for passenger and non-\n                passenger automobiles for each model year beginning \n                with model year 2017 to achieve a combined fuel economy \n                average for model year 2030 of at least 55 miles per \n                gallon for the total fleet of passenger and non-\n                passenger automobiles manufactured for sale in the \n                United States for that model year (excluding light-duty \n                vehicles that draw motive power from a battery with a \n                capacity larger than 4 kilowatt-hours).''.\n    (b) Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Economy Standards.--In \naccordance with section 202 of the National Emission Standards Act (42 \nU.S.C. 7521) and section 32902 of title 49, United States Code, the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in collaboration \nwith the Administrator of the National Highway Transportation Safety \nAdministration, and in consultation with the State of California and \nrepresentatives of the automotive industry and other relevant parties, \nshall ensure continued progress in significantly improving motor \nvehicle fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by \nsetting motor vehicle emission and fuel economy standards for model \nyear 2017 and subsequent model years that reflect the greatest emission \nreductions and fuel efficiency improvement achievable through the \napplication of technology that the Administrators determine will be \navailable for the model year to which the standards apply, considering \nthe costs associated with the application of the technology and other \nfactors, as appropriate."
