FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) Indian tribes face an unprecedented crisis due to the \n        lack of shelter for a growing number of individuals and \n        families, including elderly persons, persons with disabilities, \n        and families with children;\n            (2) the demand for Indian housing has become more severe \n        and, in the absence of more effective efforts and consistent \n        funding, is expected to become dramatically worse, endangering \n        the lives and safety of Indian and Alaska Native people;\n            (3) the Federal Government has a historical and special \n        legal relationship with, and resulting responsibility to, \n        Indian tribes;\n            (4) included within the relationship referred to in \n        paragraph (3) is a trust responsibility to provide decent, \n        safe, sanitary, and affordable housing to the members of Indian \n        tribes residing on reservations;\n            (5) the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior \n        has issued several audit reports on various area offices of the \n        Bureau of Indian Affairs and has concluded that the Housing \n        Improvement Program has been severely mismanaged and abused;\n            (6) as a result of the mismanagement and abuse of the \n        Housing Improvement Program, persons who are not eligible for \n        the Program are receiving assistance while persons who are \n        eligible for the Program are not receiving needed assistance;\n            (7) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has the \n        primary responsibility for the delivery of Indian housing \n        services; and\n            (8) the transfer of the Housing Improvement Program to the \n        Department of Housing and Urban Development will eliminate \n        useless bureaucracy and waste while allowing the Secretary of \n        Housing and Urban Development to administer the Housing \n        Improvement Program according to the Program's intended goals \n        and objectives.\n\nSEC. 3.
