UPDATING OF GUIDANCE.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Affordability.--The term ``affordability'' means, with \n        respect to payment of a utility bill, a measure of whether an \n        individual customer or household can pay the bill without undue \n        hardship or unreasonable sacrifice in the essential lifestyle \n        or spending patterns of the individual or household, as \n        determined by the Administrator.\n            (3) Financial capability.--The term ``financial \n        capability'' means the financial capability of a community to \n        make investments necessary to make water quality-related \n        improvements, taking into consideration the criteria described \n        in subsection (b)(2)(A).\n            (4) Guidance.--The term ``guidance'' means the guidance \n        published by the Administrator entitled ``Combined Sewer \n        Overflows--Guidance for Financial Capability Assessment and \n        Schedule Development'' and dated February 1997, as applicable \n        to combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows.\n    (b) Updating.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall update the \n        guidance to ensure that the evaluations by the Administrator of \n        financial capability assessment and schedule development meet \n        the criteria described in paragraph (2).\n            (2) Criteria.--The criteria described in this paragraph are \n        that, under the updated guidance--\n                    (A) in assessing the financial capability of a \n                community--\n                            (i) greater emphasis should be placed on \n                        local economic conditions;\n                            (ii) for regional systems, consideration \n                        should be given to the economic conditions of \n                        political jurisdictions and significant \n                        demographic groups within each region;\n                            (iii) prescriptive formulas for use in \n                        calculating financial capability and thresholds \n                        for expenditure should not be considered to be \n                        the only indicator of the financial capability \n                        of a community;\n                            (iv) site-specific local conditions should \n                        be taken into consideration in analyzing \n                        financial capability;\n                            (v) a single measure of financial \n                        capability or affordability (such as median \n                        household income) should be viewed in the \n                        context of other economic measures, rather than \n                        as a threshold to be achieved; and\n                            (vi)(I) consideration should be given to \n                        the economic outlook of a community, including \n                        the potential impact of program requirements \n                        over time, in the development of implementation \n                        schedules;

and\n                            (iv) existing implementation schedules \n                        should be modified in appropriate cases taking \n                        into consideration the criteria set forth in \n                        this subparagraph;\n                    (C) with respect to implementation--\n                            (i) a determination of local financial \n                        capability may be achieved through an \n                        evaluation of an array of factors the relative \n                        importance of which may vary across regions and \n                        localities; and\n                            (ii) an appropriate methodology should give \n                        consideration to such various factors as are \n                        appropriate to recognize the prevailing and \n                        projected economic concerns in a community; and\n                    (D) the residential indicator should be revised to \n                include--\n                            (i) a consideration of costs imposed upon \n                        ratepayers for essential utilities;\n                            (ii) increased consideration and \n                        quantification of local community-imposed costs \n                        in regional systems;\n                            (iii) a mechanism to assess impacts on \n                        communities with disparate economic conditions \n                        throughout the entire service area of a \n                        utility;\n                            (iv) a consideration of the industrial and \n                        population trends of a community;\n                            (v) recognition that--\n                                    (I) the median household income of \n                                a service area reflects a numerical \n                                median rather than the distribution of \n                                incomes within the service area;
