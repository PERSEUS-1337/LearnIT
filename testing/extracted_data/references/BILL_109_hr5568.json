DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE \n              PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The District of Columbia National Guard is under the \n        exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the United States as \n        Commander-in-Chief and, unlike other National Guards, is \n        permanently federalized.\n            (2) The District of Columbia National Guard is unique and \n        differs from the National Guards of the several States in that \n        the District of Columbia National Guard is responsible, not \n        only for residents of the District of Columbia, but also for a \n        special and unique mission and obligation as a result of the \n        extensive presence of the Federal Government in the District of \n        Columbia.\n            (3) Consequently, the President of the United States, \n        rather than the chief executive of the District of Columbia, is \n        in command of the District of Columbia National Guard, and only \n        the President can call up the District of Columbia National \n        Guard even for local emergencies.\n            (4) The District of Columbia National Guard has been \n        specifically trained to address the unique emergencies that may \n        occur regarding the presence of the Federal Government in the \n        District of Columbia.\n            (5) The great majority of the members of the District of \n        Columbia National Guard actually live in Maryland or Virginia, \n        rather than in the District of Columbia.\n            (6) The District of Columbia National Guard has been \n        experiencing a disproportionate decline in force in comparison \n        to the National Guards of Maryland and Virginia.\n            (7) The States of Maryland and Virginia provide additional \n        recruiting and retention incentives, such as educational \n        benefits, in order to maintain their force, and their National \n        Guards have drawn recruits from the District of Columbia at a \n        rate that puts at risk the maintenance of the necessary force \n        levels for the District of Columbia National Guard.\n            (8) Funds for an educational benefit for members of the \n        District of Columbia National Guard would provide an incentive \n        to help reverse the loss of members to nearby National Guards \n        and allow for maintenance and increase of necessary District of \n        Columbia National Guard personnel.\n            (9) The loss of members of the District of Columbia \n        National Guard could adversely affect the readiness of the \n        District of Columbia National Guard to respond in the event of \n        a terrorist attack on the capital of the United States.\n    (b) Educational Assistance Program Authorized.--The commanding \ngeneral of the District of Columbia National Guard (in this section \nreferred to as the ``commanding general'') may provide financial \nassistance under this section to a member of the District of Columbia \nNational Guard who has satisfactorily completed required initial active \nduty service and executes a written agreement to serve in the District \nof Columbia National Guard for a period of not less than six years, to \nassist the member in covering expenses incurred by the member while \nenrolled in an approved institution of higher education to pursue the \nmember's first undergraduate, masters, vocational, or technical degree \nor certification.\n    (c) Maintenance of Eligibility.--To continue to be eligible for \nfinancial assistance under this section, a member of the District of \nColumbia National Guard must--\n            (1) be satisfactorily performing duty in the District of \n        Columbia National Guard in accordance with regulations of the \n        National Guard;\n            (2) be enrolled on a full-time or part-time basis (at least \n        three, but less than twelve credit hours per semester) in an \n        approved institution of higher education; and\n            (3) maintain satisfactory progress in the course of study \n        the member is pursuing, determined in accordance with section \n        484(c) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1091(c)).\n    (d) Covered Expenses.--Financial assistance received by a member of \nthe District of Columbia National Guard under this section may be used \nto cover--\n            (1) tuition and fees charged by an approved institution of \n        higher education involved;\n            (2) the cost of books; and\n            (3) laboratory expenses.\n    (e) Amount of Assistance.--The amount of financial assistance \nprovided to a member of the District of Columbia National Guard under \nthis section may be up to $400 per credit hour, but not to exceed \n$5,500 per year.
