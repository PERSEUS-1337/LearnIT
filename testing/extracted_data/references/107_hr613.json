GRANT TO DEVELOP INITIATIVES AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ABOUT \n              CHARACTER EDUCATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The commitment of schools to the academic achievement \n        of students should be partnered with an effort to address and \n        improve the character of students.\n            (2) Improving the character of students includes ensuring \n        that students understand, care about, and act upon ethical \n        values and virtues.\n            (3) Improving the character of students promotes a more \n        compassionate and responsible society.\n            (4) Character education is an initiative in schools that \n        attends to the social, emotional, and ethical development of \n        students and is a means of teaching, modeling, and practicing \n        positive ethical character traits as part of the regular school \n        curriculum and culture.\n            (5) Effective character education increases the self-esteem \n        of students and decreases the risk that students will become \n        isolated or do harm to others.\n            (6) Schools that integrate character education into \n        existing curriculum and daily activities foster the development \n        of core ethical values and virtues in students, and provide for \n        students a model of a community that is comprised of mature and \n        responsible individuals.\n            (7) An increasing number of States and local educational \n        agencies are promoting the implementation of character \n        education initiatives.\n            (8) Successful character education requires that States, \n        local educational agencies, schools, and teachers have access \n        to effective methodologies, high-quality initiatives, \n        professional development opportunities, criteria for assessing \n        initiatives, and cost-effective opportunities to network \n        nationally with each other, especially through electronic \n        means.\n            (9) As States and local educational agencies continue to \n        coordinate the implementation of character education in \n        schools, a central and comprehensive source of information \n        regarding the activities of States and local educational \n        agencies becomes increasingly necessary.\n            (10) Information about the effectiveness of Federal, State, \n        and local educational agency initiatives, the impact of those \n        initiatives, and the advancement of character education in \n        schools is essential to successfully educating students about \n        character.\n    (b) Grant Authorization.--The Secretary is authorized to make a \nsingle 5-year grant to the eligible organization that, in the judgment \nof the Secretary, best demonstrates--\n            (1) an expertise on the national level in providing to \n        schools comprehensive and objective information regarding \n        character education policies, organizations, initiatives, \n        curricula, methods, research, and assessment;\n            (2) a membership that is representative of the various \n        individuals and groups who provide character education \n        initiatives, resources, and curricula to schools; and\n            (3) a history of, and commitment to, promoting and \n        advocating quality character education initiatives.\n    (c) Grant Requirements.--\n            (1) Initiative development.--The recipient of the grant \n        under subsection (b) (hereafter in this section referred to as \n        the ``grantee'') shall use the grant funds to develop \n        initiatives that--\n                    (A) present methods of addressing core ethical \n                values in a comprehensive manner in schools;\n                    (B) emphasize student motivation and behavior;\n                    (C) assist in the development of schools as caring \n                communities;\n                    (D) give students the opportunity to put character \n                lessons into practice;\n                    (E) provide for the inclusion of families and \n                communities in character education;\n                    (F) emphasize leadership, service, and teamwork as \n                dimensions of character education;
