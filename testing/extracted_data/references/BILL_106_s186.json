The review of district court decisions shall \n        be governed as provided in this subsection.\n            (2) Review.--Except as provided in sections 1292(c), \n        1292(d), and 1295 of title 28, United States Code, once the \n        court is organized into divisions, appeals from reviewable \n        decisions of the district and territorial courts located within \n        the Ninth Circuit shall be taken to the regional divisions of \n        the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as follows:\n                    (A) Appeals from the districts of Alaska, Guam, \n                Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, the Northern Mariana Islands, \n                Oregon, Eastern Washington, and Western Washington \n                shall be taken to the Northern Division.\n                    (B) Appeals from the districts of Eastern \n                California, Northern California, and Nevada shall be \n                taken to the Middle Division.\n                    (C) Appeals from the districts of Arizona, Central \n                California, and Southern California shall be taken to \n                the Southern Division.\n                    (D) Appeals from the Tax Court, petitions to \n                enforce the orders of administrative agencies, and \n                other proceedings within the court of appeals' \n                jurisdiction that do not involve review of district \n                court actions shall be filed in the court of appeals \n                and assigned to the division that would have \n                jurisdiction over the matter if the division were a \n                separate court of appeals.\n            (3) Assignment of judges.--Each regional division shall \n        include from 7 to 11 judges of the court of appeals in active \n        status. A majority of the judges assigned to each division \n        shall reside within the judicial districts that are within the \n        division's jurisdiction as specified in paragraph (2). Judges \n        in senior status may be assigned to regional divisions in \n        accordance with policies adopted by the court of appeals. Any \n        judge assigned to 1 division may be assigned by the chief judge \n        of the circuit for temporary duty in another division as \n        necessary to enable the divisions to function effectively.\n            (4) Presiding judges.--Section 45 of title 28, United \n        States Code, shall govern the designation of the presiding \n        judge of each regional division as though the division were a \n        court of appeals, except that the judge serving as chief judge \n        of the circuit may not at the same time serve as presiding \n        judge of a regional division, and that only judges resident \n        within, and assigned to, the division shall be eligible to \n        serve as presiding judge of that division.\n            (5) Panels.--Panels of a division may sit to hear and \n        decide cases at any place within the judicial districts of the \n        division, as specified by a majority of the judges of the \n        division. The divisions shall be governed by the Federal Rules \n        of Appellate Procedure and by local rules and internal \n        operating procedures adopted by the court of appeals. The \n        divisions may not adopt their own local rules or internal \n        operating procedures. The decisions of 1 regional division \n        shall not be regarded as binding precedents in the other \n        regional divisions.\n    (c) Circuit Division.--\n            (1) In general.--In addition to the 3 regional divisions \n        specified under subsection (a), the Ninth Circuit Court of \n        Appeals shall establish a Circuit Division composed of the \n        chief judge of the circuit and 12 other circuit judges in \n        active status, chosen by lot in equal numbers from each \n        regional division. Except for the chief judge of the circuit, \n        who shall serve ex officio, judges on the Circuit Division \n        shall serve nonrenewable, staggered terms of 3 years each. One-\n        third of the judges initially selected by lot shall serve terms \n        of 1 year each, one-third shall serve terms of 2 years each, \n        and one-third shall serve terms of 3 years each. Thereafter all \n        judges shall serve terms of 3 years each. If a judge on the \n        Circuit Division is disqualified or otherwise unable to serve \n        in a particular case, the presiding judge of the regional \n        division to which that judge is assigned shall randomly select \n        a judge from the division to serve in the place of the \n        unavailable judge.\n            (2) Jurisdiction.--The Circuit Division shall have \n        jurisdiction to review, and to affirm, reverse, or modify any \n        final decision rendered in any of the court's divisions that \n        conflicts on an issue of law with a decision in another \n        division of the court. The exercise of such jurisdiction shall \n        be within the discretion of the Circuit Division and may be \n        invoked by application for review by a party to the case, \n        setting forth succinctly the issue of law as to which there is \n        a conflict in the decisions of 2 or more divisions. The Circuit \n        Division may review the decision of a panel within a division \n        only if en banc review of the decision has been sought and \ndenied by the division.\n            (3) Procedures.--The Circuit Division shall consider and \n        decide cases through procedures adopted by the court of appeals \n        for the expeditious and inexpensive conduct of the division's \n        business. The Circuit Division shall not function through \n        panels. The Circuit Division shall decide issues of law on the \n        basis of the opinions, briefs, and records in the conflicting \n        decisions under review, unless the Circuit Division determines \n        that special circumstances make additional briefing or oral \n        argument necessary.\n            (4) En banc proceedings.--Section 46 of title 28, United \n        States Code, shall apply to each regional division of the Ninth \n        Circuit Court of Appeals as though the division were the court \n        of appeals. Section 46(c) of title 28, United States Code, \n        authorizing hearings or rehearings en banc, shall be applicable \n        only to the regional divisions of the court and not to the \n        court of appeals as a whole. After a divisional plan is in \n        effect, the court of appeals shall not order any hearing or \n        rehearing en banc, and the authorization for a limited en banc \n        procedure under section 6 of Public Law 95-486 (92 Stat. 1633), \n        shall not apply to the Ninth Circuit. An en banc proceeding \n        ordered before the divisional plan is in effect may be heard \n        and determined in accordance with applicable rules of appellate \n        procedure.\n    (d) Clerks and Employees.--Section 711 of title 28, United States \nCode, shall apply to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, except the \nclerk of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals may maintain an office or \noffices in each regional division of the court to provide services of \nthe clerk's office for that division.\n    (e) Study of Effectiveness.--The Federal Judicial Center shall \nconduct a study of the effectiveness and efficiency of the divisions in \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. No later than 3 years after the \neffective date of this Act, the Federal Judicial Center shall submit to \nthe Judicial Conference of the United States a report summarizing the \nactivities of the divisions, including the Circuit Division, and \nevaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the divisional \nstructure. The Judicial Conference shall submit recommendations to \nCongress concerning the divisional structure and whether the structure \nshould be continued with or without modification.\n\nSEC. 2.

Assignment of judges; panels; en banc proceedings; \n              divisions; quorum\n    ``(a) Circuit judges shall sit on the court of appeals and its \npanels in such order and at such times as the court directs.\n    ``(b) Unless otherwise provided by rule of court, a court of \nappeals or any regional division thereof shall consider and decide \ncases and controversies through panels of 3 judges, at least 2 of whom \nshall be judges of the court, unless such judges cannot sit because \nrecused or disqualified, or unless the chief judge of that court \ncertifies that there is an emergency including, but not limited to, the \nunavailability of a judge of the court because of illness. A court may \nprovide by rule for the disposition of appeals through panels \nconsisting of 2 judges, both of whom shall be judges of the court. \nPanels of the court shall sit at times and places and hear the cases \nand controversies assigned as the court directs. The United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall determine by rule a \nprocedure for the rotation of judges from panel-to-panel to ensure that \nall of the judges sit on a representative cross section of the cases \nheard and, notwithstanding the first sentence of this subsection, may \ndetermine by rule the number of judges, not less than 2, who constitute \na panel.\n    ``(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), a majority of the judges of a \ncourt of appeals not organized into divisions as provided in subsection \n(d) who are in regular active service may order a hearing or rehearing \nbefore the court en banc. A court en banc shall consist of all circuit \njudges in regular active service, except that any senior circuit judge \nof the circuit shall be eligible to participate, at that judge's \nelection and upon designation and assignment pursuant to section 294(c) \nand the rules of the circuit, as a member of an en banc court reviewing \na decision of a panel of which such judge was a member.\n    ``(d)(1) A court of appeals having more than 15 authorized \njudgeships may organize itself into 2 or more adjudicative divisions, \nwith each judge of the court assigned to a specific division, either \nfor a specified term of years or indefinitely. The court's docket shall \nbe allocated among the divisions in accordance with a plan adopted by \nthe court, and each division shall have exclusive appellate \njurisdiction over the appeals assigned to it. The presiding judge of \neach division shall be determined from among the judges of the division \nin active status as though the division were the court of appeals, \nexcept the chief judge of the circuit shall not serve at the same time \nas the presiding judge of a division.\n    ``(2) When organizing itself into divisions, a court of appeals \nshall establish a circuit division, consisting of the chief judge and \nadditional circuit judges in active status, selected in accordance with \nrules adopted by the court, so as to make an odd number of judges but \nnot more than 13.\n    ``(3) The circuit division shall have jurisdiction to review, and \nto affirm, reverse, or modify any final decision rendered in any of the \ncourt's divisions that conflicts on an issue of law with a decision in \nanother division of the court. The exercise of such jurisdiction shall \nbe within the discretion of the circuit division and may be invoked by \napplication for review by a party to the case, setting forth succinctly \nthe issue of law as to which there is a conflict in the decisions of 2 \nor more divisions. The circuit division may review the decision of a \npanel within a division only if en banc review of the decision has been \nsought and denied by the division.\n    ``(4) The circuit division shall consider and decide cases through \nprocedures adopted by the court of appeals for the expeditious and \ninexpensive conduct of the circuit division's business. The circuit \ndivision shall not function through panels. The circuit division shall \ndecide issues of law on the basis of the opinions, briefs, and records \nin the conflicting decisions under review, unless the \ndivision determines that special circumstances make additional briefing \nor oral argument necessary.\n    ``(e) This section shall apply to each division of a court that is \norganized into divisions as though the division were the court of \nappeals. Subsection (c), authorizing hearings or rehearings en banc, \nshall be applicable only to the divisions of the court and not to the \ncourt of appeals as a whole, and the authorization for a limited en \nbanc procedure under section 6 of Public Law 95-486 (92 Stat. 1633), \nshall not apply in that court. After a divisional plan is in effect, \nthe court of appeals shall not order any hearing or rehearing en banc, \nbut an en banc proceeding already ordered may be heard and determined \nin accordance with applicable rules of appellate procedure.\n    ``(f) A majority of the number of judges authorized to constitute a \ncourt, a division, or a panel thereof shall constitute a quorum.''.\n    (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for \nchapter 3 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by amending the \nitem relating to section 46 to read as follows:\n\n``46. Assignment of judges; panels; en banc proceedings; divisions; \n                            quorum.''.\n    (c) Monitoring Implementation.--The Federal Judicial Center shall \nmonitor the implementation of section 46 of title 28, United States \nCode (as amended by this section) for 3 years following the date of \nenactment of this Act and report to the Judicial Conference such \ninformation as the Center determines relevant or that the Conference \nrequests to enable the Judicial Conference to assess the effectiveness \nand efficiency of this section.\n\nSEC. 3. DISTRICT COURT APPELLATE PANELS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 5 of title 28, United States Code, is \namended by adding after section 144 the following:\n``Sec. 145. District Court Appellate Panels\n    ``(a) The judicial council of each circuit may establish a district \ncourt appellate panel service composed of district judges of the \ncircuit, in either active or senior status, who are assigned by the \njudicial council to hear and determine appeals in accordance with \nsubsection (b). Judges assigned to the district court appellate panel \nservice may continue to perform other judicial duties.\n    ``(b) An appeal heard under this section shall be heard by a panel \ncomposed of 2 district judges assigned to the district court appellate \npanel service, and 1 circuit judge as designated by the chief judge of \nthe circuit. The circuit judge shall preside. A district judge serving \non an appellate panel shall not participate in the review of decisions \nof the district court to which the judge has been appointed. The clerk \nof the court of appeals shall serve as the clerk of the district court \nappellate panels. A district court appellate panel may sit at any place \nwithin the circuit, pursuant to rules promulgated by the judicial \ncouncil, to hear and decide cases, for the convenience of parties and \ncounsel.\n    ``(c) In establishing a district court appellate panel service, the \njudicial council shall specify the categories or types of cases over \nwhich district court appellate panels shall have appellate \njurisdiction. In such cases specified by the judicial council as \nappropriate for assignment to district court appellate panels, and \nnotwithstanding sections 1291 and 1292, the appellate panel shall have \nexclusive jurisdiction over district court decisions and may exercise \nall of the authority otherwise vested in the court of appeals under \nsections 1291, 1292, 1651, and 2106. A district court appellate panel \nmay transfer a case within its jurisdiction to the court of appeals if \nthe panel determines that disposition of the case involves a question \nof law that should be determined by the court of appeals. The court of \nappeals shall thereupon assume jurisdiction over the case for all \npurposes.\n    ``(d) Final decisions of district court appellate panels may be \nreviewed by the court of appeals, in its discretion. A party seeking \nreview shall file a petition for leave to appeal in the court of \nappeals, which that court may grant or deny in its discretion. If a \ncourt of appeals is organized into adjudicative divisions, review of a \ndistrict court appellate panel decision shall be in the division to \nwhich an appeal would have been taken from the district court had there \nbeen no district court appellate panel.\n    ``(e) Procedures governing review in district court appellate \npanels and the discretionary review of such panels in the court of \nappeals shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the court of \nappeals.\n    ``(f) After a judicial council of a circuit makes an order \nestablishing a district court appellate panel service, the chief judge \nof the circuit may request the Chief Justice of the United States to \nassign 1 or more district judges from another circuit to serve on a \ndistrict court appellate panel, if the chief judge determines there is \na need for such judges. The Chief Justice may thereupon designate and \nassign such judges for this purpose.''.\n    (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for \nchapter 5 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding after \nthe item relating to section 144 the following:\n\n``145. District court appellate panels.''.\n    (c) Monitoring Implementation.--The Federal Judicial Center shall \nmonitor the implementation of section 145 of title 28, United States \nCode (as added by this section) for 3 years following the date of \nenactment of this Act and report to the Judicial Conference such \ninformation as the Center determines relevant or that the Conference \nrequests to enable the Conference to assess the effectiveness and \nefficiency of this section."
