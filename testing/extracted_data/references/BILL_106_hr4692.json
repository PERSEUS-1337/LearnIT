FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Las Vegas Wash is a significant ecosystem of desert \n        wetland created by treated effluent return flows, urban runoff, \n        and flood events from the Las Vegas Valley;\n            (2) a healthy wetland ecosystem in the Las Vegas Wash would \n        improve water quality in the Las Vegas Bay, the Lake Mead \n        National Recreation Area, and the lower Colorado River, which \n        is critical habitat for endangered and threatened fish and \n        wildlife populations;\n            (3) the Secretary of the Interior delivers municipal, \n        industrial, and agricultural water from the Colorado River to \n        millions of people in Nevada, Arizona, and California;\n            (4) a significant concern relating to water quality in Lake \n        Mead is the transmission of contaminants to the Colorado River \n        through the Las Vegas Wash from shallow ground water seepage \n        originating at an industrial complex located in the southeast \n        part of the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada;\n            (5) such industrial complex was constructed by the Federal \n        Government during World War II to manufacture products required \n        by the Department of Defense, including perchlorate, which is \n        an essential component of rocket fuel used exclusively by the \n        Federal Government;\n            (6) over the past 20 years the Las Vegas Wash wetland has \n        been significantly eroded and deteriorated by flash floods, \n        increasing treated effluent flows, urban runoff, and polluted \n        shallow groundwater seepage;\n            (7) the loss of the Las Vegas Wash wetland is having an \n        adverse impact on wildlife habitat;\n            (8) the Las Vegas Wash wetland is a unique opportunity to \n        experience a wetland environment providing educational, \n        cultural, environmental, and recreation benefits to the \n        community of southern Nevada;\n            (9) as recommended by a citizens' water quality advisory \n        committee in 1998, the Las Vegas Wash Coordination Committee, \n        including Federal, State, and local agencies, was formed to \n        establish a comprehensive adaptive management plan for the Las \n        Vegas Wash wetland;\n            (10) from 1998 to 1999, the Committee engaged in an \n        extensive public process to evaluate the multifaceted \n        challenges associated with the restoration of the Las Vegas \n        Wash wetland;\n            (11) in October of 1999, the Committee initiated a process \n        for public comment on a comprehensive adaptive management plan;\n            (12) in January 2000, the adaptive management plan was \n        approved by the Board of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, \n        which is the coordinating agency for the Committee; and\n            (13) the adaptive management plan calls for a partnership \n        among Federal, State and local agencies with an interest in Las \n        Vegas Wash wetland.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to recognize the importance of the restoration of the \n        Las Vegas Wash wetland to water quality in the Colorado River \n        and a desert wetland ecosystem;\n            (2) to direct the affected Federal agencies to participate \n        constructively in the implementation of the Las Vegas Wash \n        Wetland Restoration and Lake Mead Water Quality Improvement \n        Project under the comprehensive adaptive management plan; and\n            (3) to authorize such sums as are necessary for the \n        affected Federal agencies to carry out specific tasks required \n        by the Project in partnership with the authority and other \n        State and local agencies involved in the Las Vegas Wash \n        Coordination Committee.\n\nSEC. 3.
