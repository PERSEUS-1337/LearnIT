    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Remediation Research \nAct of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) methamphetamine use and production is growing rapidly \n        throughout the United States;\n            (2) some materials and chemical residues remaining from the \n        production of methamphetamine pose novel environmental problems \n        in locations in which methamphetamine laboratories have been \n        closed;\n            (3) there has been little standardization of measures for \n        determining when the site of a former methamphetamine \n        laboratory has been successfully remediated;\n            (4)(A) initial cleanup actions are generally limited to \n        removal of hazardous substances and contaminated materials that \n        pose an immediate threat to public health or the environment; \n        and\n            (B) it is not uncommon for significant levels of \n        contamination to be found throughout residential structures in \n        which methamphetamine has been manufactured, partially because \n        of a lack of knowledge of how to achieve an effective cleanup;\n            (5)(A) data on methamphetamine laboratory-related \n        contaminants of concern are very limited;\n            (B) uniform cleanup standards do not exist; and\n            (C) procedures for sampling and analysis of contaminants \n        need to be researched and developed; and\n            (6) many States are struggling with establishing assessment \n        and remediation guidelines and programs to address the rapidly \n        expanding number of methamphetamine laboratories being closed \n        each year.\n\nSEC. 3. VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Voluntary Guidelines.--Not later than 1 year \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant Administrator \nfor Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency \n(referred to in this Act as the ``Assistant Administrator''), in \nconsultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nshall establish voluntary guidelines, based on the best available \nscientific knowledge, for the remediation of former methamphetamine \nlaboratories, including guidelines regarding preliminary site \nassessment and the remediation of residual contaminants.\n    (b) Considerations.--In developing the voluntary guidelines under \nsubsection (a), the Assistant Administrator shall consider, at a \nminimum--\n            (1) relevant standards, guidelines, and requirements found \n        in Federal, State, and local laws (including regulations);\n            (2) the varying types and locations of former \n        methamphetamine laboratories; and\n            (3) the expected cost of carrying out any proposed \n        guidelines.\n    (c) States.--\n            (1) In general.--The voluntary guidelines should be \n        designed to assist State and local governments in the \n        development and the implementation of legislation and other \n        policies to apply state-of-the-art knowledge and research \n        results to the remediation of former methamphetamine \n        laboratories.\n            (2) Adoption.--The Assistant Administrator shall work with \n        State and local governments and other relevant non-Federal \n        agencies and organizations, including through the conference \n        described in section 5, to promote and encourage the \n        appropriate adoption of the voluntary guidelines.\n    (d) Updating the Guidelines.--The Assistant Administrator shall \nperiodically update the voluntary guidelines as the Assistant \nAdministrator, in consultation with States and other interested \nparties, determines to be appropriate to incorporate research findings \nand other new knowledge.\n\nSEC. 4. RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Assistant Administrator shall establish a \nprogram of research to support the development and revision of the \nvoluntary guidelines described in section 3.\n    (b) Research.--The research shall--\n            (1) identify methamphetamine laboratory-related chemicals \n        of concern;\n            (2) assess the types and levels of exposure to chemicals of \n        concern identified under paragraph (1), including routine and \n        accidental exposures, that may present a significant risk of \n        adverse biological effects;\n            (3) identify the research efforts necessary to better \n        address biological effects and to minimize adverse human \n        exposures;\n            (4) evaluate the performance of various methamphetamine \n        laboratory cleanup and remediation techniques; and\n            (5) support other research priorities identified by the \n        Assistant Administrator in consultation with States and other \n        interested parties.\n\nSEC. 5. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CONFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Conference.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act and at least every third year thereafter, \n        the Assistant Administrator shall convene a conference of \n        appropriate State agencies, individuals, and organizations \n        involved in research and other activities directly relating to \n        the environmental or biological impacts of former \n        methamphetamine laboratories.\n            (2) Forum.--The conference should be a forum for--\n                    (A) the Assistant Administrator to provide \n                information on the guidelines developed under section 3 \n                and on the latest findings from the research program \n                described in section 4; and\n                    (B) non-Federal participants to provide information \n                on the problems and needs of States and localities and \n                their experience with guidelines developed under \n                section 3.\n    (b) Report.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n        each conference, the Assistant Administrator shall submit to \n        Congress a report that summarizes the proceedings of the \n        conference, including a summary of any recommendations or \n        concerns raised by the non-Federal participants and how the \n        Assistant Administrator intends to respond to the \n        recommendations or concerns.\n            (2) Public availability.--The Assistant Secretary shall \n        make each report widely available to the general public.\n\nSEC. 6.
