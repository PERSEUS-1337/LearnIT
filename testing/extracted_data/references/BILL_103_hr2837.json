FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Television and radio programming are bringing ever-\n        increasing levels of violent programming into the American \n        home. Over 25 percent of prime-time television shows contain \n        `very violent' material, according to the National Coalition on \n        Television Violence.\n            (2) Prime time violence tripled during the 1980's, the \n        American Academy of Pediatrics reports.\n            (3) Programs developed for children are especially violent. \n        A University of Pennsylvania study found that children's \n        programming contains over 30 violent acts per hour.\n            (4) Before the average child finishes grade school, he or \n        she sees 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on \n        television.\n            (5) Numerous academic studies have built up astonishing \n        evidence that shows children tend to imitate the behavior they \n        see on television. The National Institute of Mental Health \n        finds that violence on television leads to aggressive behavior \n        by children and teenagers who watch violent programs.\n            (6) Three different Surgeons General, the Attorney \n        General's Task Force on Family Violence, the American Medical \n        Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American \n        Academy of Pediatrics, and other authorities have all found \n        that viewing televised violence is harmful to children.\n            (7) Americans watch enormous amounts of television, and \n        many children will watch television for twice as many hours \n        (22,000 hours) as they attend school.\n            (8) Many children watch violent television programs without \n        adult supervision or guidance.\n            (9) More than 20 years of research has led to a consensus \n        that watching televised violence increases children's \n        aggressiveness and desensitizes them to the effects and \n        implications of violence, and the solidity of the agreement \n        among respected scientists that televised violence is harmful \n        nullifies arguments to the contrary by the television industry.\n            (10) There is a need to find solutions that limit the \n        harmful influence of television and radio violence and yet \n        maintain our freedom of expression.\n\nSEC. 3.
