    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Poverty Trap Study Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Low income people are subject to many taxes, including \n        the Federal income tax, payroll taxes, and State income taxes. \n        In addition, eligibility for many Federal and State programs \n        for assistance to the working poor, such as the earned income \n        tax credit, food stamps, housing assistance programs, medicaid, \n        child care assistance, and the women, infants, and children \n        (WIC) nutrition program is based in part on income levels. The \n        rates at which the benefits from such programs are phased out \n        have the same effect as additional taxes imposed on the \n        beneficiaries.\n            (2) The total effective marginal rate of tax for additional \n        income earned by low income people can exceed 100 percent and \n        can be a disincentive to working more hours, getting a raise, \n        learning a more lucrative trade, getting married, or engaging \n        in other economic or social activities.\n\nSEC. 3.
