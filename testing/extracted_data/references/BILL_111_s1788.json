SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse and Health \nCare Worker Protection Act of 2009''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2007, direct-care registered nurses ranked seventh \n        among all occupations for the number of cases of \n        musculoskeletal disorders resulting in days away from work--\n        8,580 total cases. Nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants \n        sustained 24,340 musculoskeletal disorders in 2007, the second \n        highest of any occupation. The leading cause of these injuries \n        in health care are the result of patient lifting, transferring, \n        and repositioning injuries.\n            (2) The physical demands of the nursing profession lead \n        many nurses to leave the profession. Fifty-two percent of \n        nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38 percent suffer from \n        pain severe enough to require leave from work. Many nurses and \n        other health care workers suffering back injury do not return \n        to work.\n            (3) Patients are not at optimum levels of safety while \n        being lifted, transferred, or repositioned manually. Mechanical \n        lift programs can substantially reduce skin tears suffered by \n        patients and the frequency of patients being dropped, thus \n        allowing patients a safer means to progress through their care.\n            (4) The development of assistive patient handling equipment \n        and devices has essentially rendered the act of strict manual \n        patient handling unnecessary as a function of nursing care.\n            (5) A growing number of health care facilities have \n        incorporated patient handling technology and have reported \n        positive results. Injuries among nursing staff have \n        dramatically declined since implementing patient handling \n        equipment and devices. As a result, the number of lost work \n        days due to injury and staff turnover has declined. Studies \n        have also shown that assistive patient handling technology \n        successfully reduces workers' compensation costs for \n        musculoskeletal disorders.\n            (6) Establishing a safe patient handling and injury \n        prevention standard for direct-care registered nurses and other \n        health care workers is a critical component in protecting \n        nurses and other health care workers, addressing the nursing \n        shortage, and increasing patient safety.\n    (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1.

Definitions.\n\nSEC. 2. SAFE PATIENT HANDLING AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD.\n\n    (a) Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor, shall, pursuant to \nsection 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. \n655), propose a standard on safe patient handling and injury prevention \n(in this section such standard referred to as the ``safe patient \nhandling and injury prevention standard'') under such section to \nprevent musculoskeletal disorders for direct-care registered nurses and \nall other health care workers handling patients in health care \nfacilities. A final safe patient handling and injury prevention \nstandard shall be promulgated not later than 2 years after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Requirements.--The safe patient handling and injury prevention \nstandard shall require the use of engineering controls to perform \nlifting, transferring, and repositioning of patients and the \nelimination of manual lifting of patients by direct-care registered \nnurses and all other health care workers, through the use of mechanical \ndevices to the greatest degree feasible except where the use of safe \npatient handling practices can be demonstrated to compromise patient \ncare. The standard shall apply to all health care employers and shall \nrequire at least the following:\n            (1) Each health care employer to develop and implement a \n        safe patient handling and injury prevention plan within 6 \n        months of the date of promulgation of the final standard, which \n        plan shall include hazard identification, risk assessments, and \n        control measures in relation to patient care duties and patient \n        handling.\n            (2) Each health care employer to purchase, use, maintain, \n        and have accessible an adequate number of safe lift mechanical \n        devices not later than 2 years after the date of issuance of a \n        final regulation establishing such standard.\n            (3) Each health care employer to obtain input from direct-\n        care registered nurses, health care workers, and employee \n        representatives of direct-care registered nurses and health \n        care workers in developing and implementing the safe patient \n        handling and injury prevention plan, including the purchase of \n        equipment.\n            (4) Each health care employer to establish and maintain a \n        data system that tracks and analyzes trends in injuries \n        relating to the application of the safe patient handling and \n        injury prevention standard and to make such data and analyses \n        available to employees and employee representatives.\n            (5) Each health care employer to establish a system to \n        document in each instance when safe patient handling equipment \n        was not utilized due to legitimate concerns about patient care \n        and to generate a written report in each such instance. The \n        report shall list the following:\n                    (A) The work task being performed.\n                    (B) The reason why safe patient handling equipment \n                was not used.\n                    (C) The nature of the risk posed to the worker from \n                manual lifting.\n                    (D) The steps taken by management to reduce the \n                likelihood of manual lifting and transferring when \n                performing similar work tasks in the future.\n        Such reports shall be made available to OSHA compliance \n        officers, workers, and their representatives upon request \n        within one business day.\n            (6) Each health care employer to train nurses and other \n        health care workers on safe patient handling and injury \n        prevention policies, equipment, and devices at least on an \n        annual basis. Such training shall include providing information \n        on hazard identification, assessment, and control of \n        musculoskeletal hazards in patient care areas and shall be \n        conducted by an individual with knowledge in the subject \n        matter, and delivered, at least in part, in an interactive \n        classroom-based and hands-on format.\n            (7) Each health care employer to post a uniform notice in a \n        form specified by the Secretary that--\n                    (A) explains the safe patient handling and injury \n                prevention standard;\n                    (B) includes information regarding safe patient \n                handling and injury prevention policies and training; \n                and\n                    (C) explains procedures to report patient handling-\n                related injuries.\n            (8) Each health care employer to conduct an annual written \n        evaluation of the implementation of the safe patient handling \n        and injury prevention plan, including handling procedures, \n        selection of equipment and engineering controls, assessment of \n        injuries, and new safe patient handling and injury prevention \n        technology and devices that have been developed. The evaluation \n        shall be conducted with the involvement of nurses, other health \n        care workers, and their representatives and shall be documented \n        in writing. Health care employers shall take corrective action \n        as recommended in the written evaluation.\n    (c) Inspections.--The Secretary of Labor shall conduct unscheduled \ninspections under section 8 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act \nof 1970 (29 U.S.C. 657) to ensure implementation of and compliance with \nthe safe patient handling and injury prevention standard.\n\nSEC. 3.
