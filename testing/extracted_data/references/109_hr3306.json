    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Trade with China Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The growth of the economy of the People's Republic of \n        China is one of the most important developments of the 21st \n        century.\n            (2) The bilateral trade relationship between the United \n        States and China is heavily imbalanced and is undermining the \n        long-term economic health of the United States.\n            (3) The United States trade deficit with China has doubled \n        since 2000, reaching $162,000,000,000 in 2004, the largest \n        bilateral trade deficit in the world.\n            (4) As a consequence of the trade deficit, the United \n        States has had to borrow massive amounts of money from foreign \n        governments.\n            (5) The United States has accumulated more debt to foreign \n        countries since 2000 than in the first 220 years of the \n        country's history.\n            (6) China has become a major purchaser of United States \n        Treasury bonds, and United States indebtedness to the \n        Government of China has grown by more than $100,000,000,000 \n        since 2000.\n            (7) The large amounts of United States dollars accumulated \n        by the Government of China contribute to China's acquisitions \n        of United States companies, such as the proposed acquisition of \n        Unocal Corporation by the China National Offshore Oil \n        Corporation.\n            (8) China continues to violate many of the commitments it \n        made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\n            (9) China's inadequate enforcement of intellectual property \n        rights is resulting in infringement levels of 90 percent or \n        more for nearly all forms of intellectual property, and cost \n        American companies more than $2,500,000,000 in lost sales in \n        2004.\n            (10) China's industrial policies discriminate against \n        foreign firms and products.\n            (11) The Government of China continues to heavily subsidize \n        its manufacturing sector through tax incentives, preferential \n        access to credit and capital, subsidized utilities, and other \n        measures.\n            (12) Since 1994, China has kept its currency pegged at \n        approximately 8.3 renminbi to the United States dollar, which \n        has caused the renminbi to become undervalued against the \n        dollar by as much as 40 percent, harming exports of United \n        States goods and services to China and providing an unfair \n        advantage to Chinese exports to the United States.\n            (13) Current policies of the United States have failed to \n        advance and protect the interests of American workers, farmers, \n        and businesses in the United States-China trade relationship, \n        failed to address effectively China's unfair trade practices \n        and market access barriers to goods and services and its poor \n        record at protecting intellectual property rights, and failed \n        to stem or reverse the unsustainable United States trade \n        deficit with China.\n            (14) It is critical that the United States develop and \n        implement a comprehensive and coherent set of policies to \n        address China's unfair trading practices and failure to abide \n        by its commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization.\n\nSEC. 3. APPLICATION OF COUNTERVAILING DUTIES TO NONMARKET ECONOMY \n              COUNTRIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 701(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 \nU.S.C. 1671(a)(1)) is amended by inserting ``(including a nonmarket \neconomy country)'' after ``country'' each place it appears.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to \npetitions filed under section 702 of the Tariff Act of 1930 on or after \nthe date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Antidumping Provisions not Affected.--The amendments made by \nsubsection (a) shall not affect the status of a country as a nonmarket \neconomy country for purposes of any matter relating to antidumping \nduties under the Tariff Act of 1930.\n\nSEC. 4.
