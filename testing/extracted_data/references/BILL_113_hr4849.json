ADVANCED BIOFUEL, BIOMASS-BASED DIESEL, AND CELLULOSIC BIOFUEL \n              REQUIRED TO BE PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES TO SATISFY \n              RENEWABLE FUEL PROGRAM MANDATES.\n\n    (a) Advanced Biofuel.--Section 211(o)(1)(B)(i) of the Clean Air Act \n(42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(B)(i)) is amended by striking ``that has \nlifecycle'' and inserting ``that is produced in the United States and \nhas lifecycle''.\n    (b) Biomass-Based Diesel.--Section 211(o)(1)(D) of the Clean Air \nAct (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(D)) is amended--\n            (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``that is \n        biodiesel'' and inserting ``that is produced in the United \n        States and is biodiesel''; and\n            (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``renewable fuel \n        derived from'' and inserting ``renewable fuel that is produced \n        in the United States and derived from''.\n    (c) Cellulosic Biofuel.--Section 211(o)(1)(E) of the Clean Air Act \n(42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(E)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``renewable fuel derived from'' and \n        inserting ``renewable fuel that is produced in the United \n        States, that is derived from''; and\n            (2) by inserting a comma after ``from renewable biomass''.\n    (d) Waivers for Reduction of Applicable Volume in Case of \nInadequate Supply.--\n            (1) Advanced biofuel.--Section 211(o)(7) of the Clean Air \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(7)) is amended by adding at the end the \n        following:\n                    ``(G) Advanced biofuel.--For any calendar year for \n                which the projected volume of advanced biofuel \n                production is less than the minimum applicable volume \n                established under paragraph (2)(B), as determined by \n                the Administrator based on the estimate provided under \n                paragraph (3)(A), not later than November 30 of the \n                preceding calendar year, the Administrator shall reduce \n                the applicable volume of advanced biofuel required \n                under paragraph (2)(B) to the projected volume \n                available during that calendar year.''.\n            (2) Biomass-based diesel.--Section 211(o)(7)(E) of the \n        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(7)(E)) is amended by adding at \n        the end the following:\n                    ``(iv) Inadequate supply.--For any calendar year \n                for which the projected volume of biomass-based diesel \n                production is less than the minimum applicable volume \n                established under paragraph (2)(B), as determined by \n                the Administrator based on the estimate provided under \n                paragraph (3)(A), not later than November 30 of the \n                preceding calendar year, the Administrator shall reduce \n                the applicable volume of biomass-based diesel \n                production required under paragraph (2)(B) to the \n                projected volume available during that calendar \n                year.''.\n            (3) Estimate of volumes.--Section 211(o)(3)(A) of the Clean \n        Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3)(A)) is amended by inserting \n        ``advanced biofuel,'' before ``biomass-based diesel''.\n\nSEC. 3.
