    "content": "Since November 1986, the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) has provided the legal framework for the placement of commemorative works in the District of Columbia. The CWA was enacted to establish a statutory process for ensuring \"that future commemorative works in areas administered by the National Park Service (NPS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) in the District of Columbia and its environs (1) are appropriately designed, constructed, and located and (2) reflect a consensus of the lasting significance of the subjects involved.\" Areas administered by other agencies are not subject to the CWA. Responsibility for overseeing the design, construction, and maintenance of such works was delegated to the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the GSA, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA). Additionally, the CWA restricts placement of commemorative works to certain areas of the District of Columbia based on the subject's historic importance. Pursuant to the CWA, locating a commemorative work on federally owned and administered land in the District of Columbia requires the federal government to maintain the memorial unless otherwise stipulated in the enabling legislation. In some cases, however, authorized memorials are ultimately sited on land that falls outside of CWA jurisdiction and outside the boundaries of the District of Columbia and its environs. For example, the Air Force Memorial was authorized by Congress for placement on land owned and administered by either NPS or GSA in the District of Columbia. Memorial organizers, however, chose a site near the Pentagon in Arlington, VA, that is owned and administered by the Department of Defense. Consequently, the Department of Defense, not the NPS or GSA, is responsible for maintenance.  This report highlights in-progress works and memorials with lapsed authorizations since the passage of the CWA in 1986. The report provides information\u2014located within text boxes for easy reference\u2014on the statute(s) authorizing the work; the sponsor organization; statutory legislative extensions, if any; and the memorial's location or proposed location, if known. A picture or rendering of each work is also included, when available. The CWA divides areas administered by the NPS and the GSA in the District of Columbia and its environs into three sections for the placement of memorials: the Reserve, Area I, and Area II. For each area, the standards for memorial placement are specified in law, and congressional approval of monument location is required. The Reserve was created in November 2003, by P.L. 108-126 , to prohibit the addition of future memorials in an area defined as \"the great cross-axis of the Mall, which generally extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, and from the White House to the Jefferson Memorial .\" Under the act, this area is considered \"a substantially completed work of civic art. \" Within this area, \"to preserve the integrity of the Mall \u2026 the siting of new commemorative works is prohibited. \"  Created as part of the original CWA in 1986, Area I is reserved for commemorative works of \"preeminent historical and lasting significance to the United States. \" Area I is roughly bounded by the West Front of the Capitol; Pennsylvania Avenue NW (between 1 st and 15 th Streets NW); Lafayette Square; 17 th Street NW (between H Street and Constitution Avenue); Constitution Avenue NW (between 17 th and 23 rd Streets); the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts waterfront area; Theodore Roosevelt Island; National Park Service land in Virginia surrounding the George Washington Memorial Parkway; the 14 th Street Bridge area; and Maryland Avenue SW, from Maine Avenue SW, to Independence Avenue SW, at the U.S. Botanic Garden. Also created as part of the original CWA statute, Area II is reserved for \"subjects of lasting historical significance to the American people. \" Area II encompasses all sections of the District of Columbia and its environs not part of the Reserve or Area I. Of the 37 commemorative works authorized for placement in the District of Columbia since 1986, 19 (51%) have been completed and dedicated, 12 (32%) are in progress, and 6 (16%) have lapsed authorizations. Several factors may affect a memorial foundation's ability to complete a memorial. These include settling on a desired site location, getting design approval, and raising the funds necessary to design and build a commemorative work. Choosing a memorial site location is one of the biggest tasks for all authorized sponsor groups. Many groups want locations on or near the National Mall. The creation of the Reserve in 2003, however, makes placement of a future memorial on the National Mall difficult. Subsequently, many sponsor groups attempt to locate sites as close to the National Mall as possible in order to ensure that visitors have easy access to the memorial. For example, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial is to be located on land directly south of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, thus providing a prominent\u2014just off the Mall\u2014location. Likewise, the foundation previously authorized to construct a memorial to honor John Adams and his family's legacy evaluated site locations as close to the National Mall as possible. In 1986, as part of the CWA, Congress authorized the NCPC and the CFA to approve memorial designs. The NCPC and the CFA were tasked with carrying out the goals of the CWA, which are (1) to preserve the integrity of the comprehensive design of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans for the Nation's Capital; (2) to ensure the continued public use and enjoyment of open space in the District of Columbia and its environs, and to encourage the location of commemorative works within the urban fabric of the District of Columbia; (3) to preserve, protect, and maintain the limited amount of open space available to residents of, and visitors to, the Nation's Capital; and (4) to ensure that future commemorative works in areas administered by the National Park Service and the Administrator of General Services in the District of Columbia and its environs are \u2026 appropriately designed, constructed, and located; and \u2026 reflect a consensus of lasting national significance of the subjects involved. In some instances, sponsor groups have difficulty creating a memorial vision that meets the specifications of the NCPC, CFA, and the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission (NCMAC). In these cases, groups will often have to present multiple designs to these bodies before getting final design approval. For example, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission has presented variations on the design for the Eisenhower Memorial to the NCPC multiple times. In all instances, the NCPC gave feedback to the memorial design team and asked them to continue work to comply with NCPC guidelines for memorial construction. Perhaps the most challenging step in the commemorative works process for many sponsor groups is raising the necessary funds to design and build a commemorative work. Although most sponsor groups do not anticipate fundraising difficulties, some groups have experienced challenges. Failure to raise the necessary funds can be used as a reason not to extend a memorial's authorization beyond the initial seven-year period. In some cases, even though the CWA generally prohibits the use of federal funds for memorial design and construction, Congress has authorized appropriations to aid sponsor groups in their fundraising efforts. For example, in 2005, Congress appropriated $10 million to the Secretary of the Interior \"for necessary expenses for the Memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr.\" The appropriation was designated as matching funds, making them available only after being matched by nonfederal contributions. Since the enactment of the Commemorative Works Act in 1986, 37 memorials and monuments have been authorized by statute. On a yearly basis, however, legislation is pending before Congress to consider a wide range of additional commemorative works. Pursuant to the CWA, future commemorative works will continue to be considered according to congressional guidelines. If new commemorative works are authorized or currently authorized commemorative works are completed, this report will be updated accordingly. Since the passage of the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) in 1986, Congress has authorized 37 commemorative works to be placed in the District of Columbia or its environs; 32 of these have been sited on land governed by the CWA. Of these works, 12 are in progress and 6 have lapsed authorizations. Table 1 lists commemorative works authorized by Congress since 1986 that are in progress or whose authorization has lapsed. Currently, 12 commemorative works are in various stages of development. These include the following: In-Progress Memorials Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial;  Memorials Being Designed Slaves and Free Black Persons Who Served in the Revolutionary War Memorial; Memorials Being Planned with a Site Location World War II Prayer plaque, World War I Memorial, Korean War Memorial Wall of Remembrance, Second Division Memorial modifications,  Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial, and Peace Corps Memorial; Memorials Being Planned and Evaluating Site Locations Gold Star Mothers Memorial,  John Adams and his Family's Legacy Memorial,  Global War on Terrorism Memorial, and Emergency Medical Services Memorial. Currently, one memorial authorized pursuant to the CWA is under construction\u2014the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial, which broke ground on November 2, 2017. The most recently dedicated memorial was the Victims of the Ukrainian Manmade Famine of 1932-1933 Memorial. In October 1999, Congress created a federal commission to \"consider and formulate plans for ... a permanent memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower, including its nature, design, construction, and location.\" In January 2002, Congress amended the initial statute to formally authorize the commission to create a memorial. In remarks during debate on additional amendments to the commission's statute in 2007, Representative Dennis Moore summarized Eisenhower's life and contributions to the United States: I am particularly proud to claim one of the greatest 20 th -century Americans as a fellow Kansan. He ranks as one of the preeminent figures in the global history of the 20 th century. Dwight Eisenhower spent his entire life in public service. His most well-known contributions include serving as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces in World War II and as 34 th President of the United States, but Eisenhower also served as the first commander of NATO and as President of Columbia University. Dramatic changes occurred in America during his lifetime, many of which he participated in and influenced through his extraordinary leadership as President. Although Ike grew up before automobiles existed, he created the Interstate Highway System and took America into space. He created NASA, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Federal Aviation Administration. He added Hawaii and Alaska to the United States and ended the Korean War. President Eisenhower desegregated the District of Columbia and sent federal troops into Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce school integration. He defused international crises and inaugurated the national security policies that guided the nation for the next three decades, leading to the peaceful end of the Cold War. A career soldier, Eisenhower championed peace, freedom, justice and security, and as President he stressed the interdependence of those goals. He spent a lifetime fulfilling his duty to his country, always remembering to ask what's best for America. The memorial is to be located at Maryland Avenue and Independence Avenue, SW, between the National Air and Space Museum and the Lyndon B. Johnson Department of Education building. It is designed by architect Frank Gehry. On September 20, 2017, the CFA reviewed and approved the final design for the Eisenhower Memorial. On October 5, 2017, NCPC also approved the final memorial design. On November 2, 2017, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for the memorial.  Figure 1 shows the final design for the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial as approved by NCPC and CFA. The Eisenhower Memorial is currently under construction. In June 2014, Congress authorized the placement of a plaque containing President Franklin D. Roosevelt's D-Day prayer at the \"area of the World War II Memorial in the District of Columbia.... \" During debate on the bill in the 112 th Congress ( H.R. 2070 ), Representative Bill Johnson summarized why he believed the prayer should be added to the World War II Memorial. This legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to install at the World War II Memorial a suitable plaque or an inscription with the words that President Franklin Roosevelt prayed with the Nation on the morning of the D-day invasion. This prayer, which has been entitled \"Let Our Hearts Be Stout,'' gave solace, comfort and strength to our Nation and our brave warriors as we fought against tyranny and oppression. The memorial was built to honor the 16 million who served in the Armed Forces of the United States during World War II and the more than 400,000 who died during the war ... I have no doubt that the prayer should be included among the tributes to the Greatest Generation memorialized on the National Mall, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. The prayer plaque is to be located at the \"Circle of Remembrance\" on the northwest side of the World War II Memorial. The NCPC and the CFA both favor an \"asymmetrical\" design for the prayer plaque. Figure 2 shows the proposed location of the plaque at the Circle of Remembrance. In December 2012, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, Congress authorized the National Mall Liberty Fund DC to establish a commemorative work \"to honor the more than 5,000 courageous slaves and free Black persons who served as soldiers and sailors or provided civilian assistance during the American Revolution.\" Additionally, P.L. 112-239 repealed a 1986 authorization to the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation to establish a commemorative work for black Revolutionary War veterans.  In remarks introducing the 1986 legislation, Representative Mary Rose Oakar summarized the need, from her perspective, for a memorial to black Revolutionary War veterans: Mr. Speaker, as early as 1652 blacks were fighting as members of the Militia in Colonial America, thus beginning their history of achievement and heroism for our country. Yet, history books in American schools have for the most part omitted the contributions of black soldiers since the Revolutionary War, to our most recent conflict in Vietnam. This memorial to these black Americans is a small tribute to their bravery and valor, an important part of the founding of our country. Following its initial authorization in 1986, Congress approved the memorial's location in Area I on land that became part of the Reserve in 2003. Following the site designation, the memorial was reauthorized three times. Pursuant to P.L. 106-442 , the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation's authorization for the memorial expired in 2005. In the Senate report accompanying the 2012 authorization ( S. 883 , 112 th Congress), the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources summarized the importance of reauthorizing the memorial with a new sponsor. In 1986, Congress authorized the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial Foundation to establish the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial to honor the 5,000 courageous slaves and free Black persons who served as soldiers or provided civilian assistance during the American Revolution ( P.L. 99-558 ).  In 1987 Congress enacted a second law, P.L. 100-265 , authorizing placement of that memorial within the monumental core area as it was then defined by the Commemorative Works Act. In 1988, the National Park Service, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the National Capital Planning Commission approved a site in Constitution Gardens for the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial and, in 1996, approved the final design. Despite four extensions of the memorial's legislative authorization over 21 years, the Foundation was unable to raise sufficient funds for construction, the authority (and associated site and design approvals) finally lapsed in October 2005, and the Foundation disbanded with numerous outstanding debts and unpaid creditors.  S. 883 would authorize another nonprofit organization, the National Mall Liberty Fund D.C., to construct a commemorative work honoring the same individuals as proposed by the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial Foundation, subject to the requirements of the Commemorative Works Act. On September 26, 2014, President Obama signed H.J.Res. 120 to provide the memorial with a location in Area I. The sponsor group publicly expressed interest in three sites: the National Mall at 14 th Street and Independence Avenue, NW; Freedom Plaza; and Virginia Avenue and 19 th Streets, NW, with a strong preference for the National Mall site, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In the 114 th Congress (2015-2016), legislation was introduced to designate the Secretary of Agriculture as the officer \"responsible for the consideration of the site and design proposals and the submission of such proposals on behalf of the sponsor to the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission\" in order to apply the CWA to the memorial. No further action was taken on the measure. Figure 3 shows a memorial concept design. In December 2014, as part of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress re-designated Pershing Park in the District of Columbia as \"a World War I Memorial,\" and authorized the World War I Centennial Commission to \"enhance the General Pershing Commemorative Work by constructing ... appropriate sculptural and other commemorative elements, including landscaping, to further honor the service of members of the United States Armed Forces in World War I.\" Pershing Park is located between E Street and Pennsylvania Avenue and 14 th and 15 th Streets, NW. Currently, the park contains a statue of General John J. Pershing.  On January 26, 2016, the World War I Centennial Commission announced the winner of its design competition. Titled \"The Weight of Sacrifice,\" the winning design envisions an \"allegorical idea that public space and public freedom are hard won through the great sacrifices of countless individuals in the pursuit of liberty.\" On February 7, 2019, the commission presented the latest version of its design to the NCPC, and on May 16, 2019, to the CFA. Previously, a ceremonial groundbreaking for the memorial was held on November 9, 2017. Figure 4 shows a revised concept design for the World War I Memorial. In October 2016, Congress authorized a wall of remembrance, which \"shall include a list of names of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who died in the Korean War\" to be added to the Korean War Memorial in the District of Columbia. The wall of remembrance is to be located \"at the site of the Korean War Veterans Memorial.\" During debate on the bill ( H.R. 1475 , 114 th Congress) in the House, Representative Sam Johnson summarized why he believed it was important to add a wall of remembrance to the Korean War Veterans Memorial. My fellow Korean war veterans and I believe that the magnitude of this enormous sacrifice is not yet fully conveyed by the memorial in Washington, DC.... Similar to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance would eternally honor the brave Americans who gave their lives in defense of freedom during the Korean War. It would list their names as a visual record of their sacrifice.  Figure 5 shows the concept design for the Korean War Memorial Wall of Remembrance. On March 23, 2018, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), modifications to the Second Division Memorial were authorized. The Second Division Memorial was initially dedicated on July 18, 1936, to commemorate the division's World War I casualties, and \"two wings were dedicated on June 20, 1962, with significant battles of World War II inscribed on the west and of the Korean War on the east.\" P.L. 115-141 authorizes the placement of \"additional commemorative elements or engravings on the raised platform or stone work of the existing Second Division Memorial ... to further honor the members of the Second Infantry Division who have given their lives in service to the United States.\" Figure 6 shows the current design of the Second Division Memorial. In December 2014, as part of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress authorized the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial in the District of Columbia to \"commemorate and honor those who, as a member of the Armed forces, served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield.\" During debate on the House version of the bill ( H.R. 503 ), Representative Doc Hastings, chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, summarized the need for a memorial: Over 600,000 American servicemen deployed for Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield and successfully led a coalition of over 30 countries to evict an invading army to secure the independence of Kuwait.  This memorial will recognize their success, but it will also serve as a commemoration of those nearly 300 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. On March 31, 2017, President Trump signed S.J.Res. 1 to provide the memorial with a location in Area I. The memorial will be located at the southwest corner of Constitution Avenue, NW, and 23 rd Street, NW. Figure 7 shows a rendering for the National Desert Storm Veteran's War Memorial. In January 2014, Congress authorized the Peace Corps Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia to \"commemorate the mission of the Peace Corps and the ideals on which the Peace Corps was founded.\" During House debate on the bill ( S. 230 ), Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulations, summarized his understanding of the aims of the Peace Corps Memorial: Last November, we marked the 50 th anniversary of President Kennedy's tragic assassination. Losing President Kennedy left a lasting scar on the American psyche, but his legacy lives on through his words and ideas, including the establishment of the Peace Corps, an institution that has sent over 200,000 Americans to 139 countries in its 52-year history.  S. 230 authorizes construction of a memorial to commemorate the mission of the Peace Corps and the values on which it was founded. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate President Kennedy's legacy and the tremendous accomplishments of the Peace Corps.  With the passage of S. 230 , we will be sending a worthwhile bill to the President's desk. I am glad we have been able to put our differences aside and pass such a meaningful bill in the first few weeks of the new year. To be located between 1 st Street, NW, Louisiana Avenue, NW, and C Street, NW, in the District of Columbia, the Peace Corps Memorial Foundation presented its design concept to the CFA and NCPC in early 2019. In March 2019, the CFA approved the memorial's concept design with comments to be addressed as the design moves forward toward a final design. In May 2019, the NCPC stated \"that the proposed concept design does not adequately embrace the site's strengths or adequately respond to these challenges, particularly as they relate to visual resources, visitor use and experience, or natural resources.\" Figure 8 shows the concept design for the Peace Corps Memorial as presented to CFA and NCPC. In November 2001, Congress authorized the Adams Memorial Foundation to \"establish a commemorative work on Federal land in the District of Columbia and its environs to honor former President John Adams, along with his wife Abigail Adams and former President John Quincy Adams, and the family's legacy of public service.\" In remarks during debate on the bill ( H.R. 1668 , 107 th Congress), Representative Joel Hefley summarized the importance of the Adams family to American history: Perhaps no American family has contributed as profoundly to public service as the family that gave the Nation its second President, John Adams; his wife, Abigail Adams; and their son, our sixth President, John Quincy Adams, who was also, by the way, a member of this body. The family's legacy was far reaching, continuing with John Quincy Adams's son, Charles Francis Adams, who was also a member of this body and an ambassador to England during the Civil War; and his son, Henry Adams, an eminent writer and scholar, and it goes on and on. In March 2019, as part of the enactment of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, Congress created the Adams Memorial Commission. The Adams Memorial Commission replaces the Adams Memorial Foundation as the memorial's sponsor. Moving forward, the commission will be responsible for all aspects of the memorial's siting, design, and construction. Previously, in December 2013, the Adams Memorial Foundation's authorization expired. Prior to its lapse of authorization, the Adams Memorial Foundation was working with the NCMAC on the potential recommendation of Area I. While the commission had not endorsed any particular site location, it had recommended that the foundation continue its examination of numerous sites in the District of Columbia in order to find a suitable location. In December 2012, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, Congress authorized the Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation to establish a commemorative work to \"commemorate the sacrifices made by mothers, and made by their sons and daughters who as members of the Armed Forces make the ultimate sacrifice, in defense of the United States.\" In testimony before the House Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, the legislation's ( H.R. 1980 ) sponsor, Representative Jon Runyan, explained why he thought a memorial to Gold Star Mothers was needed: During World War I, mothers of sons and daughters who served in the Armed Forces displayed flags bearing a blue star to represent pride in their sons or daughters and their hope that they would return home safely.  For more than 650,000 of these brave mothers, that hope was shattered, and their children never returned home. Afterwards many of them began displaying flags bearing gold stars to represent the sacrifice that their sons and daughters made in heroic service to our country. Over the years the gold star has come to represent a child who was killed while serving in the Armed Forces, during either war or peacetime. In December 2013, the Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation presented its site analysis to the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission. In that informational presentation, they expressed a preference for a site location adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. In January 2015, the NCPC expressed support for a site next to the Arlington National Cemetery Visitor's Center on Memorial Drive, and the CFA approved that site location. Figure 9 shows the Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation's concept design.  In August 2017, Congress authorized the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia to \"commemorative and honor the members of the Armed Forces that served on active duty in support of the Global War on Terrorism.\" During debate on the bill ( H.R. 873 ) in the House, Representative Tom McClintock, chair of the Federal Lands Subcommittee of the House Committee on Natural Resources, stated why a memorial to the Global War on Terrorism is important, despite a statutory prohibition against war memorials for ongoing conflicts. The Commemorative Works Act requires that a war be ended for at least 10 years before planning can commence on a national memorial. There is good reason for this requirement: it gives history the insight to place the war in an historic context and to begin to fully appreciate its full significance to our country and future generations. But the war on terrorism has been fought in a decidedly different way than our past wars. We are now approaching the 16 th anniversary of the attack on New York and Washington. The veterans who sacrificed so much to keep that war away from our shores deserve some tangible and lasting tribute to their patriotism and altruism while they, their families, and their fellow countrymen can know it. The Gold Star families of our fallen heroes for whom the war will never end deserve some assurance that their sons and daughters will never be forgotten by a grateful Nation. We should remember that many of our Nation's heroes from World War II never lived to see the completion of the World War II Memorial, which was completed 59 years after the end of that conflict. For these reasons, this measure suspends the 10-year period in current law. It doesn't repeal it. It merely sets it aside for the unique circumstances of the current war on terrorism. In October 2018, Congress authorized the National Emergency Medical Services Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia to \"commemorate the commitment and service represented by emergency medical services.\" During House debate on the bill ( H.R. 1037 ), Representative Tom McClintock, chair of the Federal Lands Subcommittee of the House Committee on Natural Resources, stated why he considered a memorial to the emergency medical services providers to be important: Mr. Speaker, each year 850,000 EMS providers answer more than 30 million calls to serve 22 million patients in need at a moment's notice and without reservation. For these heroes who serve on the front lines of medicine, sacrifice is a part of their calling. EMTs and paramedics have a rate of injury that is about three times the national average for all occupations, and some pay the ultimate price in the service of helping others. The men and women of the emergency medical services profession face danger every day to save lives and help their neighbors in crisis. They respond to incidents ranging from a single person's medical emergency to natural and manmade disasters, including terrorist attacks. But while their first responder peers in law enforcement and firefighting have been honored with national memorials, EMS providers have not. Since 1986, six commemorative works authorized by Congress were not completed in the time allowed by the Commemorative Works Act and were not granted subsequent extensions by Congress. These memorials were to be constructed to honor Thomas Paine, Benjamin Banneker, Frederick Douglass, Brigadier General Francis Marion, to create a National Peace Garden, and to build a Vietnam Veterans Visitor Center. The following section describes the initial authorization for each of these memorials and congressional extensions of memorial authorization, if appropriate. In June 1987, Congress authorized the Director of the National Park Service to enter into an agreement with the Peace Garden Project to \"construct a garden to be known as the 'Peace Garden' on a site on Federal land in the District of Columbia to honor the commitment of the people of the United States to world peace.\" In remarks during debate on the bill ( H.R. 191 , 100 th Congress), Representative Steny Hoyer summarized the need for a memorial to peace: No one or nation can ever doubt the commitment of the American people to protecting our freedoms when threatened by foreign aggressors. Our Nation's Capital rightfully honors our heroic defenders of freedom\u2014Americans who served their country courageously, gallantly, and at great risk to their lives. Our citizens have also exhibited an equal commitment for world peace and international law and justice. The creation of a Peace Garden is an appropriate symbol of our efforts to continuing to seek peaceful resolution of world conflict and the institution of the rule of law. Certainly, this century has been one of bloodiest and most violent in man's history. We have seen countless battles, wars, rebellions, massacres, and civil and international strife of all kinds\u2014continuing examples of man's inhumanity toward his fellow man. At the same time, against this terrible backdrop, there have been encouraging strides toward world peace. As we honor those who have made sacrifices in war, through monuments, so, too, should we honor them by striving to ensure that the world they have left us will be a peaceful one. A garden would be a living monument to our efforts. In 1988, a site was approved for the Peace Garden at Hains Point in Southwest Washington, DC. Since its initial authorization in 1987, the National Peace Garden was reauthorized twice. The authorization expired on June 30, 2002. In October 1992, Congress authorized the Thomas Paine National Historical Association to establish a memorial to honor Revolutionary War patriot Thomas Paine. In remarks summarizing the need for a memorial to Thomas Paine, Representative William Lacy Clay stated: Thomas Paine's writings were a catalyst of the American Revolution. His insistence upon the right to resist arbitrary rule has inspired oppressed peoples worldwide, just as it continues to inspire us. It is time that a grateful nation gives him a permanent place of honor in the capital of the country he helped build. Since its initial authorization in 1992, the authorization for the Thomas Paine memorial was extended once. Authorization for the memorial expired on December 31, 2003. In November 1998, Congress authorized the Washington Interdependence Council of the District of Columbia to establish a memorial to \"honor and commemorate the accomplishments of Mr. Benjamin Banneker.\" Adopted as part of a larger bill to create a national heritage area in Michigan, the authorization for the Benjamin Banneker Memorial passed the House and Senate without debate and by voice vote in October. In 2001, the National Park Service reported that the memorial was to be sited on the L'Enfant Promenade in Southwest Washington and be under the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia.  Since its initial authorization, the Washington Interdependence Council has not been granted an extension to its original authorization, which expired in 2005. A bill ( S. 3886 ) was introduced in the 111 th Congress (2009-2010) to reauthorize a Benjamin Banneker Memorial. S. 3886 was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, but no further action was taken. In November 2000, Congress authorized the Frederick Douglass Gardens, Inc., \"to establish a memorial and gardens on lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior in the District of Columbia or its environs in honor and commemoration of Frederick Douglass.\" During debate, Representative James Hansen provided a summary of why a memorial to Frederick Douglass was important: Mr. Speaker, Frederick Douglass was one of the most prominent leaders of the 19 th century abolitionist movement. Born into slavery in eastern Maryland in 1818, Douglass escaped to the North as a young man where he became a world-renowned defender of human rights and eloquent orator, and later a Federal ambassador and advisor to several Presidents. Frederick Douglass was a powerful voice for human rights during the important period of American history, and is still revered today for his contributions against racial injustice. Early in 2001, the Frederick Douglass Memorial Gardens, Inc., expressed its preference for a site location near the Douglass Memorial Bridge in Southeast Washington, but no further action was taken by Congress to approve the site location. The Frederick Douglass Memorial's authorization expired in 2008. One attempt was made to reauthorize a Frederick Douglass Memorial during the 110 th Congress (2007-2008), but the bill was not reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources. In May 2008, Congress authorized the Marion Park Project to establish a commemorative work to honor Brigadier General Francis Marion. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Subcommittee on National Parks, Daniel N. Wenk, deputy director for operations, National Park Service, supported the enactment of legislation authorizing a Brigadier General Francis Marion Memorial and explained why such a memorial meets criteria for commemoration in the District of Columbia. Brigadier General Francis Marion commanded the Williamsburg Militia Revolutionary force in South Carolina and was instrumental in delaying the advance of British forces by leading his troops in disrupting supply lines. He is credited for inventing and applying innovative battle tactics in this effort, keys to an ultimate victory for the American Colonies in the Revolutionary War. Additionally Brigadier General Marion's troops are believed to have been the first racially integrated force fighting for the United States. The Marion Park Project identified its preferred site location for the memorial at Marion Park in southeast Washington, DC. In December 2014, the National Capital Planning Commission expressed its support for the Marion Park site. Since its initial authorization, the Marion Memorial was reauthorized once. Authorization for the memorial expired on May 8, 2018. In November 2003, Congress authorized the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund to create a visitor center at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to \"better inform and educate the public about the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Vietnam War.\" In the House report accompanying the legislation ( H.R. 1442 , 108 th Congress), the Committee on Resources summarized the need for a visitor center at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial: Since its dedication in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, known to many as simply \"The Wall,\" has done much to heal the nation's wounds after the bitterly divisive experience of the Vietnam War. For those who served, that year marked a sea change in the country's view of the Vietnam veteran. Americans began to understand and respect the Vietnam veterans' service and sacrifice. Today, over 4.4 million people visit The Wall every year\u2014making it the most visited Memorial in the Nation's Capital. Today, most visitors to The Wall were not alive during the \"Vietnam Era.\" Many veterans' organizations and many others believe today's visitor is shortchanged in his/her experience. Many leave The Wall not fully understanding its message. To that end, a visitor center would provide an educational experience for visitors by facilitating self-guided tours, collecting and displaying remembrances of those whose names are inscribed on the Memorial, and displaying exhibits discussing the history of the Memorial and the Vietnam War. The visitor's center would eventually replace a 168-foot National Park Service kiosk currently at the site. The visitor center was to be constructed underground and located across the street from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. In 2015, the NCPC and CFA approved the visitor center's design. On September 21, 2018, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund announced their intenti on not to seek an extension to its authorization to build the visitor center, which expired on November 17, 2018. At that time, legislation had been introduced, but not considered, to extend the fund's authorization into 2022. Previously, the fund had received two statutory extensions. "
