FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Association of School Nurses identifies \n        schools as primary locations to address student health issues, \n        since a school nurse is the health care provider that many \n        students see on the most regular basis.\n            (2) The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes the \n        crucial role of school nurses in the seamless provision of \n        comprehensive health services to children and youth, as well as \n        in the development of a coordinated school health program.\n            (3) The school nurse functions as a leader and the \n        coordinator of the school health services team, facilitating \n        access to a medical home for each child and supporting academic \n        achievement.\n            (4) School nurses promote wellness and disease prevention \n        to improve health outcomes for our Nation's children. In \n        addition, school nurses perform early intervention services \n        such as periodic assessments for vision, hearing, and dental \n        problems, in an effort to remove barriers to learning.\n            (5) The American Federation of Teachers has called for a \n        nurse in every school, as nurses are front-line workers that \n        address an array of health needs and their presence in a school \n        can help to improve student learning.\n            (6) National data indicate only 45 percent of public \n        schools have a school nurse all day, every day, while another \n        30 percent of schools have a school nurse who only works part-\n        time in one or more schools.\n            (7) The National Association of School Nurses has reported \n        that medication administration to students is one of the most \n        common health-related activities performed in school. As more \n        chronically ill and medically unstable children enter the \n        school system each year, the medical factors that promote and \n        support their academic success increase, including the need for \n        medications that enhance overall health or stabilize chronic \n        conditions.\n            (8) Statistics from the National Center for Education \n        Statistics indicate that 15 to 18 percent of the 52,000,000 \n        students who currently spend their day in school have a chronic \n        health condition.\n            (9) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, \n        students today face increased social and emotional issues, \n        which enhance the need for preventive services and \n        interventions for acute and chronic health issues. School \n        nurses are actively engaged members of school-based mental \n        health teams and spend nearly 32 percent of their time \n        providing mental health services, including universal and \n        targeted interventions, screenings to identify early warning \n        signs and provide referrals to medical providers, and crisis \n        planning.\n            (10) In 2013, the Bureau of the Census reported 7.6 percent \n        of children under the age of 19, which equals 78,000,000 \n        children under the age of 19, were without health insurance. \n        Data show that uninsured children achieve lower educational \n        outcomes than those with health coverage. Children who cannot \n        afford to see a medical provider miss more days of school, \n        experience increased severity of illness, and suffer from \n        disparities in health.\n            (11) More than 1,600,000 children experience homelessness \n        each year in the United States. Homeless children develop \n        increased rates of acute and chronic health conditions, and the \n        stress of their living situation can negatively affect their \n        development and ability to learn. As a result, schools have \n        become the primary access to health care for many children and \n        adolescents. School nurses serve on the front lines as a safety \n        net for the Nation's most vulnerable children.\n            (12) Communicable and infectious diseases account for \n        millions of school days lost each year. Data illustrate that \n        when students have access to a registered nurse in school, \n        immunization rates increase.\n            (13) A 2011 study showed that a school nurse in the \n        building saves principals, teachers, and clerical staff a \n        considerable amount of time that they would have spent \n        addressing health concerns of students, including saving \n        principals almost an hour a day, saving teachers almost 20 \n        minutes a day, and saving clerical staff more than 45 minutes a \n        day. This would amount to a savings of about 13 hours per day \n        in the aggregate for such school personnel.\n\nSEC. 3.
