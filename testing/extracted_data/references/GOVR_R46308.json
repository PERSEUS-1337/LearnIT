    "content": "According to a 2019 study, 2 million Americans lack access to running water, indoor plumbing, or wastewater services. Many of the communities with inadequate water supply infrastructure are in rural areas or on tribal lands. Over time, Congress has authorized projects and programs through various federal agencies to address rural water supply needs. Since 1980, Congress has authorized the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), among other federal agencies, to develop municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply projects in rural areas and on tribal lands.  Reclamation was established to implement the Reclamation Act of 1902, which authorized the construction of water works to provide water for irrigation in arid western states. Reclamation owns and manages 491 dams and 338 reservoirs, which are capable of storing a combined 140 million acre-feet of water. Reclamation has incorporated M&I water resource projects into larger projects that serve various other authorized purposes (e.g., irrigation, power). Reclamation-funded M&I water deliveries total approximately 10 trillion gallons of water per year. As part of Reclamation's M&I responsibilities, Congress has expressly authorized the agency to undertake the design and construction of rural water supply projects intended to deliver potable water supplies to defined rural communities. From 1980 through 2009, Congress authorized Reclamation to undertake the design and construction, and in some cases the operations and maintenance (O&M), of specific projects intended to deliver potable water supplies to rural communities in western Reclamation states. These projects were largely located in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and New Mexico. The rural communities include tribal reservations and nontribal rural communities with nonexistent, substandard, or declining water supply or water quality. Many rural water projects are large in scope\u00e2\u0080\u0094taking water from one location and moving it long distances to tie to existing systems. M&I portions of Reclamation water supply facilities typically require 100% repayment of construction costs to the federal treasury with interest. Congress also has authorized rural water projects that receive funding from the federal government for some or all costs on a nonreimbursable basis (i.e., a de facto grant). For example, the federal government pays up to 100% of the cost of tribal rural water supply projects, including O&M. For nontribal rural water supply projects, the federal cost share for current projects ranges from 75% to 80%. The Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 (Title I of P.L. 109-451 ) created the Rural Water Supply Program, a structured program for developing and recommending rural water supply projects. This program was to replace the previous process of authorizing projects individually\u00e2\u0080\u0094often without the level of analysis and review (e.g., feasibility studies) consistent with Reclamation's other projects. Under the Rural Water Supply Program, Congress authorized Reclamation to work with rural communities and tribes to identify M&I water needs and options to address such needs through appraisal investigations and feasibility studies. Congress would then consider feasibility studies recommended by the Administration before authorizing specific projects for construction in legislation. Ultimately, Congress did not authorize any projects for construction through this process, and the authority for the program expired in 2016.  Reclamation continues to construct rural water projects (and to provide O&M assistance for some tribal components) that were authorized and initiated outside of the Rural Water Supply Program. In 2012, Reclamation developed prioritization criteria for budgeting these projects:  inclusion of tribal components amount of financial resources committed urgency and severity of need financial need and potential economic impact regional and watershed approach water, energy, and other priority objectives  According to Reclamation, the criteria aim to reflect both the priorities identified in the statutes that authorized individual projects and the goals of the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006. For FY2020, Congress appropriated $145.1 million for construction and O&M at seven authorized rural water projects, which was $117.4 million above the Administration's FY2020 budget request. As of early 2020, Reclamation reported that $1.2 billion was still needed to construct authorized, ongoing rural water projects. For FY2021, the Administration requested $30.3 million for Reclamation rural water activities, of which $8.1 million is for construction. This report provides an overview of Reclamation rural water projects, including completed and ongoing rural projects and efforts under Reclamation's Rural Water Supply Program. The report also discusses considerations for Congress (e.g., funding prioritization, potential nexus with other federal programs) and presents recent legislation relating to authorizing additional projects and reauthorizing the Rural Water Supply Program.  Congress has funded water supply projects in rural areas for more than four decades. Reclamation first became involved in these efforts beginning with authorization of the WEB Rural Water Supply Project in 1980 ( P.L. 96-355 ). Since that time, Congress has authorized Reclamation to fund the construction of several other rural water supply projects (see Table 1 ). These projects have individual authorizations and generally aim to provide water exclusively for M&I water uses in rural areas\u00e2\u0080\u0094a departure from the historical mission of providing water for irrigation, with M&I water use as an incidental project purpose. According to a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, Reclamation became involved in such projects because communities proposed projects directly to Congress and, in response, Congress created specific authorizations for these rural water supply projects, with Reclamation overseeing funding and construction. In addition to projects authorized only in Reclamation states, Congress specifically authorized Reclamation's involvement in the Lewis and Clark Rural Water Supply Project located in South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. Reclamation reported that, prior to authorization, some rural water projects did not go through the level of analysis and review that is consistent with Reclamation's other projects and did not meet the economic, environmental, and design standards that are required to determine the feasibility of federal water resources development projects. In these instances, following authorization, Reclamation was to complete the analysis that was necessary to execute the project while adhering to the project configuration and designs specified by the authorizing statutes and in accordance with other laws (e.g., Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a71251-1387], National Environmental Policy Act [42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a74321 et seq.]). Critics have sometimes expressed concerns over this approach\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically, whether the authorized project would have emerged as the most cost-effective preferred alternative had a feasibility study been performed prior to authorization.  Each rural water project authorization required that the cost ceilings authorized in the legislation be indexed to adjust for inflation to include the rising cost of materials and labor, which was estimated to be 4% annually. The result of these indexing requirements is that the overall cost of authorized rural water projects has risen and continues to rise due in part to actual federal appropriations for projects falling short of the optimal funding scenarios that were assumed under planning projections. As of early 2020, Reclamation reported that $1.2 billion was needed to construct authorized, ongoing rural water projects. For FY2021, the Administration's budget proposal requested $30.3 million: $8.1 million for ongoing construction at four authorized rural water projects and $22.2 million for O&M of tribal systems (e.g., $14.5 million for the Mni Wiconi Project, $7.7 million for the Garrison Diversion Unit M&I, and $20,000 for the Mid-Dakota Rural Water System). The FY2021 request is $114.8 million less than FY2020 enacted funding of $145.1 million. The FY2021 request continues a trend since FY2014 in which the President's budget requested reduced funding for rural water projects from prior-year enacted levels. Reclamation also has emphasized its authority to accept nonfederal contributions in excess of cost-sharing requirements as one way to expedite projects in the absence of increased federal funding. In the FY2021 budget request, Reclamation noted that nonfederal parties have the ability to move forward with important investments in water resources infrastructure by contributing amounts in excess of minimum contributions.  In FY2020, Reclamation funded $125.4 million in construction work at five projects ( Table 2 ). Reclamation's FY2020 budget request included $8.0 million in construction for four projects, but Congress provided $117.4 million in appropriations above the President's budget request. The Administration distributed the funds above the request among five authorized projects, as described in Reclamation's additional funding spend plan. The following briefly describes the projects under construction in FY2020 based on Reclamation budget documents. The Garrison Diversion Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri-Basin Program was authorized in 1965 (P.L. 89-108) and was amended in 1986 by the Garrison Diversion Unit Reformulation Act ( P.L. 99-294 ) to include rural water services. Garrison Diversion Unit water supply facilities are associated with Garrison Dam of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. They are located in eight counties in the central and eastern part of North Dakota and serve four tribal reservations (Spirit Lake, Fort Berthold, Turtle Mountain, and Standing Rock Indian Reservations). The multipurpose project principally provides tribal and nontribal M&I water, along with fish and wildlife, recreation, and flood control benefits.  The Fort Peck Reservation Rural Water System Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-382 ), as amended, authorized rural water projects in northeastern Montana for the Fort Peck Reservation, serving the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes, and for the Dry Prairie Rural Water Authority, serving towns outside of the reservation. The total service area population is around 25,000 people; rural water use is also available for commercial users and livestock. Currently, groundwater from shallow alluvial aquifers is the primary water source for the municipal systems, but groundwater quality is generally poor. The regional rural water project is to provide for a single water treatment plant located on the Missouri River, which is to distribute up to 13.6 million gallons of treated water per day through 3,200 miles of pipeline.  The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 2000 (Division B, Title IV of P.L. 106-246 ) authorized the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System to serve over 300,000 people in southeast South Dakota, southwest Minnesota, and northwest Iowa. The project aims to address concerns regarding low water quality, contamination, and insufficient supplies of existing drinking water sources throughout the project area. The water source for the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System is the sand and gravel aquifers of the Missouri River near Vermillion, SD. The project is to collect, treat, and distribute water through a network of wells, pipelines, pump stations, and storage reservoirs to each of 15 municipalities (including the city of Sioux Falls) and five rural systems. As of February 2020, completed facilities delivered water to the first 14 of 20 members, serving more than 200,000 individuals in Iowa, Minnesota, and South Dakota. The Rocky Boy's/North Central Montana Regional Water System Act of 2002 (Title IX of P.L. 107-331 ) authorized a rural water system to serve the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation (Chippewa Cree Tribe) and surrounding communities in northern Montana. The system is designed to serve a total projected population of 43,000 (14,000 on reservation and 29,000 off reservation) by providing infrastructure to ensure existing water systems within the project service area comply with federal Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7300f-300j-26) regulations. A core pipeline is to provide potable water from Tiber Reservoir to the Rocky Boy's Reservation, and non-core pipelines are to serve 21 surrounding towns and rural water districts. A $20 million trust fund established with Bureau of Indian Affairs appropriations is to fund O&M and replacement for the core and on-reservation systems initially; eventually, water users are expected to entirely fund the project. Reclamation states that the current authorization is not adequate to cover the project. Section 9103 of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-11 ) authorized the Eastern New Mexico Water Supply project to deliver water from Ute Reservoir on the Canadian River to eight member communities. The use of Ute Reservoir water aims to provide long-term water supply and reduce the eight communities' dependence on groundwater in the Ogallala Aquifer. Current funding is for planning, design, and construction of interim projects to deliver groundwater to the communities before treated surface water is delivered from the Ute Reservoir Pipeline. The Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 (Title I of P.L. 109-451 ) authorized the Rural Water Supply Program and directed the Secretary of the Interior to undertake certain activities to implement the program. Specifically, the act directed Reclamation to conduct appraisal investigations and feasibility studies (or to ensure that nonfederal entities conducted such studies) and to recommend proposed projects to Congress for construction authorization and subsequent funding. In 2008, Reclamation published an interim final rule (43 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7404) that established operating criteria for the program and defined the criteria for the prioritization, eligibility, and evaluation of appraisal investigations and feasibility studies, in accordance with the act. To be eligible under the rule, a rural community must have a population under 50,000. The rule prioritized domestic, residential, and municipal uses and prohibited the use of water for commercial irrigation purposes. Interested entities (e.g., Reclamation states and western tribes) may request that either (1) Reclamation complete an appraisal investigation or feasibility study or (2) Reclamation provide financial assistance so the entity can conduct an appraisal investigation or feasibility study.  Reclamation began to implement the Rural Water Supply Program in FY2010 on a pilot basis, providing assistance to nonfederal entities to conduct appraisal investigations and feasibility studies. Between FY2009 and FY2012, Congress provided Reclamation a total of $7.9 million for the program. After FY2012, Reclamation no longer requested funding for the program and Congress did not appropriate funds for it. Overall, Reclamation reported using this authority to study approximately 22 projects to varying extents (see Appendix ). Twelve were located in the Reclamation's Great Plains region, five in the Upper Colorado region, four in the Lower Colorado region, and one in the Pacific Northwest region. Of these, Reclamation finalized and approved two feasibility reports: the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System Feasibility Report (Montana) and the Payson-Cragin Reservoir Water Supply Project Feasibility Report (Arizona). Reclamation did not recommend these or any other projects for authorization, and Congress did not authorize any projects. In justifying its lack of construction recommendations, Reclamation pointed to existing rural water construction obligations, which it argued precluded recommendation of new projects with completed feasibility studies.  The authority for the Rural Water Supply Program expired at the end of FY2016 and has not been renewed. Members of Congress have introduced legislation in the 116 th Congress that would reauthorize both the Rural Water Supply Program and particular projects and studies previously considered through the expired program (see \" Legislation in the 116th Congress \"). Congress continues to fund construction and O&M (only required for tribal components) of authorized rural water projects; however, since the FY2016 expiration of the Rural Water Supply Program, Reclamation has for the most part ceased activities relating to new project study and authorization. Congress may consider conducting oversight or legislating changes to Reclamation's rural water activities, including those related to existing or new program and project authorizations, funding prioritization criteria, and Reclamation's role in supporting rural water projects.  The Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 required the Secretary of the Interior to assess the demand for new rural water supply projects in Reclamation states. In FY2009, Reclamation estimated that identified needs for potable water supply systems in rural areas ranged from $5 billion to $8 billion for nontribal needs; in the same year, it estimated approximately $1.2 billion for specific tribal water supply projects. However, the Administration has not recommended, and Congress has not authorized, any new Reclamation rural water projects since 2009. Additionally, because authorization of Reclamation's Rural Water Supply Program lapsed at the end of FY2016, Reclamation lacks a structured program for developing and recommending rural water supply projects.  In the 116 th Congress, House and Senate companion bills H.R. 967 and S. 334 , both titled the Clean Water for Rural Communities Act, would authorize $5 million for a feasibility study for the Dry Redwater Rural Water System and $56.7 million (2014 price levels) for construction of the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System. As noted, a feasibility report for the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System was completed through Reclamation's Rural Water Supply Program, but the Administration did not recommend the project to Congress for authorization.  Congress also is considering legislation to reauthorize the Rural Water Supply Program through FY2026. In the 116 th Congress, both the Water Justice Act ( H.R. 4033 ) and the Securing Access for the Central Valley and Enhancing (SAVE) Water Resources Act ( H.R. 2473 ) would reauthorize the existing program.  Congress may consider other legislative proposals to address the demand for rural water assistance in the West. For example, the Disadvantaged Community Drinking Water Assistance Act ( H.R. 5347 ) would require the Secretary of the Interior to establish a grant program to provide financial assistance to disadvantaged communities of less than 60,000 residents that have experienced a significant decline in quantity or quality of drinking water. The grants could fund technical assistance, initial operating and capital costs for edible facilities, and up to 25% of such facilities' O&M. Other legislative proposals would address rural water needs by amending authorities to specific water technology and programs. For example, the Western Water Security Act of 2019 ( H.R. 4891 ) would amend the Water Desalination Act of 1996, as amended ( P.L. 104-298 ; 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a710301 note), to add a classification for rural desalination projects with a higher federal cost share than desalination projects serving more than 40,000 individuals. In early 2020, Reclamation stated that $1.2 billion was needed to complete authorized rural water projects under construction by the agency. In addition, Reclamation has previously estimated nontribal rural water supply needs in excess of $5 billion, and some observers have reported that assistance for communities is needed to address these needs. Some stakeholders have requested continued and increased funding for Reclamation rural water projects. In the 115 th Congress, representatives of the National Water Resources Association and the Family Farm Alliance asked Congress to compel Reclamation and the Office of Management and Budget to implement the Rural Water Supply Program and investigate opportunities to develop loan and loan guarantee programs that can help fund new water infrastructure projects. Over the years, Reclamation has provided its views regarding funding for rural water projects. In general, Reclamation has testified that rural water projects must compete with a long list of other priorities, including aging infrastructure, environmental compliance and restoration actions, and dam safety. During the consideration of authorizing existing rural water projects, Reclamation stated that long-standing agency policy was that local sponsors, particularly those that are nontribal, should reimburse Reclamation for 100% of the costs incurred for rural water supply from multipurpose projects. Reclamation notes in its budget requests to Congress that constrained federal budgets do not preclude nonfederal sponsors' ability to move forward with rural water projects by funding in excess of the minimum nonfederal contributions. Reclamation has recommended that tribes, where possible, and other project beneficiaries be responsible for the O&M expenses of their rural water projects.  Congress has appropriated funds for rural water projects on a nonreimbursable basis (i.e., as de facto grants). In some cases, local and tribal sponsors do not have funds or have not prioritized funds to increase their funding contributions. Should Congress continue to support rural water projects through Reclamation, Congress may consider various options. These might include Continue to provide Reclamation annual appropriations for the agency to allocate funds to individually authorized rural water projects based on established agency criteria. Establish mandatory funding for Reclamation to allocate funds to individually authorized rural water projects based on established agency criteria. For example, the Authorized Rural Water Projects Completion Act ( S. 1556 ) in the 115 th Congress would have created a Reclamation Rural Water Construction Account to receive $80 million annually that otherwise would be deposited into the Reclamation Fund. Funds in the Reclamation Rural Water Construction Account, in addition to amounts appropriated for rural water projects, would be available for the construction of authorized rural water projects. Provide grant funding through a competitive process for nonfederal sponsors to support local projects, such as the grant program the Disadvantaged Community Drinking Water Assistance Act ( H.R. 5347 ) would establish for communities with fewer than 60,000 residents. Direct appropriations to individually authorized rural water projects.  As GAO noted in a 2007 report, numerous federal entities provide funding for water supply and wastewater projects. In addition to Reclamation (which funds only water supply projects), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Department of Commerce (DOC) all provide funding for both water supply and wastewater projects. USDA, EPA, HUD, and DOC have formal, nationwide programs with standardized eligibility criteria and processes under which communities compete for funding. In contrast, Reclamation and USACE fund water projects in defined geographic locations under explicit congressional authorizations. According to GAO, Congress has chosen Reclamation to fill a void for projects that are larger and more complex than other rural water projects and that do not meet the criteria of other rural water programs. Some might argue that these projects would be better accomplished via other existing federal water quality or water supply programs. However, as GAO has observed, as designed, some of Reclamation's authorized rural water projects do not fit criteria of other agency's programs due to their cost and regional focus; thus, project proponents have looked to Reclamation for funding. For example, Reclamation may assist rural areas with populations in excess of 10,000 residents that may not be eligible for funding under other programs. Reclamation rural water projects also may serve more than one community (i.e., a regional area, as opposed to a single area). Reclamation developed its Rural Water Supply Program with the intent to complement, rather than duplicate, the efforts of the other agencies' programs and activities. In creating the program, Reclamation signed memoranda of understanding and related documents with other agencies to coordinate efforts. Reclamation has stated that it participates in a variety of broad coordination activities among agencies related to ongoing authorized projects. With the expiration of the Rural Water Supply Program, this formal coordination between Reclamation and other agencies' programs is no longer required. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) provided the Congressional Research Service with a list of appraisal investigations and feasibility studies conducted for potential projects under the Rural Water Supply Program. Before the program authorization expired in FY2016, 22 appraisal investigations were conducted, with nine recommendations for a feasibility study. Five feasibility studies were conducted. Reclamation did not recommend any projects for construction funding, although two studies found feasible alternatives for rural water supply. Reclamation issued concluding reports for appraisal investigations and feasibility studies of projects that were not recommended for construction funding. Reclamation provided a range of reasons for issuing concluding reports: studies being incomplete, no found feasible alternatives, lack of funding, and program expiration. According to Reclamation, some concluding reports were not issued due to a lack of time or resources. In these cases, Reclamation considered the appraisal reports as concluding reports for the purposes of the Rural Water Supply Program. A feasibility report for the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System was completed through Reclamation's Rural Water Supply Program. Legislation introduced in the 116 th congress, the Clean Water for Rural Communities Act ( H.R. 967 and S. 334 ), would authorize the Central Montana Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System. "
