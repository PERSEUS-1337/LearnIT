FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Overdoses from opioids have increased dramatically in \n        the United States.\n            (2) Deaths from drug overdose, largely from prescription \n        pain relievers, have tripled among men and increased fivefold \n        among women over the past decade.\n            (3) Nationwide, drug overdoses now claim more lives than \n        car accidents.\n            (4) Death from heroin and other opioid overdoses can be \n        prevented if the person who overdosed is timely administered an \n        opioid overdose drug.\n            (5) Medical personnel as well as non-medical personnel can \n        be trained to administer opioid overdose drugs safely and \n        effectively.\n            (6) Several States, including Massachusetts, have \n        established programs allowing for the administration of opioid \n        overdose drugs by non-medical personnel, and those programs \n        have saved lives.\n            (7) The willingness of medical and non-medical personnel to \n        administer opioid overdose drugs may be deterred by potential \n        civil liability, and the willingness of physicians to prescribe \n        opioid overdose drugs to persons other than a patient may also \n        be deterred by potential civil liability.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save the lives of \npeople who intentionally or inadvertently overdose on heroin or other \nopioids by providing certain protections from civil liability with \nrespect to the emergency administration of opioid overdose drugs.\n\nSEC. 3.
