TEMPORARY PROHIBITION AGAINST REVISING ANY NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR \n              QUALITY STANDARD APPLICABLE TO COARSE PARTICULATE MATTER.\n\n    Before the date that is one year after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may \nnot propose, finalize, implement, or enforce any regulation revising \nthe national primary ambient air quality standard or the national \nsecondary ambient air quality standard applicable to particulate matter \nwith an aerodynamic diameter greater than 2.5 micrometers under section \n109 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7409).\n\nSEC. 3. NUISANCE DUST.\n\n    Part A of title I of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 132. REGULATION OF NUISANCE DUST PRIMARILY BY STATE, TRIBAL, AND \n              LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), this Act \ndoes not apply to, and references in this Act to particulate matter are \ndeemed to exclude, nuisance dust.\n    ``(b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect to any \ngeographic area in which nuisance dust is not regulated under State, \ntribal, or local law insofar as the Administrator, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, finds that--\n            ``(1) nuisance dust (or any subcategory of nuisance dust) \n        causes substantial adverse public health and welfare effects at \n        ambient concentrations; and\n            ``(2) the benefits of applying standards and other \n        requirements of this Act to nuisance dust (or such subcategory \n        of nuisance dust) outweigh the costs (including local and \n        regional economic and employment impacts) of applying such \n        standards and other requirements to nuisance dust (or such \n        subcategory).\n    ``(c) Definition.--In this section--\n            ``(1) the term `nuisance dust' means particulate matter \n        that--\n                    ``(A) is generated primarily from natural sources, \n                unpaved roads, agricultural activities, earth moving, \n                or other activities typically conducted in rural areas;\n                    ``(B) consists primarily of soil, other natural or \n                biological materials, or some combination thereof;\n                    ``(C) is not emitted directly into the ambient air \n                from combustion, such as exhaust from combustion \n                engines and emissions from stationary combustion \n                processes; and\n                    ``(D) is not comprised of residuals from the \n                combustion of coal; and\n            ``(2) the term `nuisance dust' does not include radioactive \n        particulate matter produced from uranium mining or \n        processing.''.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency should implement an approach to \nexcluding so-called ``exceptional events'', or events that are not \nreasonably controllable or preventable, from determinations of whether \nan area is in compliance with any national ambient air quality standard \n(NAAQS) applicable to coarse particulate matter that--\n            (1) maximizes transparency and predictability for States, \n        tribes, and local governments; and\n            (2) minimizes the regulatory and cost burdens States, \n        tribes, and local governments bear in excluding such events.\n\nSEC. 5. IMPACTS OF EPA REGULATORY ACTIVITY ON EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC \n              ACTIVITY IN THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY.\n\n    (a) Analysis of Impacts of Actions on Employment and Economic \nActivity in the Agriculture Community.--\n            (1) Analysis.--Before taking a covered action, the \n        Administrator shall analyze the impact, disaggregated by State, \n        of the covered action on--\n                    (A) employment levels in the agriculture industry; \n                and\n                    (B) agricultural economic activity, including \n                estimated job losses and decreased economic activity \n                related to agriculture.\n            (2) Economic models.--\n                    (A) In general.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the \n                Administrator shall utilize the best available economic \n                models.\n                    (B) Annual gao report.--Not later than December 31 \n                of each year, the Comptroller General of the United \n                States shall submit to Congress a report on the \n                economic models used by the Administrator to carry out \n                this subsection.\n            (3) Availability of information.--With respect to any \n        covered action, the Administrator shall--\n                    (A) post the analysis under paragraph (1) as a link \n                on the main page of the public Internet Web site of the \n                Environmental Protection Agency;\n                    (B) request the Secretary of Agriculture to post \n                the analysis under paragraph (1) as a link on the main \n                page of the public Internet Web site of the Department \n                of Agriculture; and\n                    (C) request that the Governor of any State \n                experiencing more than a de minimis negative impact \n                post such analysis in the Capitol of such State.\n    (b) Public Hearings.--\n            (1) In general.--If the Administrator concludes under \n        subsection (a)(1) that a covered action will have more than a \n        de minimis negative impact on agricultural employment levels or \n        agricultural economic activity in a State, the Administrator \n        shall hold a public hearing in each such State at least 30 days \n        prior to the effective date of the covered action.\n            (2) Time, location, and selection.--A public hearing \n        required under paragraph (1) shall be held at a convenient time \n        and location for impacted residents. In selecting a location \n        for such a public hearing, the Administrator shall give \n        priority to locations in the State that will experience the \n        greatest number of job losses.\n    (c) Notification.--If the Administrator concludes under subsection \n(a)(1) that a covered action will have more than a de minimis negative \nimpact on agricultural employment levels or agricultural economic \nactivity in any State, the Administrator shall give notice of such \nimpact to the State's Congressional delegation, Governor, and \nLegislature at least 45 days before the effective date of the covered \naction.\n    (d) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Covered action.--The term ``covered action'' means any \n        of the following actions taken by the Administrator under the \n        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) relating to agriculture \n        and the national primary ambient air quality standard or the \n        national secondary ambient air quality standard for particulate \n        matter:\n                    (A) Issuing a regulation, policy statement, \n                guidance, response to a petition, or other requirement.\n                    (B) Implementing a new or substantially altered \n                program.\n            (3) More than a de minimis negative impact.--The term \n        ``more than a de minimis negative impact'' means the following:\n                    (A) With respect to employment levels, a loss of \n                more than 100 jobs related to the agriculture industry. \n                Any offsetting job gains that result from the \n                hypothetical creation of new jobs through new \n                technologies or government employment may not be used \n                in the job loss calculation.\n                    (B) With respect to economic activity, a decrease \n                in agricultural economic activity of more than \n                $1,000,000 over any calendar year. Any offsetting \n                economic activity that results from the hypothetical \n                creation of new economic activity through new \n                technologies or government employment may not be used \n                in the economic activity calculation.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives December 8, 2011.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                                                 Clerk.\n                                                       "
