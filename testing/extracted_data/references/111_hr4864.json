REVIEW OF STATE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH PLANS.\n\n    Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. \n668) is amended--\n            (1) by amending subsection (f) to read as follows:\n    ``(f)(1) The Secretary shall, on the basis of reports submitted by \nthe State agency and the Secretary's own inspections, make a continuing \nevaluation of the manner in which each State that has a plan approved \nunder this section is carrying out such plan. Such evaluation shall \ninclude an assessment of whether the State continues to meet the \nrequirements of subsection (c) of this section and any other criteria \nor indices of effectiveness specified by the Secretary in regulations. \nWhenever the Secretary finds, on the basis of such evaluation, that in \nthe administration of the State plan there is a failure to comply \nsubstantially with any provision of the State plan (or any assurance \ncontained therein), the Secretary shall make an initial determination \nof whether the failure is of such a nature that the plan should be \nwithdrawn or whether the failure is of such a nature that the State \nshould be given the opportunity to remedy the deficiencies, and provide \nnotice of the Secretary's findings and initial determination.\n    ``(2) If the Secretary makes an initial determination to reassert \nand exercise concurrent enforcement authority while the State is given \nan opportunity to remedy the deficiencies, the Secretary shall afford \nthe State an opportunity for a public hearing within 15 days of such \nrequest, provided that such request is made not later than 10 days \nafter Secretary's notice to the State. The Secretary shall review and \nconsider the testimony, evidence, or written comments, and not later \nthan 30 days following such hearing, make a determination to affirm, \nreverse, or modify the Secretary's initial determination to reassert \nand exercise concurrent enforcement authority under sections 8, 9, 10, \n13, and 17 with respect to standards promulgated under section 6 and \nobligations under section 5(a). Following such a determination by the \nSecretary, or in the event that the State does not request a hearing \nwithin the time frame set forth in this paragraph, the Secretary may \nreassert and exercise such concurrent enforcement authority, while a \nfinal determination is pending under paragraph (3) or until the \nSecretary has determined that the State has remedied the deficiencies \nas provided under paragraph (4). Such determination shall be published \nin the Federal Register. The procedures set forth in section 18(g) \nshall not apply to a determination by the Secretary to reassert and \nexercise such concurrent enforcement authority.\n    ``(3) If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the plan \nshould be withdrawn, the Secretary shall provide due notice and the \nopportunity for a hearing. If based on the evaluation, comments, and \nevidence, the Secretary makes a final determination that there is a \nfailure to comply substantially with any provision of the State plan \n(or any assurance contained therein), he shall notify the State agency \nof the withdrawal of approval of such plan and upon receipt of such \nnotice such plan shall cease to be in effect, but the State may retain \njurisdiction in any case commenced before the withdrawal of the plan in \norder to enforce standards under the plan whenever the issues involved \ndo not relate to the reasons for the withdrawal of the plan.\n    ``(4) If the Secretary makes a determination that the State should \nbe provided the opportunity to remedy the deficiencies, the Secretary \nshall provide the State an opportunity to respond to the Secretary's \nfindings and the opportunity to remedy such deficiencies within a time \nperiod established by the Secretary, not to exceed 1 year. The \nSecretary may extend and revise the time period to remedy such \ndeficiencies, if the State's legislature is not in session during this \n1 year time period, or if the State demonstrates that it is not \nfeasible to correct the deficiencies in the time period set by the \nSecretary, and the State has a plan to correct the deficiencies within \na reasonable time period. If the Secretary finds that the State agency \nhas failed to remedy such deficiencies within the time period specified \nby the Secretary and that the State plan continues to fail to comply \nsubstantially with a provision of the State plan, the Secretary shall \nwithdraw the State plan as provided for in paragraph (3).''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(i) Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this \nsubsection, and every 5 years thereafter, the Comptroller General shall \ncomplete and issue a review of the effectiveness of State plans to \ndevelop and enforce safety and health standards to determine if they \nare at least as effective as the Federal program and to evaluate \nwhether the Secretary's oversight of State plans is effective. The \nComptroller General's evaluation shall assess--\n            ``(1) the effectiveness of the Secretary's oversight of \n        State plans, including the indices of effectiveness used by the \n        Secretary;\n            ``(2) whether the Secretary's investigations in response to \n        Complaints About State Plan Administration (CASPA) are \n        adequate, whether significant policy issues have been \n        identified by headquarters and corrective actions are fully \n        implemented by each State;\n            ``(3) whether the formula for the distribution of funds \n        described in section 23(g) to State programs is fair and \n        adequate;\n            ``(4) whether State plans are as effective as the Federal \n        program in preventing occupational injuries, illnesses and \n        deaths, and investigating discrimination complaints, through an \n        evaluation of at least 20 percent of approved State plans, and \n        which shall cover--\n                    ``(A) enforcement effectiveness, including handling \n                of fatalities, serious incidents and complaints, \n                compliance with inspection procedures, hazard \n                recognition, verification of abatement, violation \n                classification, citation and penalty issuance, \n                including appropriate use of willful and repeat \n                citations, and employee involvement;\n                    ``(B) inspections, the number of programmed health \n                and safety inspections at private and public sector \n                establishments, and whether the State targets the \n                highest hazard private sector work sites and facilities \n                in that State;\n                    ``(C) budget and staffing, including whether the \n                State is providing adequate budget resources to hire, \n                train and retain sufficient numbers of qualified staff, \n                including timely filling of vacancies;\n                    ``(D) administrative review, including the quality \n                of decisions, consistency with Federal precedence, \n                transparency of proceedings, decisions and records are \n                available to the public, adequacy of State defense, and \n                whether the State appropriately appeals adverse \n                decisions;\n                    ``(E) antidiscrimination, including whether \n                discrimination complaints are processed in a timely \n                manner, whether supervisors and investigators are \n                properly trained to investigate discrimination \n                complaints, whether a case file review indicates merit \n                cases are properly identified consistent with Federal \n                policy and procedure, whether employees are notified of \n                their rights, and whether there is an effective process \n                for employees to appeal the dismissal of a complaint;\n                    ``(F) program administration, including whether the \n                State's standards and policies are at least as \n                effective as the Federal program and are updated in a \n                timely manner, and whether National Emphasis Programs \n                that are applicable in such States are adopted and \n                implemented in a manner that is at least as effective \n                as the Federal program;\n                    ``(G) whether the State plan satisfies the \n                requirements for approval set forth in this section and \n                its implementing regulations; and\n                    ``(H) other such factors identified by the \n                Comptroller General, or as requested by the Committee \n                on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives \n                or the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n                Pensions of the Senate.''."
