FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the National Center for Education \n        Statistics, over the next 10 years, the United States will need \n        more than 2,000,000 new teachers to replace the teachers who \n        are retiring or leaving the classroom for other careers.\n            (2) The Hart-Rudman National Security Report on education \n        recommended that the President direct the Department of \n        Education to work with the States to devise a comprehensive \n        plan to avert a looming shortage of high-quality teachers.\n            (3) According to the National Center for Education \n        Statistics, 20 percent of all new teachers leave the teaching \n        profession within 3 years. Providing loan forgiveness or loan \n        cancellation is one step that would help retain high-quality \n        teachers in schools that need teachers.\n            (4) The American Hospital Association has reported more \n        than 126,000 unfilled registered nurse positions in hospitals \n        in the United States. Additionally, the vacancy rate for \n        registered nurse positions at nursing homes throughout the \n        Nation is approaching 20 percent.\n            (5) College loans are more of a burden than ever for \n        students and families. According to a recent United States \n        Public Interest Research Group report, average student loan \n        debt almost doubled from $9,200 in 1992-1993 to $16,928 in \n        1999-2000.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve access to, and \nthe delivery of, high-quality educational and health services \nthroughout the United States by reducing the shortage of qualified \nteachers and nurses.\n\nSEC. 3. LOAN FORGIVENESS AND CANCELLATION.\n\n    (a) Loan Forgiveness.--Section 428J of the Higher Education Act of \n1965 (20 U.S.C. 1078-10) is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 428J.
