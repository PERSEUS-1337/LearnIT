FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly every industrialized nation other than the \n        United States, and most developing nations, provide parents \n        with paid leave for infant care.\n            (2)(A) Parents' interactions with their infants have a \n        major influence on the physical, cognitive, and social \n        development of the infants; and\n            (B) optimal development of an infant depends on a strong \n        attachment between an infant and the infant's parents.\n            (3) Nearly two-thirds of employees, who need to take family \n        or medical leave, but do not take the leave, report that they \n        cannot afford to take the leave.\n            (4) Although some employees in the United States receive \n        wage replacement during periods of family or medical leave, the \n        benefit of wage replacement is not shared equally in the \n        workforce, as demonstrated by the fact that--\n                    (A) employees with less education and lower income \n                are less likely to receive wage replacement than \n                employees with more education and higher salaries; and\n                    (B) female employees, employees from racial \n                minority groups, and younger employees are slightly \n                less likely to receive wage replacement than male \n                employees, white employees, and older employees, \n                respectively.\n            (5) In order to cope financially with taking family or \n        medical leave, of persons taking that leave without full wage \n        replacement--\n                    (A) 40 percent cut their leave short;\n                    (B) 39 percent put off paying bills;\n                    (C) 25 percent borrowed money; and\n                    (D) 9 percent obtained public assistance.\n            (6) Taking family or medical leave often drives employees \n        earning low wages into poverty, and 21 percent of such low-wage \n        employees who take family or medical leave without full wage \n        replacement resort to public assistance.\n            (7) Studies document shortages in the supply of infant \n        care, and that the shortages are expected to worsen as welfare \n        reform measures are implemented.\n            (8) Compared to 30 years ago, families have experienced an \n        average decrease of 22 hours per week in time that parents \n        spend with their children.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish a demonstration program that supports the \n        efforts of States and political subdivisions to provide partial \n        or full wage replacement, often referred to as FIRST insurance, \n        to new parents so that the new parents are able to spend time \n        with a new infant or newly adopted child, and to other \n        employees; and\n            (2) to learn about the most effective mechanisms for \n        providing the wage replacement assistance.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Labor, acting after consultation with the Secretary of \n        Health and Human Services.\n            (2) Son or daughter; state.--The terms ``son or daughter'' \n        and ``State'' have the meanings given the terms in section 101 \n        of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2611).\n\nSEC. 5.
