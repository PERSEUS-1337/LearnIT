DEFINITION OF PESTICIDE CHEMICAL UNDER FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND \n              COSMETIC ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 201(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(q)) is amended by striking ``(q)(1)'' and \nall that follows through the end of subparagraph (1) and inserting the \nfollowing:\n    ``(q)(1)(A) Except as provided in clause (B), the term `pesticide \nchemical' means any substance that is a pesticide within the meaning of \nthe Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, including all \nactive and inert ingredients of such pesticide. Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law, the term `pesticide' within such meaning \nincludes ethylene oxide and propylene oxide when such substances are \napplied on food.\n    ``(B) In the case of the use, with respect to food, of a substance \ndescribed in clause (A) to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate \nmicroorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, algae, \nand slime), the following applies for purposes of clause (A):\n        ``(i) The definition in such clause for the term `pesticide \n    chemical' does not include the substance if the substance is \n    applied for such use on food, or the substance is included for such \n    use in water that comes into contact with the food, in the \n    preparing, packing, or holding of the food for commercial purposes. \n    The substance is not excluded under this subclause from such \n    definition if the substance is ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, \n    and is applied for such use on food. The substance is not so \n    excluded if the substance is applied for such use on a raw \n    agricultural commodity, or the substance is included for such use \n    in water that comes into contact with the commodity, as follows:\n            ``(I) The substance is applied in the field.\n            ``(II) The substance is applied at a treatment facility \n        where raw agricultural commodities are the only food treated, \n        and the treatment is in a manner that does not change the \n        status of the food as a raw agricultural commodity (including \n        treatment through washing, waxing, fumigating, and packing such \n        commodities in such manner).\n            ``(III) The substance is applied during the transportation \n        of such commodity between the field and such a treatment \n        facility.\n        ``(ii) The definition in such clause for the term `pesticide \n    chemical' does not include the substance if the substance is a food \n    contact substance as defined in section 409(h)(6), and any of the \n    following circumstances exist: The substance is included for such \n    use in an object that has a food contact surface but is not \n    intended to have an ongoing effect on any portion of the object; \n    the substance is included for such use in an object that has a food \n    contact surface and is intended to have an ongoing effect on a \n    portion of the object but not on the food contact surface; or the \n    substance is included for such use in or is applied for such use on \n    food packaging (without regard to whether the substance is intended \n    to have an ongoing effect on any portion of the packaging). The \n    food contact substance is not excluded under this subclause from \n    such definition if any of the following circumstances exist: The \n    substance is applied for such use on a semipermanent or permanent \n    food contact surface (other than being applied on food packaging); \n    or the substance is included for such use in an object that has a \n    semipermanent or permanent food contact surface (other than being \n    included in food packaging) and the substance is intended to have \n    an ongoing effect on the food contact surface.\nWith respect to the definition of the term `pesticide' that is \napplicable to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, \nthis clause does not exclude any substance from such definition.''.\n    (b) Regulations.--Section 408(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a(j)) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing paragraph:\n        ``(4) Certain substances.--With respect to a substance that is \n    not included in the definition of the term `pesticide chemical' \n    under section 201(q)(1) but was so included on the day before the \n    date of the enactment of the Antimicrobial Regulation Technical \n    Corrections Act of 1998, the following applies as of such date of \n    enactment:\n            ``(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), any regulation \n        applying to the use of the substance that was in effect on the \n        day before such date, and was on such day deemed in such \n        paragraph to have been issued under this section, shall be \n        considered to have been issued under section 409.\n            ``(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), any regulation \n        applying to the use of the substance that was in effect on such \n        day and was issued under this section (including any such \n        regulation issued before the date of the enactment of the Food \n        Quality Protection Act of 1996) is deemed to have been issued \n        under section 409.''.\n    (c) Technical Amendment.--Section 201(q)(3) of the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(q)(3)) is amended in the matter \npreceding clause (A) by striking ``paragraphs (1) and (2)'' and \ninserting ``subparagraphs (1) and (2)''.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
