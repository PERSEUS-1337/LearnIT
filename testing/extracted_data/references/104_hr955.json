FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION PRECLUDED.\n\n    This Act does not provide the district courts of the United States \nwith jurisdiction over product liability actions based on section 1331 \nor 1337 of title 28, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 3. APPLICABILITY AND PREEMPTION.\n\n    (a) Preemption.--This Act governs any product liability action \nbrought in any State or Federal court against a manufacturer or product \nseller, on any theory for harm caused by a product. A product liability \naction brought against a manufacturer or product seller for commercial \nloss shall be governed only by applicable commercial or contract law.\n    (b) Relationship to State Law.--This Act supersedes State law only \nto the extent that State law applies to an issue covered by this Act. \nAny issue that is not governed by this Act shall be governed by \notherwise applicable State or Federal law.\n    (c) Applicability.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to--\n            (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n        asserted by any State under any law;\n            (2) supersede any Federal law, except the Federal Employers \n        Compensation Act and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' \n        Compensation Act;\n            (3) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n        asserted by the United States;\n            (4) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 \n        of title 28, United States Code;\n            (5) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to \n        claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign \n        nation;\n            (6) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n        apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a \n        foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the \n        ground of inconvenient forum; or\n            (7) supersede any Federal law that prescribes a specific \n        regimen for punitive damages.\n\nSEC. 4. LIABILITY RULES APPLICABLE TO PRODUCT SELLERS.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in any \nproduct liability action, a product seller other than a manufacturer \nshall be liable to a claimant only if the claimant establishes that--\n            (1)(A) the product which allegedly caused the harm \n        complained of was sold by the product seller; (B) the product \n        seller failed to exercise reasonable care with respect to the \n        product; and (C) such failure to exercise reasonable care was a \n        proximate cause of the claimant's harm; or\n            (2)(A) the product seller made an express warranty \n        applicable to the product which allegedly caused the harm \n        complained of, independent of any express warranty made by a \n        manufacturer as to the same product; (B) the product failed to \n        conform to the warranty; and (C) the failure of the product to \n        conform to the warranty caused the claimant's harm; or\n            (3) the product seller engaged in intentional wrongdoing as \n        determined under applicable State law and such intentional \n        wrongdoing was a proximate cause of the harm complained of by \n        the claimant.\nFor purposes of subparagraph (1)(B), a product seller shall not be \nconsidered to have failed to exercise reasonable care with respect to \nthe product based upon an alleged failure to inspect a product where \nthere was no reasonable opportunity to inspect the product in a manner \nwhich would, in the exercise of reasonable care, have revealed the \naspect of the product which allegedly caused the claimant's harm.\n    (b) Exception.--In a product liability action, a product seller \nshall be liable for harm to the claimant caused by such product as if \nthe product seller were the manufacturer of such product if--\n            (1) the manufacturer is not subject to service of process \n        under the laws of any State in which the action might have been \n        brought; or\n            (2) the court determines that the claimant would be unable \n        to enforce a judgment against the manufacturer.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFENSE BASED ON CLAIMANT'S USE OF INTOXICATING ALCOHOL OR \n              DRUGS.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--In any product liability action, it shall be a \ncomplete defense to such action if--\n            (1) the claimant was intoxicated or was under the influence \n        of intoxicating alcohol or any drug; and\n            (2) the claimant, as a result of the influence of the \n        alcohol or drug, was more than 50 percent responsible for the \n        accident or event which resulted in such claimant's harm.\n    (b) Construction.--For purposes of this section--\n            (1) the determination of whether a person was intoxicated \n        or was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or any drug \n        shall be made pursuant to applicable State law; and\n            (2) the term ``drug'' means any controlled substance as \n        defined in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(6)) \n        that has been taken by the claimant other than in accordance \n        with the terms of a lawfully issued prescription.\n\nSEC. 6. SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n    In any product liability action, the liability of each defendant \nfor noneconomic loss shall be several only and shall not be joint. Each \ndefendant shall be liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss \nattributable to such defendant in direct proportion to such defendant's \nproportionate share of fault or responsibility for the claimant's harm, \nas determined by the trier of fact.\n\nSEC. 7. STATUTE OF REPOSE.\n\n    A product liability action shall be barred unless the complaint is \nserved and filed within 15 years after the time of delivery of the \nproduct. For the purposes of this section, the term ``time of \ndelivery'' means the time when a product is delivered to its first \npurchaser or lessee who was not involved in the business of \nmanufacturing or selling such product or using it as a component part \nof another product to be sold. This section applies only if the harm \ncaused by a product did not include chronic illness and only to claims \narising after the date of enactment of this Act. This section does not \naffect the provisions of the General Aviation Revitalization Act of \n1994.\n\nSEC. 8. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by \napplicable State law, be awarded in any product liability action in any \nFederal or State court against a defendant if the claimant establishes \nby clear and convincing evidence that the harm suffered was result of \nconduct specifically intended to cause harm or conduct manifesting a \nconscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of those persons who \nmight be harmed by the product for which the action was brought.\n    (b) Proportional Awards.--The amount of punitive damages that may \nbe awarded for a claim in any product liability action subject to this \nAct shall not exceed 3 times the amount of damages awarded to the \nclaimant for the economic loss on which such claim is based, or \n$250,000, whichever is greater. This provision shall be applied by the \ncourt and shall not be disclosed to the jury.\n    (c) Applicability and Preemption.--Except as provided in section 2, \nthis section shall apply to any product liability action brought in any \nFederal or State court on any theory where punitive damages are sought. \nThis section does not create a cause of action for punitive damages in \nany jurisdiction that does not authorize such actions.\n    (d) Bifurcation at Either Party's Request.--At the request of \neither party, the trier of fact shall consider in a separate proceeding \nwhether punitive damages are to be awarded and the amount of such \naward. If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to \nthe claim of punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, \nshall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether \ncompensatory damages are to be awarded.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) The term ``claimant'' means any person who brings a \n        product liability action and any person on whose behalf such an \n        action is brought.
