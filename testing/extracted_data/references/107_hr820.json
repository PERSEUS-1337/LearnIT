    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Employment Dispute \nResolution Act of 2001 (NEDRA)''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The prohibitive costs and emotional toll of litigation \n        as well as the growing backlog of employment civil rights \n        claims and lawsuits has impeded the protection and enforcement \n        of workplace civil rights.\n            (2) Mediation is an economical, participatory, and \n        expeditious alternative to traditional, less cooperative \n        methods of resolving employment disputes.\n            (3) Mediation enables disputants to craft creative \n        solutions and settlements, surpassing the reach of traditional \n        remedies, thereby possibly protecting the continuity of the \n        employment relationship.\n            (4) As we enter the new millennium, a national program of \n        directed or required participation in mediation where any \n        settlement is voluntary mandated mediation for certain \n        employment and contract disputes, will help fulfill the goal of \n        equal opportunity in work and business places of the United \n        States.\n            (5) Overt and subtle discrimination still exists in our \n        society and in the workplace.\n            (6) Overt and subtle forms of discrimination cause \n        substantial measurable economic and noneconomic costs to \n        employers and the American workforce, create a barrier to fully \n        realizing equal opportunity in the workplace, and are contrary \n        to public policy promoting equal opportunity in the workplace.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish a fair and effective alternative means by \n        which employees and covered employers may have an increased \n        likelihood of resolving both alleged overt and subtle forms or \n        acts of discrimination without the necessity of the employee \n        taking some form of legal action against the employer,\n            (2) in accordance with the various public policies \n        encouraging the use of mediation, to make mediation available \n        at an early stage of an employment dispute, thus--\n                    (A) possibly reducing economic and noneconomic \n                costs,\n                    (B) preserving the employment relationship and \n                decreasing acrimony, and\n                    (C) decreasing the filing of a number of formal \n                discrimination complaints, charges, and lawsuits and \n                further burdening our public justice system, and\n            (3) to provide that the participation in mediation shall \n        not preclude either the employee-disputant or covered employer-\n        disputant from having access to the public justice system.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964.\n\n    (a) Federal Employees.--Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n(42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) in section 706(a) by inserting after the 7th sentence \n        the following:\n``Regardless of whether the Commission makes an investigation under \nthis subsection, the Commission shall provide counseling services \nregarding, and endeavor to responsibly address and resolve, claims of \nunlawful discrimination using certified contract mediators.'', and\n            (2) in section 711(a) by adding at the end the following:\n``Every employer, employment agency, and labor organization shall \nprovide to each employee and each member, individually, a copy of the \nmaterials required by this section to be so posted.''.\n    (b) Office of Federal Contract Compliance.--Section 718 of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-17) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a)'' after ``Sec. 718'', and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance shall endeavor to \nresponsibly address and resolve any alleged discrimination using \nmediation with respect to which this section applies.\n    ``(c) An employer who establishes, implements an approved internal \nconflict management program or system providing the use of a certified \nmediator participates in mediation under this section shall be given \npreferred status in contract bidding for additional and for maintaining \ncurrent Federal Government contracts.\n    ``(d) An employer who is a party to a Government contract or the \nagency of the United States shall assume the costs of mediation under \nthis section, including the fees of the mediator and any travel and \nlodging expenses of the employee, if such travel exceeds 25 miles, one \nway. Any settlement shall include, among other things, any appropriate \nand reasonable attorney fees.\n    ``(e) Retaliation by an employer who is a party to a Government \ncontract or the agency of the United States, or the destruction of \nevidence, shall result in the imposition of appropriate civil or \ncriminal sanctions. The participation in mediation shall be at the \noption of the employee. The participation in mediation shall not \npreclude the employee's access to any State, local, or Federal EEO \nenforcement agency or any State or Federal court.\n    ``(f) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance shall have \nauthority over employers who are parties to Government contracts that \nfail to comply with this section. Failure to comply shall result in the \nloss of a current Government contract and disqualification from \nconsideration for future Government contracts.\n    ``(g) No resolution by the disputants may contravene the provisions \nof a valid collective bargaining agreement between an employer who is a \npart to a Government contract and a labor union or certified bargaining \nrepresentative. Any voluntary settlement outcome and agreement may not \nbe in conflict with the collective bargaining agreement.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
