FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Forested lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest \n        Service and Bureau of Land Management in California have grown \n        into a state of unnatural density and structure.\n            (2) Overgrown forest conditions, in combination with \n        continued drought and other climatic circumstances, have left \n        these forests at extreme risk to insects, disease, and \n        catastrophic wildfire.\n            (3) The risk of catastrophic wildfire presents a very real \n        threat to the health and safety of individuals and communities \n        in the wildland-urban interface as well as to the property of \n        adjacent private landowners.\n            (4) The catastrophic, stand-replacing fires that are \n        occurring with increasing frequency as a result of the forest \n        conditions described in paragraph (2), pose a threat to the \n        health of lands, watersheds, wildlife, air quality and the \n        environment.\n            (5) Local communities and interests are willing to work \n        collaboratively to assure seamless protection from catastrophic \n        wildfire and to improve forest health across public and private \n        lands.\n            (6) The Federal Government, particularly the Forest Service \n        and Bureau of Land Management, must address these conditions at \n        the appropriate annual pace and scale needed across the \n        landscape to have a substantial impact in reducing natural \n        disturbances.\n\nSEC. 3.
