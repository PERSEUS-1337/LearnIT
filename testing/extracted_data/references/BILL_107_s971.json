FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Oral and general health are inseparable, and good \n        dental care is critical to our overall physical health and \n        well-being.\n            (2) Although oral health in America has improved \n        dramatically over the last 50 years, these improvements have \n        not occurred evenly across all sectors of our population, \n        particularly among low-income individuals and families and \n        people living in underserved areas.\n            (3) According to the United States Surgeon General, an \n        estimated 25,000,000 Americans live in areas lacking adequate \n        dental care services, and as many as 11 percent of our Nation's \n        rural population has never been to a dentist.\n            (4) This access problem is exacerbated by the fact that our \n        dental workforce is aging: more than 20 percent of dentists \n        will retire in the next 10 years, and the number of dental \n        graduates by 2015 may not be enough to replace these retirees. \n        Although dentists have significantly increased their \n        productivity, there are still distribution problems in specific \n        geographic areas.\n            (5) Our Nation's dental school faculty is also aging. With \n        retirement being the leading indicator, faculty shortage issues \n        face United States dental schools with approximately 400 \n        current vacancies for unfilled, budgeted positions. United \n        States dental schools play an important role in improving \n        access to care to underserved populations.\n            (6) While the National Health Service Corps has placed more \n        than 20,000 health care providers in some of America's most \n        difficult-to-place inner city, rural, and frontier communities, \n        the current funding levels for this program do not begin to \n        meet the need in these underserved communities for physical, \n        oral, and mental and behavioral health care services and should \n        be substantially increased.\n            (7) According to the United States Surgeon General, the \n        number of dentists and dental hygienists with obligations to \n        serve in the National Health Service Corps falls far short of \n        meeting the total identified need: only about 6 percent of the \n        dental need in designated underserved areas is currently being \n        met by this program, and outreach and development are critical \n        to future opportunities for strengthening the dental workforce \n        in designated dental health professional shortage areas.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPANDING AVAILABILITY OF DENTAL SERVICES.\n\n    Part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n254b et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                  ``Subpart X--Primary Dental Programs\n\n``SEC. 340F.
