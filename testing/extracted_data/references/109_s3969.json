FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the number of children suffering from lead poisoning \n        remains unacceptably high;\n            (2) children younger than 6 years of age are much more \n        likely to suffer the devastating effects of lead poisoning;\n            (3) the health of children may be impacted at lower levels \n        of lead exposure than previously thought;\n            (4) lead poisoning can lead to organ damage, as well as \n        serious developmental, learning, and behavioral problems in \n        children;\n            (5) owners and managers of childcare and pre-school \n        facilities constructed before 1978 need guidance with respect \n        to protecting children of the United States from exposure to \n        lead; and\n            (6) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency has the authority, but, as of the date of enactment of \n        this Act, has elected not, to promulgate regulations pursuant \n        to section 402 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. \n        2682) to reduce lead exposure in child-occupied facilities.\n\nSEC. 3.
