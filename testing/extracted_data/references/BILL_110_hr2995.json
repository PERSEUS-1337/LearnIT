FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the defects in the United States civil justice system \n        have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by \n        decreasing the availability of goods and services in commerce;\n            (2) the spiraling costs of litigation and the magnitude and \n        unpredictability of punitive damage awards and noneconomic \n        damage awards have continued unabated for at least the past 30 \n        years;\n            (3) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n        that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the \n        award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate \n        interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence of \n        unlawful conduct;\n            (4) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly \n        excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some circumstances \n        for a party to be held responsible under the doctrine of joint \n        and several liability for damages that party did not cause;\n            (5) as a result of joint and several liability, entities \n        including small businesses are often brought into litigation \n        despite the fact that their conduct may have little or nothing \n        to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to the \n        lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust costs due \n        to the possibility or result of unfair and disproportionate \n        damage awards;\n            (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n        costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing \n        insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their \n        activities; and\n            (7) legislation to address these concerns is an appropriate \n        exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses 3, 9, and 18 \n        of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n        States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
