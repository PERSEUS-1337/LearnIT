    "content": "Americans spend more than $1 trillion on food each year, nearly half of it in restaurants, schools, and other places outsid e the home. Federal laws give food manufacturers, distributors, and retailers the basic responsibility for assuring that foods are wholesome, safe, and handled under sanitary conditions. A number of federal agencies, cooperating with state, local, and international entities, play a major role in regulating food quality and safety under these laws.  The combined efforts of the food industry and the regulatory agencies often are credited with making the U.S. food supply among the safest in the world. Nonetheless, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that each year an estimated one in six Americans\u2014a total of 48 million people\u2014becomes sick from contaminated food foodborne illnesses caused by contamination from any one of a number of microbial pathogens. Of these, an estimated 128,000 cases require hospitalization and 3,000 cases result in death. In addition, experts have cited numerous other hazards to health, including the use of unapproved veterinary drugs, pesticides, and other dangerous substances in food commodities, of particular concern at a time when a growing share of the U.S. food supply is from overseas sources. These concerns, combined with the ongoing recurrence of major food safety-related incidents, have heightened public and media scrutiny of the U.S. food safety system and magnified congressional interest in the issue.  Numerous federal, state, and local agencies share responsibilities for regulating the safety of the U.S. food supply. Federal responsibility for food safety rests primarily with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). FDA is responsible for ensuring that all domestic and imported food products\u2014except for most meats and poultry\u2014are safe, nutritious, wholesome, and accurately labeled. FDA also has oversight of all seafood, fish, and shellfish products. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulates most meat and poultry and some egg and fish products. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified as many as 15 federal agencies, including FDA and FSIS, as collectively administering at least 30 laws related to food safety. Appendix A and Appendix B provide a brief comparative look at each of these agencies and their responsibilities. State and local food safety authorities collaborate with federal agencies for inspection and other food safety functions, and they regulate retail food establishments. This organizational complexity, and trends in U.S. food markets\u2014for example, increasing imports as a share of U.S. food consumption and increasing consumption of fresh, often unprocessed, foods\u2014pose ongoing challenges to ensuring food safety. The text box below provides a comparison of FDA and USDA and other federal agencies' responsibilities for food safety and related food quality and other requirements. The division of food safety responsibility between FDA and USDA is rooted in the early history of U.S. food regulation. Congress created separate statutory frameworks when it enacted, in 1906, both the Pure Food and Drugs Act and the Meat Inspection Act. The former addressed the widespread marketing of intentionally adulterated foods, and its implementation was assigned to USDA's Bureau of Chemistry. The latter law addressed unsafe and unsanitary conditions in meat packing plants, and implementation was assigned to the USDA's Bureau of Animal Industry. This bifurcated system has been perpetuated and split further into additional food safety activities under additional agencies (for example, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and others) by a succession of statutes and executive directives. The separation of the two major food safety agencies was further reinforced when, in 1940, the President moved responsibilities for safe foods and drugs, other than meat and poultry, from USDA to the progenitor of HHS, the Federal Security Agency. Meat inspection remained in USDA. There has been discussion over time regarding whether this dispersal of food safety responsibilities has been problematic, or whether a reorganization would divert time and attention from other fundamental problems in the system. Figure 1 shows this history by providing a timeline of selected important dates for food safety in the United States. Over the years, GAO has published a series of reports highlighting how food safety oversight in the United States is fragmented and recommending broad restructuring of the nation's food safety system. These GAO reports document examples where a number of federal agencies are responsible for some aspect of food safety or product quality, resulting in split agency jurisdiction for some foods. Limited coordination and sharing of information results in often overlapping and/or duplication of efforts. Similar observations are noted in a series of food safety studies by the National Research Council (NRC) and Institute of Medicine (IOM). The NRC/IOM studies further recommend that the core federal food safety responsibilities should reside within a single entity/agency; have a unified administrative structure, clear mandate, and dedicated budget; and maintain full responsibility for oversight of the entire U.S. food supply. FDA has primary responsibility for the safety of most (about 80%-90%) of all U.S. domestic and imported foods. The FDA is responsible for ensuring that all domestic and imported food products\u2014except for most meats and poultry\u2014are safe, nutritious, wholesome, and accurately labeled. Examples of FDA-regulated foods are produce, dairy products, and processed foods. FDA also has oversight of all seafood and shellfish products, and most fish products (except for catfish). FDA has jurisdiction over meats from animals or birds that are not under the regulatory jurisdiction of FSIS. FDA shares some responsibility for the safety of eggs with FSIS. FDA has jurisdiction over establishments that sell or serve eggs or use them as an ingredient in their products.  As described in a memorandum of understanding between FDA and FSIS: FDA is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301, et seq .), the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201, et seq .), the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1451 et seq .), and parts of the Egg Products Inspection Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71031 et seq .]. In carrying out its responsibilities under these acts, FDA conducts inspections of establishments that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods, with the exception of certain establishments that are regulated exclusively by FSIS. FDA also inspects vehicles and other conveyances, such as boats, trains, and airplanes, in which foods are transported or held in interstate commerce. In addition, the 111 th Congress passed comprehensive food safety legislation with the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA, P.L. 111-353 ), amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). FSMA was the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s. FSMA did not directly address meat and poultry products under USDA's jurisdiction. New rules governing FDA's food inspection regime of both domestic and imported foods under the agency's jurisdiction are now being implemented. For more information, see CRS Report R43724, Implementation of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA, P.L. 111-353) . In the Washington, DC, area, two FDA offices are the focal point for food safety-related activities. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is responsible for (1)\u00a0conducting and supporting food safety research; (2) developing and overseeing enforcement of food safety and quality regulations; (3) coordinating and evaluating FDA's food surveillance and compliance programs; (4) coordinating and evaluating cooperating states' food safety activities; and (5) developing and disseminating food safety and regulatory information to consumers and industry. FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is responsible for ensuring that all animal drugs, feeds (including pet foods), and veterinary devices are safe for animals, are properly labeled, and produce no human health hazards when used in food-producing animals. The FDA also cooperates with over 400 state agencies across the nation to carry out a wide range of food safety regulatory activities. However, the state agencies are primarily responsible for actual inspection. FDA works with the states to set the safety standards for food establishments and commodities and evaluates the states' performance in upholding such standards as well as any federal standards that may apply. FDA also contracts with states to use their food safety agency personnel to carry out certain field inspections in support of FDA's own statutory responsibilities. FSIS regulates the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of most domestic and imported meat and poultry and their products sold for human consumption, comprising roughly 10%-20% of the U.S. food supply. As described in a memorandum of understanding between FDA and FSIS, FSIS's jurisdiction is as follows: FSIS is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601, et seq .), the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451, et seq .), and parts of the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031, et seq .). In carrying out its responsibilities under these acts, FSIS places inspectors in meat and poultry slaughterhouses and in meat, poultry, and egg processing plants. FSIS also conducts inspections of warehouses, transporters, retail stores, restaurants, and other places where meat, poultry, and egg products are handled and stored. In addition, FSIS conducts voluntary inspections under the Agriculture Marketing Act (7 U.S.C. 1621, et seq .). The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) of 1906, as amended, requires USDA to inspect all cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines slaughtered and processed for human consumption. The Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) of 1957, as amended, gives USDA the authority to inspect poultry meat. The PPIA mandates USDA inspection of any domesticated birds (chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, guineas, ratites [ostrich, emu, and rhea], and squab (pigeons up to one month old]) intended for use as human food. The Egg Products Inspection Act, as amended, provides USDA authority to inspect liquid, frozen, and dried egg products. Each of these laws contains provisions governing USDA's authority to label food products under its jurisdiction. Under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 as amended, USDA's FSIS may provide voluntary inspection for buffalo, antelope, reindeer, elk, migratory waterfowl, game birds, and rabbits. This type of inspection is performed by FSIS on a fee-for-service basis. However, these meat and poultry species are still within the purview of FDA under FFDCA, whether or not inspected under the voluntary FSIS program. FDA has jurisdiction over meat products from such species in interstate commerce, even if they bear the USDA inspection mark. FDA also has jurisdiction over shell eggs. In addition, the 2008 farm bill requires that FSIS inspect and grade farmed catfish products. Meat and poultry animals and products undergo continuous (i.e., 100%) inspection, which may in turn act as a deterrent to fraud in some cases. FSIS inspects all meat and poultry animals to look for signs of disease, contamination, and other abnormal conditions, both before and after slaughter (\"antemortem\" and \"postmortem,\" respectively), on a continuous basis\u2014meaning that no animal may be slaughtered and dressed unless an inspector has examined it. One or more federal inspectors are on the line during all hours the plant is operating. Processing plants visited once every day by an FSIS inspector are considered to be under continuous inspection in keeping with the laws. Inspectors monitor operations, check sanitary conditions, examine ingredient levels and packaging, review records, verify food safety plans, and conduct statistical sampling and testing of products for pathogens and residues during their inspections.  FSIS is responsible for certifying that foreign meat and poultry plants are operating under an inspection system equivalent to the U.S. system before they can export their product to the United States. Meat and poultry imports are 100% visually inspected (process-based, documentation, labeling), although physical inspections of imports may be more random. FSIS conducts evaluations of foreign meat safety programs and visits establishments to determine whether they are providing a level of safety equivalent to that of U.S. safeguards. No foreign plant can ship meat or poultry to the United States unless its country has received such an FSIS determination. Twenty-seven states operate their own meat and/or poultry inspection programs. FSIS is statutorily responsible for ensuring that the states' programs are at least equal to the federal program. Plants processing meat and poultry under state inspection can market their products only within the state. If a state chooses to discontinue its own inspection program, or if FSIS determines that it does not meet the agency's equivalency standards, FSIS must assume the responsibility for inspection if the formerly state-inspected plants are to remain in operation. FSIS also has cooperative agreements with more than two dozen states under which state inspection personnel are authorized to carry out federal inspection in meat and/or poultry plants. Products from these plants may travel in interstate commerce. CDC is responsible for (1) monitoring, identifying, and investigating foodborne disease problems to determine the contributing factors; (2) working with FDA, FSIS, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), state and local public health departments, universities, and industry to develop control methods; and (3) evaluating the effect of control methods. CDC's \"FoodNet\" is a collaborative project with the FDA and USDA to improve data collection on foodborne illness outbreaks. FoodNet includes active surveillance of clinical microbiology laboratories to obtain a more accurate accounting of positive test results for foodborne illness; a physician survey to determine testing and laboratory practices; population surveys to identify illnesses not reported to doctors; and research studies to obtain new and more precise information about which food items or other exposures may cause diseases. FoodNet data allow CDC to have a clearer picture of the incidence and causes of foodborne illness and to establish baseline data against which to measure the success of changes in food safety programs. The Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7201, et seq .) provides legislative authority for CDC's food safety-related activities. Although the FDA is the primary agency responsible for ensuring the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of domestic and imported seafood products, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, conducts, on a fee-for-service basis, a voluntary seafood inspection and grading program that focuses on marketing and quality attributes of U.S. fish and shellfish. The primary legislative authority for NMFS's inspection program is the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71621 et seq .). NMFS has approximately 160 seafood safety and quality inspectors, and inspection services are funded with user fees. NMFS works with FDA, which helps provide training and other technical assistance to NMFS. Under the program, NMFS inspects a reported 20% of the seafood consumed in the United States. EPA has the statutory responsibility for ensuring that the chemicals used on food crops do not endanger public health. EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is the part of the agency that (1)\u00a0registers new pesticides and determines residue levels for regulatory purposes; (2) performs special reviews of pesticides of concern; (3) reviews and evaluates all the health data on pesticides; (4) reviews data on pesticides' effects on the environment and on other species; (5)\u00a0analyzes the costs and benefits of pesticide use; and (6) interacts with EPA regional offices, state regulatory counterparts, other federal agencies involved in food safety, the public, and others to keep them informed of EPA regulatory actions. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7136 et seq. ), and FFDCA, as amended (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7301 et seq. ), are the primary authorities for EPA's activities in this area. USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is responsible for establishing quality and marketing grades and standards for many foods (including dairy products, fruits and vegetables, livestock, meat, poultry, seafood, and shell eggs) and for certifying quality programs and conducting quality grading services. Accordingly, AMS is primarily responsible for ensuring product quality and not food safety . USDA programs establishing quality grade standards to encourage uniformity and consistency in commercial practices are provided for under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. \u00a71621). AMS also administers the Pesticide Data Program (PDP), a cooperative federal-state residue testing program through which it collects data on residual pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and growth regulators in over 50 different commodities. The pesticides and commodities to be tested each year are chosen based on EPA data needs and on information about the types and amounts foods consumed, in particular, by infants and children. Authorization for the program is under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7301 et seq. ).  Among the other agencies that play a role in food safety, USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) performs food safety research in support of FSIS's inspection program. It has scientists working in animal disease bio-containment laboratories in Plum Island, NY, and Ames, IA. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) indirectly protects the nation's food supply through programs to protect plant and animal resources from domestic and foreign pests and diseases, such as brucellosis and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow\" disease). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to coordinate many food security activities, including at U.S. borders. Historically, federal funding and staffing levels between FDA and FSIS have been disproportionate to their respective responsibilities for addressing food safety activities. Although FSIS is responsible for roughly 10%-20% of the U.S. food supply, it has received about 60% of the two agencies' combined food safety budget. Although FDA has been responsible for 80%-90% of the U.S. food supply, a few years ago it received about 40% of the combined budget for federal food safety activities ( Table 1 ). Staffing levels also have varied considerably among the two agencies: FSIS staff numbered around 9,400 FTEs in FY2010, while FDA staff working on food-related activities numbers about 3,400 FTEs.  In recent years, however, the balance of overall funding for food safety between FDA and USDA has started to shift. Congressional appropriators have increased funding for FDA food activities, which more than doubled from $435.5 million in FY2005 to $987.3 million in FY2016 ( Table 1 ). Funding for FSIS remained mostly unchanged to slightly lower overall. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) also provided for additional limited funding through certain types of industry-paid user fees. FSMA\u2014comprehensive food safety legislation enacted in the 111 th Congress\u2014authorized additional appropriations and staff for FDA's future food safety activities. FSMA was the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s. Among its many provisions, FSMA authorized increased frequency of inspections at food facilities, tightened record-keeping requirements, extended oversight to certain farms, and mandated product recalls. It required food processing, manufacturing, shipping, and other facilities to conduct food safety plans of the most likely safety hazards and design and implement risk-based controls. It also mandated improvements to the nation's foodborne illness surveillance systems and increased scrutiny of food imports, among other provisions. FSMA did not directly address meat and poultry products under USDA's jurisdiction.  Although Congress authorized appropriations when it enacted FSMA, it did not provide the funding needed for FDA to perform these activities, and FDA funding for FSMA implementation and other food safety activities has been lower than what agency officials have said is needed to fully implement the law. Previously, FDA reported that an additional $400 million to $450 million per year above the FY2012 base is needed to fully implement FSMA. The enacted FY2016 Agriculture appropriation provided for a $104.5 million increase in budget authority for FDA's food safety activities, including FSMA implementation. For additional information, see CRS Report R44309, FY2016 Appropriations: Selected Federal Food Safety Agencies . Funding levels specific to food safety responsibilities at other federal and state agencies are not readily available. Although FDA staff working on food-related activities has increased, actual staffing levels remain below that mandated in FSMA. Among its many provisions, FSMA mandated an increase in the number of food safety inspectors within FDA and expanded the agency's authority to increase inspection of domestic and foreign food facilities. FSMA states a \"goal of not fewer than ... 5,000 staff members in fiscal year 2014.\" Instead, FDA reports actual staffing levels at 3,700 FTEs in FY2015 ( Table 1 ). FSIS staff number about 8,900 FTEs, a reduction from that in previous years. The discrepancy between the number of FDA and FSIS inspectors is, in part, attributable to differences in how each agency fulfills its respective inspection mandate. Whereas FDA inspection involves primarily review and sampling, FSIS personnel inspect all meat and poultry animals at slaughter on a continuous basis, requiring that at least one federal inspector is on the line during all hours the plant is operating. Processing inspection does not require an FSIS inspector to remain constantly on the production line or to inspect every item. Instead, inspectors are on site daily to monitor the plant's adherence to the standards for sanitary conditions, ingredient levels, and packaging and to conduct statistical sampling and testing of products. Because all plants are visited daily, processing inspection is also considered to be continuous. As of February 2016, a reported more than 300,000 domestic and foreign food facilities were registered with the agency and are potentially subject to inspection FDA reports. Of these, about 88,000 facilities are domestic (U.S.) registrations, and 212,000 facilities are foreign registrations. Registration of domestic and foreign food facilities is required under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (\"Bioterrorism Act,\" P.L. 107-188 ). Most recent available information for FY2012 indicate that FDA and the states under contract with FDA inspected 24,462 domestic food facilities and 1,342 foreign food facilities ( Table 2 ). Data compiled by FDA indicate that, on average, between 10% and 30% of all domestic facilities are inspected by FDA annually, most of which are considered \"high-risk\" facilities. Estimates of unannounced compliance inspections of domestic establishments by FDA officials range from once every five years to once every 10 years, on average, although the agency claims to visit about 6,000 so-called \"high-risk\" facilities on an annual basis. In general, FDA relies on notifications from within the industry or from other federal or state inspection personnel to alert it to situations calling for increased inspection. FDA inspection rates of imported foods are much lower, with a reported roughly 2% of all food import lines being physically examined by FDA. Previously, GAO reported that FDA inspections covered only about 1% of the food imported under its jurisdiction. Although FDA is not able to physically inspect a large percentage of food entering the United States, FDA electronically screens all import entries using an automated system known as Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT) information technology system. In addition, FDA can issue import bulletins to signal field inspectors to pay special attention to a particular product, or a range of products from a particular producer, shipper, or importer. The number of regulated meat and poultry facilities under USDA's jurisdiction is much lower and has remained mostly stable over time ( Table 3 ). Much of the agency's work is conducted in cooperation with federal, state, and municipal agencies, as well as private industry. FSIS currently conducts inspections in 6,389 establishments. This compares to 2002, when USDA reported that it conducted inspections in about 6,000 establishments. This total includes Talmadge-Aiken plants, wherein state inspectors perform inspections under federal inspectors' supervision. There were 350 Talmadge-Aiken plants in 2015, up from 235 in 2002.  Of the total number of meat, poultry, and egg establishments under FSIS jurisdiction, about 1,100 plants either slaughter or slaughter and process livestock or poultry. More than 4,000 facilities only process meat and poultry, and about 80 process egg products. FSIS also reinspects imported meat, poultry, and egg products at about 140 import reinspection facilities.  In the Senate, food safety issues are under the jurisdiction of the Committees on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. In the House, various food safety activities fall under the jurisdiction of the Committees on Agriculture; Energy and Commerce; Oversight and Government Reform; and Science, Space, and Technology. Agriculture subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees set funding and provide oversight of the major agencies that carry out food safety policies.  In general, the House and Senate Agriculture Committees maintain jurisdiction over USDA's meat and poultry inspection programs and also other food-safety-related programs administered by other USDA agencies ( see text box below ). One exception involves certain nutrition programs, such as the National School Lunch Program and certain other institutional food service programs administered by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), where the committees of jurisdiction are the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. FDA-regulated foods and other products generally fall under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Under FSMA, the separate authorities between FDA and USDA for various foods were explicitly maintained in the enacted law. However, identifying committees of jurisdiction for specific laws, programs, and federal agencies is not straightforward and further complicated by split jurisdiction between FDA and USDA in the case of some foods due to documented fragmentation, overlap, and duplication among the agencies responsible for administering the laws and programs governing certain foods.
