FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The inappropriate display of social security account \n        numbers has contributed to a growing range of illegal \n        activities, including fraud, identity theft, stalking, and \n        other crimes that have a substantial effect on interstate \n        commerce and public safety.\n            (2) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n        individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a social \n        security account number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n        old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under \n        title II of the Social Security Act, or to seek employment. An \n        unintended consequence of these requirements is that social \n        security account numbers have become one of the tools that can \n        be used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the \n        privacy of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. \n        Because the Federal Government created and maintains this \n        system, and because the Federal Government does not permit \n        individuals to exempt themselves from those requirements, it is \n        appropriate for the Federal Government to take steps to stem \n        the abuse of social security account numbers.\n            (3) In most jurisdictions throughout the United States, \n        State and local law requires that certain public documents, \n        such as business filings, property records, and birth and \n        marriage certificates, be made available to the general public. \n        These documents may contain an individual's social security \n        account number. An increasing number of official records \n        repositories, such as repositories maintained by a Secretary of \n        State's office or a local clerk's office, are storing such \n        records on the Internet. In a report issued in November 2004, \n        the Government Accountability Office estimated that between 15 \n        and 28 percent of counties display records containing social \n        security account numbers on the Internet, potentially affecting \n        millions of individuals. Due to a patchwork of practices and \n        regulations, the risk of exposure of social security account \n        numbers through the Internet is highly variable across States \n        and localities. While online availability of public records \n        improves access, it also increases the risk that social \n        security account numbers will be widely displayed and misused.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE DISPLAY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC ON THE \n              INTERNET OF ALL OR ANY PORTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT \n              NUMBERS BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 88 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by inserting at the end the following:\n``Sec. 1802.
