FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Despite the fact that Federal and State governments \n        spend hundreds of billions of dollars every year on care for \n        Americans through the Medicaid and CHIP programs, there is no \n        nationwide, systematic method of reporting, collecting, \n        evaluating, or improving the quality of care across all payment \n        and delivery systems (fee-for-service, managed care, primary \n        care case management, or other mechanisms).\n            (2) Although the quality of care delivered through Medicaid \n        health plans is frequently measured, there is no method or \n        mechanism to systematically improve the quality of care \n        provided to all Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries.\n            (3) For the majority of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees who are \n        served by primary care case management or fee-for-service \n        arrangements, there are no Federal requirements for comparable \n        quality monitoring or improvement. Thus there currently is no \n        ability to make fair assessments across all modes of care for \n        Medicaid and CHIP enrollees.\n            (4) State flexibility and the resulting opportunities for \n        innovation are hallmarks of the partnership between Federal and \n        State governments in the Medicaid and CHIP programs. Without a \n        way to systematically measure quality, however, policymakers \n        cannot know which innovations are the most effective.\n\nSEC. 3. MEASURING AND REPORTING ON COMPARABLE HEALTH CARE QUALITY \n              MEASURES FOR ALL PERSONS ENROLLED IN MEDICAID.\n\n    (a) Quality Assurance Standards.--Section 1932(c)(1)(A) of the \nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(c)(1)(A)) is amended by \ninserting ``or comparable primary care case management services \nproviders described in section 1905(t) as well as health care services \nfurnished in fee-for-service settings or other delivery systems'' after \n``1903(m)''.\n    (b) Adult Health Quality Measures.--Section 1139B of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-9b) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (b)--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as \n                paragraphs (5) and (6), respectively; and\n                    (B) by inserting after paragraph (3), the \n                following:\n            ``(4) Quality reporting for medicaid eligible adults.--\n        Beginning not later than January 1 of the calendar year that \n        begins on or after the date that is 2 years after the date of \n        enactment of the Medicaid and CHIP Quality Improvement Act of \n        2016, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall require \n        States to use the measures and approaches identified in \n        paragraph (3) to report on the initial core set of quality \n        measures for Medicaid eligible adults identified in paragraph \n        (2), subject to revisions made in accordance with paragraph \n        (6)(B). Such reporting shall be stratified by delivery system, \n        including managed care organizations under section 1932, \n        benchmark plans under section 1937, primary care case \n        management services providers described in section 1905(t), \n        health care services in fee-for-service settings, and other \n        delivery systems, except that the Secretary may determine that \n        reporting on certain measures should not be stratified by \n        delivery system because such stratification would not be \n        feasible or the delivery systems are not comparable with \n        respect to the application of such measures. In addition to the \n        stratification required under the previous sentence, the \n        Secretary shall have the discretion to further stratify \n        reporting on certain measures based on factors such as \n        eligibility category, income level, or other differentiating \n        factors that could have an impact on the comparability of the \n        measure.''; and\n            (2) in subsection (d)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ``under the \n                such plan'' and all that follows through ``subsection \n                (a)(5)'' and inserting ``under such plan or waiver, \n                including measures described in subsection (b)(2), \n                subject to revisions made in accordance with subsection \n                (b)(6)(B)'';\n                    (B) in paragraph (1)(B), by inserting ``, or \n                comparable primary care case management services \n                providers described in section 1905(t), as well as \n                health care services furnished in fee-for-service \n                settings or other delivery systems'' after ``section \n                1937''; and\n                    (C) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the \n                period the following: ``, including analysis of \n                comparable quality measures for Medicaid eligible \n                adults who receive their health services through \n                managed care, primary care case management, and fee-\n                for-service settings or other delivery systems''.\n    (c) Pediatric Health Care Measures.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1139A of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1320b-9a) is amended--\n                    (A) in subsection (a)--\n                            (i) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through \n                        (8) as paragraphs (6) through (9), \n                        respectively; and\n                            (ii) by inserting after paragraph (4), the \n                        following:\n            ``(5) Reporting of pediatric health care measures.--\n        Beginning not later than January 1 of the calendar year that \n        begins on or after the date that is 2 years after the date of \n        enactment of the Medicaid and CHIP Quality Improvement Act of \n        2016, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall require \n        States to use the measures and approaches identified in \n        paragraph (4) to report on the initial core child health care \n        quality measures established under this subsection and as such \n        measures subsequently are updated under subsection (b)(5).
