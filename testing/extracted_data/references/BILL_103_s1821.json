FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading known cause of \n        mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;\n            (2) each year, more than 5,000 infants are born in the \n        United States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering \n        irreversible physical and mental damage;\n            (3) 50,000 more infants are born each year with lesser, \n        though still serious, alcohol-related birth defects, known as \n        Fetal Alcohol Effects;\n            (4) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a national problem, it can \n        impact any child, family, or community, but its threat to \n        American Indians and Alaska Natives is especially alarming;\n            (5) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol \n        dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a \n        newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol \n        Effects are 30 times greater than national averages;\n            (6) researchers have determined that the possibility of \n        giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n        Alcohol Effects increases in proportion to the amount and \n        frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that \n        stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy \n        reduces the risks and the emotional, physical, and mental \n        consequences of alcohol exposure to the baby;\n            (7) in addition to the immeasurable toll on Fetal Alcohol \n        Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects children and their families, \n        Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects pose \n        extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, including the \n        costs of health care, education, foster care, job training, and \n        general support services for affected individuals;\n            (8) as a reliable comparison, delivery and care costs are \n        four times greater for infants who were exposed to illicit \n        substances than for infants with no indication of substance \n        exposure, and over a lifetime, health care costs for one Fetal \n        Alcohol Syndrome child are estimated, to be at least \n        $1,400,000; and\n            (9) we know of no safe dose of alcohol during pregnancy, or \n        of any safe time to drink during pregnancy, thus, it is in the \n        best interest of the Nation for the Federal Government to take \n        an active role in encouraging all women to abstain from alcohol \n        consumption during pregnancy.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to establish, within the Department \nof Health and Human Services, a comprehensive program to help prevent \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects nationwide. Such \nprogram shall--\n            (1) coordinate and support epidemiologic research \n        concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects;\n            (2) coordinate and support national, State, and community-\n        based public awareness, prevention, and education programs on \n        Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects; and\n            (3) foster coordination among all Federal agencies that \n        conduct or support Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n        Effects research, programs, and surveillance and otherwise meet \n        the general needs of populations actually or potentially \n        impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n    Part B of title V of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new \nsubpart:\n\n ``Subpart 4--Provisions Relating to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal \n                            Alcohol Effects\n\n``SEC. 520E.
