ACROSS-THE-BOARD RESCISSIONS.\n\n    (a) Fiscal Year 2006.--\n            (1) In general.--On September 30, 2006, there is rescinded \n        $4,718,047,269 of the unobligated balances of funds apportioned \n        before such date to the States for the Interstate maintenance, \n        national highway system, bridge, congestion mitigation and air \n        quality improvement, surface transportation (other than the STP \n        set-aside programs), metropolitan planning, minimum guarantee, \n        Appalachian development highway system, recreational trails, \n        safe routes to school, freight intermodal connectors, \n        coordinated border infrastructure, high risk rural road, high \n        priority projects, and transportation improvements programs and \n        each of the STP set-aside programs.\n            (2) Allocation among states.--The Secretary shall determine \n        each State's share of the amount to be rescinded by paragraph \n        (1) by multiplying $4,718,047,269 by the ratio of the aggregate \n        amount apportioned to such State for fiscal year 2006 for all \n        the programs referred to in paragraph (1) to the aggregate \n        amount apportioned to all States for such fiscal year for those \n        programs.\n            (3) Calculations.--To determine the allocation of the \n        amount to be rescinded for a State under paragraph (2) among \n        the programs referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary of \n        Transportation shall make the following calculations:\n                    (A) The Secretary shall multiply such amount to be \n                rescinded by the ratio that the aggregate amount of \n                unobligated funds available to the State on September \n                30, 2006, for each such program bears to the aggregate \n                amount of unobligated funds available to the State on \n                September 30, 2006, for all such programs.\n                    (B) The Secretary shall multiply such amount to be \n                rescinded by the ratio that the aggregate of the amount \n                apportioned to the State for each such program for \n                fiscal year 2006 bears to the aggregate amount \n                apportioned to the State for all such programs for \n                fiscal year 2006.\n            (4) Allocation among programs.--\n                    (A) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation \n                with the State, shall rescind for the State from each \n                program referred to in paragraph (1) the amount \n                determined for the program under paragraph (3)(A).\n                    (B) Special rule.--\n                            (i) Restoration of funds for covered \n                        programs.--If the rescission calculated under \n                        paragraph (3)(A) for a covered program exceeds \n                        the amount calculated for the covered program \n                        under paragraph (3)(B), the State shall \n                        immediately restore to the apportionment \n                        account for the covered program from the \n                        unobligated balances of programs referred to in \n                        paragraph (1) (other than covered programs) the \n                        amount of funds required so that the net \n                        rescission from the covered program does not \n                        exceed the amount calculated for the covered \n                        program under paragraph (3)(B).\n                            (ii) Treatment of restored funds.--Any \n                        funds restored under clause (i) shall be deemed \n

amounts \n        determined, and the amounts allocated, under section 105 of \n        title 23, United States Code, for fiscal year 2006 shall not be \n        recalculated to take into account a rescission made pursuant to \n        this subsection.\n            (6) STP set-aside program defined.--In this subsection, the \n        term ``STP set-aside program'' means the amount set aside
