FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) The United States makes substantial contributions and \n        provides significant funding for major international \n        development projects through the International Bank for \n        Reconstruction and Development, the International Development \n        Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Inter-\n        American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the \n        Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Investment \n        Corporation, the North American Development Bank, the African \n        Development Fund, and other multilateral lending institutions.\n            (2) These international development projects are often \n        plagued with fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, and misuse \n        of funding.\n            (3) Fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, misuse, and \n        abuse are major impediments to competition in foreign commerce \n        throughout the world.\n            (4) Identifying these impediments after they occur is \n        inadequate and meaningless.\n            (5) Detection of impediments before they occur helps to \n        ensure that valuable United States resources contributed to \n        important international development projects are used \n        appropriately.\n            (6) Independent third-party procurement monitoring is an \n        important tool for detecting and preventing such impediments.\n            (7) Third-party procurement monitoring includes evaluations \n        of each stage of the procurement process and assures the \n        openness and transparency of the process.\n            (8) Improving transparency and openness in the procurement \n        process helps to minimize fraud, corruption, waste, \n        inefficiency, and other misuse of funding, and promotes \n        competition, thereby strengthening international trade and \n        foreign commerce.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to build on the excellent \nprogress associated with the Organization on Economic Development and \nCooperation Agreement on Bribery and Corruption, by requiring the use \nof independent third-party procurement monitoring as part of the United \nStates participation in multilateral development banks and other \nlending institutions and in the disbursement of nonhumanitarian foreign \nassistance funds.\n\nSEC. 3.
