FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Cybercrime is one of the preeminent threats facing the \n        United States today, and presents a cumulative national \n        security, economic, and individual threat unlike any before it.\n            (2) The total global cost of cybercrime is estimated to be \n        $1,000,000,000,000 per year and represents one of the greatest \n        transfers of wealth in the history of the world.\n            (3) Cybercrime surveys have found that the solutions to \n        cybersecurity threats are multi-pronged and go beyond increased \n        data sharing and threat analysis.\n            (4) Many leaders of organizations do not know who is \n        responsible for the cybersecurity needs of their organization \n        or industry. These leaders also underestimate the capabilities \n        of their adversaries in cybercrime and the strategic, \n        financial, reputational, and regulatory risks those adversaries \n        pose to organizations.\n            (5) Security experts are not effectively communicating best \n        practices to address cyberthreats, cyberattacks, and defensive \n        technologies.\n            (6) Cybersecurity experts believe there are 4 key factors \n        that impact the vulnerability of an organization to cybercrime:\n                    (A) Understanding the changes to and best practices \n                for the current threat environment.\n                    (B) Strategy and execution of a cybersecurity \n                program.\n                    (C) The identification of key assets in need of \n                protection.\n                    (D) The ability to develop relationships with \n                similar organizations to develop protection within the \n                industry ecosystem.\n            (7) It is essential that the United States prioritize the \n        development of organizational relationships and best practices \n        of specific industries to help protect those industries against \n        threats to cybersecurity.\n\nSEC. 3.
