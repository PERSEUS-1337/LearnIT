Remittance of the local charges shall be separately identified from any other local taxes or other charges that are remitted to the local jurisdiction or local entity imposing the local tax or other charge.\n(g) A direct seller shall utilize the amounts posted by the board pursuant to subdivision (c) when determining what amounts to remit to the Public Utilities Commission, board, and each local jurisdiction or local agency.\n(h) A prepaid MTS provider shall offer prepaid consumers the option to make payment for additional prepaid usage directly to the prepaid MTS provider at the provider\u2019s retail location or Internet Web site.\n(i) The amount of the combined prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges shall be separately stated on an invoice, receipt, or other similar document that is provided to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services by the seller, or otherwise disclosed electronically to the prepaid consumer, at the time of the retail transaction.\n(j) The prepaid MTS surcharge that is required to be collected by a seller and any amount unreturned to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services that is not owed as part of the surcharge, but was collected from the prepaid consumer under the representation by the seller that it was owed as part of the surcharge, constitute debts owed by the seller to this state. The local charge\nshall\nthat is required to\nbe collected by a\nseller,\nseller\nand any amount unreturned to the prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services that is not owed as part of the local\ncharge\ncharge,\nbut that was collected from the prepaid consumer under the representation by the seller that it was owed as part of the local\ncharge\ncharge,\nconstitutes\na debt\ndebts\nowed by the seller jointly to the state, for purposes of collection on behalf of, and payment to, the local jurisdiction and to the local jurisdiction imposing that local charge.\n(k) A seller that has collected any amount of prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges in excess of the amount of the surcharge imposed by this part and actually due from a prepaid consumer may refund that amount to the prepaid consumer, even though the surcharge amount has already been paid over to the board and no corresponding credit or refund has yet been secured. Any seller making a refund of any charge to a prepaid consumer may repay therewith the amount of the surcharge paid.\n(l) (1) Every prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services in this state is liable for the prepaid MTS surcharge and any local charges until they have been paid to this state, except that payment to a seller registered under this part relieves the prepaid consumer from further liability for the surcharge and local charges. Any surcharge collected from a prepaid consumer that has not been remitted to the board shall be a debt owed to the state by the person required to collect and remit the surcharge. Any local charge collected from a prepaid consumer that has not been remitted to the board shall be a debt owed jointly to the state, for purposes of collection on behalf of, and payment to, the local jurisdiction and to the local jurisdiction imposing the local charge by the person required to collect and remit the local charge. Nothing in this part shall impose any obligation upon a seller to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the surcharge or local charge imposed by this section.\n(2) A credit shall be allowed against, but shall not exceed, the prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges imposed on any prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services by this part to the extent that the prepaid consumer has paid emergency telephone users charges, state utility regulatory commission fees, state universal service charges, or local charges on the purchase to any other state, political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. The credit shall be apportioned to the charges against which it is allowed in proportion to the amounts of those charges.\n(m) (1) A seller is relieved from liability to collect the prepaid MTS surcharge imposed by this part that became due and payable, insofar as the base upon which the surcharge is imposed is represented by accounts that have been found to be worthless and charged off for income tax purposes by the seller or, if the seller is not required to file income tax returns, charged off in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A seller that has previously paid the surcharge may, under rules and regulations prescribed by the board, take as a deduction on its return the amount found worthless and charged off by the seller. If any such accounts are thereafter in whole or in part collected by the seller, the amount so collected shall be included in the first return filed after such collection and the surcharge shall be paid with the return.\n(2) The board may by regulation promulgate such other rules with respect to uncollected or worthless accounts as it shall deem necessary to the fair and efficient administration of this part.\nSEC. 4.\nThis act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:\nIn order to allow sufficient time to promulgate and adopt regulations necessary to implement the recently enacted Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Surcharge Act (Part 21 (commencing with Section 42001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code) and Local Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services Collection Act (Part 21.1 (commencing with Section 42100) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), it is necessary that this act take effect immediately."
