FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that for a significant minority \nof Americans sincere conscientious objection to participation in war in \nany form means that such Americans cannot in conscience pay the portion \nof their taxes that would support military expenditures.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the Congress--\n            (1) to improve revenue collections and to allow \n        conscientious objectors to pay their full tax liability without \n        violating their moral, ethical, or religious beliefs;\n            (2) to reduce the present administrative and judicial \n        burden created by conscientious objectors who violate tax laws \n        rather than violate their consciences;\n            (3) to recognize conscientious objector status with regard \n        to the payment of taxes for military purposes; and\n            (4) to provide a mechanism for congressional appropriations \n        of such funds for nonmilitary purposes.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES PEACE TAX FUND.\n\n    (a) Creation of Trust Fund.--There is hereby established within the \nTreasury of the United States a special trust fund to be known as the \n``United States Peace Tax Fund'' (hereinafter referred to as the \n``Fund'').

Such amounts shall be deposited into the Fund and shall \n        be available only for the purposes provided in this Act.\n            (2) Method of transfer.--The amounts transferred by \n        paragraph (1) shall be transferred at least monthly from the \n        general fund of the Treasury to the Fund on the basis of \n        estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amounts, \n        referred to in paragraph (1), received in the Treasury. Proper \n        adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently \n        transferred to the extent that prior estimates were in excess \n        of or less than the amounts required to be transferred.\n            (3) Report.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall report to \n        the Committees on Appropriations of the House of \n        Representatives and the Senate each year on the total amount \n        transferred into the Fund during the preceding fiscal year. \n        Such report shall be printed in the Congressional Record upon \n        receipt by the committees.\n\nSEC. 4.
