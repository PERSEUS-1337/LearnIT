    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Budget Protection Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds:\n            (1) The Congress, after review of Congressional Budget \n        Office estimates and other expert opinions, finds that for a \n        prolonged period the amount of revenues collected will be \n        substantially less than the projected Federal expenditures \n        thereby placing burdens and constraints on the budget and \n        appropriations decision-making process.\n            (2) The Congress finds that the budget/appropriations for \n        Defense, driven by the war and occupation of Iraq, is likely to \n        grow rapidly and uncontrollably. These obligations will place \n        intense strains on the Budget/Appropriations process.\n            (3) The Congress finds that already certain vital federally \n        funded programs are experiencing devastating federal financial \n        assistance cuts. More specifically, assistance for Education, \n        Public Housing, Medicaid, Medicare and Temporary Aid to Needy \n        Families (TANF) are being subjected to unacceptable cuts.\n            (4) The Congress finds that there is an established \n        precedent for the long-term financing of a U.S. War effort. A \n        special tax on the profits of the nation's largest corporations \n        would be in accordance with previous precedents: World War I, \n        World War II, Korea and Vietnam.\n            (5) The Congress finds that in the last 25 years \n        corporations have steadily borne less and less of the overall \n        tax burden. The corporate share of the tax burden has dropped \n        from a high of 35 percent in 1945 to a level of less than 3 \n        percent in the year 2000. At the same time the individual \n        income share of the tax burden has grown from 41 percent in \n        1945 to 50 percent in 2000.\n            (6) The Congress finds that it is necessary to suspend \n        further reductions in assistance to domestic programs. It is \n        also imperative that any increases in basic revenue be utilized \n        to increase assistance to vital domestic programs.\n\nSEC. 3. CORPORATE TAX SURCHARGE TO FUND WAR IN IRAQ.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 (relating to determination of tax liability) is \namended by adding at the end thereof the following new part:\n\n        ``PART VIII--CORPORATE TAX SURCHARGE TO FUND WAR IN IRAQ\n\n                              ``Sec. 59B.
