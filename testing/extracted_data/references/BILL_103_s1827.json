FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) As a result of unfair and incomplete provisions in the \n        United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (hereafter referred \n        to as the ``CFTA'') and the North American Free Trade Agreement \n        (hereafter referred to as the ``NAFTA'') affecting exports of \n        Canadian grain to the United States--\n                    (A) Canadian exports of durum wheat, spring wheat, \n                and barley have increased beyond the level that such \n                exports can be absorbed into the United States market;\n                    (B) these exports have depressed domestic grain \n                prices, causing severe financial losses to American \n                farmers and increasing the costs and difficulties of \n                implementing domestic farmer support programs; and\n                    (C) Canadian grain exports continue to increase \n                without bounds, increasing the damage to United States \n                farmers each year.\n            (2) The Congress approved the CFTA subject to--\n                    (A) the statement in the Statement of \n                Administrative Action that the United States would \n                ``pursue consultations with Canada regarding the price \n                setting policy of the CWB (Canadian Wheat Board) as it \n                affects goods exported to the United States . . . \n                directed toward establishing a method to determine the \n                price at which the CWB is selling agricultural goods to \n                the United States and the CWB's acquisition price for \n                those goods''; and\n                    (B) the provision of the implementing legislation \n                requiring that ``the President will enter into \n                immediate consultation with the Government of Canada to \n                obtain the exclusion from the transport rates \n                established under Canada's Western Grain Transportation \n                Act of agricultural goods that originate in Canada and \n                are shipped via east coast ports for consumption in the \n                United States,'',\n        yet to date there has been no resolution of these \n        consultations.\n            (3) United States trade negotiators agreed not to reexamine \n        the CFTA while negotiating the NAFTA based on the assumption \n        that the Uruguay Round talks of the General Agreement on \n        Tariffs and Trade would address the subsidy and dispute \n        resolution concerns and would be completed before the enactment \n        of the NAFTA.\n            (4) The failure of the United States successfully to pursue \n        the consultations described in paragraph (2) led to a flawed \n        binational panel decision that renders meaningless the plain \n        language of Article 701(3) of the CFTA (which was incorporated \n        by reference in the NAFTA), which states that ``Neither Party, \n        including any public entity that it establishes or maintains, \n        shall sell agricultural goods for export to the territory of \n        the other Party at a price below the acquisition price of the \n        goods plus any storage, handling or other cost incurred by it \n        with respect to those goods.''.\n            (5) Imports of wheat and barley have increased \n        significantly as a result of substantial changes in Canada's \n        support programs. Some of the changes were made with declared \n        intent to increase imports to the United States. The increases \n        in imports constitutes grounds under Article 705.5 of the CFTA \n        for use of import restrictions by the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENTS AND IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL DUTIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Termination of nafta and cfta.--Notwithstanding any \n        other provision of law, the President shall provide written \n        notification to the Government of Canada of the intent of the \n        United States to terminate the CFTA and the NAFTA, as such \n        agreement applies to Canada, unless the President provides the \n        Congress with a certification described in subsection (c). Such \n        notification shall be given not later than the date that is 6 \n        months after the date of the enactment of this Act and shall \n        provide that the agreements shall terminate not later than 1 \n        year after the date of the enactment of this Act in accordance \n        with the terms and conditions of the respective agreements.\n            (2) Imposition of duty.--Notwithstanding any other \n        provision of law, the President shall immediately impose a duty \n        at the rate of 50 percent ad valorem or the specific rate \n        equivalent to articles imported from Canada described in the \n        following headings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the \n        United States:\n                    (A) heading 1001.10.00 (relating to durum wheat),\n                    (B) heading 1001.90.10 (relating to seed wheat),\n                    (C) heading 1001.90.20 (relating to other wheat),\n                    (D) heading 1003.00.20 (relating to malting \n                barley), and\n                    (E) heading 1003.00.40 (relating to other barley).\n    (b) Negotiations.--The President shall immediately pursue \nnegotiations with the Government of Canada to--\n            (1) establish a method for determining the sale price of \n        Canadian grain exports to the United States and the Canadian \n        Wheat Board's acquisition price for such grain;\n            (2) establish procedures for obtaining the data necessary \n        to implement the method described in paragraph (1);\n            (3) eliminate all transportation subsidies on agricultural \n        goods that originate in Canada and are shipped for consumption \n        in the United States; and\n            (4) clarify the meaning of the term ``acquisition price'' \n        in Article 701(3) of the CFTA (and any other provision \n        accompanying such agreement or the NAFTA) so that such term \n        includes--\n                    (A) the value of any transportation subsidy applied \n                to grain entering the United States;\n                    (B) all direct payments to producers made by the \n                Canadian Wheat Board or any government agency for grain \n                entering the United States; and\n                    (C) any other payments or subsidy incurred by the \n                Canadian Wheat Board, any government agency, or any \n                private interest in the acquisition, handling, storage, \n                and transportation of the grain.\n    (c) Certification by the President.--At such time as the President \ncertifies to the Congress that the Government of Canada has entered \ninto an agreement with the United States with respect to the \nrequirements described in subsection (b), the President may terminate \nthe duties imposed under subsection (a)(1) and take action to reinstate \nthe CFTA and the NAFTA with respect to Canada. An agreement entered \ninto under this Act shall supersede the corresponding provisions of the \nCFTA and the NAFTA and shall be incorporated in and become part of such \nagreements as reinstated."
