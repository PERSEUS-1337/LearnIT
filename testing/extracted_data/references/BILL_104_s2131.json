FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (a) The Congress of the United States recognizes the \n        existence of a severe computer problem that may have extreme \n        negative economic and national security consequences in the \n        year 2000 and beyond.\n            (b) Most computer programs (particularly in mainframes) in \n        both the public and private sector express dates with only two \n        digits and assume the first two digits are ``19'', and that \n        therefore most programs read 00-01-01 as January 1, 1900; and \n        that these programs will not recognize the year 2000 or the \n        21st century without a massive rewriting of codes.\n            (c) The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has completed \n        a report on the implications of the ``Year 2000 Computer \n        Problem'' and according to CRS, each line of computer code will \n        need to be analyzed and either passed on or be rewritten and \n        this worldwide problem could cost as much as $600 billion to \n        repair. We recognize that no small share of the American burden \n        will fall on the shoulders of the Federal Government and on \n        State and local governments.\n            (d) Six issues need to be addressed:\n                    (1) An analysis of the history and background \n                concerning the reasons for the occurance of the Year \n                2000 problem.\n                    (2) The cost of reviewing and rewriting codes for \n                both the Federal and State Governments over the next \n                three years, including a legal analysis of \n                responsibilities for such costs and possible equitable \n                bases for sharing them.\n                    (3) The time it will take to get the job done and, \n                if not by 2000, what agencies are at risk of not being \n                able to perform basic services.\n                    (4) The development of balanced and sound contracts \n                with the computer industry available for use by Federal \n                agencies, and if such outside contractual assistance is \n                needed, to assist such agencies in contracting for and \n                effectuating Year 2000 compliance for current computer \n                programs and systems as well to ensure Year 2000 \n                compliance for all programs and systems acquired in the \n                future.\n                    (5) An analysis of what happens to the United \n                States economy if the problem is not resolved by mid-\n                1999.\n                    (6) Recommendations to the President and the \n                Congress concerning lessons to be learned and policies \n                and actions to be taken in the future to minimize the \n                Year 2000 public and private sector costs and risks.\n            (e) The Congress recognizes that an Executive Branch \n        Interagency Committee has been established to raise awareness \n        of this problem and facilitate efforts at solving it; but that \n        in order to best minimize the impact and cost of this problem, \n        and recognizing the extreme urgency of this problem, this \n        bipartisan commission will be established to both address these \n        issues and take responsibility for assuring that all Federal \n        agencies be computer compliant by January 1, 1999.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) There is established a commission to be known as the ``National \nCommission on the Year 2000 Computer Problem'' (hereinafter in this \nsection referred to as the ``Commission'').
