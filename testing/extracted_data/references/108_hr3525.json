    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Citizen Legislature and Political \nFreedom Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The proliferation of campaign finance laws (beginning \n        with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971) and the \n        proliferation of government regulations promulgated pursuant to \n        such laws have placed strict limits on contributions by \n        citizens to the candidates of their choice, limits which have \n        served to severely hinder the ability of challengers to compete \n        on equal terms with incumbent politicians.\n            (2) The contribution limits imposed by the Federal Election \n        Campaign Act of 1971 force candidates to raise funds in small \n        amounts subject to fixed limitations, inevitably fostering a \n        system under which wealthy candidates and long-term incumbent \n        politicians hold an unfair financial advantage, which in turn \n        serves to discourage potential candidates from seeking public \n        office.\n            (3) The current campaign finance laws have inhibited the \n        full and fair discussion of public policy issues, as \n        challengers who are not well known to the electorate are forced \n        by government regulation to attempt to amass contributions from \n        large numbers of donors at the outset of a campaign. As a \n        result, challengers who lack the necessary resources to bring \n        new issues into the public debate often are eliminated from \n        political campaigns before their voices are even heard.\n            (4) The regulation by government of political speech \n        through the regulation of campaign contributions and \n        expenditures is patently undemocratic because it favors \n        institutionalized special interests over grassroots and citizen \n        activity by imposing burdensome reporting and disclosure \n        requirements and stringent spending limits on the political \n        parties, thereby tilting the financial and tactical advantage \n        in political campaigns to well-financed interest groups and \n        wealthy individuals.\n            (5) The effect of the unreasonably low contribution limits \n        has been to force more contributors and political activists to \n        operate outside the system, resulting in even less \n        accountability and even greater encouragement of irresponsible \n        behavior.\n            (6) The only way to encourage the robust discourse of \n        public issues and candidates, promote the free exchange of \n        political speech and ideas, protect constitutional freedom, and \n        foster a more informed electorate is to lift all current \n        restrictions on political candidate and party contributions and \n        expenditures and to provide full, instantaneous disclosure of \n        all contributions and expenditures in elections for Federal \n        office.\n\nSEC. 3. REMOVAL OF LIMITATIONS ON FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN \n              CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n    Section 315(a) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \nU.S.C. 441a(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nparagraph:\n    ``(9) The limitations established under this subsection shall not \napply to contributions made during calendar years beginning after \n2004.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
