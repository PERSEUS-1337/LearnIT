FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) more than 35 percent of families in the northeastern \n        United States depend on oil to heat their homes each winter, \n        and most of those families have no practical alternative to \n        paying the going price for home heating oil or seeking public \n        or private assistance to pay for home heating oil;\n            (2) consumers experienced sudden and dramatic increases in \n        prices for home heating oil during the winters of 1989, 1996, \n        and 1999, causing hardship to families and other people of the \n        United States, including people on fixed and low incomes, \n        people living in rural areas, the elderly, farmers, truckers \n        and the driving public, and governments that pay home heating \n        oil bills;\n            (3) a substantial part of each sudden increase in home \n        heating oil prices has been caused by vastly inadequate \n        supplies of home heating oil accumulated during the summer, \n        fall, and winter months by importers, refiners, and \n        wholesalers; and\n            (4) increased stability in home heating oil prices is \n        necessary to maintain the economic vitality of the Northeast.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that minimally \nadequate stocks of home heating oil are accumulated in the Northeast to \nmeet reasonably foreseeable demand during each winter while protecting \nconsumers from sudden increases in the price of home heating oil.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 152 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. \n6232) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), \n        (7), (8), (9), (10), and (11) as paragraphs (3), (4), (5), (8), \n        (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), and (14), respectively;\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n            ``(2) Home heating oil.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `home heating oil' \n                means distillate fuel oil.\n                    ``(B) Inclusions.--The term `home heating oil' \n                includes No. 1 and No. 2 diesel and fuel oils.'';\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (5) (as redesignated by \n        paragraph (1) of this section) the following:\n            ``(6) Northeast.--The term `Northeast' means the States of \n        Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, \n        Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.\n            ``(7) Primary heating oil inventory.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `primary heating oil \n                inventory' means a heating oil inventory held by an \n                importer, refiner, or wholesaler.\n                    ``(B) Exclusion.--The term `primary heating oil \n                inventory' does not include any inventory held by a \n                retailer for the direct sale to an end user of home \n                heating oil.''; and\n            (4) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(15) Wholesaler.--The term `wholesaler' means any person \n        that--\n                    ``(A) owns, operates, leases, or otherwise controls \n                a bulk terminal having a total petroleum storage \n                capacity of 50,000 barrels or more;\n                    ``(B) stores heating oil; and\n                    ``(C)(i) resells petroleum products to retail \n                businesses that market the petroleum products to end \n                users; or\n                    ``(ii) receives petroleum products by tanker, \n                barge, or pipeline.\n            ``(16) Winter season.--The term `winter season' means the \n        months of November through March.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
