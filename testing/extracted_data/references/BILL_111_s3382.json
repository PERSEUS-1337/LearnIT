FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) an effective means of conserving and recovering Federal \n        trust species and promoting self-sustaining populations of \n        those species is to protect, conserve, restore, and enhance the \n        habitats of the species;\n            (2) coastal ecosystems are highly dynamic areas that \n        provide valuable breeding, nursery, staging, and resting areas \n        for a rich diversity of fish, shellfish, migratory birds, and \n        mammals;\n            (3) coastal areas support 40 percent of the refuges within \n        the National Wildlife Refuge System, 40 percent of the \n        endangered and threatened species (including 75 percent of the \n        listed mammals and birds), and 50 percent of the fisheries \n        conservation activities of the Service;\n            (4) although coastal counties make up only 17 percent of \n        total contiguous United States land area, coastal areas are \n        home to more than 53 percent of the human population of the \n        United States, which is placing enormous pressure on coastal \n        ecosystems;\n            (5) during the 2 decades after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, human populations in coastal areas are projected to \n        increase by approximately 25 percent, along with associated \n        development and activities that threaten the health of coastal \n        ecosystems;\n            (6) because coastal deterioration can cause fragmentation \n        and landward migration of coastal ecosystems as well as create \n        new habitats along shorelines, it has become necessary to \n        incorporate adaptation assistance into coastal ecosystem \n        management strategies;\n            (7) in addition to value as fish and wildlife habitat, \n        coastal ecosystems--\n                    (A) serve as an important source of food;\n                    (B) protect coastal communities against floods;\n                    (C) filter polluted runoff; and\n                    (D) provide valuable commercial and recreational \n                benefits to coastal communities and the United States;\n            (8)(A) fish and wildlife conservation is a responsibility \n        shared by citizens and government; and\n            (B) public-private partnerships should be supported through \n        technical and financial assistance to conduct assessment, \n        protection, planning, restoration, and enhancement of coastal \n        ecosystems;\n            (9) successful fish and wildlife conservation increasingly \n        relies on interdependent partnerships in which priority \n        setting, planning, and conservation delivery are collaborative \n        endeavors;\n            (10) since 1985, the Service has administered a coastal \n        program through which the Service has worked with willing \n        partners to assess, protect, plan, restore, and enhance coastal \n        ecosystems, including coastal wetland and watersheds, upland, \n        and riparian and in-stream habitats, that provide significant \n        benefits to Federal trust species;\n            (11) through that coastal program, the Service provides \n        strategic conservation planning and design at the regional and \n        landscape scales, and integrates the resources of the Service \n        to address priorities identified by partners; and\n            (12) the coastal program of the Service complements and \n        enhances the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant \n        Program under section 305 of the Coastal Wetlands Planning, \n        Protection and Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 3954), which provides \n        matching grants to coastal States to support long-term \n        conservation of coastal wetland and associated habitats.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to legislatively authorize \nthe coastal program of the Service in effect as of the date of \nenactment of this Act to conduct collaborative, long-term, landscape-\nlevel planning and on-the-ground habitat protection, restoration, and \nenhancement projects in priority coastal areas to conserve and recover \nFederal trust species.\n\nSEC. 3.
