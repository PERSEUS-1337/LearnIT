FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The freedom of speech and the press is enshrined in the \n        First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n            (2) Free speech, the free exchange of information, and the \n        free expression of ideas and opinions are essential to the \n        functioning of representative democracy in the United States.\n            (3) The free expression and publication by journalists, \n        academics, commentators, experts, and others of the information \n        they uncover and develop through research and study is \n        essential to the formation of sound public policy and thus to \n        the security of Americans.\n            (4) The First Amendment jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, \n        articulated in such precedents as New York Times v. Sullivan, \n        376 U.S. 254 (1964), and its progeny, reflects the fundamental \n        value that Americans place on promoting the free exchange of \n        ideas and information, requiring in cases involving public \n        figures a demonstration of actual malice--that is, that \n        allegedly defamatory, libelous, or slanderous statements about \n        public figures are not merely false but made with knowledge of \n        that falsity or with reckless disregard of their truth or \n        falsity.\n            (5) Some persons are obstructing the free expression rights \n        of Americans, and the vital interest of the American people in \n        receiving information on matters of public importance, by first \n        seeking out foreign jurisdictions that do not provide the full \n        extent of free-speech protection that is fundamental in the \n        United States and then suing Americans in such jurisdictions in \n        defamation actions based on speech uttered or published in the \n        United States--speech that is fully protected under First \n        Amendment jurisprudence in the United States and the laws of \n        the several States and the District of Columbia.\n            (6) Some of these actions are intended not only to suppress \n        the free speech rights of journalists, academics, commentators, \n        experts, and other individuals but to intimidate publishers and \n        other organizations that might otherwise disseminate or support \n        the work of those individuals with the threat of prohibitive \n        foreign lawsuits, litigation expenses, and judgments that \n        provide for money damages and other speech-suppressing relief.\n            (7) The governments and courts of some foreign countries \n        have failed to curtail this practice, permitting lawsuits filed \n        by persons who are often not citizens of those countries, under \n        circumstances where there is often little or no basis for \n        jurisdiction over the Americans against whom such suits are \n        brought.\n            (8) Some of the plaintiffs bringing such suits are \n        intentionally and strategically refraining from filing their \n        suits in the United States, even though the speech at issue was \n        published in the United States, in order to avoid the Supreme \n        Court's First Amendment jurisprudence and frustrate the \n        protections it affords Americans.\n            (9) The Americans against whom such suits are brought must \n        consequently endure the prohibitive expense, inconvenience, and \n        anxiety attendant to being sued in foreign courts for conduct \n        that is protected by the First Amendment, or decline to answer \n        such suits and risk the entry of costly default judgments that \n        may be executed in countries other than the United States where \n        those individuals travel or own property.\n            (10) Journalists, academics, commentators, experts, and \n        others subjected to such suits are suffering concrete and \n        profound financial and professional damage for engaging in \n        conduct that is protected under the United States Constitution \n        and essential to informing the American people, their \n        representatives, and other policy-makers.\n            (11) In turn, the American people are suffering concrete \n        and profound harm because they, their representatives, and \n        other government policymakers rely on the free expression of \n        information, ideas, and opinions developed by responsible \n        journalists, academics, commentators, experts, and others for \n        the formulation of sound public policy, including national \n        security policy.\n            (12) The United States respects the sovereign right of \n        other countries to enact their own laws regarding speech, and \n        seeks only to protect the First Amendment rights of Americans \n        in connection with speech that occurs, in whole or in part, in \n        the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION.\n\n    (a) Cause of Action.--Any United States person against whom a \nlawsuit is brought in a foreign country for defamation on the basis of \nthe content of any writing, utterance, or other speech by that person \nthat has been published, uttered, or otherwise disseminated in the \nUnited States may bring an action in a United States district court \nspecified in subsection (f) against any person who, or entity which, \nbrought the foreign suit if the writing, utterance, or other speech at \nissue in the foreign lawsuit does not constitute defamation under \nUnited States law.\n    (b) Jurisdiction.--It shall be sufficient to establish jurisdiction \nover the person or entity bringing a foreign lawsuit described in \nsubsection (a) that such person or entity has filed the lawsuit against \na United States person, or that such United States person has assets in \nthe United States against which the claimant in the foreign action \ncould execute if a judgment in the foreign lawsuit were awarded.\n    (c) Remedies.--\n            (1) Order to bar enforcement and other injunctive relief.--\n        If the cause of action set forth in subsection (a) is \n        established, the district court shall order that any foreign \n        judgment in the foreign lawsuit in question may not be enforced \n        in the United States, including by any Federal, State, or local \n        court, and may order such other injunctive relief that the \n        court considers appropriate to protect the right to free speech \n        under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n            (2) Damages.--In addition to the remedy under paragraph \n        (1), damages may be awarded to the United States person \n        bringing the action under subsection (a), based on the \n        following:\n                    (A) The amount of the foreign judgment.\n                    (B) The costs, including all legal fees, \n                attributable to the foreign lawsuit that have been \n                borne by the United States person.\n                    (C) The harm caused to the United States person due \n                to decreased opportunities to publish, conduct \n                research, or generate funding.\n    (d) Treble Damages.--If, in an action brought under subsection (a), \nthe factfinder determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the \nperson or entity bringing the foreign lawsuit at issue intentionally \nengaged in a scheme to suppress First Amendment rights by discouraging \npublishers or other media not to publish, or discouraging employers, \ncontractors, donors, sponsors, or similar financial supporters not to \nemploy, retain, or support, the research, writing, or other speech of a \njournalist, academic, commentator, expert, or other individual, the \nfactfinder may award treble damages.\n    (e) Expedited Discovery.--Upon the filing of an action under \nsubsection (a), the court may order expedited discovery if the court \ndetermines, based on the allegations in the complaint, that the speech \nat issue in the foreign defamation action is protected by the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.\n    (f) Venue.--An action under subsection (a) may be brought by a \nUnited States person only in a United States district court in which \nthe United States person is domiciled, does business, or owns real \nproperty that could be executed against in satisfaction of a judgment \nin the foreign defamation lawsuit giving rise to the action.\n    (g) Timing of Action; Statute of Limitations.--\n            (1) Timing.--An action under subsection (a) may be \n        commenced after the filing of the defamation lawsuit in a \n        foreign country on which the action is based.\n            (2) Statute of limitations.--For purposes of section \n        1658(a) of title 28, United States Code, the cause of action \n        under subsection (a) accrues on the date on which the \n        defamation lawsuit in a foreign country on which the cause of \n        action is based is filed.\n\nSEC. 4. APPLICABILITY.\n\n    This Act applies with respect to any foreign lawsuit that is \ndescribed in section 3(a) and is brought in the foreign country \nconcerned before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
