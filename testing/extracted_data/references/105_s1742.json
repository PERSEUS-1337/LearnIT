FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the measure of a good teacher is how much and how well \n        the teacher's students learn;\n            (2) the main teacher quality problem in 1998 is the lack of \n        subject matter knowledge;\n            (3) knowledgeable and eager individuals of sound character \n        and various professional backgrounds should be encouraged to \n        enter the kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms as teachers;\n            (4) many talented professionals who have demonstrated a \n        high level of subject area competence outside the education \n        profession may wish to pursue careers in education, but have \n        not fulfilled the traditional requirements to be certified or \n        licensed as teachers;\n            (5) States should have maximum flexibility and incentives \n        to create alternative teacher certification and licensure \n        programs in order to recruit well-educated people into the \n        teaching profession; and\n            (6) alternative routes can enable qualified individuals to \n        fulfill State teacher certification or licensure requirements \n        and will allow school systems to utilize the expertise of \n        professionals and improve the pool of qualified individuals \n        available to local educational agencies as teachers.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to improve the supply \nof well-qualified elementary school and secondary school teachers by \nencouraging and assisting States to develop and implement programs for \nalternative routes to teacher certification or licensure requirements.\n\nSEC. 3.
