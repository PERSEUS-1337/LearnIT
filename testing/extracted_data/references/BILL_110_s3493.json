POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) Submission of Plan.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 12 months after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, each rail carrier that is a Class I \n        railroad, a rail carrier that has inadequate safety performance \n        (as determined by the Secretary), or a rail carrier that \n        provides intercity passenger or commuter rail passenger \n        transportation shall develop and submit to the Secretary a plan \n        for implementing a positive train control system by December \n        31, 2014.\n            (2) Technical assistance.--The Secretary may provide \n        technical assistance and guidance to railroad carriers in \n        developing the plans required under this subsection.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Positive train control system.--The term ``positive \n        train control system'' means a system designed to prevent \n        train-to-train collisions, overspeed derailments, and \n        incursions into roadway worker work limits.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Transportation.\n    (c) Safety Redundancy.--The positive train control system required \nunder subsection (a) shall--\n            (1) minimize the risk of train collisions and over-speed \n        derailments;\n            (2) provide protection to maintenance-of-way workers within \n        established work zone limits;\n            (3) provide a safety redundancy to minimize the risk of \n        accidents by overriding human performance failures involving \n        train movements on main line tracks;
