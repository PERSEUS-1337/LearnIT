FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States secured the independence of the \n        Republic of Panama, built the Panama Canal at considerable cost \n        in blood and treasure, and has provided for its management, \n        operations, maintenance, improvement, and defense throughout \n        the 20th century, providing a vital service to the peaceful \n        commerce of all nations as well as substantial returns to the \n        national interests of both the United States and Panama.\n            (2) The Panama Canal continues to play a vital role both in \n        international trade and in the national security of the United \n        States, reducing the distance by sea between New York and San \n        Francisco by some 8,000 miles, contributing critical strategic \n        mobility to naval forces of the United States and substantial \n        savings to maritime commerce.\n            (3) Absent any new base-rights agreement between the United \n        States Government and the Government of the Republic of Panama \n        allowing for a post-2000 United States military presence, \n        United States forces in Panama will be reduced to zero by \n        December 31, 1999, calling into question the ability of the \n        United States to continue to protect its interests in the area.\n            (4) The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine \n        proclaimed in 1904 that it was a national security concern of \n        the United States when foreign powers attempted to use public \n        or private investment as a vehicle for the expansion of \n        political and military influence in the Western Hemisphere.\n            (5) The recent grant to Hutchison Whampoa, a Chinese firm \n        with ties to the Government of the People's Republic of China, \n        of management control of the Panamanian ports of Balboa and San \n        Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal, has \n        raised the specter of the expansion of Chinese political \n        influence in Panama--a situation aggravated by unanswered \n        questions concerning the methods used by the Chinese firm to \n        win its bids.\n            (6) In addition, Article V of the Treaty Concerning the \n        Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, states \n        that only the Republic of Panama shall maintain military \n        forces, defense sites, and military installations in its \n        national territory after December 31, 1999.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA IF FORMER \n              UNITED STATES MILITARY FACILITIES IN THE REPUBLIC OF \n              PANAMA ARE CONVEYED TO ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT-OWNED \n              ENTITY.\n\n    (a) Limitation on United States Assistance.--United States \nassistance may not be provided to the Republic of Panama for any period \nof time beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act during \nwhich a defense site or military installation, that is located within \nthe territory of the Republic of Panama and that was at any time part \nof a defense site or military installation built or formerly operated \nby the United States, has been conveyed by the Government of the \nRepublic of Panama to any foreign government-owned entity.\n    (b) Opposition to Assistance From International Financial \nInstitutions.--The President shall instruct the United States \nrepresentative to each international financial institution to which the \nUnited States is a member to use the voice and vote of the United \nStates to oppose any loans or other forms of assistance from that \ninstitution to the Republic of Panama for any period of time during \nwhich the Government of the Republic of Panama is in violation of the \nrequirements of subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4.
