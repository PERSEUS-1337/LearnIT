    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Support for Vulnerable and Displaced \nIraqis Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since the beginning of the 2003 war in Iraq, according \n        to countries hosting Iraqi refugees, up to 2,000,000 Iraqis \n        have fled their homes for neighboring countries to avoid \n        sectarian and other violence.\n            (2) According to the Office of the United Nations High \n        Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are over 2,700,000 \n        internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Iraq, and many other \n        vulnerable Iraqis have been unable to flee, many lacking \n        adequate food, shelter, and other basic services.\n            (3) The massive flow of Iraqi refugees into neighboring \n        host countries has overwhelmed existing social, economic, and \n        security capacities of such countries. Few Iraqis currently \n        consider return to Iraq an option.\n            (4) Increasing poverty and despair among displaced \n        populations may provide fertile ground for possible recruitment \n        by extremist groups.\n            (5) The humanitarian crisis in Iraq and its neighbors \n        threatens to undermine stability in the broader region.\n            (6) The United States has yet to disclose a long-term \n        comprehensive strategy to address the humanitarian situation of \n        vulnerable Iraqis, especially mass displacement of Iraqis \n        inside Iraq and as refugees into neighboring countries.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) refugees from Iraq and vulnerable Iraqis in Iraq, \n        especially internally displaced persons, will have an impact on \n        the stability of Iraq and the region, and the short- and long-\n        term effects and needs of their situation must be considered \n        within the overall Iraq policy of the United States and be \n        addressed at the highest levels of government;\n            (2) United States leadership is essential to sustain and \n        expand the response of the international community, including \n        the Government of Iraq, to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and \n        faced by Iraqi refugees;\n            (3) it is critical for the United States to provide strong \n        leadership on funding assistance requests from the UNHCR and \n        other international organizations and nongovernmental \n        organizations providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable \n        populations in Iraq, including internally displaced persons, \n        and to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries;\n            (4) the United States should develop a long-term, \n        comprehensive humanitarian strategy in coordination with the \n        Government of Iraq, host countries, and other countries in the \n        region, donor governments, inter-governmental organizations, \n        international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations \n        to meet the humanitarian needs of vulnerable Iraqis, especially \n        Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons, through \n        assistance and resettlement;\n            (5) internally displaced Iraqis and Iraqi refugees should \n        only return when they are able to do so safely, voluntarily, \n        and sustainably; and\n            (6) the United States should rely on assessments of the \n        UNHCR, which has the mandate from the international community \n        for displaced people, nongovernmental organizations, and \n        displaced Iraqis themselves, in developing a long-term, \n        comprehensive humanitarian strategy to address the crisis \n        facing refugees from Iraq and internally displaced persons in \n        Iraq.\n\nSEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL STRATEGY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of State, in consultation with the \nAdministrator of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other Federal \nagencies as appropriate, shall develop a comprehensive regional \nstrategy to address the mass displacement of Iraqis inside Iraq and as \nrefugees into neighboring countries.\n    (b) Content.--The strategy required under subsection (a) shall--\n            (1) address the serious challenges facing refugees from \n        Iraq, including--\n                    (A) the lack of legal status recognized by host \n                governments and the inability of refugees to work \n                legally;\n                    (B) inadequate UNHCR resources to register more \n                refugees from Iraq, assist them in Iraq and host \n                countries, and refer them for resettlement;\n                    (C) inadequate UNHCR resources for nongovernmental \n                organizations to assist refugees from Iraq;\n                    (D) limited access to education and healthcare;\n                    (E) critical food shortages; and\n                    (F) inadequate shelter, drinking water, sanitation, \n                and protection;\n            (2) address the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to \n        help meet the urgent humanitarian needs of its citizens in Iraq \n        and the region and steps the United States can take to provide \n        support in this area;\n            (3) include an assessment of the needs of vulnerable Iraqis \n        in Iraq, especially internally displaced persons and Iraqi \n        refugees in the region, and an estimate of assistance required \n        in order for the United States to help meet these needs, \n        including bilateral assistance and contributions to the Office \n        of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), \n        other international organizations, and nongovernmental \n        organizations providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable \n        populations in Iraq, including internally displaced persons, \n        and to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries;\n            (4) include the number of refugees from Iraq that the \n        United States plans to admit to and resettle in the United \n        States in order to maintain the traditional United States share \n        of world-wide refugee admissions and resettlement, participate \n        in burden sharing with host countries, and provide a robust \n        response to the protection needs of refugees from Iraq, and \n        provide an explanation and justification for the number;\n            (5) include an assessment of what conditions are necessary \n        for the voluntary, safe, sustainable return of displaced \n        Iraqis, relying on the evaluations of the United States High \n        Commissioner for Refugees, nongovernmental organizations, and \n        displaced Iraqis themselves;\n            (6) include a description of the steps that the United \n        States Government has taken and will take to engage the \n        international community, including the Government of Iraq, to \n        implement the strategy and the response of the international \n        community to these efforts; and\n            (7) include plans to assess the impact of the strategy.\n\nSEC. 5.
