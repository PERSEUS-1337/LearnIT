FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Black men and boys face disproportionate hardships that \n        result in disparities in areas including: education, criminal \n        justice, health, employment, fatherhood, mentorship, and \n        violence. These hardships have negative consequences for \n        national productivity, especially for Black families and \n        communities.\n            (2) A Commission to study and examine issues which \n        disproportionately have a negative impact on Black men and boys \n        in America will signal that the issues facing the Black male \n        population are a national priority, will develop solutions to \n        these hardships, and will help eliminate the obstacles facing \n        Black men and boys.\n            (3) A Commission will also be able to investigate potential \n        civil rights violations affecting this population that attract \n        national attention.\n            (4) Black babies are three times more likely to be born in \n        poverty and rapidly fall behind their White counterparts in \n        cognitive development.\n            (5) By fourth grade, Black students are expected to be \n        three years behind White male students. According to the \n        Educational Testing Service Policy Informational Center, only \n        12 percent of Black eighth-grade male students are proficient \n        in math, compared to 44 percent of White eighth-grade male \n        students.\n            (6) The Educational Testing Service Policy Informational \n        Center also found that nationally, more than 50 percent of \n        Black male students attending urban schools will drop out.\n            (7) The low rate of high school retention among Black male \n        students directly relates to high rates of joblessness and \n        incarceration among this population. This barrier to employment \n        exacerbates cycles of poverty, which in turn results in health \n        inequalities, including higher levels of diabetes, obesity, and \n        HIV/AIDS. According to a study by the American Academy of Arts \n        and Sciences, more than 66 percent of Black male dropouts are \n        expected to serve time in State or Federal prison.\n            (8) Black men are subjected to unequal profiling by the \n        police and disproportionately harsh sentences in the judicial \n        system. The Black male population is six times more likely to \n        become incarcerated than their White counterparts. Although the \n        Black male population comprises approximately six percent of \n        the United States population, of the 2,300,000 people \n        incarcerated nationwide, 1 million are Black males. Black males \n        receive ten percent longer Federal sentences than White males \n        who commit the same crime.\n            (9) According to the Bureau of Statistics and the Pew \n        Research Center, Black male unemployment is consistently almost \n        double that of White male unemployment.\n            (10) Black fathers are more than twice as likely to live \n        apart from their children as White fathers.\n            (11) Young boys with male mentors are more likely to \n        progress further in school and have greater financial success \n        in life.\n\nSEC. 3.
