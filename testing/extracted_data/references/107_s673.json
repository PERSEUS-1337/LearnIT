    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nonproliferation Assistance \nCoordination Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) United States nonproliferation efforts in the \n        independent states of the former Soviet Union have achieved \n        important results in ensuring that weapons of mass destruction, \n        weapons-usable material and technology, and weapons-related \n        knowledge remain beyond the reach of terrorists and weapons-\n        proliferating states;\n            (2) although these efforts are in the United States \n        national security interest, the effectiveness of these efforts \n        suffers from a lack of coordination within and among United \n        States Government agencies;\n            (3) increased spending and investment by the United States \n        private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n        states of the former Soviet Union, specifically, spending and \n        investment by the United States private sector in job creation \n        initiatives and proposals for unemployed Russian weapons \n        scientists and technicians, is making an important contribution \n        in ensuring that knowledge related to weapons of mass \n        destruction remains beyond the reach of terrorists and weapons-\n        proliferating states; and\n            (4) increased spending and investment by the United States \n        private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n        states of the former Soviet Union requires the establishment of \n        a coordinating body to ensure that United States public and \n        private efforts are not in conflict, and to ensure that public \n        spending on efforts by the independent states of the former \n        Soviet Union is maximized to ensure efficiency and further \n        United States national security interests.\n\nSEC. 3. INDEPENDENT STATES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``independent states of the former Soviet \nUnion'' has the meaning given the term in section 3 of the FREEDOM \nSupport Act (22 U.S.C. 5801).\n\nSEC. 4.
