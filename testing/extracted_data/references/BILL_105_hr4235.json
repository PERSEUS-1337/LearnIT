FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the recent outbreak of the harmful microbe Pfiesteria \n        piscicida in the coastal waters of the United States is one \n        example of potentially harmful algal blooms composed of \n        naturally occurring species that reproduce explosively and that \n        are increasing in frequency and intensity in the Nation's \n        coastal waters;\n            (2) other recent occurrences of harmful algal blooms \n        include red tides in the Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast; \n        brown tides in New York and Texas; ciguatera fish poisoning in \n        Hawaii, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; and \n        shellfish poisonings in the Gulf of Maine, the Pacific \n        Northwest, and the Gulf of Alaska;\n            (3) in recent years, harmful algal blooms have resulted in \n        massive fish kills, the deaths of numerous endangered West \n        Indian manatees, beach and shellfish bed closures, threats to \n        public health and safety, and concern among the public about \n        the safety of seafood;\n            (4) according to scientists, the factors causing or \n        contributing to harmful algal blooms may include excessive \n        nutrients in coastal waters, other forms of pollution, the \n        transfer of harmful species through ship ballast water, and \n        ocean currents;\n            (5) harmful algal blooms have been responsible for an \n        estimated $1,000,000,000 in economic losses during the past \n        decade;\n            (6) harmful algal blooms and blooms of non-toxic algal \n        species can also lead directly to other damaging marine \n        conditions such as hypoxia (reduced oxygen concentrations), \n        which are harmful or fatal to fish, shellfish, and benthic \n        organisms;\n            (7) according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration in the Department of Commerce, 53 percent of \n        U.S. estuaries experience hypoxia for at least part of the year \n        and a 7,000 square mile area in the Gulf of Mexico off \n        Louisiana and Texas suffers from hypoxia, creating a massive \n        ``dead zone'' during much of the year where little or no marine \n        life exists;\n            (8) according to scientists, the primary factor known to \n        cause hypoxia is excessive nutrient loading into coastal \n        waters;\n            (9) there is a strong need to identify more workable and \n        effective actions to reduce nutrient loadings to coastal \n        waters;\n            (10) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n        through its ongoing research, education, grant, and coastal \n        resource management programs, possesses a full range of \n        capabilities necessary to support a near and long-term \n        comprehensive effort to prevent, reduce, and control harmful \n        algal blooms and hypoxia;\n            (11) funding for the research and related programs of the \n        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will aid in \n        improving the Nation's understanding and capabilities for \n        addressing the human and environmental costs associated with \n        harmful algal blooms and hypoxia; and\n            (12) other Federal agencies such as the Environmental \n        Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and the \n        National Science Foundation, along with the States, Indian \n        tribes, and local governments, conduct important work related \n        to the prevention, reduction, and control of harmful algal \n        blooms and hypoxia.\n\nSEC. 3.
