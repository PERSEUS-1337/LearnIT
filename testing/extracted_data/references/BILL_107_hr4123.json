FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Adult literacy and remedial education teachers provide \n        adults and out-of-school youths basic skills that equip them to \n        solve problems and become active participants in our society, \n        to hold a job, and to further their education.\n            (2) Students in adult literacy and remedial education \n        classes are made up of those who dropped out of school or have \n        passed through the school system without an adequate education. \n        It also includes students who want to take the General \n        Educational Development examination and, increasingly, \n        immigrants whose native language is not English.\n            (3) In the year 1998, there were over 4,000,000 students \n        enrolled in adult education programs throughout the United \n        States.\n            (4) Nearly one-fourth of the 4,000,000 students enrolled \n        were unemployed. Another 24 percent were working poor. Welfare \n        recipients comprised almost 10 percent of all students in 1998.\n            (5) That same year, there were 177,943 adult education \n        instructors. Nearly 23,000 of those were working full-time, \n        with another 69,129 working part-time. The remaining 85,924 \n        teachers were volunteers.\n            (6) Adult education has been shown to assist persons in \n        achieving job skills and gain or advance in employment. For \n        example, in 1998, over 150,000 adult education students went on \n        to do other training; nearly 300,000 students retained, \n        advanced, or gained employment.\n            (7) As employers increasingly require a more literate \n        workforce, workers' demand will grow for all types of literacy \n        and remedial classes.\n            (8) A softening economy may require more students to obtain \n        additional education to get a job.\n            (9) Adult education instructors often feel they are not as \n        respected by education departments as their general education \n        peers. Funding is generally inadequate, and resources are often \n        old or nonexistent. Funding level changes can cause the number \n        of teaching jobs to fluctuate from year to year.\n            (10) Median hourly earnings of adult literacy and remedial \n        education teachers and high school equivalency instructors were \n        $16.12 in 2000. Yet, many adult education teachers have high \n        student loans that they need to repay.\n\nSEC. 3.
