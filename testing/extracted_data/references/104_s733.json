FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) intercity passenger rail service is an essential \n        component of an integrated national transportation system;\n            (2) Amtrak must lessen its dependence on Federal operating \n        support and instead enter into more sustaining partnerships \n        with States, multi-State regions, and localities;\n            (3) intercity passenger rail service can play a significant \n        role in reducing traffic congestion, improve national ambient \n        air quality standards, and lower fuel consumption;\n            (4) since certain major rail corridors clearly meet the \n        description of National Highway System principal arterial \n        routes in section 103(b)(1) of title 23, United States Code, by \n        serving major population centers, major travel destinations, \n        and other intermodal transportation facilities, the corridors \n        should be designated as part of the mapped National Highway \n        System;\n            (5) since intercity passenger rail service is often \n        provided in the same corridor as, or in proximity to, a \n        designated segment of the National Highway System or will \n        improve the level of service on a National Highway System \n        segment, the service should be eligible for funding under \n        section 103(i) of title 23, United States Code;\n            (6) States should be given the maximum flexibility in the \n        use of Federal transportation funds provided under titles 23 \n        and 49, United States Code, to provide--\n                    (A) transportation systems that reflect local \n                priorities; and\n                    (B) the highest quality most appropriate \n                transportation services for citizens of the States; and\n            (7) Federal law should not restrict the rights of States to \n        use their Federal transportation allocation for intercity \n        passenger rail service.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF CERTAIN CORRIDORS AS PART OF NATIONAL HIGHWAY \n              SYSTEM.\n\n    Section 103 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by \ninserting after subsection (b) the following:\n    ``(c) Rail Lines and Related Facilities.--The National Highway \nSystem as designated pursuant to this section shall include the rail \nlines and related facilities owned or used by the National Railroad \nPassenger Corporation for the provision of intercity passenger service \nbetween Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, District of Columbia \n(including the rail lines owned by the Corporation between \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and between \nNew Haven, Connecticut, and Springfield, Massachusetts); between New \nYork, New York, and Albany, New York; between Albany, New York, and \nBuffalo, New York; between Washington, District of Columbia, and \nRichmond, Virginia; between Raleigh, North Carolina, and Charlotte, \nNorth Carolina; between Miami, Florida, and Tampa, Florida (through \nWest Palm Beach, Florida, and Orlando, Florida); between Detroit, \nMichigan, and Chicago, Illinois; between Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and \nChicago, Illinois; between St. Louis, Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois; \nbetween San Diego, California, and Sacramento, California (through Los \nAngeles, California, and Oakland, California); and between Eugene, \nOregon, and Vancouver, British Columbia (through Portland, Oregon).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
