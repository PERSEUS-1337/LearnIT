The Secretary shall complete \n        such a review not later than 6 months after the date of the \n        enactment of this subsection, and not later than the end of \n        each 1-year period thereafter.\n            ``(2) Review elements.--In conducting each review under \n        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall do the following with \n        respect to the export controls requiring a license described in \n        paragraph (1):\n                    ``(A) Objectives of controls.--The Secretary shall \n                identify the specific objectives of the export \n                controls, for the 12-month period following the \n                completion of the review, for each country or group of \n                countries for which a validated license is required. \n                When an objective of an export control is to defer the \n                development of a specific capability in such country or \n                group of countries, the Secretary shall specify for \n                what period of time the controls are expected to defer \n                such capability.\n                    ``(B) Quantity and performance.--The Secretary \n                shall estimate, for the 12-month period described in \n                subparagraph (A), the quantities and performance (as \n                specified in specific performance parameters on the \n                control list) of the goods and technology to which the \n                controls apply that must be obtained by each country or \n                group of countries for which a validated license is \n                required in order to defeat the objectives of the \n                export controls.\n                    ``(C) Availability to controlled destinations.--The \n                Secretary shall evaluate the effectiveness of the \n                export controls in achieving their specific objectives, \n                including explicit descriptions of the availability \n                from sources outside the United States, or from sources \n                inside the United States resulting from the inability \n                of the United States Government to effectively enforce \n                controls, during the 12-month period described in \n                subparagraph (A), to controlled countries of goods and \n                technology to which the export controls apply.\n                    ``(D) Economic impact.--The Secretary shall \n                evaluate the economic impact, during the 12-month \n                period described in subparagraph (A), of the export \n                controls on exporting companies, including estimates of \n                lost sales, loss in market share, and administrative \n                overhead.\n            ``(3) Changes in controls.--\n                    ``(A) Changes.--After completing each review under \n                this subsection, the Secretary shall, if warranted by \n                the findings of the review and after consultation with \n                appropriate departments or agencies--\n                            ``(i) eliminate the requirement for an \n                        export license for a particular good or \n                        technology;\n                            ``(ii) make such a good or technology \n                        eligible for delivery under a distribution \n                        license or other license authorizing multiple \n                        exports;\n                            ``(iii) eliminate a performance threshold \n                        or other characteristic upon which the \n                        requirement for a validated license for such a \n                        good or technology is based;
