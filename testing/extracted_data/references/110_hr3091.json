PATSY MINK.\n\n    Title VII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1133 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new part:\n\n                   ``PART E--PATSY T. MINK FELLOWSHIP\n\n``SEC. 771. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; DESIGNATION.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following\n            ``(1) While minority college enrollment continues to grow, \n        rising to 28 percent in 1999-2000, the employment of women and \n        minorities as faculty in higher education continues to lag \n        behind, especially among American Indian and Alaskan Natives, \n        and women of color in the professoriate.\n            ``(2) In the fall of 1999, total employment of faculty in \n        all sectors in instruction and research was 1,027,830, only 14 \n        percent of whom were minorities, including 5 percent African \n        American; 5 percent Asia/Pacific Islanders; 3 percent Hispanic \n        American; and 0.5 percent American Indian/Alaskan Native; with \n        one-half of all collegiate faculty being white males and 35 \n        percent white females.\n            ``(3) In the fall of 1999, African American faculty totaled \n        53,401, Hispanic American faculty totaled 30,961, Asian/Pacific \n        Islander faculty totaled 48,892, and American Indian/Alaskan \n        Native faculty were just 4,429 of the 1,027,830 faculty \n        employed in all degree-granting institutions of higher \n        education.\n            ``(4) In the Fall of 1999, women made up over one-third of \n        full-time instructional faculty, ranging from 49 percent of \n        faculty at public two-year institutions to less than 30 percent \n        of faculty at research universities; with men outnumbering \n        women in all faculty rank categories except the two less-senior \n        positions of Instructor and Lecturer.\n            ``(5) The maldistribution and absence of minority faculty \n        frequently places minority students in institutional and \n        educational environments in which they encounter no teachers, \n        counselors, or advisors, mentor and professional or personal \n        role models to ensure student progress and academic success.\n            ``(6) The presence of minority and women faculty at all \n        levels in the higher education professoriate will help \n        facilitate student access, increase student retention and \n        persistence, and strengthen the academic environment for all \n        students.\n    ``(b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this part to provide a program \nof fellowship awards to assist highly qualified minorities and women to \nacquire the terminal masters degree or the doctorate degree in academic \nareas in which such individuals are underrepresented for the purpose of \nentering the higher education professoriate.\n    ``(c) Eligible Institutions.--For purposes of this part, the term \n`eligible institution' means an institution of higher education, or a \nconsortium of such institutions, that offers a program of post-\nbaccalaureate study leading to a graduate degree.\n    ``(d) Designation.--Each recipient of a fellowship award from an \ninstitution receiving a grant under this subpart shall be known as a \n`Patsy T. Mink Graduate Fellow'.\n\n``SEC. 772. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    ``(a) Grants By Secretary.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall make grants to \n        eligible institutions of higher education to enable such \n        institutions to make fellowship awards to qualified students in \n        accordance with the provisions of this part.\n            ``(2) Priority consideration.--In making grant awards under \n        this part, the Secretary shall consider the applicant \n        institution's prior experience in producing doctorates and \n        terminal masters degree holders who are minorities and females, \n        and shall give priority consideration in making grants under \n        this part to those institutions with a demonstrated record of \n        producing minorities and women who have earned such degrees.\n    ``(b) Distribution and Amounts of Grants.--\n            ``(1) Equitable distribution.--In making such grants the \n        Secretary shall, to the maximum extent feasible, ensure an \n        equitable geographic distribution of awards and an equitable \n        distribution among eligible public and private institutions of \n        higher education that apply for grants under this part and that \n        demonstrate the institution's ability to achieve the purpose of \n        this part.\n            ``(2) Special rule.--To the maximum extent practical, the \n        Secretary shall award at least 50 percent of the amount \n        appropriated pursuant under this part to institutions of higher \n        education eligible for assistance under titles III and V, or to \n        consortia composed of otherwise eligible institutions of higher \n        education and such minority-serving institutions.\n            ``(3) Allocation.--In making such grants the Secretary \n        shall, consistent with paragraphs (1) and (2), allocate \n        appropriated funds to those institutions whose applications \n        indicate their ability to significantly increase the numbers of \n        minorities and women entering the higher education \n        professoriate and that commit institutional resources to the \n        attainment of the purpose of this part. No grant made under \n        this part shall support fewer than fifteen degree candidates \n        consistent with section 774(b).\n            ``(4) Reallotment.--Whenever the Secretary determines that \n        an institution of higher education is unable to utilize all of \n        the amounts made available to it under this part, the Secretary \n        shall, on such dates during the fiscal year as the Secretary \n        may determine, reallocate such unused amounts to institutions \n        which demonstrate that they can use any reallocated grant funds \n        to make fellowship awards to qualified individuals under this \n        part.\n\n``SEC. 773.
