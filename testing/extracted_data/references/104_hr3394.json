    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This section may be cited as the ``Low-Level Radioactive Waste \nPolicy Act of 1996''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) Compact.--The term ``compact'' means a compact entered \n        into by 2 or more States under section 4 of the Low-Level \n        Radioactive Waste Policy Act.\n            (2) Compact region.--The term ``compact region'' means the \n        area consisting of all the States that are members of the \n        compact.\n            (3) Disposal.--The term ``disposal'' means the permanent \n        isolation of low-level radioactive waste pursuant to the \n        requirements established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n            (4) Generate.--The term ``generate'', when used in relation \n        to low-level radioactive waste, means to produce low-level \n        radioactive waste.\n            (5) Low-level radioactive waste.--The term ``low-level \n        radioactive waste'' means radioactive material that--\n                    (A) is not highly radioactive waste, spent nuclear \n                fuel, or byproduct material (as defined in section \n                11e.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n                2014(e)(2)))--\n                            (i) owned or generated by the Department of \n                        Energy;\n                            (ii) owned or generated by the United \n                        States Navy as the result of the decommission \n                        of vessels of the United States Navy; or\n                            (iii) owned or generated as a result of any \n                        research, development, testing, or production \n                        of any atomic weapons;\n                    (B) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, consistent \n                with existing law and in accordance with subparagraph \n                (A), classifies as low-level radioactive waste; and\n                    (C) consists of or contains class A, B, or C \n                radioactive waste as defined by regulations published \n                at section 61.55 of title 10, Code of Federal \n                Regulations, as in effect on January 26, 1983.\n            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'', unless otherwise \n        specified, means the Secretary of the Interior.\n            (7) Sited compact region.--The term ``sited compact \n        region'' means a compact region in which there is located one \n        of the following disposal facilities: Barnwell in the State of \n        South Carolina and Richland in the State of Washington. A \n        region ceases to be a sited compact region if, for any reason, \n        the disposal facility located in the region ceases to accept \n        waste.\n            (8) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n        United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth \n        of Puerto Rico.\n\nSEC. 3. DUTY TO DISPOSE OF LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE.\n\n    The Secretary shall dispose of low-level radioactive waste \ngenerated within any State outside a sited compact region. Each sited \ncompact region shall provide for the disposal of low-level radioactive \nwaste generated within the sited compact region. A State outside a \nsited compact region may provide for the disposal within that State of \nany low-level radioactive waste generated within that State, except \nthat such a State shall not be required to accept low-level radioactive \nwaste generated outside that State, except under contract with the \nSecretary under section 5.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF DISPOSAL FACILITY.\n\n    The Secretary shall establish a disposal facility for low-level \nradioactive waste on land owned by the Federal Government, and may \ncontract with the Department of Energy for disposal of low-level \nradioactive waste at a disposal facility established by the Department \nof Energy for radioactive waste as described in clause (i), (ii), or \n(iii) of section 2(5)(A).\n\nSEC. 5. ACCEPTANCE OF LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE.\n\n    Not later than January 1, 1997, the Secretary shall accept for \ndisposal any low-level radioactive waste generated within any State \noutside a sited compact region. Notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw, no later than January 1, 1997, the Secretary shall contract with \nthe Secretary of Energy for the temporary storage of low-level \nradioactive waste at any facility established by the Department of \nEnergy for radioactive waste as described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) \nof section 2(5)(A) and may contract with the Secretary of Energy for \ndisposal of such waste at any such facility or may contract with any \nState for disposal of such waste at any licensed disposal facility \noperated to dispose of low-level radioactive waste generated within \nthat State. The Secretary shall take physical possession of low-level \nradioactive waste tendered consistent with this Act by a waste \ngenerator or broker or by a State official charged with regulating \npossession of radioactive materials beginning on January 1, 1997, \nwhether or not a contract with the Secretary of Energy has been \nexecuted.\n\nSEC. 6. RATES FOR DISPOSAL.\n\n    The Secretary shall establish by regulation rates for the disposal \nof low-level radioactive waste accepted for disposal. The rates shall \nprovide for recovery of the actual costs of disposal and the \nadministrative costs of the Secretary to contract with the Secretary of \nEnergy as provided in section 5. Rates may be based upon volume or \nactivity of waste, or a combination of the two, except that the rate \nshall not exceed an average rate of $500 per cubic foot of waste \ndisposed.\n\nSEC. 7. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) Repeal.--The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (42 U.S.C. \n2021b et seq.) is repealed.\n    (b) Duties of the Secretary of the Interior.--Section 441 of the \nRevised Statutes (43 U.S.C. 1457) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n            ``14. Commercial Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal \n        (other than greater than Class C).''."
