FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Russian Federation uses corruption as a strategic \n        tool to erode democratic governance from within and discredit \n        the liberal democratic system, thereby strengthening Russia's \n        sphere of influence.\n            (2) Russia's ultimate goal is to dissolve the transatlantic \n        union by capitalizing on and exacerbating existing tensions \n        within European countries.\n            (3) In 2016, the Center for Strategic and International \n        Studies (CSIS) and the Centre for the Study of Democracy \n        concluded that Russia has cultivated an opaque network of \n        patronage across the region that it uses to influence and \n        direct decision-making. Russia seeks to gain influence over if \n        not control of critical state institutions, bodies, and the \n        economy and uses this influence to shape national policies and \n        decisions.\n            (4) Central and Eastern European leaders, including those \n        from Romania, the Czech Republic, Latvia, and Poland, have \n        warned that Russia engages in economic warfare by using \n        politically motivated investments to advance its agenda, and \n        seeks to challenge the transatlantic orientation of Central and \n        Eastern Europe.\n            (5) While countries along Russia's border, especially the \n        Baltic countries, Ukraine, and Georgia, are under threat from \n        Moscow's malign influence and military aggression, corruption \n        is also part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy to use direct \n        and indirect action to coerce, destabilize and exercise malign \n        influence over other countries.\n            (6) Much like a virus, malign Russian-fueled corruption \n        inconspicuously penetrates a country through what appears to be \n        a host of legitimate financial transactions.\n            (7) According to CSIS, the corruption, often through opaque \n        financial transactions, infects various strategic sectors of \n        host economies, particularly energy, media, and financial \n        sectors. Over time, the host countries' institutions become \n        compromised and can no longer self-police or resist Russian \n        influence, thereby allowing Russian control over the \n        government.\n            (8) In France, Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom, \n        Russia directly supports entities that feed directly off lack \n        of confidence and trust in democratic systems, which enhances \n        the popularity of extreme parties.\n            (9) The United States intelligence community concluded that \n        Russia deployed similar tactics in the 2016 United States \n        elections in order to erode public confidence and trust in the \n        United States political system.\n            (10) This strategy exploits the inherent openness and \n        vulnerabilities within Western capitalist systems. To combat \n        it, the United States must support efforts of foreign partner \n        countries to investigate corruption and strengthen fiscal \n        transparency.\n            (11) Only through strengthening Western governance and \n        institutions will the United States and its partners thwart \n        Russian tactics of corruption and exploitation and prevent \n        Russia's virus-like corruption from eroding democracy in the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
