    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) As the telecommunications industry has moved toward \n        competition in the provision of long distance telephone \n        services, consumers have increasingly elected to change the \n        carriers that provide their long distance telephone services. \n        As many as 50,000,000 consumers now change long distance \n        telephone service providers each year.\n            (2) The fluid nature of the market for long distance \n        telephone services has also allowed an increasing number of \n        unauthorized changes of telephone service providers to occur. \n        Such changes have been called ``slamming'', a term which \n        denotes any practice in which a consumer's long distance \n        telephone service provider is changed without the consumer's \n        knowledge or consent.\n            (3) Slamming accounts for the largest number of consumer \n        complaints received by the Common Carrier Bureau of the Federal \n        Communications Commission. As many as 1,000,000 consumers are \n        subject to the unauthorized change of telephone service \n        providers each year.\n            (4) The increased costs which consumers face as a result of \n        the unauthorized change of telephone service providers threaten \n        to deprive consumers of the financial benefits created by a \n        competitive marketplace in telephone services.\n            (5) The burdens placed upon consumers by unauthorized \n        changes of telephone service providers will expand \n        exponentially as competition enters into the markets for \n        intraLATA and local telephone services.\n            (6) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to combat \n        unauthorized changes of telephone service providers by \n        requiring that a provider who changes a subscriber without \n        authorization pay the previously selected carrier an amount \n        equal to all charges paid by the subscriber after the change. \n        The Federal Communications Commission has proposed regulations \n        to implement this requirement. Implementing these regulations \n        will eliminate many of the financial incentives to execute \n        unauthorized changes of telephone service providers. However, \n        under current and proposed regulations consumers have, and will \n        continue to face, difficulty in securing proof of unauthorized \n        changes. Thus, enforcement of the regulations will be impeded \n        by a lack of tangible proof of consumer consent to the change \n        of telephone service providers.\n            (7) The interests of consumers require that telephone \n        service providers maintain evidence of their verification of \n        consumer consent to changes in telephone service providers. \n        This evidence should take the form of a consumer's written \n        consent or a recording of a consumer's oral consent obtained by \n        the telephone service provider or a third party.\n            (8) Both Congress and the Federal Communications Commission \n        should continue to examine electronic means by which consumers \n        could most readily change telephone service providers while \n        ensuring that such changes would result only from consumer \n        action evidencing express consent to such changes.\n            (9) By providing consumers with a private right of action \n        in State court, if State law permits, against those who have \n        executed unauthorized changes of telephone service providers, \n        Congress insures in a constitutional manner that neither \n        Federal nor State courts will be overburdened with litigation, \n        while also providing the proper forum for such actions given \n        that competition will soon come to all segments of the \n        telephone service market.\n            (10) The majority of consumers who have been subject to the \n        unauthorized change of telephone service do not seek redress \n        through the Federal Communications Commission. In light of the \n        general responsibilities of the States for consumer protection, \n        as well as the prosecutions against unauthorized changes \n        already undertaken by the States, it is essential that the \n        States be allowed to pursue actions on behalf of their \n        citizens, while also preserving the proper role of the Federal \n        Communications Commission in regulating the telecommunications \n        industry.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect consumers from unauthorized changes of \n        telephone service providers;\n            (2) to allow the efficient prosecution of legal actions \n        against telephone service providers who defraud consumers by \n        transferring telephone service providers without consumer \n        consent; and\n            (3) to facilitate the ready selection of telephone service \n        providers by consumers.\n\nSEC. 2.
