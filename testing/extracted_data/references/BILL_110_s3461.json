FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Various entities across the United States have \n        generated skills certification programs based on local and \n        regional needs. At the same time, some national groups have \n        engaged in similar efforts.\n            (2) As State and local workforce investment boards, \n        workers, and employers search for a meaningful way to \n        categorize skills, information about existing skills \n        certification programs and certifications can be limited, and \n        may lead to the development of new, duplicative certifications.\n            (3) As these skill certification programs may take less \n        time than technical or vocational degrees, the programs provide \n        important recognition for both employers and employees.\n            (4) Nationally available, recognized standards for skills \n        certification allow employers and employees the greatest \n        possible flexibility by making the certification portable and \n        meaningful.\n            (5) These standards benefit both incumbent, highly skilled \n        workers and those workers with less specialized skills or just \n        starting in the workforce.\n            (6) Widely recognized standards for skills certification \n        provide States, regions, communities, and cities the option and \n        ability to quantify and categorize their workforce in a \n        meaningful way.\n            (7) There is a well-documented ``skills gap'' in many \n        industries, including manufacturing, that makes it difficult \n        for employers to find workers.\n            (8) In 2005, 90 percent of manufacturing employers say a \n        shortage of qualified production workers is their top workforce \n        issue.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to periodically evaluate skills certification programs \n        that certify various employee skills and to determine which \n        skills certifications are most desired by employers and \n        employees; and\n            (2) to make information, and materials if possible, about \n        skills certification programs available to eligible entities \n        providing job training.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Local board.--The term ``local board'' means a local \n        workforce investment board established under section 117 of the \n        Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2832).\n            (2) Skills certification program.--The term ``skills \n        certification program'' means an industry-led or industry-\n        created program that--\n                    (A) receives Federal funding;\n                    (B) is in existence as of the time that the \n                evaluation under section 5 is conducted;\n                    (C) delineates a skill set necessary for a career \n                in a certain industry;\n                    (D) does not culminate in an associate or \n                baccalaureate degree; and\n                    (E) is not portable or widely or nationally \n                recognized.\n            (3) State board.--The term ``State board'' means a State \n        workforce investment board established under section 111 of the \n        Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2821).\n\nSEC. 5.

and\n                    (B) ways to streamline, if possible, duplicative \n                and similar skills certification programs into a \n                single, widely recognized certification.\n    (b) Criteria for Evaluations.--The evaluation of the skills \ncertification programs conducted under subsection (a)(1) shall include \nthe following criteria:\n            (1) Overall usefulness of the skills certification program \n        for workers and employers.\n            (2) The demand from industry for workers with the skills \n        provided and certified through the skills certification \n        program.\n            (3) Industry involvement in the development of the skill \n        standards included in the skills certification program.\n            (4) Industry recognition of the certification awarded under \n        the skills certification program.\n            (5) The success of the skills certification program, based \n        on criteria including--\n                    (A) how many individuals have successfully \n                completed the skills certification program;\n                    (B) how many of such individuals are employed in a \n                field utilizing the skills provided and certified \n                through the skills certification program;
