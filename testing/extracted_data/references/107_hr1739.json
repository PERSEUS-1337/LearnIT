    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Sprawl and Smart Growth Study \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Urban sprawl destroys valuable open space, farmland, \n        wildlife, and natural, cultural, scenic, and recreational \n        resources.\n            (2) Urban sprawl also leads to costly public expenditures \n        for infrastructure, public schools, and transportation for \n        newly developed areas while causing disinvestment in the urban \n        cores of cities and towns.\n            (3) Smart growth can prevent these problems and help \n        enhance the quality of life for everyone.\n            (4) Although growth management is primarily a State, \n        tribal, and local responsibility, the effects of Federal \n        actions contributing to or avoiding urban sprawl can be \n        considerable.\n            (5) Federal agencies can benefit from additional guidance \n        to improve the use of environmental impact statements and \n        environmental assessments in considering the potential effects \n        of their proposed actions on urban sprawl and smart growth.\n\nSEC. 3. SMART GROWTH STUDY.\n\n    (a) Study Required.--The Council on Environmental Quality shall \nconduct a study of urban sprawl and smart growth that updates and \nbuilds on the Council's 1974 study entitled ``The Costs of Sprawl'' and \nthe Council's 1981 study entitled ``National Agricultural Lands \nStudy''.\n    (b) Examination of Environmental Impact Statements.--In conducting \nthe study, the Council shall select and examine a variety of \nenvironmental impact statements and environmental assessments by a \nminimum of 15 Federal agencies, that were completed after 1995 for land \nand facility management, transportation and infrastructure, and \nregulatory and development assistance programs, including rural, urban, \nand tribal assistance.\n    (c) Public Participation.--The Council shall provide opportunities \nfor public participation in the study, including by--\n            (1) conducting public meetings in at least 5 cities that, \n        as determined by the Council, are each located--\n                    (A) in a different region of the United States; and\n                    (B) in an area that is experiencing an increase in \n                urban sprawl;\n            (2) making electronically accessible to the public \n        information on the study and related documents; and\n            (3) holding discussions with Federal, State, and local \n        government personnel and representatives of Indian tribes \n        involved in the process of formulating environmental impact \n        statements and environmental assessments.\n    (d) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Council shall submit a report to the \nCommittee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate describing the \nresults of the study, including the following:\n            (1) Findings of the Council concerning the economic, \n        environmental, and land use effects of urban sprawl, such as \n        those relating to energy, transportation, housing, schools, \n        small business, Government facilities and military \n        installations, public lands and forests, parks and recreation, \n        agriculture and rural landscapes, air and water, and natural, \n        scenic, and cultural resources.\n            (2) Recommendations for improving environmental reviews by \n        Federal agencies to more adequately address urban sprawl.\n            (3) Recommendations for nonregulatory actions that may be \n        taken by Federal agencies to--\n                    (A) assist States and local communities in efforts \n                to promote the beneficial effects of smart growth; and\n                    (B) minimize actions by the agencies that result in \n                adverse effects of urban sprawl.\n    (e) Participation of Other Agencies.--In carrying out this section, \nthe Council should seek the participation of other Federal agencies.\n    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Council $300,000 for the purpose of carrying out \nthis section, in addition to any other amounts that are available for \nsuch purpose.\n\nSEC. 4. COMMENTS ON URBAN SPRAWL.\n\n    In any written comment prepared under section 309 of the Clean Air \nAct (42 U.S.C. 7609) for any matter contained in any proposed \nlegislation, Federal project, Federal agency action, or proposed \nregulation described in clause (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a) of \nthat section, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \nshall address the impact of the matter on urban sprawl.\n\nSEC. 5. NOTIFICATION, CONSULTATION, AND CONSIDERATION OF EFFECTS BEFORE \n              DETERMINING WHETHER TO PREPARE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \n              STATEMENT.\n\n    (a) Notice and Comment.--In preparing an environmental assessment \nfor a proposed Federal action and before determining whether to prepare \nan environmental impact statement for the action, the head of a Federal \nagency shall--\n            (1) publish notice of the action in the Federal Register \n        and local newspapers of general circulation;\n            (2) directly notify persons that may be affected by the \n        proposed Federal action, including each State government, local \n        government, Indian tribe, and private property owner that may \n        be so affected;\n            (3) conduct discussions with such persons on the proposed \n        action and its alternatives; and\n            (4) seek to address such persons' concerns, if any.\n    (b) Consideration of Request for Environmental Impact Statement.--\nIf the Governor of a State or the head of a local government or Indian \ntribe referred to in subsection (a)(1) submits in writing to the head \nof the Federal agency a statement that the proposed Federal action will \nresult in urban sprawl significantly affecting the quality of the human \nenvironment and a request for preparation of an environmental impact \nstatement for the proposed Federal action, the head of the Federal \nagency shall give great weight to the request in determining whether to \nprepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed Federal \naction.\n    (c) Publication of Environmental Assessment.--If, after receiving a \nwritten statement and request for an environmental impact statement \nunder subsection (b) for a proposed Federal action, the head of a \nFederal agency determines that the environmental impact statement is \nnot required by section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy \nAct of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)), the agency head shall--\n            (1) include in an environmental assessment for the action \n        an explanation of why the proposed action will not result in \n        urban sprawl significantly affecting the quality of the human \n        environment;\n            (2) provide public notice of the availability of the \n        assessment in the Federal Register and local newspapers of \n        general circulation; and\n            (3) transmit a copy of the assessment to the Council on \n        Environmental Quality.\n    (d) Urban Sprawl.--The head of a Federal agency shall include in an \nenvironmental impact statement requested pursuant to subsection (b), \nfor each alternative included in the statement under section \n102(2)(C)(iii) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(iii)), an analysis of the environmental effects of \nthe action on urban sprawl.\n\nSEC. 6.
