FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Postpartum depression is a devastating mood disorder \n        which strikes many women during and after pregnancy.\n            (2) Postpartum mood changes are common and can be broken \n        into three subgroups: ``baby blues,'' which is an extremely \n        common and the less severe form of postpartum depression; \n        postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, which are more severe \n        than baby blues and can occur during pregnancy and anytime \n        within the first year of the infant's birth; and postpartum \n        psychosis, which is the most extreme form of postpartum \n        depression and can occur during pregnancy and up to twelve \n        months after delivery.\n            (3) ``Baby blues'' is characterized by mood swings, \n        feelings of being overwhelmed, tearfulness, irritability, poor \n        sleep, mood changes, and a sense of vulnerability.\n            (4) The symptoms of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders \n        are the worsening and the continuation of the baby blues beyond \n        the first days or weeks after delivery.\n            (5) The symptoms of postpartum psychosis include losing \n        touch with reality, distorted thinking, delusions, auditory \n        hallucinations, paranoia, hyperactivity, and rapid speech or \n        mania.\n            (6) Each year over 400,000 women suffer from postpartum \n        mood changes, with baby blues afflicting up to 80 percent of \n        new mothers; postpartum mood and anxiety disorders impairing \n        around 10-20 percent of new mothers; and postpartum psychosis \n        striking 1 in 1,000 new mothers.\n            (7) The causes of postpartum depression are complex and \n        unknown at this time; however, theories include a steep and \n        rapid drop in hormone levels after childbirth; difficulty \n        during labor or pregnancy; a premature birth; a miscarriage; \n        feeling overwhelmed, uncertain, frustrated or anxious about \n        one's new role as a mother; a lack of support from one's \n        spouse, friends or family; marital strife; stressful events in \n        life such as death of a loved one, financial problems, or \n        physical or mental abuse; a family history of depression or \n        mood disorders; a previous history of major depression or \n        anxiety; or a prior postpartum depression.\n            (8) Postpartum depression is a treatable disorder if \n        promptly diagnosed by a trained provider and attended to with a \n        personalized regimen of care including social support, therapy, \n        medication, and when necessary hospitalization.\n            (9) All too often postpartum depression goes undiagnosed or \n        untreated due to the social stigma surrounding depression and \n        mental illness, the myth of motherhood, the new mother's \n        inability to self-diagnose her condition, the new mother's \n        shame or embarrassment over discussing her depression so near \n        to the birth of her child, the lack of understanding in society \n        and the medical community of the complexity of postpartum \n        depression, and economic pressures placed on hospitals and \n        providers.\n            (10) Untreated, postpartum depression can lead to further \n        depression, substance abuse, loss of employment, divorce and \n        further social alienation, self-destructive behavior, or even \n        suicide.\n            (11) Untreated, postpartum depression impacts society \n        through its affect on the infant's physical and psychological \n        development, child abuse, neglect or death of the infant or \n        other siblings, and the disruption of the family.\n\n        TITLE I--RESEARCH ON POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOSIS\n\nSEC. 101.
