    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Intermodal Equipment Safety and \nResponsibility Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Promoting safety on United States highways is a \n        national priority. The Secretary of Transportation has \n        promulgated the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to \n        further this purpose. The systematic maintenance, repair, and \n        inspection of equipment traveling on public highways in \n        interstate commerce are an integral part of this safety regime.\n            (2) Intermodal transportation plays a significant role in \n        expanding the United States economy, which depends heavily upon \n        the ability to transport goods by various modes of \n        transportation.\n            (3) Although motor carriers and their drivers often receive \n        trailers, chassis, containers, and other items of intermodal \n        equipment to be transported in interstate commerce, they do not \n        possess the requisite level of control or authority over this \n        intermodal equipment to perform the systematic maintenance, \n        repair, and inspection necessary to ensure compliance with the \n        applicable Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and to \n        ensure the safety of United States highways.\n            (4) As a result of roadside inspections, motor carriers and \n        their drivers are cited and fined for violations of the Federal \n        Motor Carrier Safety Regulations attributable to intermodal \n        equipment that they do not have the opportunity to \n        systematically maintain. These violations negatively affect the \n        safety records of motor carriers.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to ensure that only those parties that \ncontrol intermodal equipment transported on public highways in the \nUnited States (and thus have the opportunity and authority to \nsystematically maintain, repair, and inspect the intermodal equipment) \nhave legal responsibility for the safety of that equipment as it \ntravels in interstate commerce.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 5901 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following new paragraphs:\n            ``(9) `motor carrier' includes--\n                    ``(A) a motor private carrier, as defined in \n                section 13102 of this title; and\n                    ``(B) an agent of a motor carrier.\n            ``(10) `intermodal equipment'--\n                    ``(A) means equipment that is commonly used in the \n                intermodal transportation of freight over public \n                highways as an instrumentality of foreign or interstate \n                commerce; and\n                    ``(B) includes a trailer, chassis, container, and \n                any device associated with a trailer, chassis, or \n                container.\n            ``(11) `equipment interchange agreement', with respect to \n        intermodal equipment, means a written document that--\n                    ``(A) is executed by a controller of the equipment, \n                or its agent, and a motor carrier; and\n                    ``(B) establishes the responsibilities and \n                liabilities of both parties as they relate to the \n                interchange of the equipment.\n            ``(12) `controller', with respect to intermodal equipment, \n        means any party that has any legal right, title, or interest in \n        the equipment, except that a motor carrier--\n                    ``(A) is not a controller of the equipment solely \n                because it provides or arranges for any part of the \n                intermodal transportation of the equipment; and\n                    ``(B) may not be considered a controller of the \n                equipment if authority for systematic maintenance and \n                repairs of the equipment has not been delegated to the \n                motor carrier.\n            ``(13) `interchange', with respect to intermodal equipment, \n        means the act of providing the equipment to a motor carrier for \n        the purpose of transporting the equipment for loading or \n        unloading by any party or repositioning the equipment for the \n        benefit of the equipment controller, except that such term does \n        not mean the leasing of the equipment to a motor carrier for \n        use in the motor carrier's over-the-road freight hauling \n        operations.\n            ``(14) `applicable safety regulations' means the \n        regulations applicable to controllers of intermodal equipment \n        under section 5909 of this title.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
