FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) International organizations and other multilateral \n        institutions play a key role in United States foreign policy \n        and serve key United States foreign policy objectives, such as \n        obligating all countries to freeze assets of terrorist groups, \n        preventing the proliferation of chemical, biological and \n        nuclear weapons, and spearheading the fight to combat the \n        ravages of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n            (2) Decisions at many international organizations, \n        including membership and key positions, remain subject to \n        determinations made by regional groups where democratic states \n        are often in the minority and where there is intensive \n        cooperation among repressive regimes. As a result, the United \n        States has often been blocked in its attempts to take action in \n        these institutions to advance its goals and objectives, \n        including at the United Nations Human Rights Commission (where \n        a representative of Libya was elected as chairman and the \n        United States temporarily lost a seat).\n            (3) In order to address these shortcomings, the United \n        States must actively work to improve the workings of \n        international organizations and multilateral institutions, \n        particularly by creating a caucus of democratic countries that \n        will advance United States interests. In the Second Ministerial \n        Conference of the Community of Democracies in Seoul, Korea, on \n        November 10-20, 2002, numerous countries recommended working \n        together as a democracy caucus in international organizations \n        such as the United Nations and ensuring that international and \n        regional institutions develop and apply democratic standards \n        for member states.\n            (4) In addition, the United States has shortchanged its \n        ability to influence these organizations by failing to obtain \n        enough support for positions that are congruent to or \n        consistent with United States objectives and has not done \n        enough to build expertise in the United States Government in \n        the area of multilateral diplomacy.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRACY CAUCUS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The President of the United States, acting through \nthe Secretary of State and the relevant United States chiefs of \nmission, shall seek to establish a democracy caucus at the United \nNations, the United Nations Human Rights Commission, the United Nations \nConference on Disarmament, and at other broad-based international \norganizations.\n    (b) Purposes of the Caucus.--A democracy caucus at an international \norganization should--\n            (1) forge common positions, including, as appropriate, at \n        the ministerial level, on matters of concern before the \n        organization and work within and across regional lines to \n        promote agreed positions;\n            (2) work to revise an increasingly outmoded system of \n        regional voting and decision making; and\n            (3) set up a rotational leadership scheme to provide member \n        states an opportunity, for a set period of time, to serve as \n        the designated president of the caucus, responsible for serving \n        as its voice in each organization.\n\nSEC. 4. ANNUAL DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS ON MULTILATERAL ISSUES.\n\n    The Secretary of State, acting through the principal officers \nresponsible for advising the Secretary on international organizations, \nshall ensure that a high-level delegation from the United States \nGovernment, on an annual basis, is sent to consult with key foreign \ngovernments in every region in order to promote the United States \nagenda at key international fora, such as the United Nations General \nAssembly, United Nations Human Rights Commission, the United Nations \nEducation, Science, and Cultural Organization, and the International \nWhaling Commission.\n\nSEC. 5. LEADERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n    The President, acting through the Secretary of State and the \nrelevant United States chiefs of mission, shall use the voice, vote, \nand influence of the United States to--\n            (1) where appropriate, reform the criteria for leadership \n        and, in appropriate cases for membership, at all United Nations \n        bodies and at other international organizations and \n        multilateral institutions to which the United States is a \n        member so as to exclude nations that violate the principles of \n        the specific organization;\n            (2) make it a policy of the United Nations and other \n        international organizations and multilateral institutions, in \n        which the United States is a member, that a member state may \n        not stand in nomination or be in rotation for a leadership \n        position in such bodies if such member state is subject to \n        sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council; and\n            (3) work to ensure that no member state stand in nomination \n        or be in rotation for a leadership position in such \n        organizations if such member state is subject to a \n        determination under section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act \n        of 1961, section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, or section \n        6(j) of the Export Administration Act.\n\nSEC. 6.
