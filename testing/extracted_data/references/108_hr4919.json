    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Drug Card \nGuaranteed Savings Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Americans who buy their own prescription drugs often \n        pay twice as much for prescription drugs as consumers in \n        foreign nations or as the price the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs obtains by negotiating directly with the pharmaceutical \n        manufacturers. In some cases, older Americans pay 10 times more \n        for prescription drugs than such customers. Prescription drug \n        prices have increased 3.4 percent during the first quarter of \n        2004, nearly three times the rate of inflation.\n            (2) The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n        Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law No: 108-173) established \n        a program for the endorsement of medicare drug discount card \n        programs in order to provide for reduced prices for drugs for \n        medicare beneficiaries and provide a subsidy for low-income \n        medicare beneficiaries.\n            (3) There are currently more than 70 endorsed medicare drug \n        discount card programs. Medicare drug discount card programs \n        can change the drugs that they offer and the size of the \n        discounts every seven days. Medicare beneficiaries are allowed \n        to change their current medicare drug discount card program \n        only once, during an annual enrollment period between November \n        15 and December 31, 2004.\n            (4) Enrollment in medicare drug discount card programs has \n        been less than projected due to the complexity of the programs, \n        the limited number of drugs covered under most programs, the \n        changing prescription drug needs of beneficiaries, and \n        beneficiaries' concern that the programs do not guarantee real \n        savings on prescription drug purchases. As of July 19, 2004, \n        fewer than 14 percent of low-income medicare beneficiaries who \n        qualify for the $600 subsidy under the law have enrolled in a \n        medicare drug discount card program.\n            (5) Currently, medicare discount drug card sponsors are \n        required to pass on to enrollees only an undefined ``share'' of \n        the rebates they secure from drug manufacturers and card \n        sponsors can use the remaining savings for administrative costs \n        and profit. The law does not require the sponsors to reveal to \n        enrollees the size of the rebates secured from drug \n        manufacturers or to disclose what portion of those rebates are \n        kept by the sponsors and not passed on to enrollees.\n            (6) There is a need for a Federal national medicare \n        prescription drug discount card program that offers guaranteed \n        discounts on all prescription drugs and that aggregates the \n        buying power of all medicare beneficiaries in order to \n        negotiate significant reductions in price.\n\nSEC. 2.
