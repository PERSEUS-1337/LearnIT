FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The use of large sums of cash is one of the most \n        reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money \n        laundering, racketeering, tax evasion, and similar crimes.\n            (2) The prevention, investigation, and prosecution of such \n        crimes depends upon the ability of law enforcement to deter and \n        trace such movements of cash, and the failure to report such \n        movements accordingly undermines law enforcement's ability to \n        prevent and detect serious criminal activity.\n            (3) The nonreporting of large cash transactions or \n        movements, in contravention of the provisions of subchapter II \n        of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, and regulations \n        prescribed under such subchapter, is therefore itself a serious \n        crime.\n            (4) The intentional transportation into or out of the \n        United States of large amounts of currency or monetary \n        instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory \n        reporting provisions of such subchapter is the equivalent of, \n        and creates the same harm as, the smuggling of goods.\n            (5) The penalties in subchapter II of chapter 53 of title \n        31, United States Code, for nonreporting reflect the potential \n        harm caused by the crimes to which intentional nonreporting is \n        linked, and such penalties accordingly protect the following \n        important governmental interests:\n                    (A) The obligation of government to prevent the \n                manipulation of commerce and trade by criminals.\n                    (B) The cost to the government of investigating \n                criminal activity and enforcing the laws designed to \n                hinder such activity.\n                    (C) The government's underlying right to taxes \n                sought to be evaded through the movement of unreported \n                cash.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize forfeiture \nof any cash or instruments whose movements are not reported under the \nterms of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, \nand regulations prescribed under such chapter, to emphasize the \nseriousness of the act of such nonreporting, and to prescribe \nguidelines for determining the amount of property subject to such \nforfeiture in various situations.\n\nSEC. 3.
