FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Oil producing countries, including the nations of the \n        Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), took \n        concerted actions in March and September of 1999 to cut oil \n        production and hold back from the market 4,000,000 barrels a \n        day representing approximately six percent of the global \n        supply.\n            (2) OPEC, in its capacity as an oil cartel, has been a \n        critical factor in driving prices from approximately $11 a \n        barrel in December 1998 to a high of $30 a barrel in mid-\n        February 2000, levels not seen since the Persian Gulf Conflict.\n            (3) On February 10, 2000, a hearing before the Committee on \n        International Relations of the House of Representatives on \n        ``OPEC and the Northeast Energy Crisis'' clearly demonstrated \n        that OPEC's goal of reducing its oil stocks was the major \n        reason behind price increases in heating oil, gasoline, and \n        diesel oil stocks.\n            (4) During this hearing, the Assistant Secretary in the \n        Office of International Affairs of the Department of Energy \n        noted that artificial supply constraints placed on the market \n        are ultimately self-defeating in so far as they increase \n        volatility in the market, lead to boom and bust cycles, and \n        promote global instability, particularly in developing \n        countries whose economies are extremely vulnerable to sharp \n        price increases.\n            (5) These price increases have caused inflationary shocks \n        to the United States economy and could threaten the global \n        economic recovery now underway in Europe and Asia where the \n        demand for oil is rising.\n            (6) The transportation infrastructure of the United States \n        is under stress and tens of thousands of small- to medium-sized \n        trucking firms throughout the Northeast region are on the verge \n        of bankruptcy because of the rise in diesel oil prices to more \n        than $2 per gallon--a 43 percent increase in the Central \n        Atlantic region and a 55 percent increase in the New England \n        region--an increase that has had the effect of requiring these \n        trucking firms to use up to 20 percent of their operating \n        budgets for the purchase of diesel oil.\n            (7) Many elderly and retired Americans on fixed incomes \n        throughout the Northeast region of the United States cannot \n        afford to pay the prevailing heating oil costs and all too \n        often are faced with the choice of paying the grocery bills or \n        staying warm.\n            (8) Several key oil producing nations relied on the United \n        States military for their protection in 1990 and 1991, \n        including during the Persian Gulf Conflict, and these nations \n        still depend on the United States for their security.\n            (9) Many of these nations enjoy a close economic and \n        security relationship with the United States which is a \n        fundamental underpinning of global security and cooperation.\n            (10) A continuation of the present policies put in place at \n        the meeting of OPEC Ministers in March and September of 1999 \n        threatens the relationship that many of the OPEC nations enjoy \n        with the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) Policy With Respect to Oil Exporting Countries.--It shall be \nthe policy of the United States to consider the extent to which major \nnet oil exporting countries engage in oil price fixing to be an \nimportant determinant in the overall political, economic, and security \nrelationship between the United States and these countries.\n    (b) Policy With Respect to Oil Importing Countries.--It shall be \nthe policy of the United States to work multilaterally with other \ncountries that are major net oil importers to bring about the complete \ndismantlement of international oil price fixing arrangements.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nthe President shall transmit to the Congress a report that contains the \nfollowing:\n            (1) A description of the overall economic and security \n        relationship between the United States and each country that is \n        a major net oil exporter, including each country that is a \n        member of OPEC.\n            (2) A description of the effect that coordination among the \n        countries described in paragraph (1) with respect to oil \n        production and pricing has had on the United States economy and \n        global energy supplies.\n            (3) Detailed information on any and all assistance programs \n        under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export \n        Control Act, including licenses for the export of defense \n        articles and defense services under section 38 of such Act, \n        provided to the countries described in paragraph (1).\n            (4) A determination made by the President in accordance \n        with section 5 for each country described in paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 5. DETERMINATION BY THE PRESIDENT OF MAJOR OIL EXPORTING COUNTRIES \n              ENGAGED IN PRICE FIXING.\n\n    The report submitted pursuant to section 4 shall include the \ndetermination of the President with respect to each country described \nin section 4(1) as to whether or not, as of the date on which the \nPresident makes the determination, that country is engaged in oil price \nfixing to the detriment of the United States economy.\n\nSEC. 6.
