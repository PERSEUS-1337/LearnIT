    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Forest Service Cost Reduction and \nEfficiency Demonstration Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Budgetary reductions and project delays caused by \n        litigation have reduced certain levels of accomplishments and \n        resource outputs by the Forest Service in recent years, with \n        the result that many targets and goals of land and resource \n        management plans that were developed with years of public and \n        scientific input are not being met.\n            (2) Certain staffing levels of the Forest Service have been \n        reduced in recent years, but not to the extent that related \n        accomplishments and resource outputs have been reduced.\n            (3) Per unit costs and overhead of the Forest Service are \n        rising substantially.\n            (4) Staffing reductions and retirements have cost the \n        Forest Service substantial expertise in certain technical and \n        scientific disciplines.\n            (5) Technical and scientific expertise relevant to Forest \n        Service needs is available in the private sector.\n            (6) Contractor performance of certain tasks would be less \n        costly than performing those tasks using Forest Service \n        personnel, would free agency personnel to devote their time to \n        necessary tasks now being left undone, and would provide the \n        Forest Service with the ability to maintain an on-demand \n        skilled workforce to meet changing demands on public lands.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to implement Government reform, reduce \ncosts, and increase efficiency in the Forest Service, which has been \ndesignated as a reinvention laboratory by the Vice President, and to \ndemonstrate that contractor performance of certain Forest Service tasks \ncan lower the cost, improve the efficiency, and increase the \naccomplishment of tasks necessary to achieve the targets, goals, and \ndesired forest conditions established by final land and resource \nmanagement plans developed as required by section 6 of the Forest and \nRangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604).\n\nSEC. 4.
