SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) foreign governments, including the Governments of the \n        Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, use \n        disinformation and other propaganda tools to undermine the \n        national security objectives of the United States and key \n        allies and partners;\n            (2) the Russian Federation, in particular, has conducted \n        sophisticated and large-scale disinformation campaigns that \n        have sought to have a destabilizing effect on United States \n        allies and interests;\n            (3) in the last decade disinformation has increasingly \n        become a key feature of the Government of the Russian \n        Federation's pursuit of political, economic, and military \n        objectives in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, the Balkans, and \n        throughout Central and Eastern Europe;\n            (4) the challenge of countering disinformation extends \n        beyond effective strategic communications and public diplomacy, \n        requiring a whole-of-government approach leveraging all \n        elements of national power;\n            (5) the United States Government should develop a \n        comprehensive strategy to counter foreign disinformation and \n        propaganda and assert leadership in developing a fact-based \n        strategic narrative; and\n            (6) an important element of this strategy should be to \n        protect and promote a free, healthy, and independent press in \n        countries vulnerable to foreign disinformation.\n\nSEC. 3.
