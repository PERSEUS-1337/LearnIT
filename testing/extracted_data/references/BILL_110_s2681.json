PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to require the issuance of medals to \nexpress the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the service of Native American code talkers to the \n        United States deserves immediate recognition for dedication and \n        valor; and\n            (2) honoring Native American code talkers is long overdue.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) when the United States entered World War I, Native \n        Americans were not accorded the status of citizens of the \n        United States;\n            (2) without regard to that lack of citizenship, members of \n        Indian tribes and nations enlisted in the Armed Forces to fight \n        on behalf of the United States;\n            (3) the first reported use of Native American code talkers \n        was on October 17, 1918;\n            (4)(A) during World War I, Choctaw code talkers were the \n        first code talkers who played a role in United States military \n        operations by transmitting vital communications that helped \n        defeat German forces in Europe;\n            (B) because the language used by the Choctaw code talkers \n        in the transmission of information was not based on a European \n        language or on a mathematical progression, the Germans were \n        unable to understand any of the transmissions;\n            (C) this was the first time in modern warfare that such a \n        transmission of messages in a native language was used for the \n        purpose of confusing an enemy;\n            (5) on December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, \n        Hawaii, and Congress declared war the following day;\n            (6)(A) the Federal Government called on the Comanche Nation \n        to support the military effort during World War II by \n        recruiting and enlisting Comanche men to serve in the Army to \n        develop a secret code based on the Comanche language;\n            (B) the Army recruited approximately 50 Native Americans \n        for special native language communication assignments; and\n            (C) the Marines recruited several hundred Navajos for duty \n        in the Pacific region;\n            (7)(A) during World War II, the United States employed \n        Native American code talkers who developed secret means of \n        communication based on native languages and were critical to \n        winning the war; and\n            (B) to the frustration of the enemies of the United States, \n        the code developed by the Native American code talkers proved \n        to be unbreakable and was used extensively throughout the \n        European theater;\n            (8) in 2001, Congress and President Bush honored Navajo \n        code talkers with congressional gold medals for the \n        contributions of the code talkers to the United States Armed \n        Forces as radio operators during World War II;\n            (9) soldiers from the Assiniboine, Cherokee, Cheyenne, \n        Chippewa/Oneida, Choctaw, Comanche, Cree, Crow, Hopi, Kiowa, \n        Menominee, Meskwaki, Mississauga, Muscogee, Osage, Pawnee, Sac \n        and Fox, Seminole, and Sioux (Lakota and Dakota) Indian tribes \n        and nations also served as code talkers during World War II;\n            (10) the heroic and dramatic contributions of Native \n        American code talkers were instrumental in driving back Axis \n        forces across the Pacific during World War II; and\n            (11) Congress should provide to all Native American code \n        talkers the recognition the code talkers deserve for the \n        contributions of the code talkers to United States victories in \n        World War I and World War II.\n\nSEC. 4.
