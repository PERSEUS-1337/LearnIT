    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Special Care \nDentistry Act of 2010''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the United States Surgeon General's Report \n        on Oral Health in America:\n                    (A) No less than a silent epidemic of oral diseases \n                is affecting our most vulnerable citizens, including \n                low income elderly, individuals with disabilities, and \n                many members of racial and ethnic minority groups.\n                    (B) Oral diseases and conditions affect health and \n                well-being throughout life. The burden of oral problems \n                is extensive and may be particularly severe in \n                vulnerable populations.\n                    (C) Oral diseases and conditions are associated \n                with other health problems. Associations between \n                chronic oral infections and other health problems, \n                including diabetes, heart disease, and adverse \n                pregnancy outcomes have been reported.\n            (2) Providing appropriate and necessary oral health \n        benefits under Medicaid to individuals classified as aged, \n        blind, or disabled would prevent unnecessary emergency room \n        visits, hospitalizations, and downstream health care costs, \n        reducing Medicaid spending.\n            (3) While 28 percent of the people enrolled in Medicaid are \n        aged, blind, or disabled, the high cost of medical expenditures \n        for these populations consumes 72 percent of the total Medicaid \n        budget. This is not the case with dental benefits.\n            (4) For the aged, blind, or disabled, oral health services \n        are deemed ``optional'' by the Federal Government and most \n        States provide little to no Medicaid coverage for these \n        services. Many of these vulnerable citizen's mouths are \n        infected with no hope of receiving access to even basic dental \n        care.\n            (5) In 2003, adult aged, blind, and disabled Medicaid \n        recipients received basic oral health services in only 6 States \n        (Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, \n        and Wisconsin).\n            (6) Appropriate and necessary oral health services for \n        adult aged, blind, and disabled people will help reduce not \n        only Medicaid costs for these populations, but also down-stream \n        Medicare expenditures, which together total almost \n        $600,000,000,000 annually.\n            (7) Dental office overhead averages over 65 percent. \n        Unfortunately, Medicaid reimbursement rates fall far short of \n        covering these expenses.\n            (8) Additional Federal investment for the delivery of oral \n        health services is needed to ensure vulnerable adults receive \n        oral health benefits.\n            (9) Investments are needed for an oral health initiative to \n        reduce the profound disparities in oral health by improving the \n        health status of vulnerable populations to the level of health \n        status that is enjoyed by the majority of Americans.\n\nSEC. 2. REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE AGED, BLIND, OR DISABLED INDIVIDUALS \n              WITH ORAL HEALTH SERVICES UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1396 et seq.), as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct (Public Law 111-148), is amended by inserting after section 1943 \nthe following new section:\n\n    ``oral health services for aged, blind, or disabled individuals\n\n    ``Sec. 1944.
