    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Charter for the 21st \nCentury Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote \n        world peace and friendship through the service of American \n        volunteers abroad.\n            (2) The three goals codified in the Peace Corps Act which \n        have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the years, \n        can work in concert to promote global acceptance of the \n        principles of international peace and nonviolent coexistence \n        among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of government.\n            (3) The Peace Corps has operated in 135 countries with \n        165,000 Peace Corps volunteers since its establishment.\n            (4) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as \n        follows: to help people in developing nations meet basic needs, \n        to promote understanding of America's values and ideals abroad, \n        and to promote an understanding of other peoples by Americans.\n            (5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps \n        remains the world's premier international service organization \n        dedicated to promoting grassroots development.\n            (6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well \n        trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to \n        promote world peace, friendship, and grassroots development.\n            (7) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and therefore \n        no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should have any \n        relationship with any United States intelligence agency or be \n        used to accomplish any other goal than the goals established by \n        the Peace Corps Act.\n            (8) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in \n        harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps \n        volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum \n        extent the pool of talent from the returned Peace Corps \n        volunteer community.\n            (9) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual \n        budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps \n        volunteers.\n            (10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation \n        about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, \n        particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a \n        greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster \n        greater understanding and tolerance of those countries.\n            (11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be \n        expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps volunteers.\n            (12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling \n        of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service in a fiscal \n        year to 15,000 volunteers in service by the end of fiscal year \n        2007.\n            (13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps shall not jeopardize \n        the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and \n        therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase \n        in field and headquarters support staff.\n            (14) It would be extremely useful for the Peace Corps to \n        establish an office of strategic planning to evaluate existing \n        programs and undertake long-term planning in order to \n        facilitate the orderly expansion of the Peace Corps from its \n        current size to the stated objective of 15,000 volunteers in \n        the field by the end of fiscal year 2007.\n            (15) The Peace Corps would benefit from the advice and \n        council of a streamlined bipartisan National Peace Corps \n        Advisory Council composed of distinguished returned Peace Corps \n        volunteers.\n\nSEC. 3.
