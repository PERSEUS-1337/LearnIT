FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internet has become an important channel of \n        commerce in the United States, accounting for billions of \n        dollars in retail sales every year.\n            (2) Hotel reservation transactions can be easily made \n        online and online commerce has created a marketplace where \n        consumers can shop for hotels, flights, car rentals, and other \n        travel-related services and products across thousands of brands \n        on a single platform.\n            (3) Consumers should have the utmost clarity as to the \n        company with which such consumers are transacting business \n        online.\n            (4) Actions by third-party sellers that misappropriate \n        brand identity, trademark, or other marketing content are \n        harmful to consumers.\n            (5) Platforms offered by online travel agencies provide \n        consumers with a valuable tool for comparative shopping for \n        hotels and should not be mistaken for the unlawful third-party \n        actors that commit such misappropriation.\n            (6) The misleading and deceptive sales tactics companies \n        use against customers booking hotel rooms online have resulted \n        in the loss of sensitive financial and personal information, \n        financial harm, and headache for consumers.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) consumers benefit from the ability to shop for travel-\n        related services and products on the innovative platforms \n        offered by online travel agencies;\n            (2) sellers on the Internet should provide consumers with \n        clear, accurate information and such sellers should have an \n        opportunity to compete fairly with one another; and\n            (3) the Federal Trade Commission should revise the Internet \n        Web site of the Commission to make it easier for consumers and \n        businesses to report complaints of deceptive practices with \n        respect to online booking of hotel reservations.\n\nSEC. 3.
