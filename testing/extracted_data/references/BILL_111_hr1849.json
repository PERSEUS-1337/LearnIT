FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than 4,000,000 men and women from the United \n        States served in uniform in the defense of liberty during World \n        War I, among them two future presidents, Harry S. Truman and \n        Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n            (2) 2,000,000 individuals from the United States served \n        overseas during World War I, including 200,000 naval personnel \n        who served on the seas.\n            (3) The United States suffered 375,000 casualties during \n        World War I.\n            (4) The events of 1914 through 1918 shaped the world, our \n        country, and the lives of millions of people in countless ways.\n            (5) The centennial of World War I offers an opportunity for \n        people in the United States to learn about the sacrifices of \n        their predecessors.\n            (6) Commemorative efforts allow people in the United States \n        to gain a historical understanding of the type of conflicts \n        that cause countries to go to war and how those conflicts are \n        resolved.\n            (7) Kansas City is home to the Liberty Memorial and \n        America's National World War I Museum (as so recognized in the \n        Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n        Year 2005 (Public Law 108-375)).\n            (8) America's National World War I Museum seeks--\n                    (A) to preserve the history of World War I; and\n                    (B) to educate and enlighten people about this \n                significant event, the consequences of which are still \n                with us.\n            (9) Kansas City is home to the national headquarters for \n        the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n            (10) Missouri is the home State of General John Joseph \n        Pershing, who commanded the American Expeditionary Forces in \n        Europe during World War I.\n            (11) The Kansas City area is the home of the Harry S. \n        Truman Presidential Library and Museum.\n            (12) The Dwight David Eisenhower Presidential Library and \n        Museum is located close to Kansas City in the neighboring State \n        of Kansas.\n            (13) There is no nationally recognized memorial honoring \n        the service of Americans who served in World War I.\n            (14) In 1919, the people of Kansas City, Missouri, \n        expressed an outpouring of support and raised more than \n        $2,000,000 in two weeks for a memorial to the service of \n        Americans in World War I. That fundraising was an \n        accomplishment unparalleled by any other city in the United \n        States irrespective of population and reflected the passion of \n        public opinion about World War I, which had so recently ended.\n            (15) Following the drive, a national architectural \n        competition was held by the American Institute of Architects \n        for designs for a memorial to the service of Americans in World \n        War I, and the competition yielded a design by architect H. Van \n        Buren Magonigle.\n            (16) On November 1, 1921, more than 100,000 people \n        witnessed the dedication of the site for the Liberty Memorial \n        in Kansas City, Missouri. That dedication marked the only time \n        in history that the five allied military leaders; Lieutenant \n        General Baron Jacques of Belgium, General Armando Diaz of \n        Italy, Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France, General John J. \n        Pershing of the United States, and Admiral Lord Earl Beatty of \n        Great Britain, were together at one place.\n            (17) General Pershing noted at the November 1, 1921, \n        dedication that ``[t]he people of Kansas City, Missouri, are \n        deeply proud of the beautiful memorial, erected in tribute to \n        the patriotism, the gallant achievements, and the heroic \n        sacrifices of their sons and daughters who served in our \n        country's armed forces during the World War. It symbolized \n        their grateful appreciation of duty well done, an appreciation \n        which I share, because I know so well how richly it is \n        merited''.\n            (18) During an Armistice Day ceremony in 1924, President \n        Calvin Coolidge marked the beginning of a three-year \n        construction project for the Liberty Memorial by the laying of \n        the cornerstone of the memorial.\n            (19) The 217-foot Liberty Memorial Tower has an inscription \n        that reads ``In Honor of Those Who Served in the World War in \n        Defense of Liberty and Our Country'' as well as four stone \n        ``Guardian Spirits'' representing courage, honor, patriotism, \n        and sacrifice, which rise above the observation deck, making \n        the Liberty Memorial a noble tribute to all who served in World \n        War I.\n            (20) During a rededication for the Liberty Memorial in \n        1961, World War I veterans and former Presidents Harry S. \n        Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower recognized the memorial as a \n        constant reminder of the sacrifices during World War I and the \n        progress that followed.\n            (21) The 106th Congress recognized the Liberty Memorial as \n        a national symbol of World War I.\n            (22) The National World War I Museum is the only public \n        museum in the United States specifically dedicated to the \n        history of World War I.\n            (23) The National World War I Museum is known throughout \n        the world as a major center of World War I remembrance.\n\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF THE LIBERTY MEMORIAL AT THE NATIONAL WORLD WAR I \n              MUSEUM IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, AS THE NATIONAL WORLD \n              WAR I MEMORIAL.\n\n    The Liberty Memorial at the National World War I Museum in Kansas \nCity, Missouri, is hereby designated as the ``National World War I \nMemorial''. No Federal funds may be used for the annual operation or \nmaintenance of such Memorial.\n\nSEC. 4.
