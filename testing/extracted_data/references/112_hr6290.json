    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Article I, section 8 of the Constitution vests solely \n        in Congress the power to declare war.\n            (2) The Constitution provides the President with the power \n        to act as Commander-in-Chief and with the limited power to \n        utilize the United States Armed Forces to ``repel sudden \n        attacks''.\n            (3) The constitutional authority of Congress to declare \n        war, and the requirement that the President seek Congress' \n        express prior statutory authorization to deploy United States \n        Armed Forces are necessary to ensure the collective judgment of \n        both Congress and the executive branch in making the decision \n        to deploy United States Armed Forces abroad.\n            (4) In a May 21, 2011, letter, President Obama notified \n        congressional leaders that United States military forces had \n        been deployed to Libya at his direction ``to assist an \n        international effort authorized by the United Nations Security \n        Council'', and that ``United Nations Security Council \n        Resolution 1973 authorized Member States, under Chapter VII of \n        the U.N. Charter, to take all necessary measures to protect \n        civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack \n        in Libya, including the establishment and enforcement of a `no-\n        fly zone' in the airspace of Libya.''.\n            (5) In a May 20, 2011, letter to congressional leaders, \n        President Obama wrote that he ``reported to the Congress that \n        the United States, pursuant to a request from the Arab League \n        and authorization by the United Nations Security Council, had \n        acted 2 days earlier to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe by \n        deploying U.S. forces to protect the people of Libya from the \n        Qaddafi regime.''.\n            (6) Section 8(a)(2) of the War Powers Resolution \n        specifically states that the authority to introduce United \n        States Armed Forces into hostilities ``shall not be inferred . \n        . . from any treaty heretofore or hereafter ratified unless \n        such treaty is implemented by legislation specifically \n        authorizing the introduction of United States Armed Forces into \n        hostilities or into such situations and stating that it is \n        intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within \n        the meaning of this joint resolution.''.\n            (7) Section 2(c) of the War Powers Resolution acknowledged \n        the constitutional powers of President as Commander-in-Chief to \n        introduce forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities as \n        ``exercised only pursuant to a declaration of war, specific \n        statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by \n        attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, \n        or its armed forces.''.\n            (8) The War Powers Resolution was passed by Congress over a \n        presidential veto in the aftermath of the Vietnam war, to \n        ensure that Congress had a direct role in the decision to \n        introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities.\n            (9) The introduction of United States Armed Forces into \n        hostilities authorized by the United Nations or any other \n        international body aside from the United States Congress is no \n        substitute for a congressional declaration of war or \n        authorization for the use of force.\n\nSEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It should be the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to protect the role of Congress as a coequal branch of \n        government and ensure the protection of its constitutional \n        authority to declare war and support the Armed Forces;\n            (2) to prevent the need for United States and international \n        military intervention abroad through the utilization of \n        diplomacy to resolve issues of concern to the United States and \n        the international community; and\n            (3) that no funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n        to any executive agency of the United States Government may be \n        used to carry out any North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n        military operation or deploy a unit or individual of the United \n        States Armed Forces or an element of the intelligence community \n        in support of a NATO military operation unless the President \n        determines that such military operation is warranted and seeks \n        express prior authorization by Congress, as required under \n        article I, section 8 of the Constitution, except that this \n        requirement shall not apply to a military operation--\n                    (A) to directly repel an offensive military action \n                launched against the United States or an ally with whom \n                the United States has a mutual defense assistance \n                agreement; or\n                    (B) to directly thwart an imminent offensive \n                military action to be launched against the United \n                States or an ally with whom the United States has a \n                mutual defense assistance agreement.\n\nSEC. 3.
