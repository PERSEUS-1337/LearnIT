    "content": "When a President dies, a number of activities and events are set in motion. The vast majority of these activities and events are governed by custom rather than statute, and may be influenced by the wishes of the deceased President's family.  Typically, the incumbent President issues a presidential proclamation that serves as an official announcement of the death. By federal law, U.S. flags should be flown at half-staff for 30 days. In recent decades, presidential proclamations have also given specific guidance where the flag should be flown at half-staff, such as \"at the White House and on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels of the United States for a period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their Embassies, Legations, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and stations.\"  The Commanding General, Military District of Washington, U.S. Army is responsible for state funeral arrangements, as described in detail in the Army pamphlet entitled State, Official, and Special Military Funerals . According to this document, the current President, ex-President, President-elect, and any other person specifically designated by the current President are entitled to an official state funeral. An excerpt from the pamphlet on key responsibilities and delegations follows: 3. Responsibilities. a. The President notifies the Congress that he has directed that a State Funeral be conducted. The Congress, which has sole authority for use of the U.S. Capitol, makes the Rotunda available for the State Ceremony through its own procedures. b. The Secretary of Defense is the designated representative of the President of the United States. The Secretary of the Army is the designated representative of the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of making all arrangements for State Funerals in Washington, D.C. This includes participation of all Armed Forces and coordination with the State Department for participation of all branches of the Government and the Diplomatic Corps. c.

Most recently, following former President Gerald R. Ford's death on December 26, 2006, President George W. Bush announced the death, and also issued a proclamation that U.S. flags on all federal facilities be flown at half-staff. Two days later, President Bush issued Executive Order 13421, which proclaimed January 2, 2007, a day of respect and remembrance for the former President and ordered the closing of federal offices and agencies. A funeral took place in the Capitol Rotunda on December 30, 2006, where former President Ford lay in state, with subsequent services on January 2, 2007, at Washington National Cathedral.
