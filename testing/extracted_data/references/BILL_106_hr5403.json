FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Miami Nation of Indians of the State of Indiana, \n        Inc., an Indian nonprofit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation, is \n        the modern day governing body of the Miami Nation of Indiana, \n        also known as the Miami Indians of Indiana or the Indiana \n        Miamis (collectively referred to herein as the ``Miamis''), \n        which is the descendant of, and the political successor to, the \n        signatory of the Treaty of 1854 (10 Stat. 1093).\n            (2) Historically, the Miamis lived in northern and central \n        Indiana.\n            (3) Between 1795 and 1840, the Miamis entered into a number \n        of treaties with the United States ceding millions of acres of \n        land to the Federal Government.\n            (4) In some of those treaties, tracts of land were reserved \n        for individual tribal members or for bands of Miamis.\n            (5) The 1840 Treaty required all members of the Miamis to \n        remove from Indiana to territory west of the Mississippi River \n        but the Miamis strongly resisted removal to the Kansas \n        Territory.\n            (6) In early 1846, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs \n        ordered annuity payments withheld until the Miamis were \n        removed, and thereafter about one-half of the Miamis were \n        forcibly removed to the Kansas Territory.\n            (7) After this emigration, some of the Miamis resided in \n        the Kansas Territory and some of the Miamis resided in Indiana.\n            (8) In 1854, the Federal Government entered into treaty \n        negotiations with the Miamis who remained in Indiana and \n        thereby recognized them as a separate Indian tribe--the Indiana \n        Miamis.\n            (9) Congress subsequently enacted legislation specifically \n        concerning treaties with the Indiana Miamis on a government-to-\n        government basis and extended the Federal trust relationship to \n        the Indiana Miamis.\n            (10) In 1897, the Secretary of the Interior, based on an \n        opinion by then Assistant Attorney General Willis Van Devanter, \n        withdrew the acknowledgement of the Indiana Miamis as a \n        federally recognized Indian tribe.\n            (11) Congress has never terminated the Indiana Miamis or \n        authorized the Secretary of the Interior to terminate the \n        Indiana Miamis, as a result of which the 1897 administrative \n        termination by the Secretary of the Interior was ultra vires \n        and of no effect.\n            (12) Tribes elsewhere, including the Miami Tribe of \n        Oklahoma, at Miami, Oklahoma, received services from the \n        Federal Government and were extended benefits of the Indian \n        Reorganization Act (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.).\n            (13) In spite of the denial of recognition and the right to \n        organize under the Indian Reorganization Act (25 U.S.C. 461 et \n        seq.), the Indiana Miamis have continued to carry out \n        governmental functions through a tribal council from the treaty \n        times through the present day.\n            (14) In 1990, the Department of the Interior admitted that \n        the opinion of Attorney General Van Devanter was incorrect and \n        that the trust relationship with the Indiana Miamis was \n        wrongfully terminated, but nothing has been done to remedy the \n        error.\n            (15) For more than 100 years there has been administrative \n        neglect, violation of treaty and statutory obligations of \n        trusteeship, and misapplication of Federal law and regulations \n        with regard to the Indiana Miamis.\n            (16) The injustice to the Indiana Miamis described in this \n        section should be corrected and their dignity and self-esteem, \n        individually and collectively, should be returned by \n        restoration of Federal recognition to the Indiana Miamis.\n\nSEC. 3.
