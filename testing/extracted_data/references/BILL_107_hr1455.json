FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Congressional findings:\n            (1) Domestic Violence remains a very serious problem in the \n        United States. It is a dangerous crime and should be punished \n        as such, including, where appropriate, as a felony.\n            (2) Many States have classified Domestic Violence crimes as \n        misdemeanors, others as felonies. States are the proper \n        authority, rather than the Federal Government, to classify \n        Domestic Violence offenses.\n            (3) Where appropriate, States should classify Domestic \n        Violence offenses as a felony.\n            (4) Section 658 of Public Law 104-208, commonly referred to \n        as the Lautenberg amendment, oversteps Federal authority, \n        violating States' rights, because no nexus has been shown to \n        exist between Domestic Violence and interstate commerce.\n            (5) The Lautenberg amendment does not deal with a subject \n        delegated to Congress under article I, section 8 of the \n        Constitution of the United States and is therefore \n        unconstitutional under the tenth amendment to the Constitution, \n        as interpreted by United States v. Lopez.\n            (6) The Lautenberg amendment oversteps Congress's power to \n        regulate commerce as delineated by the Commerce Clause of the \n        United States Constitution.\n            (7) Some of the strictest gun control laws are found in \n        cities where the number of incidents of guns being used in \n        violent crimes is the highest. Therefore, the Lautenberg \n        amendment does not reduce incidents of domestic violence.\n            (8) State and Federal judges already have the power to deny \n        persons convicted of misdemeanors the right to possess firearms \n        as a condition of probation or parole.\n            (9) The Lautenberg amendment is an unfunded Federal mandate \n        because States are liable for the costs of monitoring those \n        citizens who have been banned for life from owning a firearm. \n        Many times this lifetime ban is a result of a misdemeanor, not \n        a felony.\n            (10) Section 658 of the Treasury-Postal portion of Public \n        Law 104-208 violates all notions of constitutional due process \n        and constitutes an ex post facto law because it imposes a \n        criminal penalty on crimes which were not subject to that \n        penalty at the time of the Act.\n            (11) Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves \n        against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year. Of \n        these self-defense cases, as many as 200,000 are by women \n        defending themselves against sexual assault.\n            (12) Section 658 of the Treasury-Postal portion of Public \n        Law 104-208 will, if allowed to stand, result in the disarming \n        of millions of citizens, including women, on account of \n        misdemeanor offenses which, in many cases, were committed long \n        before the effective date of that Act.\n            (13) Section 658 of the Treasury-Postal portion of Public \n        Law 104-208 will, in many cases, disarm battered women who need \n        access to firearms in order to protect themselves from their \n        battering spouses as well as from common criminals.\n            (14) Section 658 of the Treasury-Postal portion of Public \n        Law 104-208 will, if allowed to stand, impose a lifetime gun \n        ban on persons who committed acts so minor that they were not \n        even entitled to a jury trial prior to conviction.\n            (15) Section 658 of the Treasury-Postal portion of Public \n        Law 104-208, will, if allowed to stand, result in the disarming \n        and dismissal of a significant number of law enforcement \n        officers and American servicemen, on account of misdemeanors, \n        which in many cases, were committed long before the effective \n        date of that Act.\n            (16) Section 658 of the Treasury-Postal portion of Public \n        Law 104-208 ignores the real problem surrounding domestic \n        violence in that truly violent offenders are allowed to plea-\n        bargain down to misdemeanors.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to restore States' \nrights, the tenth amendment, and second amendment freedoms.\n\nSEC. 3. REPEALER.\n\n    Section 658 of the Treasury-Postal portion of Public Law 104-208 is \nrepealed and is null and void as if it had not been enacted, and all \nprovisions of law amended by such section are restored as if section \n658 had not been enacted.\n\nSEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act shall take effect as if included in the Treasury-Postal \nportion of Public Law 104-208. Any liability, penalty, or forfeiture \nincurred by any person by reason of the application of any amendment \nmade by section 658 of the Treasury-Postal portion of Public Law 104-\n208 is hereby extinguished, and any action or prosecution for the \nenforcement of any such liability, penalty, or forfeiture shall not be \nsustained."
