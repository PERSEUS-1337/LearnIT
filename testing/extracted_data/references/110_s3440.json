MODIFICATION OF CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Subsections (a) and (d) of section 40101 of title 49, \n        United States Code, directs the Federal Aviation Administration \n        (in this section referred to as the ``Administration'') to make \n        safety its highest priority.\n            (2) In 1996, to ensure that there would be no appearance of \n        a conflict of interest for the Administration in carrying out \n        its safety responsibilities, Congress amended section 40101(d) \n        of such title to remove the responsibilities of the \n        Administration to promote airlines.\n            (3) Despite these directives from Congress regarding the \n        priority of safety, the Administration--\n                    (A) issued a vision statement in which it stated \n                that the vision of the Administration includes ``being \n                responsive to our customers and accountable to the \n                public''; and\n                    (B) issued a customer service initiative in 2003, \n                which required aviation inspectors to treat air \n                carriers and other aviation certificate holders as \n                ``customers'' rather than as regulated entities.\n            (4) The initiatives described in paragraph (3) appear to \n        have given regulated entities and Administration inspectors the \n        impression that the management of the Administration gives an \n        unduly high priority to the satisfaction of regulated entities \n        regarding its inspection and certification decisions and other \n        lawful actions of its safety inspectors.\n            (5) As a result of the emphasis on customer satisfaction, \n        some managers of the Administration have discouraged vigorous \n        enforcement and replaced inspectors whose lawful actions \n        adversely affected an air carrier.\n    (b) Modification of Initiative.--Not later than 90 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal \nAviation Administration shall modify the customer service initiative, \nmission, and vision statements, and other statements of policy of the \nAdministration--\n            (1) to remove any reference to air carriers and other \n        entities regulated by the Administration as ``customers'';\n            (2) to clarify that in regulating safety, the only \n        customers of the Administration are individuals traveling on \n        aircraft; and\n            (3) to clarify that air carriers and other entities \n        regulated by the Administration do not have the right to select \n        the employees of the Administration who will inspect their \n        operations.\n    (c) Safety Priority.--In carrying out the Administrator's \nresponsibilities, the Administrator shall ensure that safety is given a \nhigher priority than preventing the dissatisfaction of an air carrier \nor other entity regulated by the Administration with an employee of the \nAdministration.\n\nSEC. 4. POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS FOR FLIGHT STANDARDS INSPECTORS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 44711 of title 49, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Post-Employment Restrictions for Flight Standards \nInspectors.--\n            ``(1) Prohibition.--A person holding an operating \n        certificate issued under title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, \n        may not engage in employment negotiations, knowingly employ, or \n        make a contractual arrangement of employment with an employee \n        of the Federal Aviation Administration if the individual, in \n        the preceding 2-year period--\n                    ``(A) served as, or was responsible for oversight \n                of, a flight standards inspector of the Agency; and\n                    ``(B) had responsibility to inspect, or oversee \n                inspection of, the operations of the certificate \n                holder.\n            ``(2) Written and oral communications.--For purposes of \n        paragraph (1), an individual shall be considered to be acting \n        as an agent or representative of a certificate holder in a \n        matter before the Administration if the individual makes any \n        written or oral communication on behalf of the certificate \n        holder to the Administration (or any of its officers or \n        employees) in connection with a particular matter, whether or \n        not involving a specific party and without regard to whether \n        the individual has participated in, or had responsibility for, \n        the particular matter while serving as a flight standards \n        inspector of the Administration.''.\n    (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall not \napply to an individual employed by a certificate holder as of the date \nof the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
