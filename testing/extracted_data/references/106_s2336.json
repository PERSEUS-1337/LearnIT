FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of Energy, especially in its Office of \n        Science research programs, has played a key role in the \n        development of high performance computing, networking and \n        information technology. Important contributions by the \n        Department include pioneering the concept of remote, \n        interactive access to supercomputers; developing the first \n        interactive operating system for supercomputers; establishing \n        the first national supercomputer center; laying the \n        mathematical foundations for high performance computing with \n        numerical linear algebra libraries now used by thousands of \n        researchers worldwide; leading the transition to massively \n        parallel supercomputing by developing software for parallel \n        virtual machines; and contributing to the development of the \n        Internet with software that is now used in the TCP/IP system \n        responsible for routing information packages to their correct \n        destinations.\n            (2) The Department of Energy's contributions to networking \n        and information technology have played a key role in the \n        Department's ability to accomplish its statutory mission in the \n        past, in particular through the development of remote access to \n        its facilities. Continued accomplishments in these areas will \n        be needed to continue to carry out these missions in the \n        future.\n            (3) The Department of Energy, through its portfolio of \n        unique facilities for scientific research including high energy \n        and nuclear laboratories, neutron source and synchrotron \n        facilities, and computing and communications facilities such as \n        the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and \n        Energy Sciences Network, has a unique and vital role in \n        advancing the scientific research, networking and information \n        technology infrastructure for the nation.\n            (4) The challenge of remote creation of, access to, \n        visualization of, and simulation with petabyte-scale (1,000,000 \n        gigabyte) data sets generated by experiments at DOE scientific \n        facilities is common to a number of different scientific \n        disciplines. Effective treatment of these problems will likely \n        require collaborative efforts between the university, national \n        laboratory and industrial sectors and involve close \n        interactions of the broader scientific community with \n        computational, networking and information scientists.\n            (5) The solution of contemporary challenges facing the \n        Department of Energy in developing and using high-performance \n        computing, networking, communications, and information \n        technologies will be of immense value to the entire nation. \n        Potential benefits include: effective earth, climate, and \n        energy systems modeling; understanding aging and fatigue \n        effects in materials crucial to energy systems; promoting \n        energy-efficient chemical production through rational catalyst \n        design; predicting the structure and functions of the proteins \n        coded by DNA and their response to chemical and radiation \n        damage; designing more efficient combustion systems; and \n        understanding turbulent flow in plasmas in energy and advanced \n        materials applications.\n\nSEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) High-Performance Computing Act Program.--Section 203(a) of the \nHigh-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 5523(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``and'';\n            (2) in paragraph (4), by striking the period and inserting \n        ``; and''; and\n            (3) by adding after paragraph (4) the following:\n            ``(5) conduct an integrated program of research, \n        development, and provision of facilities to develop and deploy \n        to scientific and technical users the high-performance \n        computing and collaboration tools needed to fulfill the \n        statutory missions of the Department of Energy.''.\n    (b) Computation, Networking and Information Technology \nCollaborative Program.--Within the funds authorized under this Act, the \nSecretary shall provide up to $25,000,000 in each fiscal year for a \nprogram of collaborative projects involving remote access to high-\nperformance computing assets or remote experimentation over network \nfacilities. The program shall give priority to cross-disciplinary \nprojects that involve more than one office within the Office of Science \nof the Department of Energy or that couple the Office of Science with \nDepartmental energy technology offices.\n    (c) Program Line Authority.--To the extent consistent with their \nnational security mission, laboratories administered by the National \nNuclear Security Administration may compete for funding authorized in \nthis Act to the same extent and on the same terms as other Department \nof Energy offices and laboratories. Such funding at laboratories \nadministered by the National Nuclear Security Administration shall be \nunder the direct programmatic control of the sponsoring program for the \nfunding in the Department of Energy.\n    (d) Merit Review.--All grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, \nor other financial assistance awarded under programs authorized in this \nAct shall be made only after being subject to independent merit review \nby the Department of Energy.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy \nfor the purposes of carrying out section 203 of the High-Performance \nComputing Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 5523) and this Act $190,000,000 for \nfiscal year 2001; $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2002; $285,000,000 for \nfiscal year 2003; $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2004; and $300,000,000 \nfor fiscal year 2005."
