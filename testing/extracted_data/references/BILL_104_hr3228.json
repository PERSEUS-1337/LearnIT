SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``65th Infantry \nRegiment Commemorative Coin Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress hereby finds that the brave and gallant \nsoldiers from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico who comprised the 65th \nInfantry Regiment of the United States Army deserve a special \ncommemoration and a commemorative coin for their contributions during \nthe Korean conflict for the following reasons:\n            (1) The Puerto Rican soldiers of the 65th Infantry Regiment \n        unselfishly fought, bled, and died for the rights and \n        privileges of all citizens of the United States and the \n        Republic of Korea.\n            (2) 125 soldiers of the United States Army's 65th Infantry \n        Regiment were awarded the Silver Star and 4 received the \n        Distinguished Service Cross for their heroism during the Korean \n        conflict.\n            (3) The 65th Infantry Regiment went to the rescue of the \n        1st Division of the United States Marine Corps in Hagaru-ri \n        when that division was surrounded by forces of the Peoples \n        Republic of China, provided a safe corridor through which the \n        Marines escaped, and formed a protective rear guard during the \n        retreat to Hungnam.\n            (4) After bitter fighting, and with the forces of the \n        Peoples Republic of China on their heels, the 65th Infantry \n        Regiment was the last regiment to leave the beachhead in the \n        Christmas eve evacuation of Hungnam on December 24, 1950.\n            (5) One night, while the 65th Infantry Regiment was \n        encamped near the command post of the 3d Infantry Division of \n        the United States Army during a rest and recreation leave away \n        from the front lines, the command post of the 3d Infantry \n        Division was attacked by over 1,000 North Korean soldiers who \n        had infiltrated through the front lines without being detected \n        and the 65th Infantry Regiment rallied, attacked, and \n        subsequently destroyed the North Korean force, thereby saving \n        the commanding officer and staff of the 3d Infantry Division \n        from death or capture.\n            (6) For their heroism in battle, the soldiers of the 65th \n        Infantry Division were showered with many accolades but for \n        them perhaps the most significant and meaningful came in the \n        form of a letter from the commander of the United Nations \n        forces in Korea, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur which \n        read in part as follows:\n    ``The Puerto Ricans forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry \nDivision on the battlefields of Korea by valor, determination and a \nresolute will to victory give daily testament to their invincible \nloyalty to the United States and the fervor of their devotion to those \nimmutable standards of human relations to which the Americans and the \nPuerto Ricans are in common dedicated. They are writing a brilliant \nrecord of achievement in battle and I am proud indeed to have them in \nthis command. I wish that we might have many more like them.''.\n\nSEC. 2.
