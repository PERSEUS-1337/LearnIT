CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Consumers have developed a number of legitimate \n        expectations concerning how they may use and manipulate legally \n        acquired information or entertainment content for reasonable, \n        personal, and noncommercial purposes. In addition, as digital \n        technology creates new ways to use and manipulate content, \n        consumers are likely to develop new expectations that reflect \n        the new technological possibilities.\n            (2) Digital technologies also can facilitate unlawful \n        reproduction and distribution of information or entertainment \n        content subject to copyright protection. To combat this \n        problem, technology and content companies are developing and \n        deploying technologies to prevent or deter such unlawful \n        behavior.\n            (3) Such technologies could help promote a competitive \n        digital marketplace in which consumers have a broad range of \n        choices and media businesses can pursue a variety of business \n        models. However, there are also significant risks.\n            (4) There is a risk that technologies developed to prevent \n        unlawful reproduction and distribution of digital information \n        and entertainment content could have the side effect of \n        restricting consumers' flexibility to use and manipulate such \n        content for reasonable, personal, and noncommercial purposes.\n            (5) There is a risk that such technologies could unfairly \n        surprise consumers by frustrating their expectations concerning \n        how they may use and manipulate digital content they have \n        legally acquired.\n            (6) There is a risk that such technologies could result in \n        greater market power for the holders of exclusive rights and \n        reduce competition, by limiting the ability of unaffiliated \n        entities to engage in the lawful secondhand sale or \n        distribution of such content.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure that consumers of digital information and \n        entertainment content are informed in advance of technological \n        features that may restrict the uses and manipulation of such \n        content, so that--\n                    (A) consumers may factor this information into \n                their purchasing decisions; and\n                    (B) there will be a strong, market-based incentive \n                for the development of technologies that address the \n                problem of unlawful reproduction and distribution of \n                content in ways that still preserve the maximum \n                possible flexibility for consumers to use and \n                manipulate such content for lawful and reasonable \n                purposes; and\n            (2) to express the sense of Congress concerning the \n        importance of retaining competition among distribution channels \n        for digital information and entertainment content.\n\nSEC. 3. FAIR DISCLOSURE OF TECHNOLOGICAL USE RESTRICTIONS.\n\n    (a) FTC Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall issue rules \nto implement the disclosure requirements described in subsection (b).\n    (b) Disclosure Requirements.--\n            (1) In general.--If a producer or distributor of \n        copyrighted digital content sells such content or access to \n        such content subject to technological features that limit the \n        practical ability of the purchaser to play, copy, transmit, or \n        transfer such content on, to, or between devices or classes of \n        devices that consumers commonly use with respect to that type \n        of content, the producer or distributor shall disclose the \n        nature of such limitations to the purchaser in a clear and \n        conspicuous manner prior to such sale.\n            (2) Manner of disclosure.--The Federal Trade Commission \n        shall prescribe the manner of disclosure required under this \n        subsection, which may include labels on packaging or such other \n        means as the Commission determines appropriate to achieve the \n        purposes of this section. The Commission may prescribe \ndifferent manners of disclosure for different types of content and \ndifferent distribution channels.\n    (c) Disclosure of Certain Limitations on Reasonable Consumer \nActivities.--The following are examples of limitations which shall \ntrigger the disclosure requirements of subsection (b):\n            (1) Limitations on the recording for later viewing or \n        listening (popularly referred to as ``time shifting'') of audio \n        or video programming delivered--\n                    (A) via free over-the-air broadcasting; or\n                    (B) as part of a multichannel video or audio system \n                in which the consumer obtains the programming as part \n                of a subscription package, with no per view charges and \n                no ability to select the specific time at which \n                individual programs will be delivered.\n            (2) Limitations on the reasonable and noncommercial use of \n        legally acquired audio or video content--\n                    (A) in different physical locations of the \n                consumer's choice (popularly referred to as ``space \n                shifting''); or\n                    (B) on the electronic platform or device of the \n                consumer's choice, including platforms or devices \n                requiring that the content be translated into a \n                comparable format before such use.\n            (3) Limitations on making backup copies of legally acquired \n        content distributed in a form or medium that is subject to \n        accidental erasure, damage, or destruction in the ordinary \n        course of use, including through computer failure or computer \n        viruses, to be used only in the event that the original copies \n        are lost or damaged.\n            (4) Limitations on using limited excerpts of legally \n        acquired content for purposes such as criticism, comment, news \n        reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.\n            (5) Limitations on engaging in the secondhand transfer or \n        sale of legally acquired content to another consumer, provided \n        that the transferor does not retain the content or any copy \n        thereof and that the transferee obtains only such rights to the \n        use and enjoyment of the content as the transferor possessed at \n        the time of transfer.\n    (d) Exception to Disclosure Requirement.--The Federal Trade \nCommission shall not require disclosure under subsection (b) with \nrespect to any limitation that applies only to uses--\n            (1) that are sufficiently unusual or uncommon that the \n        burdens of prior disclosure would outweigh the utility to \n        consumers; or\n            (2) that have no significant application for lawful \n        purposes.\n    (e) Annual FTC Review.--On an annual basis, the Federal Trade \nCommission shall review the effectiveness of its rules implementing \nthis section to determine whether revisions are warranted to serve the \npurposes of this section. In conducting this review, the Commission \nshall consider whether changes in technology or in consumer practices \nhave led to new, legitimate consumer expectations concerning specific \nuses of digital information or entertainment content that would result \nin consumers suffering unfair surprise if a technology were to limit \nthose uses without prior notice.\n\nSEC. 4. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\n    (a) No Limiting Effect on Fair Use.--Nothing in this Act shall be \ninterpreted to suggest that a consumer activity not referred to in \nsection 3(c) or in the Federal Trade Commission's rules implementing \nthis Act may not constitute a fair use within the meaning of section \n107 of title 17, United States Code.\n    (b) Unlawful Reproduction or Distribution.--Nothing in this Act \nshall be interpreted to permit the otherwise unlawful reproduction or \ndistribution of copyrighted content or to shield a person engaging in \nsuch activity from any type of legal action or judgment.\n\nSEC. 5. COMPETITION IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) competition among distribution outlets and methods \n        generally benefits consumers; and\n            (2) just as copyright holders have sold content embodied in \n        tangible products such as audio cassettes, videotapes, and \n        compact discs to multiple competing retail distributors, \n        copyright holders selling digital content in electronic form \n        for distribution over the Internet should offer to license such \n        content to multiple unaffiliated distributors, to enable \n        competition among different distribution models and \n        technologies."
