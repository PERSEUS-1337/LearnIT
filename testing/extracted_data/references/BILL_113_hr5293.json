FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A public report in the New York Times on January 29, \n        2014, revealed that the Russian Federation is no longer in \n        compliance with the Treaty Between the United States of America \n        and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination \n        of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, \n        commonly referred to as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces \n        (INF) Treaty, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and \n        entered into force June 1, 1988.\n            (2) On April 29, 2014, Acting Assistant Secretary of State \n        for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance Anita E. Friedt \n        stated in testimony before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of \n        the House of Representatives that, ``[w]e have concerns about \n        Russian compliance with the INF Treaty. We have raised them \n        with Russia and are pressing for clear answers in an effort to \n        resolve our concerns because of the importance of the INF \n        Treaty to Euro-Atlantic security. We've briefed our NATO allies \n        on our concerns and will continue to coordinate with them on \n        this and other matters that affect our common security. We have \n        been keeping Congress informed on this matter through briefings \n        with relevant congressional committees and will continue to do \n        so. We will continue to work with Russia to resolve our \n        concerns, and to encourage mutual steps to help foster a more \n        stable, resilient, transparent security relationship. We're not \n        going to drop the issue until our concerns have been \n        addressed.''.\n            (3) On March 5, 2014, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n        Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy, Ms. Elaine Bunn \n        said to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, ``[W]e \n        are concerned about Russian activity that appears to be \n        inconsistent with the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. \n        We've raised the issue with Russia. They provided an answer \n        that was not satisfactory to us, and we will, we told them that \n        the issue is not closed, and we will continue to raise this.''.\n            (4) On April 2, 2014, the Commander, U.S. European Command, \n        and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Breedlove, stated \n        that, ``A weapon capability that violates the INF, that is \n        introduced into the greater European land mass is absolutely a \n        tool that will have to be dealt with . . . I would not judge \n        how the alliance will choose to react, but I would say they \n        will have to consider what to do about it . . . It can't go \n        unanswered.''.\n            (5) The Russian Federation succeeded to the INF Treaty \n        obligations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in a \n        declaration issued at Biskek, Kyrgyzstan, in October 1992.\n            (6) The flight test or deployment of any INF-banned weapon \n        delivery vehicle by the Russian Federation constitutes a \n        militarily significant violation of the INF Treaty.\n            (7) The INF Treaty has unlimited duration, but, under the \n        terms of the Treaty, inspections and continuous monitoring of \n        Russian missile production under the Treaty ceased on June 1, \n        2001, thus the Treaty no longer offers any verification to \n        detect any militarily significant violations.\n            (8) A major problem exists with respect to the application \n        of the INF Treaty to any new ballistic or cruise missile that \n        is flight tested or otherwise flown once at a range not \n        prohibited by the Treaty (that is a range less than 500 \n        kilometers or more than 5,500 kilometers) but will be flown at \n        a range that is banned by the Treaty (at a range that is \n        between 500 and 5,500 kilometers) as a weapon delivery vehicle.\n            (9) President Obama has not made use of any INF Treaty-\n        provided means to address Russian noncompliance with the \n        Treaty, to include convening a meeting of the Treaty's Special \n        Verification Commission under Article XIII of the Treaty.\n            (10) The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate noted \n        in its 1988 report on the INF Treaty that, ``In the event \n        Soviet actions appear to contradict their obligations under the \n        treaty, Congress should be kept fully informed. Any \n        questionable activity should be fully discussed in the Special \n        Verification Commission. If the Soviet Union has not, after a \n        sufficient period of time, satisfied United States concerns or \n        ceased the activity in question, and if the Soviet activity is \n        deemed to be militarily significant, the President should \n        propose implementation of an appropriate and proportionate \n        response.''.\n            (11) The Administration has not made any serious or \n        credible effort, over several years, to respond to violations \n        by the Russian Federation of its obligations under the INF \n        Treaty.\n            (12) The INF Treaty is no longer effectively verifiable.\n            (13) The Russian Federation's actions, as detailed in the \n        January 29, 2014, report of the New York Times have defeated \n        the object and purpose of the INF Treaty.\n            (14) Continued noncompliance by the Russian Federation with \n        its obligations under the INF Treaty and continued United \n        States adherence to the INF Treaty, in light of failure to \n        respond in a timely manner to Russian noncompliance, places the \n        supreme interests of the United States and its allies in the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in jeopardy.\n            (15) The Russian Federation has violated its obligations \n        under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances and \n        has rendered null the effect and assurances of the NATO-Russia \n        Founding Act of 1997.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Russian Federation, through its flight testing of \n        both a ballistic missile intended for intermediate-range \n        targets as well its flight testing of a ground-launched cruise \n        missile prohibited by the INF Treaty has acted contrary to the \n        object and purpose of a central purpose of the Treaty and is \n        therefore in material breach of its obligations under the \n        Treaty; and\n            (2) the President, after consultation with United States \n        allies directly affected by such Russian Federation ballistic \n        missiles or cruise missiles, should take such actions as the \n        President determines to be necessary to deny the Russian \n        Federation any militarily significant advantage resulting from \n        its noncompliance with the INF Treaty.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATION ON FUNDS FOR PROGRAMS, PROJECTS, OR ACTIVITIES OF \n              THE U.S.-RUSSIA BILATERAL PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION.\n\n    No funds made available to the Department of State may be used to \ncarry out programs, projects, or activities of the U.S.-Russia \nBilateral Presidential Commission until the President certifies to the \nappropriate congressional committees that the Russian Federation as of \nthe date of the certification has or has not flight tested a ballistic \nmissile at strategic range in a configuration (booster stages, post-\nboost vehicle, or reentry vehicles) that is unlike a configuration that \nis used for remaining tests of the system at ranges that are prohibited \nunder the INF Treaty.\n\nSEC. 5. PROGRAM TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP GROUND-LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILE \n              AND GROUND-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILE CAPABILITIES.\n\n    (a) Program Required.--The President shall establish and carry out \na program to research and develop ground-launched cruise missile and \nground-launched ballistic missile capabilities, including by \nmodification of exiting United States military capabilities, with a \nrange between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.\n    (b) Study and Report.--\n            (1) Study.--The President shall conduct a study for \n        potential sites of the cruise missile and ballistic missile \n        capabilities specified in subsection (a). In conducting the \n        study, the President shall consider selecting sites on United \n        States overseas military bases and sites offered by United \n        States allies.\n            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the \n        appropriate congressional committees a report that contains the \n        results of the study.\n    (c) Waiver.--The President may waive the requirement to establish \nand carry out the program under subsection (a) if, on or before October \n1, 2014, the President certifies to the appropriate congressional \ncommittees that--\n            (1) the Russian Federation is in compliance with all of its \n        obligations under the INF Treaty; and\n            (2) the Russian Federation has verifiably and completely \n        eliminated any military system that it has developed, flight \n        tested, and deployed in violation of the INF Treaty.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to the President $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 to \ncarry out the program under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 6. ADDITIONAL DEFENSIVE RESPONSES TO RUSSIAN FEDERATION'S \n              VIOLATION OF INF TREATY.\n\n    The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the Aegis Ashore sites \nin Romania and Poland are deployed, consistent with the timelines \nestablished in the Ballistic Missile Defense Review of 2010, with an \noperational capability to defend against short-, medium-, and \nintermediate-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles launched by \nthe Russian Federation.\n\nSEC. 7. SANCTIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--If, on or before the date that is 180 days after \nthe date of the enactment of this section, the President does not \ncertify to the appropriate congressional committees that the Russian \nFederation is not developing or deploying any military system that \nviolates or circumvents the INF Treaty, the President shall impose the \nsanctions described in subsection (b).\n    (b) Sanctions Described.--The sanctions referred to in subsection \n(a) are the following:\n            (1) The President shall suspend any cooperation with the \n        Russian Federation related to any aspect of the United States \n        program for national, theater, or regional missile defense, \n        including any provision of any data generated by the United \n        States in any test of any missile defense technology.\n            (2) The President shall deny any license pursuant to \n        section 57 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2077 \n        b.) for the export of any nuclear material, equipment, or \n        technology to the Russian Federation.\n            (3) The President shall terminate the United States of the \n        Agreement Between the Government of the United States of \n        America and the Government of the Russian Federation for \n        Cooperation in the Field of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, \n        entered into force January 12, 2011, in accordance with the \n        provisions of Article 20(1) of that Agreement.\n            (4) The President shall not award any United States \n        Government contract to a private or public entity in the \n        Russian Federation.\n    (c) Waiver.--The President may waive the requirement to impose \nsanctions under this section beginning on or after the date on which \nthe President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees \nthat the Russian Federation has provided to the United States the \nfollowing:\n            (1) A list of all intermediate-range and shorter-range \n        missiles, as such terms are defined in the INF Treaty, as well \n        as their launchers, support structures, and support equipment \n        that are not intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles \n        listed under Article III of the Treaty as existing types and \n        which have been designed, developed, flight tested or deployed \n        by the Russian Federation since June 1, 2001.\n            (2) A list of all deployment bases for any intermediate-\n        range and shorter-range missiles, as such terms are defined in \n        the INF Treaty, including in particular, any base for any road-\n        mobile, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles that are \n        not bases at which such missiles were located on June 1, 2001.\n            (3) A list of all flight tests carried out by the Russian \n        Federation for any new type of ground-launched ballistic or \n        cruise missile which has been flight tested at one or more \n        times below a range of 500 kilometers or above 5,500 \n        kilometers.\n            (4) A list of all production facilities used for the design \n        and development of any ballistic or cruise missile that is \n        prohibited under the INF Treaty.\n            (5) A description of the reasons that the Government of the \n        Russian Federation has provided for undertaking the design, \n        development, and deployment of any ballistic or cruise missile \n        that is prohibited under the INF Treaty.\n\nSEC. 8.
