FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Augustus Saint-Gaudens $20 gold pieces of 1907 with \n        ultra-high relief are considered by many in the numismatic \n        community to be the most beautiful coins ever produced;\n            (2) two separate ``pattern'' versions of the ultra-high \n        relief Double Eagle were produced in 1907;\n            (3) a 34-millimeter version was hand-struck on a standard \n        Double Eagle planchet using a medal press and, because \n        manufacturing and technical limitations prevented mass \n        production of these pieces, this production resulted in low \n        mintage, with fewer than two dozen specimens of the 34-\n        millimeter version known to be in existence today;\n            (4) a second, 27-millimeter, version was struck using two \n        stacked $10 Eagle planchets;\n            (5) these experimental ``pattern'' 27-millimeter pieces \n        were deemed to be illegal to produce and all specimens were \n        destroyed except for 2 that reside in the Smithsonian's \n        National Numismatic Collection;\n            (6) the 27-millimeter pattern pieces are ranked by \n        numismatists as among the most beautiful coins ever produced, \n        but none are in private hands and none have ever come up for \n        sale;\n            (7) the ultra-high relief Double Eagles are representative \n        of the greatest period of American coinage, the so-called \n        ``Golden Age of Coinage'' in the United States, initiated by \n        President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted \n        sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus \n        Saint-Gaudens;\n            (8) the introduction of this famous piece as a numismatic \n        proof coin would not only give collectors an opportunity to own \n        a version of a legendary coin that has never before been \n        available for private ownership, but also inaugurate a neo-\n        renaissance in United States coin design and demonstrate the \n        technological advances that the United States has achieved over \n        the last century;\n            (9) the modern coin version of the $20 gold piece would be \n        updated with the addition of the inscription ``In God We \n        Trust'' and would include the date of minting or issuance, to \n        distinguish it from the originals and prevent counterfeiting;\n            (10) palladium is a rare silver-white metal, and is \n        considered a precious metal because of its scarcity;\n            (11) palladium is one of 6 platinum group metals that \n        include ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, iridium, and platinum; it \n        is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the \n        platinum group metals;\n            (12) the major nations mining palladium are in order of \n        volume: Russia, South Africa, United States of America, and \n        Canada;\n            (13) the major mine producing palladium in the United \n        States is located in Montana;\n            (14) palladium is fabricated into a wide range of \n        applications that includes its extensive use as an industrial \n        catalyst and a key component in the manufacturing of automotive \n        catalytic converters;\n            (15) palladium is also used in dentistry, jewelry, and in \n        the production of surgical instruments and electrical contacts;\n            (16) the demand for precious metals is driven not only by \n        their practical use, but also by their role as a store of \n        value;\n            (17) a variety of investment options are available to \n        palladium investors that includes coins, bars, and exchange-\n        traded funds;\n            (18) palladium coins have been issued by several countries, \n        mainly as commemorative coins, but also as bullion investment \n        coins (bullion is the form of palladium traded for investment \n        purposes and is a reference to its purity);\n            (19) Tonga commenced issuing palladium coins in 1967 and \n        other issuing countries have included Canada, the Soviet Union, \n        France, Russia, China, Australia, and Slovakia;\n            (20) today, only Canada mints palladium bullion coins;\n            (21) during the period 2003 through 2007, the price of \n        palladium ranged between $148 and $404 per troy ounce, and the \n        average price in 2007 was $355 per troy ounce;\n            (22) by contrast, during the same period, the price of \n        platinum ranged between a low of $603 and a high $1,544, and \n        the average price in 2007 was $1,303 per troy ounce;\n            (23) thus, platinum bullion coins have become too expensive \n        for the average investor;\n            (24) The Royal Canadian Mint minted platinum bullion coins \n        for 14 years (between 1988 and 2001), but ceased production in \n        the face of high metal prices and declining sales;\n            (25) when the United States Mint's American Eagle Platinum \n        Bullion Coin was launched in 1997, the average price for the \n        metal that year was $395 per troy ounce; and\n            (26) over the past decade, the price has more than tripled, \n        which has caused a dramatic decline in demand for these coins, \n        from 80,050 ounces sold in 1997 to 9,050 in 2007.\n\nSEC. 3. ORIGINAL SAINT-GAUDENS DOUBLE EAGLE ULTRA-HIGH RELIEF BULLION \n              COIN.\n\n    Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following \n        new paragraph:\n            ``(11) A $20 coin that--\n                    ``(A) is 27 millimeters in diameter;\n                    ``(B) weighs 1 ounce;\n
