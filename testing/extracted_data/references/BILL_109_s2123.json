FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) manufactured housing plays a vital role in providing \n        housing for low- and moderate-income families in the United \n        States;\n            (2) the FHA title I insurance program for manufactured home \n        loans traditionally has been a major provider of mortgage \n        insurance for home-only transactions;\n            (3) the manufactured housing market is in the midst of a \n        prolonged downturn which has resulted in a severe contraction \n        of traditional sources of private lending for manufactured home \n        purchases;\n            (4) during past downturns the FHA title I insurance program \n        for manufactured homes has filled the lending void by providing \n        stability until the private markets could recover;\n            (5) in 1992, during the manufactured housing industry's \n        last major recession, over 30,000 manufactured home loans were \n        insured under title I;\n            (6) in 2004, fewer than 2,000 manufactured housing loans \n        were insured under title I;\n            (7) the dramatic reduction in the use of the title I \n        program is due primarily to certain structural problems of the \n        program, which have resulted in refusal by the Government \n        National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) to accept new \n        participants into the program since 1989, contributing to \n        higher loan costs and fewer loan originators;\n            (8) the loan limits for title I manufactured housing loans \n        have not been adjusted for inflation since 1992; and\n            (9) these problems with the title I program have resulted \n        in an atrophied market for manufactured housing loans, leaving \n        American families who have the most difficulty achieving \n        homeownership without adequate financing options for home-only \n        manufactured home purchases.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide adequate funding for FHA-insured \n        manufactured housing loans for low- and moderate-income \n        homebuyers during all economic cycles in the manufactured \n        housing industry;\n            (2) to modernize the FHA title I insurance program for \n        manufactured housing loans to enhance participation by Ginnie \n        Mae and the private lending markets;\n            (3) to adjust the artificially low loan limits for title I \n        manufactured home loan insurance to reflect the increase in \n        costs since such limits were last increased in 1992 and to \n        index the limits to inflation; and\n            (4) to ensure that the title I manufactured housing loan \n        insurance program requires no credit subsidy from the Federal \n        Government.\n\nSEC. 3. EXCEPTION TO LIMITATION ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PORTFOLIO.\n\n    The second sentence of section 2(a) of the National Housing Act (12 \nU.S.C. 1703(a)) is amended by striking ``In no case'' and inserting the \nfollowing: ``Other than in connection with a manufactured home or a lot \non which to place such a home (or both), in no case''.\n\nSEC. 4.
