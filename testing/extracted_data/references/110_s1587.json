    "title": "A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow a special depreciation allowance for reuse and recycling property and to provide for tax-exempt financing of recycling equipment, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Recycling Investment Saves Energy'' \nor the ``RISE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate finds the following:\n            (1) Recycling means business in the United States, with \n        more than 56,000 reuse and recycling establishments that employ \n        over 1,100,000 people, generating an annual payroll of nearly \n        $37,000,000,000, and grossing over $236,000,000,000 in annual \n        revenues. In 2005, recycling scrap materials accounted for \n        $15,700,000,000 in exports for the United States. On a per-ton \n        basis, sorting and processing recyclables alone sustain 10 \n        times more jobs than landfilling or incineration.\n            (2) By reducing the need to extract and process virgin raw \n        materials into manufacturing feedstock, reuse and recycling \n        helps achieve significant energy savings. For example:\n                    (A) Taken together, the amount of energy wasted \n                from not recycling aluminum and steel cans, paper, \n                printed materials, glass, and plastic equals the annual \n                output of 15 medium sized power plants.\n                    (B) The reuse of 500 steel drums per week yields 6 \n                trillion Btu's per year, which is enough energy savings \n                to power a city the size of Colorado Springs, Colorado, \n                for 1 year.\n            (3) Unfortunately, the United States recycling rate of many \n        consumer commodities, including aluminum, glass, and plastic, \n        are stagnant or declining, and businesses that rely on recycled \n        feedstock are finding it difficult to obtain the quantity and \n        quality of recycled materials needed. Increasingly, United \n        States manufacturing facilities that rely on recycled feedstock \n        are closing or forced to re-tool to use virgin materials.\n            (4) The environmental impacts from reuse and recycling are \n        significant. Increased reuse and recycling would produce \n        significant environmental benefits, such as cleaner air, safer \n        water, and reduced production costs. For example:\n                    (A) Between 2 and 5 percent of the waste stream is \n                reusable. Reuse prevents waste creation and adverse \n                impacts from disposal.\n                    (B) On a per-ton basis, recycling of: office paper \n                prevents 60 pounds of air pollutants from being \n                released, saves 7,000 gallons of water, and 3.3 cubic \n                yards of landfill space; aluminum saves 10 cubic yards \n                of landfill space; plastic saves 30 cubic yards of \n                landfill space; glass prevents 7.5 pounds of air \n                pollutants from being released and saves 2 cubic yards \n                of landfill space; and steel saves 4 cubic yards of \n                landfill space.\n                    (C) The manufacture of 100 percent recycled \n                paperboard products uses significantly less fossil fuel \n                than comparable products and is therefore a net reducer \n                of greenhouse gases. And, for every 100 tons of \n                recycled paperboard produced, 105 tons of material is \n                prevented from going to the landfill, thus reducing \n                landfill gases.\n            (5) A national investment in the reuse and recycling \n        industries is needed to preserve and expand America's reuse and \n        recycling infrastructure.\n\nSEC. 3.
