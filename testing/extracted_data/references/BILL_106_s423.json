FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Heroin use in the United States continues to increase.\n            (2) Drug use among teenagers in the United States is \n        increasing and the number of teenagers that are using heroin \n        for the first time is higher than at any previous time in \n        history.\n            (3) Between 1992 and 1996 heroin use among college-age \n        students increased an estimated 10 percent.\n            (4) There are an estimated 810,000 chronic heroin users in \n        the United States, with an estimated 115,000 heroin addicts in \n        the United States currently participating in methadone \n        programs.\n            (5) Methadone is a synthetic opiate and the use of \n        methadone in the treatment of heroin addiction results in the \n        transfer of addiction from 1 narcotic to another.\n            (6) Methadone addicts attempting detoxification experience \n        the same difficult withdrawal process as would be experienced \n        with heroin detoxification.\n            (7) The Federal Government should adopt a zero-tolerance, \n        non-pharmacological policy that has as its defined objective \n        independence from drug addiction.\n            (8) The approach of the Federal Government should be to \n        address a range of human needs and conditions that contribute \n        to recidivism among recovering heroin addicts and that should \n        be designed to provide opportunities for former heroin addicts \n        to become drug-free, self-sufficient, productive members of \n        society.\n\nSEC. 3.
