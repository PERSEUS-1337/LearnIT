PURPOSE AND GOALS.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to facilitate the achievement of the \nfollowing Congressional goals:\n            (1) Conducting a study relating to natural gas \n        infrastructure, including natural gas pipelines and natural gas \n        storage infrastructure, and liquefied natural gas \n        infrastructure in the United States, which shall include an \n        examination of roles, authorities, and methods of assessing \n        risks and benefits employed by United States Government \n        agencies that regulate natural gas infrastructure sitings, \n        taking into account considerations that are beyond the \n        regulatory scope of the current siting agencies and an \n        examination of the extent that reviews of proposed natural gas \n        infrastructure projects by United States Government agencies \n        are conducted in a complementary and effectively coordinated \n        manner.\n            (2) Identifying factors that are in the public interest \n        that natural gas infrastructure developers may not take into \n        account in proposing specific projects, and that may not be \n        adequately assessed by United States Government agencies \n        reviewing natural gas infrastructure development proposals due \n        to a lack of technical expertise or oversight authority, \n        including--\n                    (A) regional environmental impacts;\n                    (B) relationship of proposed natural gas \n                infrastructure developments to United States policies \n                to address climate change;\n                    (C) relationship of proposed natural gas \n                infrastructure developments with other national \n                infrastructure development priorities, especially in \n                the electric power sector; and\n                    (D) relationship of proposed natural gas \n                infrastructure developments with national safety and \n                security priorities.\n            (3) Examining--\n                    (A) Federal, State, and local expenditures for \n                water-side and land-based security for natural gas \n                infrastructure protection, including the extent of such \n                expenditures relative to the protection of other \n                critical infrastructure (such as chemical facilities \n                and chemical tankers); and\n                    (B) the ability of existing and traditional \n                security missions of agencies involved, including the \n                United States Coast Guard and State and local law \n                enforcement agencies, to ensure adequate security and \n                safety of liquefied natural gas operations.\n            (4) Understanding--\n                    (A) the linkages among natural gas supplies, carbon \n                dioxide emissions, electricity supply, and electricity \n                reliability, including the extent that United States \n                carbon dioxide policies will influence the existing and \n                anticipated demand for natural gas; and\n                    (B) the national and regional requirements for \n                natural gas supply infrastructure in light of other \n                Federal policies related to carbon dioxide control, \n                electricity reliability, and development of domestic \n                natural gas resources.\n            (5) Identifying criteria for the selection of appropriate \n        natural gas infrastructure facility locations that will meet \n        national energy policy goals, ensure adequate natural gas \n        supplies, can be adequately secured given existing constraints \n        on water-side and land-based security measures, and are \n        environmentally sound.\n\nSEC. 3.
