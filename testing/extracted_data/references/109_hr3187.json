    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Coastal and Estuarine Land \nConservation Program Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Coastal and estuarine areas provide important nursery \n        habitat for two-thirds of the commercial fish and shellfish \n        populations of the United States, provide nesting and foraging \n        habitat for coastal birds, harbor significant natural plant \n        communities, and serve to facilitate coastal flood control and \n        pollutant filtration.\n            (2) Coastal and estuarine areas, in both urban and rural \n        settings, provide significant opportunities for recreational \n        and educational activities, including hunting and fishing, \n        boating, swimming, bird watching, wildlife observation, \n        restoration, and other activities.\n            (3) The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 \n        et seq.) recognizes the national importance of these areas and \n        their ecological vulnerability to anthropogenic activities by \n        establishing a comprehensive Federal-State partnership for \n        protecting natural reserves and managing growth in these areas.\n            (4) The National Estuarine Research Reserve system \n        established under that Act relies on the protection of \n        designated areas for long-term protection and for the conduct \n        of education and research critical to the protection and \n        conservation of coastal and estuarine resources.\n            (5) Intense development pressures within the coastal zone \n        are driving the need to provide coastal managers with a wider \n        range of tools to protect and conserve important coastal and \n        estuarine areas, including protection of developed or \n        ecologically degraded areas with potential for restoration for \n        ecological or recreational purposes.\n            (6) Federal-State-nongovernmental organization pilot \n        projects have already substantially contributed to the long-\n        term health and viability of coastal and estuarine systems.\n            (7) Enhanced protection of estuarine and coastal areas can \n        be coordinated through Federal, State, regional, and local \n        efforts.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COASTAL AND ESTUARINE LAND CONSERVATION \n              PROGRAM.\n\n    The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) is \namended by inserting after section 310 the following:\n\n           ``coastal and estuarine land conservation program\n\n    ``Sec. 310A.
