FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) From May 2004 to May 2005, average United States \n        gasoline prices rose by 24 percent, according to the Energy \n        Information Administration.\n            (2) Most United States oil companies showed huge profits \n        last year, some as much as 200 percent. The American people \n        have paid over and above their fair share of this increased \n        cost. Consumers have been at the whim of oil companies who use \n        record-breaking oil prices to make record-breaking profits.\n            (3) Although 24 States have consumer protection statutes to \n        restrict prices that are ``unconscionable'', ``excessive'', or \n        ``grossly in excess'' of a specified amount, in all but one of \n        those States the prohibition applies only during a state of \n        emergency or natural disaster.\n            (4) While consumers express concerns about being ``gouged'' \n        when prices spike at the gas pump, there is no legal definition \n        of gouging. The Federal Trade Commission has never found a \n        violation of Federal antitrust laws related to gasoline price \n        spikes. An in-depth investigation of the entire oil industry is \n        necessary to determine whether extra charges are driven by \n        collusion among oil companies or simply by legitimate market \n        influences.\n            (5) With only a few nominal exceptions, gas prices are \n        expected to increase indefinitely. Higher fuel costs impact all \n        methods of transportation. As a result, the increased cost of \n        goods and services puts an even greater financial burden on \n        consumers.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n     In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``base price index'' means the average of the \n        closing unit price on the New York Mercantile Exchange, for \n        contracts to purchase regular unleaded gasoline during the \n        subsequent calendar month, for the 10 days in each of the most \n        recent 2 preceding years which correspond to the 10 most recent \n        trading days; and\n            (2) the term ``rate of inflation'' means the average \n        consumer price index for all urban consumers, not seasonally \n        adjusted, which corresponds to the time period between the days \n        used for calculating the base price index under paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 4. GASOLINE PRICE GOUGING.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--No person shall sell gasoline at retail for a \nprice that exceeds the base price index multiplied by twice the rate of \ninflation, as adjusted according to the regional price structure index \ndeveloped under subsection (b).\n    (b) Regional Price Structure Index.--Not later than 30 days after \nthe date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall \ndevelop a regional price structure index to reflect regional variances \nin gasoline reformulation requirements and transportation costs.\n    (c) Penalty.--The Secretary of Energy shall assess a civil penalty \nfor a violation of subsection (a) in the amount of--\n            (1) not less than $5,000 for a first offense;\n            (2) not less than $10,000 for a second offense; and\n            (3) not more than $25,000 for any subsequent offense.\n    (d) Offenses.--Each day on which a person violates subsection (a) \nshall constitute a separate offense for purposes of subsection (c).\n    (e) Effective Date.--This section, except for subsection (b), shall \ntake effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION REPORT.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, and \nannually thereafter, the Federal Trade Commission shall transmit to \nCongress a report that--\n            (1) examines passive and active collusion to set gasoline \n        prices;\n            (2) examines antitrust practices throughout all supply \n        chains in the oil industry; and\n            (3) recommends policies to protect consumers against \n        gasoline price gouging.\n\nSEC. 6. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created to enhance \n        the physical and economic security of the United States;\n            (2) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act allows the \n        Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be used to provide relief when \n        oil and gasoline supply shortages cause economic hardship;\n            (3) the proper management of the resources of the Strategic \n        Petroleum Reserve could provide gasoline price relief to \n        families of the United States and provide the United States \n        with a tool to counterbalance the Organization of Petroleum \n        Exporting Countries' supply management policies; and\n            (4) the United States current policy of filling the \n        Strategic Petroleum Reserve despite the fact that the Strategic \n        Petroleum Reserve is more than 98 percent full could further \n        exacerbate the rising price of crude oil and record high retail \n        price of gasoline.\n    (b) Price Protection Measures.--\n            (1) Initial measures.--For the period beginning on the date \n        of enactment of this Act and ending on the date that is 30 days \n        after such date of enactment--\n                    (A) the Secretary of Energy shall not acquire any \n                new petroleum products for, or place any petroleum \n                products in, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; and\n                    (B) the Secretary of Energy shall release from the \n                Strategic Petroleum Reserve 1,000,000 barrels of oil \n                per day.\n            (2) Subsequent measures.--If the President finds it \n        necessary, to lower the burden of gasoline prices on the \n        economy of the United States and to circumvent the efforts of \n        the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reap \n        windfall crude oil profits, the Secretary may continue the \n        measures described in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) for an \n        additional 30 days.\n\nSEC. 7.
