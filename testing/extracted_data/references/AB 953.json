The people of California greatly appreciate the hard work and dedication of peace officers in protecting public safety. The good name of these officers should not be tarnished by the actions of those few who commit discriminatory practices.\n(2) Racial or identity profiling is a practice that presents a great danger to the fundamental principles of our Constitution and a democratic society.

This training shall prescribe evidenced-based patterns, practices, and protocols that prevent racial or identity profiling. In developing the training, the commission shall consult with the Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board established pursuant to subdivision (j).
