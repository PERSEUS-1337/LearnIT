SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians of the \nSpokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable Compensation Settlement \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the \n        Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its \n        tributaries to determine sites where power could be produced at \n        low cost.\n            (2) The Corps of Engineers listed a number of sites, \n        including the site where the Grand Coulee Dam is now located, \n        with recommendations that the power development be performed by \n        local governmental authorities or private utilities under the \n        Federal Power Act.\n            (3) Under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act, licensees \n        must pay Indian tribes for the use of reservation lands.\n            (4) The Columbia Basin Commission, an agency of the State \n        of Washington, applied for, and in August 1933 received, a \n        preliminary permit from the Federal Power Commission for water \n        power development of the Grand Coulee Site.\n            (5) In the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is not \n        subject to the Federal Power Act, federalized the Grand Coulee \n        Dam project and began construction of the Grand Coulee Dam.\n            (6) At the time the Grand Coulee Dam project was \n        federalized, the Federal Government knew and recognized that \n        the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n        Reservation had compensable interests in the Grand Coulee Dam \n        project, including but not limited to development of \n        hydropower, extinguishment of a salmon fishery upon which the \n        Spokane Tribe was almost totally dependent, and inundation of \n        lands with loss of potential power sites previously identified \n        by the Spokane Tribe.\n            (7) In an Act dated June 29, 1940 (54 Stat. 703; 16 U.S.C. \n        835d), Congress enacted legislation to grant to the United \n        States all the rights of the Indians in lands of the Spokane \n        Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations required for the Grand \n        Coulee Dam project and various rights-of-way over Indian lands \n        required in connection with the project. The Act provided that \n        compensation for the lands and rights-of-way required shall be \n        determined by the Secretary of the Interior in such amounts as \n        such Secretary determines just and equitable.\n            (8) In furtherance of the Act of June 29, 1940, the \n        Secretary of the Interior paid to the Spokane Tribe the total \n        sum of $4,700. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n        Reservation received a payment of $63,000.\n            (9) In 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the \n        Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal \n        Claims and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \n        Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the \n        Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the United \n        States that provided for past damages and annual payments of \n        $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually, based on revenues \n        for the sale of electric power and transmission of such power \n        by the Bonneville Power Administration.\n            (10) In legal opinions issued throughout the years by the \n        Department of the Interior Solicitor's Office, a Task Force \n        Study conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Senate \n        Appropriations Committee, and in hearings before the Congress \n        when the Confederated Tribes Act was enacted, it has repeatedly \n        been recognized that the Spokane Tribe suffered similar damages \n        and had a case legally comparable with that of the Confederated \n        Tribes of the Colville Reservation with the sole exception that \n        the 5-year statute of limitations provided in the Indian Claims \n        Commission Act of 1946 prevented the Spokane Tribe from \n        bringing its own action for fair and honorable dealings as \n        provided in that Act.\n            (11) The failure of the Spokane Tribe to bring an action of \n        its own before the Indian Claims Commission can be attributed \n        to a combination of factors, including the failure of the \n        Bureau of Indian Affairs to carry out its advisory \n        responsibilities as required by the Indian Claims commission \n        Act (Act of August 13, 1946, ch. 959, 60 Stat. 1050), and an \n        effort of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to impose improper \n        requirements on claims attorneys retained by Indian tribes \n        which caused delays in retention of counsel and full \n        investigation of the Spokane Tribe's potential claims.\n            (12) As a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee \n        Dam project, the Spokane Tribe has suffered the complete loss \n        of the salmon fishery upon which it was dependent, the loss of \n        identified hydropower sites it could have developed, the loss \n        of hydropower revenues it would have received under the Federal \n        Power Act had the project not been federalized, and it \n        continues to lose hydropower revenues which the Federal \n        Government recognized the Spokane Tribe was due at the time the \n        project was constructed.\n            (13) Over 39 percent of the Indian-owned lands used for the \n        Grand Coulee Dam project were Spokane Tribe lands.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable \ncompensation to the Spokane Tribe on a basis that is proportionate to \nthe compensation provided to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \nReservation for the damages and losses suffered as a consequence of \nconstruction and operation of the Grand Coulee Dam project.\n\nSEC. 4. SETTLEMENT FUND ACCOUNT.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Account.--There is hereby established in the \nTreasury an interest bearing account to be known as the ``Spokane Tribe \nof Indians Settlement Fund Account''.\n    (b) Deposit of Amounts.--\n            (1) Initial deposit.--Upon enactment of this Act and \n        appropriation of funds, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n        deposit into the Fund Account a sum equal to 39.4 percent of \n        the sum paid to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n        Reservation in a lump sum pursuant to section 5(a) of the \n        Confederated Tribes Act, adjusted by the consumer price index \nfrom the date of that payment to the Confederated Tribes until the date \nof enactment of this Act, as payment and satisfaction of the Spokane \nTribe's claim for use of its lands for generation of hydropower for the \nperiod from 1940 through November 2, 1994, the date of the enactment of \nthe Confederated Tribes Act.\n            (2) Subsequent deposits.--Commencing on September 30 of the \n        first fiscal year following enactment of this Act and on \n        September 30 of each of the 5 fiscal years following such \n        fiscal year, the Administrator of the Bonneville Power \n        Administration shall pay into the Fund Account a sum equal to \n        20 percent of 39.4 percent of the sum authorized to be paid to \n        the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation pursuant to \n        section 5(b) of the Confederated Tribes Act through the end of \n        the fiscal year during which this Act is enacted, adjusted by \n        the consumer price index to maintain the purchasing power the \n        Spokane Tribe would have had if annual payments had been made \n        to the Spokane Tribe on the date annual payments commenced and \n        were subsequently made to the Confederated Tribes of the \n        Colville Reservation pursuant to section 5(b) of the \n        Confederated Tribes Act.\n    (c) Annual Payments.--On September 1 of the fiscal year following \nthe enactment of this Act and of each fiscal year thereafter, payments \nshall be made by the Bonneville Power Administration, or any successor \nthereto, directly to the Spokane Tribe in an amount which is equal to \n39.4 percent of the annual payment authorized to be paid to the \nConfederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation in the operative and \neach subsequent fiscal year pursuant to section 5(b) of the \nConfederated Tribes Act.\n\nSEC. 5.

The actual percentage of such deduction shall be \ncalculated and adjusted to ensure that the Bonneville Power \nAdministration receives a deduction comparable to that which it \nreceives for payments made to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \nReservation pursuant to the Confederated Tribes Act. Each deduction \nmade under this section shall be credited to the interest payments \notherwise payable by the Administrator to the Secretary of the Treasury \nduring the fiscal year in which the deduction is made, and shall be \nallocated pro rata to all interest payments on debt associated with the \ngeneration function of the Federal Columbia River Power System that are \ndue during that fiscal year; except that, if the deduction in any \nfiscal year is greater than the interest due on debt associated with \nthe generation function for the fiscal year, then the amount of the \ndeduction that exceeds the interest due on debt associated with the \ngeneral function shall be allocated pro rata to all other interest \npayments due during that fiscal year. To the extent that the deduction \nexceeds the total amount of any such interest, the deduction shall be \napplied as a credit against any other payments that the Administrator \nmakes to the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nSEC. 7.
