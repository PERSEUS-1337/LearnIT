    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Children and Media Research \nAdvancement Act'' or the ``CAMRA Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Congress recognized the important role of electronic \n        media in children's lives when it passed the Children's \n        Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-437) and the \n        Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104), both of \n        which documented public concerns about how electronic media \n        products influence children's development.\n            (2) Congress has held hearings over the past several \n        decades to examine the impact of specific types of media \n        products such as violent television, movies, and video games on \n        children's and adolescents' health and development. These \n        hearings and other public discussions about the role of media \n        in children's and adolescents' development require behavioral \n        and social science research to inform the policy deliberations.\n            (3) There are important gaps in our knowledge about the \n        role of electronic media and in particular, the newer \n        interactive digital media, in children's and adolescents' \n        healthy development. The consequences of very early screen \n        usage by babies and toddlers on children's cognitive growth are \n        not yet understood, nor has a research base been established on \n        the psychological consequences of high definition interactive \n        media and other format differences for child and adolescent \n        viewers.\n            (4) Studies have shown that children who primarily watch \n        educational shows on television during their preschool years \n        are significantly more successful in school 10 years later even \n        when critical contributors to the child's environment are \n        factored in, including their household income, parent's \n        education, and intelligence.\n            (5) The early stages of childhood are a critical formative \n        period for development. Virtually every aspect of human \n        development is affected by the environments and experiences \n        that one encounters during his or her early childhood years, \n        and media exposure is an increasing part of every child's \n        social and physical environment.\n            (6) As of the late 1990's, just before the National \n        Institute of Child Health and Human Development funded 5 \n        studies on the role of sexual messages in the media on \n        children's and adolescents' sexual attitudes and sexual \n        practices, a review of research in this area found only 15 \n        studies ever conducted in the United States on this topic, even \n        during a time of growing concerns about HIV infection.\n            (7) In 2001, a National Academy of Sciences study group \n        charged with studying Internet pornography exposure on youth \n        found virtually no literature about how much children and \n        adolescents were exposed to Internet pornography or how such \n        content impacts their development.\n            (8) In order to develop strategies that maximize the \n        positive and minimize the negative effects of each medium on \n        children's physical, cognitive, social, and emotional \n        development, it would be beneficial to develop a research \n        program that can track the media habits of young children and \n        their families over time using valid and reliable research \n        methods.\n            (9) Research about the impact of the media on children and \n        adolescents is not presently supported through one primary \n        programmatic effort. The responsibility for directing the \n        research is distributed across disparate agencies in an \n        uncoordinated fashion, or is overlooked entirely. The lack of \n        any centralized organization for research minimizes the value \n        of the knowledge produced by individual studies. A more \n        productive approach for generating valuable findings about the \n        impact of the media on children and adolescents would be to \n        establish a single, well-coordinated research effort with \n        primary responsibility for directing the research agenda.\n            (10) Due to the paucity of research about electronic media, \n        educators and others interested in implementing electronic \n        media literacy initiatives do not have the evidence needed to \n        design, implement, or assess the value of these efforts.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to enable the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention to--\n            (1) examine the role and impact of electronic media in \n        children's and adolescents' cognitive, social, emotional, \n        physical, and behavioral development; and\n            (2) provide for a report to Congress containing the \n        empirical evidence and other results produced by the research \n        funded through grants under this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. RESEARCH ON THE ROLE AND IMPACT OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA IN THE \n              DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 317S the following:\n\n``SEC. 317T.
