FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) skyrocketing energy prices in oil and gas are damaging \n        families of the United States, as well as the economy, foreign \n        policy, and national security of the United States;\n            (2) while there are a number of reasons for increasing \n        energy costs, a large part of the problem appears to be from \n        excessive speculation in petroleum in the futures markets;\n            (3) oil and gas prices result from the prices established \n        in the petroleum futures markets;\n            (4) in the early 20th century, speculators were trading \n        commodities to make money at the expense of farmers and \n        families of the United States;\n            (5) Congress stopped that action by enacting the \n        Commodities Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), which was \n        reinforced later when Congress established the Commodity \n        Futures Trading Commission (referred to in this section as the \n        ``Commission''), both of which were designed to ensure that the \n        futures markets worked free of fraud, manipulation, and \n        excessive speculation;\n            (6) the Commission accomplished this (directly or through \n        delegated authority) primarily by promulgating rules and \n        regulations that required the disclosure of trading information \n        and that limited speculative trading;\n            (7) Congress made it clear in the Commodities Exchange Act \n        and in the establishment of the Commission that the petroleum \n        futures markets exist for legitimate hedging of actual, \n        physical commercial products that are bought and sold today, \n        but are to be delivered in the future;\n            (8) for a long time after enactment and enforcement of that \n        Act (including rules and regulations), the prices generated in \n        the petroleum futures markets were based largely on fundamental \n        factors relating to supply and demand for oil and gas in the \n        United States and world markets;\n            (9) those prices no longer appear to be based on those \n        factors, as excessive speculation appears to have, once again, \n        hijacked the petroleum futures markets and sent oil and gas \n        prices soaring;\n            (10) some experts have concluded that as much as 30 to 50 \n        percent of the recent increase in the price of oil may be due \n        to manipulation or excessive speculation in the petroleum \n        futures markets;\n            (11) some experts have estimated that as much as 70 percent \n        of the trading in the petroleum futures markets is by \n        speculators rather than commercial parties seeking to hedge the \n        risk of the future delivery of an actual physical product and \n        their counterparties;\n            (12) the excessive speculation appears to have resulted, in \n        part, from a variety of actions by the Commission (including \n        the issuance of exemptions, exclusions, and no action letters), \n        technology changes, and threats by market participants to take \n        their business outside the regulated United States markets to \n        overseas unregulated markets in which the participants may not \n        have to disclose their trading activities and will be subject \n        to less regulation designed to protect markets and consumers;\n            (13) the petroleum futures markets must be restored to \n        their original intent and purpose, which is legitimate hedge \n        trading directly involving commercial parties and in which \n        manipulation and excessive speculation are eliminated;\n            (14) the Commission is the primary regulator of the \n        petroleum futures markets and has ample existing investigative \n        and regulatory authority to end manipulation and excessive \n        speculation and to do so quickly;\n            (15) Congress acknowledges that the Commission announced on \n        May 29, 2008, that the Commission was conducting a broad and \n        far-reaching investigation into the national and international \n        crude markets (including into oil trading on regulated and \n        unregulated exchanges, over the counter trading, cash trades, \n        and storage, pipeline operations, shipping, and transportation \n        generally) to determine if there was or is any improper \n        manipulation or excessive speculation; and\n            (16) the announced investigation by the Commission is a \n        good start, but it is only a start and much more needs to be \n        done quickly.\n\nSEC. 3.
