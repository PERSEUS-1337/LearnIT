FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A growing body of evidence demonstrates that increases \n        in patient-level financial barriers (including deductibles, \n        copayments, and coinsurance) for high-value medical services \n        (such as prescription medications, clinician visits, diagnostic \n        tests, and procedures) systematically reduce their use. Savings \n        attributable to cost-related decreased utilization of specific \n        services may lead to an increase in total medical expenditures \n        due to increased use of other related clinical services, such \n        as hospitalizations and emergency room visits.\n            (2) Empirical research studies demonstrate that reductions \n        in beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses for high-value \n        prescription medications and clinical services can mitigate the \n        adverse health and financial consequences attributable to cost-\n        related decreased utilization of high-value services.\n            (3) Financial barriers to prescription medications and \n        clinical services that are deemed to be high value should be \n        reduced or eliminated to increase their use.\n            (4) Value-Based Insurance Design is a methodology that \n        adjusts patient out-of-pocket costs for prescription \n        medications and clinical services according to the clinical \n        value--not exclusively the cost. Value-Based Insurance Design \n        is based on the concept of clinical nuance that recognizes--\n                    (A) prescription medications and clinical services \n                differ in the clinical benefit provided; and\n                    (B) the clinical benefit derived from a specific \n                prescription medication or clinical service depends on \n                the clinical situation, the provider, and where the \n                care is delivered.\n            (5) The current ``one-size-fits-all'' copayment or \n        coinsurance design for prescription medications and clinical \n        services provided under the Medicare program does not recognize \n        the well-established value differences in health outcomes \n        produced by various medical interventions.\n            (6) The establishment by Medicare of copayment and \n        coinsurance requirements using Value-Based Insurance Design \n        methodologies will improve patient-centered health outcomes, \n        enhance personal responsibility, and afford a more efficient \n        use of taxpayer dollars.\n\nSEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in \nthis section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a 3-year \ndemonstration program to test the use of value-based insurance design \nmethodologies (as defined in subsection (c)(1)) under eligible Medicare \nAdvantage plans offered by Medicare Advantage organizations under part \nC of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-21 et \nseq.).\n    (b) Demonstration Program Design.--\n            (1) Selection of ma region and eligible medicare advantage \n        plans.--The Secretary shall--\n                    (A) select at least two MA regions (as defined in \n                section 1858(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \n                U.S.C. 1395w-27a(a)(2))) with respect to which to \n                conduct the demonstration program under this section;
