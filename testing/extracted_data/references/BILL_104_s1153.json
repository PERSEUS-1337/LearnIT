FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) fossil fuels, the main energy source of the present, \n        have provided this country with tremendous supply but are \n        limited;\n            (2) additional research, development, and demonstration are \n        needed to encourage private sector investment in development of \n        new and better energy sources and enabling technologies;\n            (3) hydrogen holds tremendous promise as a fuel because it \n        can be extracted from water and solid waste, can be burned much \n        more cleanly than conventional fuels, and is a source of energy \n        for fuel cells;\n            (4) inefficiencies in the production of hydrogen are a \n        major technical barrier to society's collectively benefiting \n        from one of the great energy carriers of the future;\n            (5) an aggressive, results-oriented, multiyear research, \n        demonstration-commercialization initiative on efficient \n        hydrogen fuel production and use should be fostered and \n        maintained;\n            (6) the current Federal effort to develop hydrogen as a \n        fuel is inadequate; and\n            (7) there is ready to proceed a demonstration-\n        commercialization project that--\n                    (A) produces hydrogen from solid and complex waste \n                for use in fuel cells and uses a 300-kilowatt \n                photovoltaic facility in existence on the date of \n                enactment of this Act and a cryoaquatic reservoir as \n                central parts of a total energy integrated system, with \n                regeneration on-site; and\n                    (B) will be environmentally beneficial and have the \n                useful by-products of electric power, heat, fuel for \n                fuel cells, and pure water.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to direct the Secretary of Energy to conduct a \n        research, development, and demonstration-commercialization \n        program leading to the production, storage, transport, and use \n        of hydrogen for industrial, institutional, residential, \n        transportation, and utility applications;\n            (2) to provide advice from academia and the private sector \n        in the implementation of the Department of Energy's hydrogen \n        research, development, and demonstration-commercialization \n        program to ensure that economic benefits of the program accrue \n        to the United States; and\n            (3) to provide for the immediate implementation of the \n        demonstration-commercialization project.\nSEC. 4.
