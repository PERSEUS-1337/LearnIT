FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps \n        Program (hereinafter referred to as ``I-Corps''), created \n        administratively by the Foundation in 2011 and statutorily \n        authorized in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, \n        has succeeded in increasing the commercialization of \n        Government-funded research.\n            (2) I-Corps provides valuable entrepreneurial education to \n        graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other researchers, \n        providing formal training for scientists and engineers to \n        pursue careers in business, an increasingly common path for \n        advanced degree holders.\n            (3) The I-Corps Teams program is successful in part due to \n        its focus on providing the specific types of education and \n        mentoring entrepreneurs need based on the early stage of their \n        companies, however the program does not provide similar support \n        to them at later stages.\n            (4) The success of I-Corps in the very early stages of the \n        innovation continuum should be expanded upon by offering \n        additional entrepreneurship training to small businesses as \n        they advance toward commercialization.\n            (5) The excellent training made available to grantees of \n        participating agencies through the I-Corps Program should be \n        made available to all Federal grantees as well as other \n        businesses willing to pay the cost of attending such training.\n            (6) The success of the I-Corps Program at promoting \n        entrepreneurship within research institutions and encouraging \n        research commercialization has been due in part to the National \n        Science Foundation's efforts to date on building a national \n        network of science entrepreneurs, including convening \n        stakeholders, promoting national I-Corps courses, cataloguing \n        best practices and encourage sharing between sites and \n        institutions, and developing a mentor network.\n            (7) As the I-Corps Program continues to grow and expand, \n        the National Science Foundation should maintain its focus on \n        networking and information sharing to ensure that innovators \n        across the country can learn from their peers and remain \n        competitive.\n\nSEC. 3.
