SHORT TITLE.\n\n    ``This subpart may be cited as the `Teach Safe Relationships Act of \n2015'.\n\n``SEC. 5622. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    ``It is the purpose of this subpart:\n            ``(1) To help ensure that all students receive evidence-\n        informed safe relationship behavior education and training, \n        including education and training regarding the prevention of \n        teen and adolescent dating violence or relationship abuse, \n        domestic abuse, and sexual violence and harassment.\n            ``(2) To promote safe and healthy relationships between and \n        among students.\n            ``(3) To help students and school faculty and staff to \n        develop healthy and respectful attitudes and insights necessary \n        for students to understand themselves in the context of \n        relationships with others and with society.\n            ``(4) To provide financial assistance to support local \n        educational agencies in meeting the requirements of title IX of \n        the Educational Amendments of 1972.\n\n``SEC. 5623. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Educating students about safe relationship behavior \n        will aid in the prevention of unsafe dating practices, \n        including dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n            ``(2) The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. \n        13925 et seq.) included programs to develop and implement \n        prevention and intervention policies in middle and high \n        schools, including appropriate responses to, and identification \n        and referral procedures for, students who are experiencing or \n        perpetrating domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n        assault, sexual harassment, stalking, or sex trafficking.\n            ``(3) Schools can play an important role in providing \n        students with a knowledge base that may allow students to make \n        informed decisions and form a healthy lifestyle.\n            ``(4) According to the Department of Justice, there is an \n        average of 293,066 victims (age 12 or older) of rape and sexual \n        assault each year.\n            ``(5) Young women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience \n        the highest rate of intimate partner violence. According to one \n        national study, 29 percent of the young women surveyed who had \n        ever been in a relationship said they had been pressured to \n        have sex or to engage in sexual activity they did not want.\n            ``(6) From 1997 to 2013, females ages 18 to 24 consistently \n        experienced higher rates of rape and sexual assault than \n        females in other age brackets.\n            ``(7) Partners of all genders and those in same-sex \n        relationships also experience dating violence. A 2013 survey of \n        grade school students found that 43 percent of lesbian, gay, \n        bisexual, and transgender youth reported being victims of \n        physical dating violence, compared to 29 percent of \n        heterosexual youth.\n            ``(8) Experiencing dating violence is associated with an \n        increase in sexual risk-taking behaviors, health risks, and is \n        associated with adolescent and unintended pregnancy.\n            ``(9) Teaching and learning practices in the United States \n        frequently do not address safe relationship behavior education \n        and training, for example--\n                    ``(A) sex education curriculum should address \n                emotional relationship health;\n                    ``(B) sexual harassment undermines the ability of \n                schools to provide safe and equitable learning or \n                workplace environments; and\n                    ``(C) classroom textbooks and educational materials \n                do not sufficiently reflect the promotion of safe and \n                healthy relationships.\n            ``(10) Efforts to improve the quality of public education \n        must also include efforts to ensure programs for safe \n        relationship behavior training.\n            ``(11) Federal support should address not only research and \n        development of innovative model curricula and teaching and \n        learning strategies to promote healthy behavior, but should \n        also assist schools and local communities with implementing a \n        curriculum that includes sexual assault and teen dating \n        violence.\n\n``SEC. 5624.
