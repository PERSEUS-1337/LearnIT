FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Office of Science is the largest Federal sponsor of \n        civilian research in the physical sciences and plays a major \n        role in supporting interdisciplinary research that contributes \n        to other scientific fields, including the life sciences, \n        mathematics, computer science, engineering, and the \n        environmental sciences.\n            (2) The Department of Energy's laboratories have scientific \n        capabilities that are unmatched in typical academic or \n        industrial institutions. Their scientific teams can develop \n        integrated approaches to grand scientific challenges that are \n        often beyond the reach of individual experimenters. The Human \n        Genome Project exemplifies this capability.\n            (3) The facilities at the Department of Energy's \n        laboratories are invaluable to scientists across disciplines, \n        including those from academia, industry, and government.\n            (4) For more than half a century, science research has had \n        an extraordinary impact on the economy, national security, \n        medicine, energy, life sciences, and the environment. In the \n        economic arena, studies show that about half of all United \n        States post-World War II economic growth is a direct result of \n        technological innovation stemming from scientific research.\n            (5) The Department of Energy's Office of Science programs, \n        in constant dollars, have been flat funded for more than a \n        decade, placing our scientific leadership in jeopardy and \n        limiting the generation of ideas that will enhance our security \n        and drive future economic growth.\n            (6) Because the cost of doing research increases at a \n        faster rate than the Consumer Price Index, flat funding for the \n        Office of Science has led to a decline in the number of grants \n        awarded, students trained, and scientists supported. Flat and \n        erratic funding has also led to an underutilization of the \n        facilities that the United States has invested hundreds of \n        millions of dollars to construct.\n            (7) Higher funding levels for the Office of Science will \n        provide more opportunities for young Americans to enter the \n        fields of mathematics, engineering, and the physical sciences, \n        helping to alleviate an increasing over-reliance on foreign \n        talent in these fields.\n\n                TITLE I--OFFICE OF SCIENCE AUTHORIZATION\n\nSEC. 101. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) Program Direction.--The Secretary of Energy, acting through the \nOffice of Science, shall--\n            (1) conduct a comprehensive program of fundamental \n        research, including research on chemical sciences, physics, \n        materials sciences, biological and environmental sciences, \n        geosciences, engineering sciences, plasma sciences, \n        mathematics, and advanced scientific computing;\n            (2) maintain, upgrade, and expand the scientific user \n        facilities maintained by the Office of Science and ensure that \n        they are an integral part of the departmental mission for \n        exploring the frontiers of fundamental science;\n            (3) maintain a leading-edge research capability in the \n        energy-related aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology, \n        advanced scientific computing and genome research;
