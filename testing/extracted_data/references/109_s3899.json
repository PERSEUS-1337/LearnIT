FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since the 1990s, the United States has experienced \n        record trade deficits that has made the United States the \n        largest debtor country in the world.\n            (2) In 2005, the merchandise trade deficit of the United \n        States was a record $767,000,000,000, and in 2006, the \n        merchandise trade deficit of the United States is projected to \n        surpass the record set in 2005.\n            (3) The surging trade deficits could soon create a balance \n        of payments crisis for the United States, which could wreak \n        havoc with the economy of the United States.\n            (4) Article XII of the General Agreement on Tariff and \n        Trade (GATT 1994), annexed to the Agreement Establishing the \n        World Trade Organization entered into on April 15, 1994, \n        permits any member country to restrict the quantity or value of \n        imports in order to safeguard the external financial position \n        and the balance of payments of the member country.\n            (5) In accordance with Article XII of the GATT 1994, the \n        United States should take steps to restore balance to its \n        merchandise trade, and safeguard its external financial \n        position and its balance of payments.\n            (6) The imposition of import restrictions should be phased \n        in to allow the economy of the United States to absorb the \n        impact of import restrictions with minimal disruption.\n\nSEC. 3.
