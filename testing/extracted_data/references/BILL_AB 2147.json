    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 22659.7 is added to the Vehicle Code, to read:\n22659.7.\nNotwithstanding any other law, a motor vehicle is a public nuisance subject to seizure by a local law enforcement agency and an impoundment period of up to 30 days when the motor vehicle is used in the commission or attempted commission of a violation of subdivision (b) of Section 647 of the Penal Code by a person buying or attempting to buy sexual services if the owner or operator of the vehicle has had a prior conviction for the same offense within the past three years. The vehicle may only be impounded pursuant to a valid arrest by a local law enforcement agency of the driver for a violation of subdivision (b) of Section 647 of the Penal Code for buying or attempting to buy sexual services. The following procedures shall apply:\n(a) Within two working days after impoundment, the impounding agency shall send a notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the legal owner of the vehicle, at the address obtained from the department, informing the owner that the vehicle has been impounded. The notice shall also include notice of the opportunity for a poststorage hearing to determine the validity of the storage or to determine mitigating circumstances establishing that the vehicle should be released. The impounding agency shall be prohibited from charging for more than five days\u2019 storage if the agency fails to notify the legal owner within two working days after the impoundment when the legal owner redeems the impounded vehicle. The impounding agency shall maintain a published telephone number that provides information 24 hours a day regarding the impoundment of vehicles and the rights of a legal owner and a registered owner to request a hearing. The notice shall include all of the following information:\n(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the agency providing the notice.\n(2) The location of the place of storage and description of the vehicle that shall include, if available, the model or make, the manufacturer, the license plate number, and the mileage.\n(3) The authority and purpose for the removal of the vehicle.\n(4) A statement that, in order to receive a poststorage hearing, the owners, or their agents, shall request the hearing in person, writing, or by telephone within 10 calendar days of the date appearing on the notice.\n(b) The poststorage hearing shall be conducted within 48 hours of the request, excluding weekends and holidays. The public agency may authorize one of its own officers or employees to conduct the hearing if that hearing officer is not the same person who directed the seizure of the vehicle or who arrested the defendant.\n(c) Failure of the legal and the registered owners, or their agents, to request or to attend a scheduled hearing shall satisfy the poststorage hearing requirement.\n(d) The agency employing the person who directed the storage of the vehicle shall be responsible for the costs incurred for towing and storage if it is determined in the poststorage hearing that reasonable grounds for the storage are not established.\n(e) Any period during which a vehicle is subjected to storage pursuant to this section shall be included as part of the period of impoundment.\n(f) The impounding agency shall release the vehicle to the registered owner or his or her agent prior to the end of the impoundment period under any of the following circumstances:\n(1) The driver of the impounded vehicle was arrested without probable cause.\n(2) The vehicle is a stolen vehicle.\n(3) The vehicle is subject to bailment and was driven by an unlicensed driver employed by a business establishment, including a parking service or repair garage.\n(4) The driver of the vehicle is not the sole registered owner of the vehicle and the vehicle is being released to another registered owner of the vehicle who agrees not to allow the driver to use the vehicle until after the end of the impoundment period.\n(5) The registered owner of the vehicle was neither the driver nor a passenger of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation or was unaware that the driver was using the vehicle to engage in activities subject to subdivision (b) of Section 647 of the Penal Code.\n(6) A spouse, registered domestic partner, or other affected third party objects to the impoundment of the vehicle on the grounds that impounding the vehicle would create a hardship because the subject vehicle is the sole vehicle in a household. The hearing officer shall release the vehicle where the hardship to a spouse, registered domestic partner, or other affected third party created by the impoundment of the subject vehicle, or the length of the impoundment, outweigh the seriousness and the severity of the act in which the vehicle was used.\n(g) Notwithstanding any other law, if a motor vehicle is released prior to the conclusion of the impoundment period because the driver was arrested without probable cause, neither the arrested person nor the registered owner of the motor vehicle shall be responsible for the towing and storage charges.\n(h) Except as provided in subdivision (g), the registered owner or his or her agent shall be responsible for all towing and storage charges related to the impoundment.\n(i) A vehicle removed and seized pursuant to this section shall be released to the legal owner of the vehicle or the legal owner\u2019s agent prior to the end of the impoundment period if both of the following conditions are met:\n(1) The legal owner is a motor vehicle dealer, bank, credit union, acceptance corporation, or other licensed financial institution legally operating in this state or is another person who is not the registered owner and holds a security interest in the vehicle.\n(2) The legal owner or the legal owner\u2019s agent pays all towing and storage fees related to the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle.\n(j) (1) No lien sale processing fees shall be charged to the legal owner who redeems the vehicle prior to the 15th day of the impoundment period.
