    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The development of new and innovative environmental \n        technologies, including technologies for monitoring \n        environmental compliance, has been identified as a priority by \n        the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Current Agency environmental monitoring requirements \n        typically specify the use of a particular prescriptive \n        analytical method that must be precisely followed, including \n        the use of specific procedures and instrumentation. The \n        codification of environmental monitoring methods in this manner \n        hampers innovation because of the time-consuming and labor-\n        intensive requirements for revising regulations and written \n        methods.\n            (3) Regulations can encourage the diffusion of innovative \n        and pollution preventing technologies if they are cast in terms \n        that specify performance in terms of data quality objectives, \n        rather than technology or method.\n            (4) The Agency is evaluating the barriers to the \n        introduction of new and innovative environmental monitoring \n        technologies and the option of converting from the current \n        prescriptive analytical methods approach to performance-based \n        monitoring methods.\n            (5) The Agency has established no internal deadline for \n        completing its review of the possibility of converting to \n        performance-based monitoring methods.\n            (6) The Agency lacks a mechanism for facilitating effective \n        communication with Industry on the direction of environmental \n        monitoring methods, technologies, and markets, and Agency \n        regulations affecting them.\n            (7) The market for environmental monitoring products and \n        services is one of the most attractive arenas of the United \n        States Government to enhance our international competitiveness \n        and export performance, and the analytical method used in \n        environmental monitoring are critical to this effort.\n            (8) The Agency should foster efforts by the scientific \n        community to develop environmental monitoring methods which \n        improve environmental quality and which also improve the \n        competitiveness of United States firms in the domestic and \n        international marketplace.\n            (9) The current Agency requirement that prescriptive \n        analytical methods be used hinders the introduction of \n        environmental monitoring methods and technologies with \n        comparable or improved capabilities, and which may also be more \n        cost effective.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) spur the development, introduction, and use of new and \n        innovative environmental monitoring technologies,\n            (2) encourage the development and use of new environmental \n        monitoring technologies through the conversion of the Agency's \n        prescriptive analytical methods to performance-based monitoring \n        methods,\n            (3) establish a date certain by which the Environmental \n        Protection Agency must complete the development of performance-\n        based monitoring methods and a process for implementation \n        within all Agency program and administrative offices to cover \n        all media and multimedia methods,\n            (4) promote and encourage participation and representation \n        among all interested parties during this process, and\n            (5) establish a date certain by which the Agency will \n        develop a plan for guidance, implementation, and acceptance of \n        performance-based monitoring methods by all Environmental \n        Protection Agency regions, program offices, and States.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Agency'' means the United States \n        Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of \n        the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (3) The term ``environmental monitoring methods'' means \n        procedures or techniques associated with the performance, \n        technical capability, or environmental impact of an analytical \n        method.\n            (4) The term ``Industry'' means members of the United \n        States environmental monitoring technology industry and \n        laboratories performing environmental testing.\n            (5) The term ``performance-based monitoring method'' means \n        a requirement that imposes legal accountability for the \n        achievement of specific data quality assurance objectives, \n        without prescribing the particular procedures, techniques, or \n        instrumentation for achieving such objectives.\n\nSEC. 3.
