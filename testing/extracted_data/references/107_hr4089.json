FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly one-third of women in the United States report \n        being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend \n        at some point in their lives.\n            (2) Family violence costs the Nation between $5,000,000,000 \n        and $10,000,000,000 each year in medical expenses, police and \n        court costs, shelters and foster care, sick leave, absenteeism, \n        and non-productivity.\n            (3) The United States is becoming increasingly \n        multicultural, and minorities are expected to constitute \n        approximately 50 percent of the population of the United States \n        by 2050.\n            (4) Minority women face unique challenges to reporting and \n        getting help for domestic violence.\n            (5) Structural inequalities experienced by minorities, \n        including poverty and discrimination, may contribute to higher \n        rates of violence.\n            (6) Many immigrant women refuse to leave a violent \n        relationship because of fears related to their immigration \n        status.\n            (7) Many minority women face cultural barriers to reporting \n        abuse or seeking help for domestic violence, including but not \n        limited to strong religious beliefs that stress the importance \n        of keeping family intact, fear of dishonor, and a belief that \n        negative events occur regardless of attempts to prevent them.\n            (8) Many minority women also face institutional barriers to \n        reporting abuse or seeking help for domestic violence, \n        including but not limited to a lack of translators or bilingual \n        professionals, little reading material in the woman's native \n        language, treatment programs that do not take into account \n        ethnic and cultural differences, prohibitive fee structures, \n        and inflexible or inconvenient hours of operation.\n\nSEC. 3.
