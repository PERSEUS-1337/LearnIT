K-12 SERVICE-LEARNING PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n\n``PART E--ENHANCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF K-12 EDUCATION THROUGH SERVICE \n                                LEARNING\n\n``SEC. 2501. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``The Congress finds as follows:\n            ``(1) Students learn best when they are actively engaged in \n        meaningful and challenging learning experiences that encourage \n        higher order skills development, critical thinking, and problem \n        solving.\n            ``(2) Service learning is a pedagogy that encompasses key \n        elements of effective teaching and learning, including active \n        learning, authentic experiences, opportunities for peer \n        collaboration, problem solving, student leadership and \n        empowerment, and cognitively challenging academic activities.\n            ``(3) Students invest themselves in learning when their \n        educational experiences have personal meaning to them and are \n        connected to authentic, real issues in their everyday lives.\n            ``(4) In service learning, students apply their knowledge \n        and skills to solve actual community problems and experience \n        the real-world value of what they are learning in school. \n        Service learning can therefore have a powerful effect on \n        students, increasing their academic engagement, their civic \n        engagement and their social and emotional development.\n            ``(5) Service learning can have a powerful effect on \n        students, helping them to increase their academic engagement \n        and performance, their civic engagement and desire to help \n        others, and their social-emotional learning in areas related to \n        21st century skill acquisition, such as task persistence, \n        intellectual curiosity, and ability to work in teams.\n            ``(6) In service learning, students connect to the \n        community and to their classmates in ways that are far more \n        powerful than simple cooperative learning.\n            ``(7) Service learning has been found to promote behavioral \n        and dispositional factors that mediate students' educational \n        success such as greater motivation for school, engagement in \n        learning tasks, building of self-efficacy and self-esteem, and \n        propensity to engage in pro-social behaviors.\n            ``(8) Research has demonstrated that test scores of \n        students who participated in service learning are higher in \n        reading, writing, mathematics, social studies, and science than \n        those of non-participants.\n            ``(9) High-quality service learning will improve student \n        achievement and our schools because it employs effective, \n        experiential learning strategies associated with student \n        engagement in academic work and preparation for success in \n        college and the workplace, engages students in solving complex \n        problems, probes for deeper learning, and seeks opportunities \n        for students to transfer knowledge from one context to another.\n            ``(10) Principals report that service learning has a \n        positive impact on teacher satisfaction, school climate, \n        academic achievement, and school engagement.\n            ``(11) Teachers who use service learning in the classroom \n        as a type of positive teaching strategy achieve better results \n        in a variety of academic and behavioral categories than those \n        who don't, are more effective, challenged, and energized, and \n        are more likely to remain within their chosen profession.\n            ``(12) Only an estimated 24 percent of the approximately \n        53,300,000 K-12 youth in the United States are given the \n        opportunity to engage in any kind of service-learning \n        experience, a decline from 32 percent in 1999.\n            ``(13) Schools in high poverty areas are less likely to \n        employ service learning as a teaching strategy, yet research \n        has shown this is a particularly effective pedagogy for use in \n        such schools. Service learning can significantly reduce the \n        achievement gap between affluent and low-income students. Low-\n        income students who participated in service opportunities have \n        better school attendance and grades than low-income students \n        who do not participate.\n            ``(14) There is a need for a rigorous and focused \n        initiative to demonstrate and broadly promote high-quality \n        service learning that enhances teacher effectiveness, improves \n        student learning and educational success, and positively \n        affects school climate.\n            ``(15) State educational agencies are the only entities \n        with comprehensive, statewide responsibility for the quality of \n        learning within a State.\n\n``SEC. 2502. PURPOSE.\n\n    ``The purpose of this part is to authorize a national elementary \nand secondary school service-learning program that will expand \nopportunities for students to engage in high-quality service learning \nthat--\n            ``(1) promotes student achievement in academic subjects, \n        including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;\n            ``(2) incorporates 21st century skills, such as critical \n        thinking, problem solving and collaboration;\n            ``(3) integrates content knowledge and use of technology;\n            ``(4) enhances school climate and civic engagement; and\n            ``(5) improves post-school outcomes.\n\n``SEC. 2503.
