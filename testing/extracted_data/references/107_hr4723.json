FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) Ukraine allows its citizens the right and opportunity \n        to emigrate, free of any heavy tax on emigration or on the \n        visas or other documents required for emigration and free of \n        any tax, levy, fine, fee, or other charge on any citizens as a \n        consequence of the desire of such citizens to emigrate to the \n        country of their choice;\n            (2) Ukraine has been found to be in full compliance with \n        the freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the \n        Trade Act of 1974 since 1997;\n            (3) since reestablishing independence in 1991, Ukraine has \n        taken important steps toward the creation of democratic \n        institutions and a free-market economy and, as a member state \n        of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n        (OSCE), is committed to developing a system of governance in \n        accordance with the principles regarding human rights and \n        humanitarian affairs that are set forth in the Final Act of the \n        Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (also known as \n        the ``Helsinki Final Act'');\n            (4) Ukraine has shown progress towards meeting \n        international commitments and standards in its most recent \n        Parliamentary elections, recognizing that significant problems \n        remain, including shortcomings in the implementation of \n        Ukraine's election laws, illegal interference by public \n        authorities in the electoral process, and intimidation against \n        opposition contestants, activists, and voters.\n            (5) Ukraine is committed to addressing issues relating to \n        its national and religious minorities as a member state of the \n        OSCE and to adopting measures to ensure that persons belonging \n        to national minorities have full equality both individually and \n        communally;\n            (6) Ukraine has enacted legislation providing protection \n        against incitement to violence against persons or groups based \n        on national, racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, \n        hostility, or hatred, including anti-Semitism, and has \n        committed itself, including through a letter to the President \n        of the United States, to ensuring freedom of religion and \n        preventing racial and ethnic intolerance and hatred;\n            (7) Ukraine has engaged in efforts to combat ethnic and \n        religious intolerance by cooperating with various United States \n        nongovernmental organizations;\n            (8) Ukraine is continuing the restitution of religious \n        properties, including religious and communal properties \n        confiscated from national and religious minorities during the \n        Soviet era, is facilitating the revival of those minority \n        groups, and is in the process of developing a legislative \n        framework for completing this process, as was confirmed in a \n        letter to the President of the United States;\n            (9) Ukraine has received normal trade relations treatment \n        since concluding a bilateral trade agreement with the United \n        States that entered into force on June 23, 1992;\n            (10) Ukraine is making progress toward accession to the \n        World Trade Organization, recognizing that many central issues \n        remain to be resolved, including commitments relating to \n        protection of intellectual property rights, tariff and excise \n        tax reductions for goods (including automobiles), trade in \n        services, agricultural subsidy levels, elimination of export \n        incentives for industrial goods, reform of customs procedures \n        and technical, sanitary, and phytosanitary measures, and \n        inclusion of trade remedy provisions;\n            (11) Ukraine has enacted some protections reflecting \n        internationally recognized labor rights, but serious gaps \n        remain both in the country's legal regime and its enforcement \n        record, with areas of particular concern including restrictions \n        on independent unions, interference in collective bargaining of \n        independent unions, and unsafe conditions at work;\n            (12) Ukraine has established exemplary relations with all \n        neighboring countries, and pursues a course of European \n        integration with a commitment to ensuring democracy and \n        prosperity for its citizens; and\n            (13) Ukraine has participated with the United States in its \n        peacekeeping operations in Europe and has provided important \n        cooperation in the global struggle against international \n        terrorism.\n\nSEC. 2.
