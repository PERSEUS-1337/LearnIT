    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge \nAuthorization Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the area known as the Clarks River Basin, consisting of \n        20,000 acres of bottomland hardwood and associated wetlands \n        along the Clarks River and the East Fork of the Clarks River in \n        Graves, Marshall, and McCracken Counties, Kentucky, is of \n        critical importance to a variety of migratory and resident \n        waterfowl, neotropical migratory birds, forest wildlife, and \n        riverine species, and a wide array of other species associated \n        with bottomland communities;\n            (2) the area is the only major, natural (unchannelized) \n        bottomland hardwood wetland ecosystem remaining in western \n        Kentucky and attracts wintering migratory waterfowl, \n        neotropical migratory birds, and an array of raptors;\n            (3) the area provides extraordinary recreational, research, \n        and educational opportunities for students, scientists, \n        birdwatchers, wildlife observers, hunters, anglers, hikers, and \n        nature photographers;\n            (4) the area is an internationally significant \n        environmental resource that is unprotected and requires active \n        management to prevent vegetative encroachment and to otherwise \n        protect and enhance the value of the area as fish and wildlife \n        habitat;\n            (5) the Clarks River Basin has been identified in the \n        preliminary project proposal plan for the establishment of the \n        Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge, prepared by the United \n        States Fish and Wildlife Service (Southeast Region), as an area \n        deserving permanent protection; and\n            (6) since agriculture and silviculture are essential to the \n        economies of Graves, Marshall, and McCracken Counties and can \n        contribute to healthy ecosystems for wildlife, the refuge \n        should not restrict agricultural and silvicultural activities \n        on private lands.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish the Kentucky National \nWildlife Refuge to be managed--\n            (1) to conserve fish and wildlife populations and the \n        habitats of the populations, including habitats of bald eagles, \n        golden eagles, Indiana bats, wood ducks, neotropical migratory \n        birds, shorebirds, and other migratory birds;\n            (2) to preserve and showcase the concepts of biodiversity \n        and ecosystem management;\n            (3) to enhance and provide a vital link to public areas \n        containing habitat managed for waterfowl and other migratory \n        birds;\n            (4) to fulfill international treaty obligations of the \n        United States with regard to fish and wildlife and the habitats \n        of the fish and wildlife;\n            (5) to restore and maintain the physical and biological \n        integrity of wetlands and other waters within the refuge;\n            (6) to conserve species known to be threatened with \n        extinction; and\n            (7) to provide opportunities for scientific research, \n        environmental education, and fish- and wildlife-associated \n        recreation (including hunting, trapping, and fishing) and \n        access to the extent compatible with the management purposes \n        specified in paragraphs (1) through (6).\n\nSEC. 4.
