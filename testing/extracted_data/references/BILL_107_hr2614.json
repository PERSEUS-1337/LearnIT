FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Automobile fuel economy standards have played an \n        important role in mitigating the increased consumption of \n        gasoline and have resulted in lower fuel costs to consumers.\n            (2) Such standards and the successful response of \n        automobile manufacturers to those standards have been very \n        effective in increasing automobile fuel efficiency, resulting \n        in a near doubling of the passenger automobile fleet fuel \n        economy between 1975 and the present.\n            (3) In recent years, the average automobile fuel economy of \n        the fleets of many automobile manufacturers has actually \n        declined, while the size and horsepower of the fleets have \n        increased. Overall, automobile and light truck average fuel \n        economy in 2000 was at its lowest in 20 years.\n            (4) Several Government studies agree that increased fuel \n        efficiency is possible utilizing currently available technology \n        and without significant changes in the size, mix, or \n        performance of the fleet of automobiles. In addition, the \n        safety of the current fleet of automobiles can be maintained \n        and potentially improved through improved safety features.\n            (5) With appropriate lead time, and by utilizing technology \n        currently in production, passenger automobile average fuel \n        economy of between 38 and 45 miles per gallon has been \n        estimated by various experts to be feasible without significant \n        changes in automobile size or performance. When technology \n        currently in development becomes available, even higher levels \n        of average fuel economy are possible.\n            (6) Improved automobile average fuel economy standards can \n        reduce carbon dioxide emissions, improve air quality, and \n        potentially mitigate against global warming.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPROVING CRASH SAFETY OF AUTOMOBILES AND LIGHT TRUCKS IN \n              COLLISIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 301 of title 49, United \nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 30128.
