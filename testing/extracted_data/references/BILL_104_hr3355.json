FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) There has been increased and growing public concern \n        expressed regarding the quality and safety of services provided \n        by health care facilities and institutions, as such facilities \n        have instituted aggressive efforts to reduce levels of staff \n        who provide direct patient care services as a principal means \n        of decreasing expenses.\n            (2) A growing body of data suggests a linkage between the \n        number and mix of nursing staff and positive patient care \n        outcomes, including the avoidance of patient death and injury.\n            (3) Many employees of health care facilities have expressed \n        fear for their employment if they report unsafe conditions, \n        including violations of State or Federal law.\n            (4) Unprecedented consolidation among health care \n        institutions has led to increasing concern regarding the effect \n        of such activity on the health and safety of communities served \n        by these facilities, yet the Federal Government has little \n        authority to evaluate such effect in deciding whether or not to \n        approve mergers and acquisitions among health care facilities.\n\nSEC. 3.
