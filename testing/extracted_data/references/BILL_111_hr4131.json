FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Secondhand smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, \n        including at least 69 carcinogens.\n            (2) Secondhand smoke is responsible for almost 50,000 \n        deaths in the United States each year.\n            (3) In 2006, the Surgeon General of the United States \n        concluded that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand \n        smoke.\n            (4) Secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and heart disease \n        among adults who do not smoke.\n            (5) Workplaces are a major source of secondhand smoke \n        exposure.\n            (6) The Surgeon General has concluded that smoke-free \n        workplace policies are the only effective way to eliminate \n        secondhand smoke exposure in the workplace. Separating smokers \n        from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings \n        cannot eliminate exposure.\n            (7) An October 2009 report ``Secondhand Smoke Exposure and \n        Cardiovascular Effects: Making Sense of the Evidence'' from the \n        Institute of Medicine concludes that smoke-free laws reduce \n        heart attacks.\n            (8) A July 2009 Institute of Medicine report, ``Combating \n        Tobacco Use in Military and Veteran Populations'', recommended \n        that the Department of Defense, the Armed Services, and the \n        Veterans Administration ``raise the priority given to tobacco \n        control throughout their organizations'' with the goal of \n        achieving a tobacco-free military.\n\nSEC. 3.
