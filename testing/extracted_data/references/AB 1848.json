    "title": "An act to add Section 680.1 to the Penal Code, relating to DNA evidence.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 680.1 is added to the Penal Code, to read:\n680.1.\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares the following:\n(1) There is a significant public interest in knowing what percentage of rape\nkit biological samples\nkits\nare analyzed for the perpetrator\u2019s DNA profile, as well as why any untested rape\nkit samples\nkits\nare not analyzed. Currently, there is no mandatory statewide tracking mechanism in place to collect and report these metrics. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section, pursuant to recommendations by the California State Auditor to the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, to correct that.\n(2) In 2015, the Department of Justice created the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Tracking (SAFE-T) database to track the status of all sexual assault evidence kits collected in the state based on voluntary data input from law enforcement agencies. It is the intent of the Legislature by enacting this section to require participation in that database.\n(b) On a schedule set forth by the Department of Justice, each law enforcement agency that has investigated a case involving the collection of sexual assault kit evidence during the relevant period of time, as determined by the department, shall report to the department, through the SAFE-T database, the data required by the department in its communications to law enforcement. The data shall include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(1) The number of kits collected during the period.\n(2) The number of kits from which one or more biological evidence samples were submitted to a DNA laboratory for analysis.\n(3) The number of kits from which a probative DNA profile was generated.\n(4) The reason or reasons for not submitting evidence from a given rape kit to a DNA laboratory for processing.\n(c) After 120 days following submission of rape kit biological evidence for processing, if a public DNA laboratory has not conducted DNA testing, that laboratory shall provide the reasons for the status in the appropriate SAFE-T data field. If the investigating law enforcement agency has contracted with a private laboratory to conduct DNA testing on rape kit evidence, the submitting law enforcement agency shall provide the 120-day update in SAFE-T. The process described in this subdivision shall take place every 120 days until DNA testing occurs, except as provided in subdivision (d).\n(d) Upon expiration of a sexual assault case\u2019s statute of limitations set forth in Section 803, or if a law enforcement agency elects not to analyze the DNA or intends to destroy or dispose of the crime scene evidence pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 680, the investigating law enforcement agency shall state in writing the reason the kit collected as part of that case\u2019s investigation was not analyzed. This written statement relieves the investigating law enforcement agency or public laboratory of any further duty to report information related to that kit pursuant to this section.\n(e) The SAFE-T database shall not contain any identifying information about a victim or a suspect, shall not contain any DNA profiles, and shall not contain any information that would impair a pending criminal investigation.\n(f) On an annual basis, the Department of Justice shall file a report to the Legislature in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code summarizing data entered into the SAFE-T database during that year. The report shall not reference individual victims, suspects, investigations, or prosecutions. The report shall be made public by the department.\n(g) Except as provided in subdivision (f), in order to protect the confidentiality of the SAFE-T database information, SAFE-T database contents shall be confidential and a participating law enforcement agency or laboratory shall not be compelled in a criminal or civil proceeding, except as required by\na law enforcement agency\u2019s duty to produce exculpatory evidence to a criminal defendant,\nBrady v. Maryland (1963) 373 U.S. 83,\nto provide any SAFE-T database contents to any person or party seeking those records or information.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 680.1 to the Penal Code, imposes a limitation on the public\u2019s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nIn order to protect the privacy of victims of crime, it is necessary to keep the information in the SAFE-T database confidential.\nSEC. 3.\nIf the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code."
