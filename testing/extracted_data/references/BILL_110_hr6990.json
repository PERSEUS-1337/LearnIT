FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has suffered tremendously from the \n        irresponsible and unchecked growth of the mortgage industry \n        which proliferated under the policies of Fannie Mae and Freddie \n        Mac.\n            (2) The Federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie \n        Mac may cost the American people a minimum of $200,000,000,000, \n        and potentially $2.4 trillion, making it potentially the \n        largest financial bailout in our Nation's history.\n            (3) The American people, forced to shoulder the financial \n        burden of the bailout, deserve to know what went wrong and why.\n            (4) Any executive officers and members of the boards of \n        directors at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who may have exercised \n        poor judgment or committed wrongdoing should be held \n        accountable for such judgments and actions.\n            (5) In June 2003, Freddie Mac disclosed that it had \n        misstated its earnings by roughly $5 billion between the years \n        2000 and 2002 to smooth the appearance of quarterly volatility \n        in earnings and to meet Wall Street expectations.\n            (6) In December 2004, the Securities and Exchange \n        Commission found that Fannie Mae had violated accounting rules \n        and needed to restate its earnings by recording a loss of up to \n        $9 billion from 2001 to 2004 based on board policies \n        established prior to that period.\n            (7) The shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the \n        employees and directors of the boards of these enterprises have \n        enjoyed large dividends, bonuses, salaries, and other \n        compensation based on policies and practices that may have been \n        misguided or fraudulent.\n            (8) In 2007, former Freddie Mac Chairman and Chief \n        Executive Richard Syron alone received nearly $18,300,000 in \n        compensation, despite the fact that the enterprise's stock lost \n        half its value.\n            (9) Last year, former Fannie Mae President and Chief \n        Executive Daniel Mudd received compensation valued at \n        $11,600,000.\n            (10) Previous investigations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n        have focused on accounting fraud, but there have not been any \n        investigations on the policies and decisions that contributed \n        to and exacerbated our Nation's housing crisis and financial \n        collapse of these corporations.\n            (11) According to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \n        Oversight, regulation allowed Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to \n        overleverage and operate with just $83.2 billion of capital at \n        the end of 2007, even though it supported $5.2 trillion of debt \n        and guarantees.\n            (12) Although the executive officers of Fannie Mae and \n        Freddie Mac have come under scrutiny, their boards of directors \n        have been held harmless throughout the Nation's housing crisis, \n        despite having the authority to create, influence, and vote for \n        the policies of such enterprises.\n            (13) The involvement of the boards of directors in the \n        policies of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has been shrouded in \n        secrecy, as their policymaking decisions have not been publicly \n        disclosed, despite the public protections and benefits their \n        enterprises receive.\n            (14) There is a need to fully understand what went wrong in \n        the management of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the misguided, \n        potentially fraudulent board policies and practices that \n        ultimately led to the Federal conservatorship of such \n        enterprises so that similar mistakes will not be repeated in \n        the future.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Independent \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac Investigative Commission'' (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Commission''). The Commission shall function upon \nthe legislation being signed by the President of the United States and \nwill conduct its investigations for a period of two years, issuing a \nfinal report upon completion with necessary hearings and assembly of \nrelated records for the period following the savings and loan crisis of \nthe 1980s to the present.\n\nSEC. 4.
