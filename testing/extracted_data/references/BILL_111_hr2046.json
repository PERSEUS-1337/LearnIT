FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The energy required to manufacture beverage containers \n        from recycled containers is often less than the energy required \n        to create new beverage container materials from raw materials.\n            (2) Recycling beverage containers would reduce municipal \n        solid waste and reduce the energy and heat-trapping emissions \n        generated in the manufacture of new aluminum, plastics, and \n        other beverage container materials.\n            (3) An average of 350,000,000 beverage bottles and cans are \n        sent to landfills, incinerated, or littered every day.\n            (4) In 2006, less than half of the 100,000,000,000 aluminum \n        beverage cans purchased were recycled, resulting in the waste \n        of 800,000 tons of aluminum. Nine of ten plastic water bottles, \n        at least 27,000,000,000 bottles a year, end up as garbage or \n        litter, where they take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade.\n            (5) A national system for requiring a refund value on the \n        sale of all beverage containers would provide a positive \n        incentive to individuals to clean up the environment, and would \n        result in a high level of reuse and recycling of such \n        containers and help reduce the costs and environmental dangers \n        associated with solid waste management and container \n        manufacturing.\n            (6) Many Americans do not have access to recycling \n        programs. States that combine container deposit incentives with \n        convenient redemption locations have beverage container \n        recycling rates ranging from 65 percent to over 90 percent. \n        This is significantly higher than the average recycling rates \n        of 35 percent for aluminum cans, 14 percent for plastic \n        bottles, and 12 percent for glass bottles in States without \n        container deposit systems.\n            (7) Many domestic industries are dependent on recycled \n        steel, aluminum, glass and paper. A container deposit system \n        would yield greater access for recyclers to high grade \n        recycling products, preventing these industries from \n        competitive disadvantages in international recycling.\n            (8) States with bottle bills have container recycling rates \n        ranging from 60 percent to over 90 percent, compared to the \n        national average recycling rate of 34 percent.\n            (9) A national system of beverage container recycling is \n        consistent with the intent of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL ACT.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--The Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et \nseq.) is amended by adding the following new subtitle at the end \nthereof:\n\n               ``Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling\n\n``SEC. 12001.
