FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The scenic Cherry Valley area of Northeastern \n        Pennsylvania is blessed with more than 80 special-concern \n        animal and plant species and natural habitats.\n            (2) In a preliminary assessment of Cherry Valley, United \n        States Fish and Wildlife Service biologists ranked Cherry \n        Valley very high as a potential national wildlife refuge.\n            (3) Six species that are listed as endangered species or \n        threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 \n        U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) have been documented within or near Cherry \n        Valley: The bog turtle (possibly the most significant \n        population of the listed subspecies), the dwarf wedge mussel, \n        the northeastern bulrush, the small whorled pogonia, the bald \n        eagle, and the Indiana bat (a historic resident, with efforts \n        under way to re-establish favorable conditions).\n            (4) Cherry Valley provides habitat for at least 79 species \n        of national or regional concern, which either nest in Cherry \n        Valley or migrate through the area during critical times in \n        their life cycle, including--\n                    (A) neo-tropical migratory birds such as the \n                Cerulean Warbler, the Worm-eating Warbler, and the Wood \n                Thrush, all of which nest in Cherry Valley;\n                    (B) waterfowl such as the American Black Duck;\n                    (C) several globally rare plants, such as the \n                spreading globeflower; and\n                    (D) anadromous fish species.\n            (5) The Cherry Valley watershed encompasses a large segment \n        of the Kittatinny Ridge, an important migration route for birds \n        of prey throughout the Northeastern United States. Every \n        migratory raptor species in the Northeast is regularly observed \n        along the Kittatinny Ridge during the autumnal migration, \n        including the bald eagle, the golden eagle, and the broad-\n        winged hawk.\n            (6) The Kittatinny Ridge also includes a long segment of \n        the Appalachian Trail, a nationally significant natural-\n        cultural-recreational feature.\n            (7) Many of the significant wildlife habitats found in the \n        Cherry Valley, especially the rare calcareous wetlands, have \n        disappeared from other localities in their range.\n            (8) Ongoing studies have documented the high water quality \n        of Cherry Creek.\n            (9) Public meetings over several years have demonstrated \n        strong, deep, and growing local support for a Cherry Valley \n        National Wildlife Refuge:\n                    (A) Area landowners, business and community \n                leaders, media, and elected officials have consistently \n                voiced their enthusiasm for a Cherry Valley National \n                Wildlife Refuge.\n                    (B) Numerous local communities and public and \n                private conservation entities share complementary goals \n                for protecting Cherry Valley and are energetically \n                conserving wildlife habitat and farmland. Along with \n                State land-management agencies and the National Park \n                Service, these local entities represent potential \n                strong partners for the United States Fish and Wildlife \n                Service.\n                    (C) A number of local landowners have already put \n                their land into conservation easements or other \n                conservation arrangements.\n                    (D) A voter-approved Monroe County Open Space Fund \n                and a voter-approved Stroud Township municipal land \n                conservation fund have contributed to many of these \n                projects.\n            (10) Two federally owned parcels of land are contiguous to \n        the area to be established by this Act as the Cherry Valley \n        National Wildlife Refuge: The Delaware Water Gap National \n        Recreation Area and a 700-acre segment of the Appalachian Trail \n        owned by the National Park Service.\n\nSEC. 3.
