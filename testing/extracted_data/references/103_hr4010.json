FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) over time, extensive ecological changes have occurred \n        in the Rio Puerco watershed, including--\n                    (A) erosion of agricultural and range lands;\n                    (B) impairment of waters due to heavy \n                sedimentation;\n                    (C) reduced productivity of renewable resources;\n                    (D) loss of biological diversity;\n                    (E) loss of functioning riparian areas; and\n                    (F) loss of available surface water;\n            (2) damage to the watershed has seriously affected the \n        economic and cultural well-being of its inhabitants, \n        including--\n                    (A) loss of existing communities that were based on \n                the land and were self-sustaining; and\n                    (B) adverse effects on the traditions, customs, and \n                cultures of the affected communities;\n            (3) a healthy and sustainable ecosystem is essential to the \n        long-term economic and cultural viability of the region;\n            (4) the impairment of the Rio Puerco watershed has damaged \n        the ecological and economic well-being of the area below the \n        junction of the Rio Puerco with the Rio Grande including--\n                    (A) disruption of ecological processes;\n                    (B) water quality impairment;\n                    (C) significant reduction in the water storage \n                capacity and life expectancy of the Elephant Butte Dam \n                and Reservoir system due to sedimentation;\n                    (D) chronic problems of irrigation system channel \n                maintenance; and\n                    (E) increased risk of flooding caused by sediment \n                accumulation;\n            (5) the Rio Puerco is a major tributary of the Rio Grande \n        and the coordinated implementation of ecosystem-based best \n        management practices for the Rio Puerco system could benefit \n        the larger Rio Grande system;\n            (6) the Rio Puerco watershed has been stressed from the \n        loss of native vegetation, introduction of exotic species, and \n        alteration of riparian habitat which have disrupted the \n        original dynamics of the river and disrupted natural ecological \n        processes;\n            (7) the Rio Puerco watershed is a mosaic of private, \n        Federal, tribal trust, and State land ownership with diverse, \n        sometimes differing management objectives;\n            (8) development, implementation, and monitoring of an \n        effective watershed management program for the Rio Puerco \n        watershed requires cooperation among--\n                    (A) the Bureau of Land Management;\n                    (B) the Rio Puerco Watershed Committee;\n                    (C) the National Forest Service;\n                    (D) the Pueblos of Acoma, Isleta, Jemez, and \n                Laguna;\n                    (E) the Eastern and Canoncito Bands of the Navajo \n                nation;\n                    (F) the Jicarilla Apache Tribe;\n                    (G) the Bureau of Reclamation;\n                    (H) the Geological Survey;\n                    (I) the Bureau of Indian Affairs;\n                    (J) the Fish and Wildlife Service;\n                    (K) the Soil and Conservation Service;\n                    (L) the Army Corps of Engineers;\n                    (M) the National Park Service;\n                    (N) the State of New Mexico;\n                    (O) private landowners;\n                    (P) local and regional governmental entities;\n                    (Q) other interested citizens; and\n                    (R) affected local soil and water conservation \n                districts;\n            (9) the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \n        Director of the Bureau of Land Management, in consultation with \n        the entities listed in paragraph (7), and in cooperation with \n        the Rio Puerco Watershed Committee, is best suited to \n        coordinate management efforts in the Rio Puerco watershed; and\n            (10) accelerating the pace of improvement in Rio Puerco \n        watershed on a coordinated, cooperative basis will benefit \n        persons living in the watershed as well as downstream users on \n        the Rio Grande.\n\nSEC. 3.
