FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The emerging fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering \n        (collectively, ``nanotechnology''), in which matter is \n        manipulated at the atomic level in order to build materials, \n        machines, and devices with novel properties or functions, are \n        leading to unprecedented scientific and technological \n        opportunities that will benefit society by changing the way \n        many things are designed and made.\n            (2) Long-term nanoscale research and development leading to \n        potential breakthroughs in areas such as materials and \n        manufacturing, electronics, medicine and health care, \n        environment, energy, chemicals, biotechnology, agriculture, \n        information technology, and national security could be as \n        significant for the 21st century as the combined influences of \n        microelectronics, biotechnology, and information technology \n        were for the 20th century.\n            (3) Long-term, high-risk research is necessary to create \n        breakthroughs in technology.\n            (4) Such research requires government funding since the \n        benefits are too distant or uncertain for industry alone to \n        support, and the Federal government can play an important role \n        in the development of nanotechnology, as it will take many \n        years of sustained investment for this field to achieve \n        maturity.\n            (5) Advancements in nanotechnology stemming from Federal \n        investments in fundamental research and subsequent private \n        sector development likely will create technologies that support \n        the work and improve the efficiency of the Federal government, \n        and contribute significantly to the efforts of the government's \n        mission agencies.\n            (6) According to various estimates, including those of the \n        National Science Foundation, the market for nanotechnology \n        products and services in the United States alone could reach \n        over $1 trillion later this century.\n            (7) Mastering nanotechnology will require a unique skill \n        set for scientists and engineers that combine chemistry, \n        physics, materials science, and information science.\n            (8) Funding in these critical areas has been flat for many \n        years and as a result fewer young people are electing to go \n        into these areas in graduate schools throughout the Nation, a \n        trend which will have to reverse if we hope to develop the next \n        generation of skilled workers with multidisciplinary \n        perspectives necessary for the development of nanotechnology.\n            (9) Research on nanotechnology creates unprecedented \n        capabilities to alter ourselves and our environment and will \n        give rise to a host of novel social, ethical, philosophical, \n        and legal issues, and addressing these issues will require wide \n        reflection and guidance that is responsive to the realities of \n        the science, as well as additional research to predict, \n        understand, and alleviate anticipated problems.\n            (10) Achieving and maintaining international leadership in \n        nanotechnology is an important national security issue for the \n        Nation, and in addition to the plethora of devices that can be \n        developed for use by the Defense Department, there are many \n        other ways in which nanotechnology has national security \n        implications.\n            (11) The Executive Branch has previously established a \n        National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) to coordinate Federal \n        nanotechnology research and development programs and this \n        initiative has contributed significantly to the development of \n        nanotechnology.\n            (12) Authorizing legislation can serve to establish new \n        technology goals and research directions, improve agency \n        coordination and oversight mechanisms, help ensure optimal \n        returns on investments, and simplify reporting, budgeting, and \nplanning processes for the Executive Branch and Congress.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory \nBoard (in this Act referred to as the ``Advisory Board''). The Advisory \nBoard shall operate in coordination with the White House Office of \nScience and Technology Policy, and shall provide advice to the \nPresident and the National Science and Technology Council on research \ninvestment policy, strategy, program goals, and management processes \nrelating to nanoscience and nanotechnology.\n\nSEC. 4.
