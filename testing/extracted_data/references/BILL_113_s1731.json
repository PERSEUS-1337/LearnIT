DEFINITION OF ESA.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``ESA'' means the Endangered Species Act of \n1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the ESA was passed in 1973 as a means of protecting and \n        recovering species and has not been substantially revised in \n        over 25 years;\n            (2) the ESA has not achieved its stated goal of recovering \n        threatened species or endangered species;\n            (3) of the species listed in accordance with the ESA, less \n        than 1 percent of the total number of species in the United \n        States have been recovered and removed from the list, largely \n        due to data errors or other factors;\n            (4) there is--\n                    (A) no comprehensive independent study of the costs \n                or benefits of the ESA;\n                    (B) no full accounting of how much the Federal \n                Government and State and local governments spend to \n                implement, enforce, and comply with the ESA; and\n                    (C) no meaningful effort to account for the costs \n                the ESA imposes on the private sector;\n            (5) the ESA effectively penalizes landowners for owning \n        endangered species habitat by forcing them to bear the cost of \n        conservation;\n            (6) the regulatory listing process under the ESA has become \n        a tool for environmentalists to undermine, slow down, or halt \n        construction of infrastructure projects, hampering economic \n        growth and employment; and\n            (7) litigation stemming from the ESA and some resulting \n        settlements between the litigants and the Federal Government \n        have made the ESA even more unworkable, to the detriment of \n        species.\n\nSEC. 4. DETERMINATIONS OF ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THREATENED SPECIES.\n\n    Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) is \namended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, with the \n                consent of the Governor of each State in which the \n                endangered species or threatened species is present,'' \n                after ``The Secretary''; and\n                    (B) in paragraph (2)(A)(ii), by inserting ``, with \n                the consent of the Governor of each State in which the \n                endangered species or threatened species is present,'' \n                after ``, who'';\n            (2) in subsection (b)--\n                    (A) by striking paragraph (3);\n                    (B) by redesignating paragraphs (4) through (8) as \n                paragraphs (3) through (7), respectively;\n                    (C) in paragraph (6) (as so redesignated), strike \n                ``paragraph (4), (5), or (6)'' and insert ``paragraph \n                (3), (4), or (5)''; and\n                    (D) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(7) Definition of best scientific and commercial data.--\n        In this subsection, the term `best scientific and commercial \n        data' includes any scientific evidence made available to the \n        Secretary by any State agency.'';\n            (3) by striking subsection (c) and inserting the following:\n    ``(c) Lists.--\n            ``(1) Definition of joint resolution.--In this subsection, \n        the term `joint resolution' means only a joint resolution the \n        matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: `That \n        Congress approves the lists relating to endangered species and \n        threatened species submitted by the Secretary of the Interior \n        on ______.'
