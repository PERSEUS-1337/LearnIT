FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The communications capabilities of first responders and \n        other public safety agencies directly affect the public safety \n        of the people of the United States and our national security.\n            (2) As events such as the terrorist attacks of September \n        11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina revealed, the inability of \n        local, State, tribal, and Federal first responders to \n        communicate effectively during an emergency impairs operations \n        and the ability to mitigate terrorist acts and natural \n        disasters.\n            (3) Many public safety communications systems rely on \n        commercially available systems that lack broadband capabilities \n        or otherwise fail to provide the level of service necessary to \n        meet the mission-critical needs of public safety agencies.\n            (4) A wireless public safety broadband network is needed to \n        guarantee priority access for public safety use and first \n        responder interoperability across the United States.\n            (5) Allocating the paired electromagnetic spectrum bands of \n        758-763 megahertz and 788-793 megahertz, referred to as the D \n        Block, to public safety agencies is the only assured way of \n        meeting public safety's needs for sufficient spectrum and would \n        help reduce the complexity and future operating cost of public \n        safety communications systems.\n            (6) Because the communications needs of public safety \n        agencies may differ by geographic region (including whether \n        they require a dedicated communications system or can rely on a \n        system shared with commercial users), each region requires \n        flexibility to develop a model that meets its needs without \n        sacrificing the interoperability of the system as a whole.\n            (7) The most timely and cost-effective way to achieve \n        nationwide interoperability in public safety communications \n        will be to leverage commercial infrastructure without \n        compromising the mission-critical needs of public safety \n        agencies.\n            (8) The use by public safety agencies of standardized \n        technologies commonly employed in the commercial \n        telecommunications sector will provide significant benefits, \n        including improved capabilities, greater economies of scale, \n        and more rapid adoption of technological innovations.\n            (9) When it is in the interest of public safety, the \n        Federal Communications Commission should encourage any public \n        safety licensee or spectrum lessee to consider using existing \n        or planned commercial infrastructure.\n\nSEC. 3. ALLOCATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY LICENSES.\n\n    (a) Spectrum Allocation.--Section 337(a) of the Communications Act \nof 1934 (47 U.S.C. 337(a)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``24'' and inserting \n        ``34''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``36'' and inserting \n        ``26''.\n    (b) Assignment.--Section 337(b) of such Act (47 U.S.C. 337(b)) is \namended to read as follows:\n    ``(b) Assignment.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n        enactment of the Broadband for First Responders Act of 2010, \n        the Commission shall allocate the paired electromagnetic \n        spectrum bands of 758-763 megahertz and 788-793 megahertz for \n        public safety broadband communications and shall assign such \n        paired bands to public safety.\n            ``(2) Establishment of rules.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The Commission shall establish \n                rules to permit a public safety broadband licensee to \n                authorize providers of public safety services to \n                construct and operate a wireless public safety \n                broadband network in the spectrum licensed to the \n                public safety broadband licensee if the public safety \n                broadband licensee determines that such authorization \n                would expedite the deployment of public safety \n                broadband communications.\n                    ``(B) Network requirements.--The Commission shall \n                require that any such wireless public safety broadband \n                network shall--\n                            ``(i) be fully interoperable and remain \n                        interoperable with, and in conformance with the \n                        same broadband technology standards as, all \n                        other public safety broadband systems deployed \n                        or authorized;\n                            ``(ii) provide for roaming by local, State, \n                        tribal, and Federal Government and other \n                        authorized users of the spectrum licensed to \n                        the public safety broadband licensee;\n                            ``(iii) provide priority access to public \n                        safety agencies;\n                            ``(iv) be built to survive most large-scale \n                        disasters; and\n                            ``(v) ensure that networks of such systems \n                        have the appropriate level of cyber security.\n                    ``(C) Deadline.--The Commission shall establish \n                rules under this paragraph not later than 180 days \n                after the date of enactment of the Broadband for First \n                Responders Act of 2010.''.\n    (c) Network-Sharing Agreements.--Section 337 of such Act (47 U.S.C. \n337) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (g); and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following:\n    ``(f) Rulemaking Required.--The Commission shall establish \nregulations to--\n            ``(1) authorize the shared use of the public safety \n        broadband spectrum and network infrastructure by entities that \n        are not defined as public safety services in subsection (g)(1), \n        subject to requirements that public safety services retain \n        priority access to the spectrum, pursuant to procedures adopted \n        by the Commission; and\n            ``(2) allow use of the public safety broadband spectrum by \n        emergency response providers, as defined in section 2 of the \n        Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101).''.\n    (d) Definition.--Section 337(g) of such Act (as so redesignated) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as paragraphs \n        (2) and (3), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting before paragraph (2), as so redesignated, \n        the following:\n            ``(1) Public safety broadband spectrum.--The term `public \n        safety broadband spectrum' means the electromagnetic spectrum \n        between 758 megahertz and 768 megahertz, inclusive, and 788 \n        megahertz and 798 megahertz, inclusive and any additional \n        electromagnetic frequencies allocated for public safety use \n        that the Commission shall designate for public safety broadband \n        use.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
