FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are \n        United States-designated terrorist organizations.\n            (2) Designated Palestinian terrorist organizations have \n        killed hundreds of Israelis and dozens of Americans in rocket \n        attacks and suicide bombings.\n            (3) Hamas has used underground tunnels to Israel and Egypt \n        to smuggle weapons, money, and supplies into Gaza and to send \n        members of Hamas out of Gaza for training and to bring trainers \n        in to Gaza to teach Hamas how to manufacture rockets and build \n        better tunnels. Tunnels in Gaza have also been used as \n        underground rocket launching sites, weapons caches, bunkers, \n        transportation networks and command and control centers.\n            (4) In 2006, Hamas kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit \n        through a tunnel and held him for five years.\n            (5) The Israel Defense Forces discovered 32 tunnels during \n        the conflict with Hamas in the summer of 2014, 14 of which \n        crossed into Israel.\n            (6) Hamas intentionally uses civilians as human shields by \n        placing its underground tunnel network in densely populated \n        areas and schools, hospitals, and mosques.\n            (7) Hamas's placement of explosive material in its vast \n        network of tunnels in Gaza has caused civilian casualties \n        through secondary and tertiary explosions.\n            (8) While the unemployment rate in Gaza is at 38 percent, \n        it is estimated that Hamas spends $3,000,000 per tunnel.\n            (9) United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he \n        was ``shocked by the tunnels used for the infiltration of \n        terrorists''.\n            (10) Hamas has claimed to be rebuilding tunnels in Gaza \n        after the war with Israel in the summer of 2014.\n            (11) Hezbollah has used underground tunnels in southern \n        Lebanon to move Hezbollah fighters and to launch attacks.\n            (12) The Palestinian Islamic Jihad claims to be digging new \n        tunnels on the Gaza border. Israel has a right to defend itself \n        from the violence of Palestinian terrorist groups, including \n        the violence that is facilitated through terrorist tunnel \n        networks.\n            (13) The United States is working cooperatively with the \n        Government of Israel to develop technologies to detect and \n        destroy tunnels penetrating the territory of Israel.\n\nSEC. 3.
