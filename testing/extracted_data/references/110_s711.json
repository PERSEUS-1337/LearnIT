    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Universal Service for the 21st \nCentury Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The preservation and advancement of universal service \n        is a fundamental goal of the Communications Act of 1934 and the \n        Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n            (2) Access throughout the Nation to high-quality and \n        advanced telecommunications and information services is \n        essential to secure the many benefits of our modern society.\n            (3) As the Internet becomes a critical element of any \n        economic and social growth, universal service should shift from \n        sustaining voice grade infrastructure promoting the development \n        of efficient and advanced networks that can sustain advanced \n        communications services.\n            (4) The current structure established by the Federal \n        Communications Commission has placed the burden of universal \n        service support on only a limited class of carriers, causing \n        inequities in the system, incentives to avoid contribution, and \n        a threat to the long term sustainability of the universal \n        service fund.\n            (5) Current fund contributors are paying an increasing \n        portion of their interstate and international service revenue \n        into the universal service fund.\n            (6) Any fund contribution system should be equitable, \n        nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral, and the funding \n        mechanism must be sufficient to ensure affordable \n        communications services for all.\n\nSEC. 3. UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Inclusion of Intrastate Revenues.--Section 254(d) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254(d)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``Every'' and inserting ``Notwithstanding \n        section 2(b) of this Act, a'';\n            (2) by striking ``interstate'' each place it appears; and\n            (3) by adding at the end ``Nothing in this subsection \n        precludes a State from adopting rules or regulations to \n        preserve and advance universal service within that State as \n        permitted by section 2(b) and subsections (b) and (f) of this \n        section.''.\n    (b) Universal Service Proceeding.--\n            (1) Proceeding.--The Federal Communications Commission \n        shall initiate a proceeding, or take action pursuant to any \n        proceeding on universal service existing on the date of \n        enactment of this Act, to establish a permanent mechanism to \n        support universal service, that will preserve and enhance the \n        long term financial stability of universal service, and will \n        promote the public interest.\n            (2) Criteria.--In establishing such a permanent mechanism, \n        the Commission may include collection methodologies such as \n        total telecommunications revenues, the assignment of telephone \n        numbers and any successor identifier, connections (which could \n        include carriers with a retail connection to a customer), and \n        any combination thereof if the methodology--\n                    (A) promotes competitive neutrality among providers \n                and technologies;\n                    (B) to the greatest extent possible ensures that \n                all communications services that are capable of \n                supporting 2-way voice communications be included in \n                the assessable base for universal service support;\n                    (C) takes into account the impact on low volume \n                users, and proportionately assesses high volume users, \n                through a capacity analysis or some other means; and\n                    (D) ensures that a carrier is not required to \n                contribute more than once for the same transaction, \n                activity, or service.\n            (3) Excluded providers.--If a provider of communications \n        services that are capable of supporting 2-way voice \n        communications would not contribute under the methodology \n        established by the Commission, the Commission shall require \n        such a provider to contribute to universal service under an \n        equitable alternative methodology if exclusion of the provider \n        from the contribution base would jeopardize the preservation, \n        enhancement, and long term sustainability of universal service.\n            (4) Deadline.--The Commission shall complete the proceeding \n        and issue a final rule not more than 6 months after the date of \n        enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION.\n\n    (a) Jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding section 2(b) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 152(b)), the Federal \nCommunications Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction to \nestablish rates for inter-carrier compensation payments and shall \nestablish rules providing a comprehensive, unified system of inter-\ncarrier compensation, including compensation for the origination and \ntermination of intrastate telecommunications traffic.\n    (b) Criteria.--In establishing these rules, and in conjunction with \nits action in its universal service proceeding under section 3, the \nCommission, in consultation with the Federal-State Joint Board on \nUniversal Service, shall--\n            (1) ensure that the costs associated with the provision of \n        interstate and intrastate telecommunications services are fully \n        recoverable;\n            (2) examine whether sufficient requirements exist to ensure \n        traffic contains necessary identifiers for the purposes of \n        inter-carrier compensation; and\n            (3) to the greatest extent possible, minimize opportunities \n        for arbitrage.\n    (c) Sufficient Support.--The Commission should, to the greatest \nextent possible, ensure that as a result of its universal service and \ninter-carrier compensation proceedings, the aggregate amount of \nuniversal service support and inter-carrier compensation provided to \nlocal exchange carriers with fewer than 2 percent of the Nation's \nsubscriber lines will be sufficient to meet the just and reasonable \ncosts of such local exchange carriers.\n    (d) Negotiated Agreements.--Nothing in this section precludes \ncarriers from negotiating their own inter-carrier compensation \nagreements.\n    (e) Deadline.--The Commission shall complete the pending \nIntercarrier Compensation proceeding in Docket No. 01-92 and issue a \nfinal rule not more than 6 months after the date of enactment of this \nAct.\n\nSEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF BROADBAND ACCOUNT WITHIN UNIVERSAL SERVICE \n              FUND.\n\n    Part I of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 201 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 254 the following:\n\n``SEC. 254A. BROADBAND FOR UNSERVED AREAS ACCOUNT.\n\n    ``(a) Account Established.--\n            ``(1) In general.--There shall be, within the universal \n        service fund established pursuant to section 254, a separate \n        account to be known as the `Broadband for Unserved Areas \n        Account'.\n            ``(2) Purpose.--The purpose of the account is to provide \n        financial assistance for the deployment of broadband \n        communications services to unserved areas throughout the United \n        States.\n    ``(b) Implementation.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Commission shall by rule establish--\n                    ``(A) guidelines for determining which areas may be \n                considered to be unserved areas for purposes of this \n                section;\n                    ``(B) criteria for determining which facilities-\n                based providers of broadband communications service, \n                and which projects, are eligible for support from the \n                account;\n                    ``(C) procedural guidelines for awarding assistance \n                from the account on a merit-based and competitive \n                basis;\n                    ``(D) guidelines for application procedures, \n                accounting and reporting requirements, and other \n                appropriate fiscal controls for assistance made \n                available from the account; and\n                    ``(E) a procedure for making funds in the account \n                available among the several States on an equitable \n                basis.\n            ``(2) Study and annual reports on unserved areas.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Within 6 months after the date \n                of enactment of the Universal Service for the 21st \n                Century Act, the Commission shall conduct a study to \n                determine which areas of the United States may be \n                considered to be `unserved areas' for purposes of this \n                section.
