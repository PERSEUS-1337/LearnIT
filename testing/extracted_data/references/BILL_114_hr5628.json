FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) wood products play a significant role in the United \n        States economy;\n            (2) the United States wood products industry employs more \n        than 548,000 individuals in manufacturing and forestry;\n            (3) private forest owners in the United States support \n        approximately 2,400,000 jobs and $87,000,000,000 in payroll;\n            (4) support for wood buildings and growing market \n        opportunities for the use of wood products, such as tall wood \n        building markets, could--\n                    (A) help ensure that forests in the United States \n                remain healthy; and\n                    (B) create income streams for private forest owners \n                that may help the owners keep their land forested \n                instead of selling the land for development;\n            (5) developing new markets for wood use in buildings may \n        drive additional investment in hazardous fuels treatments on \n        forest land;\n            (6) innovative wood product technologies and building \n        systems--\n                    (A) have enabled longer wood spans, taller walls, \n                and higher buildings; and\n                    (B) continue to expand the possibilities for wood \n                use in construction;\n            (7) wood, because it is a building material that sequesters \n        carbon, has the potential to reduce the overall carbon \n        footprint of a project that uses wood as a building material;\n            (8) research helps to modernize building codes on an \n        international basis, and that modernization is needed in the \n        United States for tall wood buildings;\n            (9) building codes specify a level of safety that each \n        building material and system shall meet and that level of \n        safety is the same regardless of the construction materials \n        used;\n            (10) in the case of wood, building codes ensure that the \n        allowable size, configuration, and required structural and fire \n        protection features of a construction project allow for the \n        safety of all occupants;\n            (11) mass timber buildings, due to the thick, solid wood \n        panels of which the buildings are composed, are slow to burn \n        and have inherent fire resistance that, under many \n        configurations, establishes a fire performance equal to or \n        better than other construction materials, allowing mass timber \n        to be used appropriately for buildings that are significantly \n        taller and larger than traditional wood buildings; and\n            (12) National Forest System lands offer a ready source of \n        wood for use in the production of mass timber and tall wood \n        buildings.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Mass timber.--The term ``mass timber'' means a type of \n        building component or system that uses large panelized wood \n        construction, including--\n                    (A) cross-laminated timber;\n                    (B) nail laminated timber;\n                    (C) glue laminated timber;\n                    (D) laminated strand lumber; and\n                    (E) laminated veneer lumber.\n            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Agriculture.\n            (3) Tall wood building.--The term ``tall wood building'' \n        means a building designed to be--\n                    (A) constructed with mass timber; and\n                    (B) more than 85 feet in height.\n\nSEC. 4.
