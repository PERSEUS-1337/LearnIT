FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in the 1990s and beyond, capital, technology, and \n        services are and will be easily transferred anywhere in the \n        world without due regard for national boundaries and \n        governmental policies, especially those pertaining to \n        fundamental labor, environmental, and agricultural standards;\n            (2) multinational corporations now play a major role in the \n        conduct of international trade and investment among all \n        nations, yet multinational corporations are not accountable in \n        important ways to any national governments or international \n        organizations and are not bound by any universal international \n        agreements or standards of conduct;\n            (3) increasingly, multinational corporations are crucial \n        agents of commerce and investment between developed and \n        developing countries, wielding great influence over whatever \n        national standards exist in respective countries pertaining to \n        socially responsible investment;\n            (4) some multinational corporations, including some based \n        in the United States, have adopted voluntary codes of conduct \n        governing all aspects of their operations with a view toward \n        promoting socially responsible investment; and\n            (5) there already exist some promising precedents of \n        corporate codes of conduct for multinational corporations \n        which, if widely adhered to and enforced, could facilitate \n        socially responsible business operations worldwide and reduce \n        pressures to enhance competitiveness by ignoring fundamental \n        labor, environmental, and agricultural standards where they \n        exist.\n\nSEC. 2.
