FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) President Obama took office amidst a weak economy and \n        high unemployment, yet he remained committed to advancing an \n        expansive ``green jobs'' agenda that received substantial \n        funding with the passage of the American Recovery and \n        Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly known as the stimulus \n        package.\n            (2) The stimulus package allocated $90 billion to various \n        green energy programs, and related appropriations provided $47 \n        billion for loan guarantees authorized under title XVII of the \n        Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16511 et seq.).\n            (3) Such title XVII authorized the Secretary of Energy to \n        issue loan guarantees for projects that avoid, reduce, or \n        sequester air pollutants or greenhouse gases and employ new or \n        significantly improved technologies compared with commercial \n        technologies in service at the time the guarantee is issued.\n            (4) Loan guarantees issued under such title XVII were \n        required to provide a reasonable prospect of repayment and were \n        expressly required to be subject to the condition that the \n        obligation is not subordinate to other financing.\n            (5) The stimulus package expanded such title XVII by adding \n        section 1705 to include projects that use commercial technology \n        for renewable energy systems, electric power transmission \n        systems, and leading-edge biofuels projects and by \n        appropriating $6,000,000,000 in funding to pay the credit \n        subsidy costs for section 1705 loan guarantees for projects \n        that commence construction no later than September 30, 2011.\n            (6) The Department of Energy, since the enactment of the \n        stimulus package, has issued loan guarantees under such title \n        XVII for 28 projects totaling $15,100,000,000 under the section \n        1705 program, and, according to the Government Accountability \n        Office, issued conditional loan guarantees for four projects \n        totaling $4,400,000,000 under the section 1705 program and four \n        projects totaling $10,600,000,000 under the section 1703 \n        program.\n            (7) Three of the first five companies that received section \n        1705 loan guarantees for their projects, Solyndra, Inc., Beacon \n        Power Corporation, and Abound Solar, Inc., have declared \n        bankruptcy.\n            (8) The bankruptcy of the first section 1705 loan guarantee \n        recipient, Solyndra, Inc., could result in a loss to taxpayers \n        of over $530,000,000.\n            (9) The investigation of the Solyndra loan guarantee by the \n        Committee on Energy and Commerce has demonstrated that the \n        review in 2009 of the Solyndra application by the Department of \n        Energy and the Office of Management and Budget was driven by \n        politics and ideology and divorced from economic reality where \n        the Department of Energy ignored concerns about the company's \n        financial condition and market for its products.\n            (10) Despite an express provision in such title XVII \n        prohibiting subordination of the United States taxpayers' \n        financial interest, the Department of Energy restructured the \n        Solyndra loan guarantee in February 2011, resulting in the \n        taxpayers losing priority to Solyndra's investors in the event \n        of a default.\n            (11) The Inspector General of the Department of the \n        Treasury concluded that it was unclear whether the Department \n        of Energy's consultation requirement with the Secretary of the \n        Treasury on the Solyndra loan guarantee was met; that the \n        consultation that did occur was rushed with the Department of \n        the Treasury expressing that ``the train really has left the \n        station on this deal''; and that no documentation was retained \n        as to how the Department of the Treasury's serious concerns \n        with the loan guarantee were addressed.\n            (12) The Government Accountability Office concluded that \n        the Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program under title \n        XVII has treated applicants inconsistently; that the Department \n        of Energy did not follow its own process for reviewing \n        applications and documenting its analysis and decisions, \n        increasing the likelihood of taxpayer exposure to financial \n        risk from a default; and that the Department of Energy's \n        absence of adequate documentation made it difficult for the \n        Department to defend its decisions on loan guarantees as sound \n        and fair.\n            (13) A memorandum prepared for the President dated October \n        25, 2010, from Carol Browner, Ron Klain, and Larry Summers, \n        principal advisors to the President, noted the risk presented \n        by loan guarantee projects because most of the projects had \n        little ``skin in the game'' from private investors.\n            (14) A January 2012 report conducted at the request of the \n        Chief of Staff to the President concluded that the portfolio of \n        projects the Department of Energy included in the loan program \n        were higher risk investments that private capital markets do \n        not generally invest in.\n            (15) The Department of Energy's section 1705 program has \n        expired but the Department of Energy has announced that it will \n        continue to consider applications for loan guarantees under the \n        section 1703 program.\n            (16) The Department of Energy has approximately \n        $34,000,000,000 in remaining lending authority to issue new \n        loan guarantees under the section 1703 program.\n\nSEC. 3.
