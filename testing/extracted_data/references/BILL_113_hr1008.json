FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Special Olympics creates the possibilities of a world \n        where everybody matters, everybody counts, and every person \n        contributes.\n            ``(2) The Government and the people of the United States \n        recognize the dignity and value the giftedness of children and \n        adults with intellectual disabilities.\n            ``(3) The Government and the people of the United States \n        recognize that children and adults with intellectual \n        disabilities experience significant health disparities, \n        including lack of access to primary care services and \n        difficulties in accessing community-based prevention and \n        treatment programs for chronic diseases.\n            ``(4) The Government and the people of the United States \n        are determined to end the isolation and stigmatization of \n        people with intellectual disabilities, and to ensure that such \n        people are assured of equal opportunities for community \n        participation, access to appropriate health care, and inclusive \n        education, and to experience life in a nondiscriminatory \n        manner.\n            ``(5) For more than 40 years, Special Olympics has \n        encouraged skill development, sharing, courage, and confidence \n        through year-round sports training and athletic competition for \n        children and adults with intellectual disabilities.\n            ``(6) Special Olympics provides year-round sports training \n        and competitive opportunities to more than 4,200,000 athletes \n        with intellectual disabilities in 30 individual and team sports \n        and plans to expand the benefits of participation through sport \n        to more than a million additional people with intellectual \n        disabilities within the United States and worldwide over the \n        next 5 years.\n            ``(7) Research shows that participation in activities \n        involving both people with intellectual disabilities and people \n        without disabilities results in more positive support for \n        inclusion in society, including in schools.\n            ``(8) Special Olympics has demonstrated its ability to \n        provide a major positive effect on the quality of life of \n        people with intellectual disabilities, improving their health \n        and physical well-being, building their confidence and self-\n        esteem, and giving them a voice to become active and productive \n        members of their communities. In the United States, for \n        example, adults with intellectual disabilities who have \n        participated in Special Olympics have a 100 percent greater \n        chance of being employed than adults with intellectual \n        disabilities who have not.\n            ``(9) In society as a whole, Special Olympics has become a \n        vehicle and platform for reducing prejudice, improving public \n        health, promoting inclusion efforts in schools and communities, \n        and encouraging society to value the contributions of all \n        members.\n            ``(10) The Government of the United States enthusiastically \n        supports the Special Olympics movement, recognizes its \n        importance in improving the lives of people with intellectual \n        disabilities and their families, and recognizes Special \n        Olympics as a valued and important component of the global \n        community.\n    ``(b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            ``(1) provide support to Special Olympics to increase \n        athlete participation in, and public awareness about, the \n        Special Olympics movement, including efforts to promote broader \n        community inclusion;\n            ``(2) dispel negative stereotypes and establish positive \n        attitudes about people with intellectual disabilities;\n            ``(3) build community engagement through sport and related \n        activities; and\n            ``(4) promote the extraordinary gifts and contributions of \n        people with intellectual disabilities.\n\n``SEC. 3.
