    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fiscal Accountability and \nTransparency in Infrastructure Spending Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given the \n        term ``Executive agency'' in section 105 of title 5, United \n        States Code.\n            (2) Alternate infrastructure type bidding.--The term \n        ``alternate infrastructure type bidding'' means a process under \n        which a Federal, State or local agency determines, from \n        engineering and economic analysis, that 2 or more initial \n        project designs utilizing different construction materials and \n        methods and their forecasted performance and life-cycle costs \n        are comparable or similar enough to warrant solicitation of \n        bids on more than 1 design for a project.\n            (3) Life-cycle cost analysis.--The term ``life-cycle cost \n        analysis'' means a process for evaluating the total economic \n        worth of an infrastructure project by analyzing initial costs \n        and discounted future costs, such as structural maintenance, \n        user costs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, restoring, and \n        resurfacing costs, over at least a 50-year period.\n            (4) Major infrastructure projects.--The term ``major \n        infrastructure projects'' means highway, transit, rail \n        (including high-speed passenger rail), airport, seaport, public \n        housing, energy, water, bridge, and military construction \n        projects, including those authorized under titles 23, 40, and \n        49, United States Code, for which the total Federal cost \n        estimated by the Federal or State government, including the \n        cost of materials, is not less than $5,000,000.\n            (5) Mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide.--The term \n        ``Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide'' means the \n        pavement design guide and software, developed under National \n        Cooperative Highway Research Program Project 1-37A, providing a \n        uniform basis for the design of flexible, rigid, and composite \n        pavements, using mechanistic-empirical approaches.\n\nSEC. 3. LIFE-CYCLE COST ANALYSIS.\n\n    (a) Requirement To Obtain Life-Cycle Cost Analysis.--Not later than \n1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, each agency shall \nobtain a life-cycle cost analysis based on the standards developed by \nthe Office of Management and Budget pursuant to subsection (c) for each \nmajor infrastructure project prior to obligating funds.\n    (b) Sources of Life-Cycle Cost Analysis.--The life-cycle cost \nanalysis required under subsection (a) may be obtained from State or \nlocal governments, or private sector entities.\n    (c) Guidance.--\n            (1) Development.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n        Management and Budget, in consultation with the American \n        Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, \n        shall issue a circular that provides guidance to agencies on \n        implementing the requirements under subsection (a).\n            (2) Requirements.--In developing the circular required \n        under paragraph (1), the Director shall--\n                    (A) provide the public with notice and opportunity \n                to comment before issuing the circular;\n                    (B) consider the principles contained in section 2 \n                of Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal \n                Infrastructure Investments'' (January 31, 1994; 59 Fed. \n                Reg. 4233); and\n                    (C) require that any analysis obtained pursuant to \n                subsection (a)--\n                            (i) be conducted over at least a 50-year \n                        valuation period; and\n                            (ii) use actual material life and \n                        maintenance cost data.\n    (d) Transparency.--Any life-cycle analysis obtained by an agency \npursuant to subsection (a) shall be posted on the agency's Web site not \nlater than 72 hours after it is received.\n\nSEC. 4. FLEXIBILITY TO USE ALTERNATE INFRASTRUCTURE TYPE BIDDING \n              PROCEDURES.\n\n    (a) Application to National Highway System.--A State transportation \ndepartment or local transportation agency may, in its sole discretion, \naward contracts for projects on the National Highway System pursuant to \nalternate infrastructure type bidding procedures.\n    (b) Application to Other Major Infrastructure Programs.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, Federal, State and local \ngovernments may award contracts for major infrastructure projects \npursuant to alternate infrastructure type bidding procedures.\n\nSEC. 5. MECHANISTIC-EMPIRICAL PAVEMENT DESIGN GUIDE.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nSecretary of Transportation shall require States to utilize the \nMechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide for the initial design \nphase of all projects authorized under title 23, United States Code."
