FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Congress has responsibility under the Constitution for \n        international commerce.\n            (2) Congressional oversight of trade policy has often been \n        hampered by a lack of resources.\n            (3) The United States has entered into numerous trade \n        agreements with foreign trading partners, including bilateral, \n        regional, and multilateral agreements.\n            (4) Foreign country performance under certain agreements \n        has been less than contemplated, and in some cases rises to the \n        level of noncompliance.\n            (5) The credibility of, and support for, the United States \n        Government's trade policy is, to a significant extent, a \n        function of the belief that trade agreements made are trade \n        agreements enforced.\n            (6) The accession of the People's Republic of China to the \n        World Trade Organization will create unprecedented challenges \n        and it is important to the world trading system that China \n        comply with the numerous and significant commitments China \n        makes as part of the accession process. Congress must play a \n        key role in ensuring full and continuous monitoring of the \n        People's Republic of China's compliance with its commitments.\n\nSEC. 2.
