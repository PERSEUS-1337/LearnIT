MEDICARE PRIMARY CARE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PILOT PROJECT.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in \nthis section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall conduct a pilot \nproject under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \nSecurity Act, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to \ntest models for providing payment under such title for direct graduate \nmedical education and indirect medical education to medical education \nentities, which entities are not otherwise eligible to receive such \npayments under the Medicare program, for the costs of training primary \ncare residents.\n    (b) Duration.--The Secretary shall conduct the pilot project under \nthis section over a 5-year period, which shall begin not later than 180 \ndays after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Models.--\n            (1) Required models.--Under the pilot project, the \n        Secretary shall test two of each of the following models:\n                    (A) A model in which the medical education entity \n                receiving funds under the pilot project is a community-\n                based independent corporate entity collaborating with \n                two or more hospitals to operate one or more primary \n                care graduate medical residency training programs.\n                    (B) A model in which--\n                            (i) the medical education entity receiving \n                        funds under the pilot project is established by \n                        two or more hospitals to operate one or more \n                        primary care graduate medical residency \n                        training programs; and\n                            (ii) such hospitals may be the sole \n                        corporate members of the entity but the \n                        governing board of the entity shall include at \n                        least one community representative.\n                    (C) A model in which the medical education entity \n                receiving funds under the pilot project is a hospital \n                subsidiary or independent corporation that operates one \n                or more primary care graduate medical residency \n                training programs for a hospital with community \n                participation in the governance of the subsidiary or \n                corporation.\n                    (D) A model in which--\n                            (i) the medical education entity receiving \n                        funds under the pilot project is independent of \n                        any hospital but collaborates with a hospital \n                        in operating one or more primary care graduate \n                        medical residency training programs; and\n                            (ii) the medical education entity may \n                        include a university or school of medicine.\n            (2) Additional models.--Under the pilot project, the \n        Secretary may test models of medical education entities in \n        addition to those described in paragraph (1).\n    (d) Prioritization.--Under the pilot project, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services may give priority to testing models that \ndemonstrate the capability of improving the quality, quantity, and \ndistribution of primary care physicians, including the ability to \nenhance primary care delivery in rural and underserved areas.\n    (e) Payments.--\n            (1) Payments to medical education entities.--Under the \n        pilot project, the Secretary shall establish a process under \n        which payments are made to each medical education entity \n        participating under such project for direct graduate medical \n        education and indirect medical education costs with respect to \n        primary care residents enrolled under a primary care graduate \n        medical residency training program operated pursuant to a model \n        of such entity under subsection (c) instead of any payment or \n        adjustment that would otherwise be made to a participant \n        hospital (as defined in subsection (m)) of such entity for \n        indirect and direct graduate medical education costs under \n        subsections (d)(5)(B) and (h) of section 1886 of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) during the period of \n        participation of such entity in such project.\n            (2) Calculation of payments.--Payments to a medical \n        education entity under the pilot project, with respect to a \n        primary care graduate medical education residency program, for \n        a cost reporting period during which the entity is \n        participating in such pilot shall be, based on the most \n        recently available data with respect to a previous cost \n        reporting period, equal to the sum of the following:\n                    (A) Direct gme.--The amount that, out of all of the \n                payment amounts (determined on a per resident basis) \n                received by hospitals under section 1886(h) of the \n                Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)) for such \n                previous cost reporting period, is equal to the 95th \n                percentile of such payment amounts.\n                    (B) Indirect gme.--The amount that, out of all of \n                the additional payment amounts (determined on a per \n                resident basis) received by hospitals under section \n                1886(d)(5)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n                1395ww(d)(5)(B)) for such previous cost reporting \n                period, is equal to the 95th percentile of such payment \n                amounts.\n            (3) Additional payments for programs serving underserved \n        areas.--Payments in addition to the payments described in \n        paragraph (2) may be made under the pilot project for primary \n        care graduate medical residency training programs that--\n                    (A) operate in sites and areas that are underserved \n                by primary care physicians;
