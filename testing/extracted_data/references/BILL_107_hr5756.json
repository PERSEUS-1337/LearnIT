The application \nshall indicate--\n            ``(A) the type of renewable energy resource used to produce \n        the electricity,\n            ``(B) the location where the electric energy was produced, \n        and\n            ``(C) any other information the Secretary determines \n        appropriate.\n    ``(3)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (B), (C), and (D), the \nSecretary shall issue to an entity one renewable energy credit for each \nkilowatt-hour of electric energy the entity generates from the date of \nenactment of this section and in each subsequent calendar year through \nthe use of a renewable energy resource at an eligible facility.\n    ``(B) For incremental hydropower the credits shall be calculated \nbased on the expected increase in average annual generation resulting \nfrom the efficiency improvements or capacity additions. The number of \ncredits shall be calculated using the same water flow information used \nto determine a historic average annual generation baseline for the \nhydroelectric facility and certified by the Secretary or the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission. The calculation of the credits for \nincremental hydropower shall not be based on any operational changes at \nthe hydroelectric facility not directly associated with the efficiency \nimprovements or capacity additions.\n    ``(C) The Secretary shall issue two renewable energy credits for \neach kilowatt-hour of electric energy generated and supplied to the \ngrid in that calendar year through the use of a renewable energy \nresource at an eligible facility located on Indian land.

If both a \nrenewable energy resource and a nonrenewable energy resource are used \nto generate the electric energy, the Secretary shall issue credits \nbased on the proportion of the renewable energy resource used. The \nSecretary shall identify renewable energy credits by type and date of \ngeneration.\n    ``(4) When a generator sells electric energy generated through the \nuse of a renewable energy resource to a retail electric supplier under \na contract subject to section 210 of this Act, the retail electric \nsupplier is treated as the generator of the electric energy for the \npurposes of this section for the duration of the contract.\n    ``(5) The Secretary may issue credits for existing facility offsets \nto be applied against a retail electric supplier's own required annual \npercentage. The credits are not tradeable and may only be used in the \ncalendar year generation actually occurs.\n    ``(e) Credit Trading.--A renewable energy credit may be sold or \nexchanged by the entity to whom issued or by any other entity who \nacquires the credit. A renewable energy credit for any year that is not \nused to satisfy the minimum renewable generation requirement of \nsubsection (a) for that year may be carried forward for use within the \nnext 4 years.\n    ``(f) Credit Borrowing.--At any time before the end of calendar \nyear 2005, a retail electric supplier that has reason to believe it \nwill not have sufficient renewable energy credits to comply with \nsubsection (a) may--\n            ``(1) submit a plan to the Secretary demonstrating that the \n        retail electric supplier will earn sufficient credits within \n        the next 3 calendar years which, when taken into account, will \n        enable the retail electric suppliers to meet the requirements \n        of subsection (a) for calendar year 2005 and the subsequent \n        calendar years involved; and\n            ``(2) upon the approval of the plan by the Secretary, apply \n        credits that the plan demonstrates will be earned within the \n        next 3 calendar years to meet the requirements of subsection \n        (a) for each calendar year involved.\n    ``(g) Credit Cost Cap.--The Secretary shall offer renewable energy \ncredits for sale at the lesser of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour or 200 \npercent of the average market value of credits for the applicable \ncompliance period. On January 1 of each year following calendar year \n2005, the Secretary shall adjust for inflation the price charged per \ncredit for such calendar year, based on the Gross Domestic Product \nImplicit Price Deflator.\n    ``(h) Enforcement.--The Secretary may bring an action in the \nappropriate United States district court to impose a civil penalty on a \nretail electric supplier that does not comply with subsection (a), \nunless the retail electric supplier was unable to comply with \nsubsection (a) for reasons outside of the supplier's reasonable control \n(including weather-related damage, mechanical failure, lack of \ntransmission capacity or availability, strikes, lockouts, actions of a \ngovernmental authority). A retail electric supplier who does not submit \nthe required number of renewable energy credits under subsection (a) \nshall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than the greater of 3 \ncents or 200 percent of the average market value of credits for the \ncompliance period for each renewable energy credit not submitted.\n    ``(i) Information Collection.--The Secretary may collect the \ninformation necessary to verify and audit--\n            ``(1) the annual electric energy generation and renewable \n        energy generation of any entity applying for renewable energy \n        credits under this section,\n            ``(2) the validity of renewable energy credits submitted by \n        a retail electric supplier to the Secretary, and\n            ``(3) the quantity of
