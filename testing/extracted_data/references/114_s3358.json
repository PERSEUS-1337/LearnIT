    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Flood Emergency Tax Relief Act of \n2016 (FLETRA)''.\n\nSEC. 2. SPECIAL RULES FOR USE OF RETIREMENT FUNDS WITH RESPECT TO \n              MISSISSIPPI DELTA AREAS DAMAGED BY 2016 FLOODING.\n\n    (a) Tax-Favored Withdrawals From Retirement Plans.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code \n        of 1986 shall not apply to any qualified Mississippi River \n        Delta flooding distribution.\n            (2) Aggregate dollar limitation.--\n                    (A) In general.--For purposes of this subsection, \n                the aggregate amount of distributions received by an \n                individual which may be treated as qualified \n                Mississippi River Delta flooding distributions for any \n                taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of--\n                            (i) $100,000, over\n                            (ii) the aggregate amounts treated as \n                        qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding \n                        distributions received by such individual for \n                        all prior taxable years.\n                    (B) Treatment of plan distributions.--If a \n                distribution to an individual would (without regard to \n                subparagraph (A)) be a qualified Mississippi River \n                Delta flooding distribution, a plan shall not be \n                treated as violating any requirement of this title \n                merely because the plan treats such distribution as a \n                qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding \n                distribution, unless the aggregate amount of such \n                distributions from all plans maintained by the employer \n                (and any member of any controlled group which includes \n                the employer) to such individual exceeds $100,000.\n                    (C) Controlled group.--For purposes of subparagraph \n                (B), the term ``controlled group'' means any group \n                treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), \n                (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code \n                of 1986.\n            (3) Amount distributed may be repaid.--\n                    (A) In general.--Any individual who receives a \n                qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding distribution \n                may, at any time during the 3-year period beginning on \n                the day after the date on which such distribution was \n                received, make one or more contributions in an \n                aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of such \n                distribution to an eligible retirement plan of which \n                such individual is a beneficiary and to which a \n                rollover contribution of such distribution could be \n                made under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), \n                408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16) of the Internal Revenue Code \n                of 1986, as the case may be.\n                    (B) Treatment of repayments of distributions from \n                eligible retirement plans other than iras.--For \n                purposes of this title, if a contribution is made \n                pursuant to subparagraph (A) with respect to a \n                qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding distribution \n                from an eligible retirement plan other than an \n                individual retirement plan, then the taxpayer shall, to \n                the extent of the amount of the contribution, be \n                treated as having received the qualified Mississippi \n                River Delta flooding distribution in an eligible \n                rollover distribution (as defined in section 402(c)(4) \n                of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) and as having \n                transferred the amount to the eligible retirement plan \n                in a direct trustee to trustee transfer within 60 days \n                of the distribution.\n                    (C) Treatment of repayments for distributions from \n                iras.--For purposes of this title, if a contribution is \n                made pursuant to subparagraph (A) with respect to a \n                qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding distribution \n                from an individual retirement plan (as defined by \n                section 7701(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n                1986), then, to the extent of the amount of the \n                contribution, the qualified Mississippi River Delta \n                flooding distribution shall be treated as a \n                distribution described in section 408(d)(3) of such \n                Code and as having been transferred to the eligible \n                retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer \n                within 60 days of the distribution.\n            (4) Definitions.--For purposes of this

             (B) Eligible retirement plan.--The term ``eligible \n                retirement plan'' shall have the meaning given such \n                term by section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal
