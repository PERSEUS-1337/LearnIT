FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Electronic commerce has been widely embraced by \n        industry, both in the United States and abroad. The volume of \n        commerce conducted over the Internet, though almost nonexistent \n        just a few years ago, is expected to top $1 trillion by 2003, \n        according to market research reports. Continued growth of this \n        market is vital to the economy of the United States as well as \n        the global economy.\n            (2) United States industries are at the forefront of this \n        global revolution, continually evolving and innovating to \n        respond to rapidly changing market needs and conditions. \n        Agility and flexibility are essential elements in their \n        abilities to compete and adapt. These are also the elements \n        required for the electronic commerce market to sustain its \n        current phenomenal growth rate.\n            (3) The Federal Government should facilitate the growth of \n        electronic commerce by allowing the private sector to continue \n        to take the lead in developing this dynamic global market, and \n        refraining from undue regulatory measures whenever possible. \n        The Government should unambiguously support the development of \n        electronic commerce as a market-driven phenomenon, yet also \n        signal its strong desire to promote and facilitate the growth \n        of the electronic commerce market.\n            (4) An important enabler for global electronic commerce is \n        the ability of different systems to communicate and exchange \n        data, referred to as system interoperability. The continued \n        growth of electronic commerce depends on a fundamental set of \n        technical standards that enable essential technologies to \n        interoperate, and on a policy and legal framework that supports \n        the development that the market demands in a timely manner.\n            (5) Prompt adoption and deployment of relevant electronic \n        commerce technologies and systems by Federal agencies allow the \n        Government to share in the benefits of the electronic commerce \n        revolution, which can result in reduced cost and increased \n        efficiency, as well as improved quality.\n            (6) Usage of the technologies will enable the Government to \n        participate more directly and effectively as an active \n        contributor in the collaborative efforts spearheaded by the \n        private sector to develop the frameworks and standards \n        necessary for systems and components to interoperate. This has \n        the added benefit of allowing the Government to intercede as \n        necessary in a timely manner, either in failure conditions or \n        to remove barriers erected by foreign governments.\n            (7) In actively deploying such technologies, the United \n        States leadership in electronic commerce is strengthened and, \n        at the same time, establishes a model for other governments and \n        enables the growth of the global electronic commerce market.\n            (8) Traditionally, small- and medium-sized enterprises play \n        a critical role in enhancing the gross domestic product \n        associated with a growing economic sector. Electronic commerce \n        technologies have the potential to enable these businesses to \n        enter the market with lower entry costs and compete more \n        effectively. The United States Government has an inherent \n        interest in ensuring that electronic commerce technologies are \n        deployed widely by these small- and medium-sized businesses so \n        that they can remain competitive in the global economy.\n\nSEC. 3.
