FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Social workers help people overcome some of life's most \n        difficult challenges: poverty, discrimination, abuse, \n        addiction, physical illness, divorce, loss, unemployment, \n        educational problems, disability, and mental illness. They help \n        prevent crises and counsel individuals, families, and \n        communities to cope more effectively with the stresses of \n        everyday life. Professional social workers are found in every \n        facet of community life--in schools, hospitals, mental health \n        clinics, senior centers, elected office, private practices, \n        prisons, the military, corporations, and in numerous public and \n        private agencies that serve individuals and families in need.\n            (2) Social workers focus on the improvement of individual \n        and family functioning and the creation of effective health and \n        mental health prevention and treatment interventions in order \n        for individuals to become more productive members of society.\n            (3) Social workers provide front line prevention and \n        treatment services in the areas of school violence, aging, teen \n        pregnancy, child abuse, domestic violence, juvenile crime, and \n        substance abuse, particularly in rural and underserved \n        communities.\n            (4) Social workers are in a unique position to provide \n        valuable research information on these complex social concerns, \n        taking into account a wide range of social, medical, economic, \n        and community influences from an interdisciplinary, family-\n        centered and community-based approach.\n            (5) Social work research as it relates to the health of \n        individuals sheds light on the behavioral and social \n        determinants of wellness and disease and helps to develop \n        effective interventions for improving health outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3.
