FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States faces real threats of man-made and \n        natural disasters which could result in catastrophic \n        consequences to the Nation, its resources, and its people. \n        Because of the scale of the potential consequences of these \n        threats, they may constitute threats to national security and \n        will require the full range of Federal resources to save lives, \n        minimize human suffering, protect property, and mitigate \n        damage.\n            (2) Because of its manpower, communications, logistics, and \n        other capabilities, the Department of Defense is uniquely \n        suited to provide critical support to other departments and \n        agencies of the Federal Government, State and local \n        governments, and governments of the Commonwealths and \n        possessions of the United States in response to a catastrophic \n        incident in the United States.\n            (3) Planning and preparation for and execution of civil \n        support operations in responding to catastrophic incidents in \n        support of the Department of Homeland Security and State and \n        local governments is a national security issue.\n            (4) A successful response to catastrophic incidents in the \n        United States requires coordinated strategic plans and detailed \n        operational plans with specific tasking and sourcing. The \n        Department of Defense must develop such plans and should \n        maintain the required units and assets at the appropriate level \n        of readiness in order to deliver the capabilities which will be \n        required in a response led by the Department of Homeland \n        Security.\n            (5) The National Guard and Reserves are forward-deployed in \n        communities throughout the United States, are integrated with \n        State and local governments, and have considerable homeland-\n        related capabilities. The Department of Defense and the United \n        States Northern Command must therefore consider the plans and \n        capabilities of the National Guard and Reserves, and State and \n        local governments, in plans for civil support operations.\n\nSEC. 3.
