FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n        activity of brain cells actually changes the physical structure \n        of the brain, and that without a stimulating environment, a \n        baby's brain suffers.\n            (2) 12,000,000 children under age 6, and 17,000,000 school-\n        aged children of working parents, need child care. Demand for \n        child care is growing as more mothers enter the workforce.\n            (3) Good quality child care, in a safe environment, with \n        trained, caring providers who offer stimulating activities \n        appropriate to the child's age, help children grow and thrive. \n        Recent research shows that most child care needs significant \n        improvement.\n            (4) Good quality child care depends largely on the \n        provider. Yet providers of child care earn on average only \n        $6.70 per hour or $11,725 per year. Such earnings cause high \n        turnover, which affects the overall quality of a child care \n        program and causes anxiety for children.\n            (5) Children attending lower-quality child care facilities \n        and child care facilities with high staff turnover are less \n        competent in language and social development.\n            (6) Low-income and high-income children are more likely \n        than middle-income children to attend child care facilities \n        providing high quality child care.\n            (7) The quality of child care is primarily related to high \n        staff-to-child ratios, staff education, and administrators' \n        prior experience. In addition, certain characteristics \n        distinguish poor, mediocre, and good-quality child care \n        facilities, the most important of which are teacher wages, \n        education, and specialized training.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to bring more highly trained individuals into the early \n        child care profession; and\n            (2) to keep more highly trained child care providers in the \n        early child care field for longer periods of time.\n\nSEC. 4. LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS.\n\n    Part B of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.) \nis amended by inserting after section 428J of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1078-\n10) the following:\n\n``SEC. 428I.
