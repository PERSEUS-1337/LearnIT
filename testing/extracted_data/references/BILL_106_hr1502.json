FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Electronic data exchanges are used extensively to \n        transfer information between computer systems. Federal agencies \n        now depend on electronic data exchanges to execute programs and \n        facilitate commerce. Consequently, as computer systems are \n        converted to process Year 2000 dates, the associated data \n        exchanges must also be made Year 2000 compliant.\n            (2) The testing and implementation of new data exchanges \n        must be closely coordinated with exchange partners to be \n        completed effectively. If Year 2000 data exchanges do not \n        function properly, data will not be exchanged between systems, \n        or invalid data could cause receiving computer systems to \n        malfunction or produce inaccurate computations.\n            (3) The United States 381,000 small manufacturers \n        contribute more than half of the country's total value in \n        manufacturing. However, as of 1998, 75 percent of all companies \n        with fewer than 2,000 employees had not yet started Year 2000 \n        remediation projects.\n            (4) As small manufacturers are an integral part of the \n        business supply chain, it is imperative that their computer \n        systems are Year 2000 compliant to prevent disruption to the \n        country's manufacturing base.\n            (5) The economic well being of the United States is \n        interdependent with the economic well being of other nations of \n        the world. There is very little information on the level of \n        Year 2000 preparedness by other countries and the potential \n        impact on the United States economy. Therefore, to prevent \n        economic disruption in the United States, the Year 2000 \n        computer problem must be addressed on a global scale.\n            (6) Currently, there is little information to guide \n        consumers in the purchase of Year 2000 compliant consumer goods \n        or to ensure that their existing goods are Year 2000 complaint.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``data exchange testing'' means testing data \n        exchange software with respect to--\n                    (A) the initiation of the exchange by sending \n                computers;\n                    (B) transmission through intermediate \n                communications software and hardware; and\n                    (C) receipt and acceptance by receiving computers;\n            (2) the term ``small and medium-sized businesses'' means \n        businesses with less than 500 employees;\n            (3) the term ``Year 2000 compliant'' means, with respect to \n        information technology, that the information technology \n        accurately processes (including calculating, comparing, and \n        sequencing) date and time data from, into, and between the 20th \n        and 21st centuries and the years 1999 and 2000, and leap year \n        calculations, to the extent that other information technology \n        properly exchanges date and time data with it; and\n            (4) the term ``Year 2000 computer problem'' means the \n        potential problems that might be encountered in any level of \n        computer hardware and software from microcode to application \n        programs, files, and databases that need to correctly interpret \n        year date data represented in 2-digit-year format.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIONS.\n\n    To ensure that all computer operations and processing can be \nprovided without interruption by Federal agencies after December 31, \n1999, the head of each Federal agency shall--\n            (1) take actions necessary to ensure that all systems and \n        hardware administered by the agency are Year 2000 compliant, to \n        the extent necessary to ensure that no significant disruption \n        of the operations of the agency or of the agency's data \n        exchange partners occurs, including--\n                    (A) establishing, before June 1, 1999, schedules \n                for testing and implementing new data exchange formats \n                for completing all data exchange corrections, which may \n                include national test days for data exchange testing of \n                critical processes and associated data exchanges \n                affecting Federal, State, and local governments;\n                    (B) notifying data exchange partners of the \n                implications to the agency and the exchange partners if \n                they do not make appropriate date conversion \n                corrections in time to meet the Federal schedule for \n                implementing and testing Year 2000 compliant data \n                exchange processes;\n                    (C) giving priority to installing filters necessary \n                to prevent the corruption of mission-critical systems \n                from data exchanges with noncompliant systems; and\n                    (D) developing and implementing, as part of the \n                agency's continuity and contingency planning efforts, \n                specific provisions for data exchanges that may fail, \n                including strategies to mitigate operational \n                disruptions if data exchange partners do not make \n                timely date conversion corrections;\n            (2) beginning not later than 30 days after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, convene meetings at least quarterly with \n        representatives of the agency's data exchange partners to \n        assess implementation progress; and\n            (3) after each meeting convened pursuant to paragraph (2), \n        transmit to the Congress a report summarizing--\n                    (A) the results of that meeting; and\n                    (B) the status of the agency's completion of key \n                data exchange corrections, including the extent of data \n                exchange inventoried, an assessment of data exchange \n                formats agreed to with data exchange partners, testing \n                and implementation schedules, and testing and \n                implementation completed.\n\nSEC. 5.
