FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Chronic Wasting Disease, the fatal neurological disease \n        found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and \n        vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased \n        occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse \n        locations in recent years necessitates an escalation in \n        research, surveillance, monitoring, and public education \n        efforts to contain and manage this lethal disease.\n            (2) The heads of relevant Federal agencies should provide \n        consistent, coherent, and integrated support structures and \n        programs for the benefit of State wildlife and agricultural \n        administrators, as Chronic Wasting Disease can move freely \n        between wild cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, \n        tribal, and local land management jurisdictions.\n            (3) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n        Agriculture, and the heads of other affected Federal agencies \n        need to better coordinate the activities of their agencies \n        related to control of Chronic Wasting Disease in wild cervid \n        populations.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are the following:\n            (1) To establish a National Chronic Wasting Disease Task \n        Force to coordinate Federal, State, and tribal activities to \n        address the environmental and economic impacts caused by \n        Chronic Wasting Disease on captive and wild populations of deer \n        and elk.\n            (2) To implement the plan published jointly by the \n        Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture \n        entitled ``Plan for Assisting States, Federal Agencies, and \n        Tribes in Managing Chronic Wasting Disease in Wild and Captive \n        Cervids'', dated June 26, 2002.\n            (3) To enhance Federal, State, and tribal research \n        concerning Chronic Wasting Disease, and to promote the \n        development of new diagnostic, surveillance, monitoring, and \n        screening methods and technologies.\n            (4) To increase public awareness concerning Chronic Wasting \n        Disease among the sport hunting community and the public at \n        large through the implementation of a national communications \n        strategy.\n    (c) Establishment of Task Force.--The Fish and Wildlife \nCoordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.) is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n\n``SEC. 10.
