    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Hire, Train, Retain Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As of June 2011 9.2 percent of all Americans eligible \n        to work were unemployed, or 14.1 million people.\n            (2) There are millions of workers who were displaced during \n        the recent ``Great Recession'' who need to be re-trained so \n        that they can re-integrate into the workforce. According to the \n        bi-annual Displaced Workers Survey, the unemployment rate was \n        4.5 percent in 2007 before spiking to nearly 10 percent in \n        2010.\n            (3) Often overlooked are the 982,000 discouraged workers, \n        people who are not looking for work because they do not believe \n        that they are qualified for any available jobs.\n            (4) Paradoxically, there are enough jobs available to \n        employ just over 20 percent of these persons--there were 3.0 \n        million job openings on the last business day of May 2011 \n        according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n            (5) The disconnect is that many people searching for work \n        lack the job-specific skills that they need to be competitive \n        for many of these vacancies. Specifically, technology is \n        outpacing the country's current approach to job-related \n        education and training. The difference between white collar and \n        blue collar jobs is fading because traditionally ``blue collar \n        jobs'' are more specialized than ever before.\n\nSEC. 3. PAYROLL TAX FORGIVENESS FOR HIRING AND TRAINING WORKERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nis amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(e) Special Exemption for Certain Individuals Hired in Between \n2011 and 2015.--\n            ``(1) In general.--During the period beginning on the day \n        after the date of the enactment of this subsection and ending \n        on December 31, 2015, subsection (a) shall not apply to wages \n        paid by a qualified employer with respect to employment of any \n        qualified individual for services performed--\n                    ``(A) in a trade or business of such qualified \n                employer, or\n                    ``(B) in the case of a qualified employer exempt \n                from tax under section 501(a), in furtherance of the \n                activities related to the purpose or function \n                constituting the basis of the employer's exemption \n                under section 501.\n            ``(2) Qualified employer.--For purposes of this \n        subsection--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified employer' \n                means any employer other than the United States, any \n                State, or any political subdivision thereof, or any \n                instrumentality of the foregoing that provides a \n                qualified job training program for or on behalf its \n                employees.\n                    ``(B) Treatment of employees of post-secondary \n                educational institutions.--Notwithstanding subparagraph \n                (A), the term `qualified employer' includes any \n                employer which is a public institution of higher \n                education (as defined in section 101(b) of the Higher \n                Education Act of 1965).\n            ``(3) Qualified individual.--For purposes of this \n        subsection, the term `qualified individual' means any \n        individual who--\n                    ``(A) begins employment with a qualified employer \n                after the date of the enactment of this subsection and \n                before January 1, 2016,\n                    ``(B) certifies by signed affidavit, under \n                penalties of perjury, that such individual has not been \n                employed for more than 40 hours during the 60-day \n                period ending on the date such individual begins such \n                employment,\n                    ``(C) certifies by signed affidavit, under \n                penalties of perjury, that such individual has \n                satisfactorily completed a qualified job training \n                program,\n                    ``(D) is not employed by the qualified employer to \n                replace another employee of such employer unless such \n                other employee separated from employment voluntarily or \n                for cause, and\n                    ``(E) is not an individual described in section \n                51(i)(1) (applied by substituting `qualified employer' \n                for `taxpayer' each place it appears).\n            ``(4) Qualified job training program.--For purposes of this \n        subsection, the term `qualified job training program' means--\n                    ``(A) a program provided by a qualified employer \n                that is in-house and is specific training for available \n                jobs at such employer, or\n                    ``(B) a program under which a qualified employer \n                partners with a public institution of higher education \n                (as defined in section 101(b) of the Higher Education \n                Act of 1965) to provide specific training for available \n                jobs at such employer.\n            ``(5) Election.--A qualified employer may elect to have \n        this subsection not apply.
