Amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.--The \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, is amended by \nredesignating section 8(a)(3) (43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)) as section \n8(a)(3)(A) and by adding at the end thereof the following:\n            ``(B) The Secretary may, in order to promote development \n        and new production on a producing or non-producing lease, \n        through primary, secondary, or tertiary recovery means, or to \n        encourage production of marginal or uneconomic resources on a \n        producing or non-producing lease, reduce or suspend any royalty \n        or net profit share set forth in the lease.\n            ``(C)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act other \n        than this subparagraph, no royalty payment shall be due on new \n        production, as defined in -c-l-a-u-s-e -(-i-i-) clause (iii) of \n        this subparagraph, from any lease located in water depths of \n        200 meters or greater in the Western and Central Planning Areas \n        of the Gulf of Mexico, and the Eastern Planning Area of the \n        Gulf of Mexico west of the lateral seaward boundary between the \n        States of Florida and Alabama, or for any lease in the frontier \n        areas of Alaska, which shall, at a minimum, include those areas \n        with seasonal sea ice, long distances to existing pipelines and \n        ports, or a lack of production infrastructure, until the \n        capital costs directly related to such new production have been \n        recovered by the lessee out of the proceeds from such new \n        production.\n            ``(ii) With respect to any lease in existence on the date \n        of enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty \n        Relief Act meeting the requirements of this subparagraph, upon \n        application by the lessee, the Secretary shall determine within \n        ninety days of such application whether new production from \n        such lease would be economic in the absence of the relief from \n        the requirement to pay royalties provided for by clause (i) of \n        this subparagraph. In making such determination, the Secretary \n        shall consider all costs associated with obtaining, exploring, \n        developing, and producing from the lease. The lessee shall be \n        afforded an opportunity to provide information to the Secretary \n        prior to such determination. Such application may be made on \n        the basis of an individual lease or unit (as defined under the \n        provisions of 30 CFR part 250). If the Secretary determines \n        that such new production would be economic in the absence of \n        the relief from the requirement to pay royalties provided for \n        by clause (i) of this subparagraph, the provisions of clause \n        (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply to such production. \n        Redetermination of the applicability of clause (i) shall be \n        undertaken by the Secretary when requested by the lessee upon \n        significant change in the factors upon which the original \n        determination was made. The Secretary shall make such \n        redetermination within sixty days of such application. The \n        Secretary may extend the time period for making any \n        determination under this clause for thirty days if \n        circumstances so warrant. The lessee shall be notified in \n        writing of any determination or redetermination and the reasons \n        for and assumptions used for such determination. In the event \n        that the Secretary fails to make the determination or \n        redetermination upon application by the lessee within the time \n        period, together with any such extension thereof provided for \n        by this clause, the relief from the requirement to pay \n        royalties provided for by clause (i) shall apply to such \n        production.\n            ``-(-i-i-) (iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the \n        term--\n                    ``(aa) `capital costs' shall be defined by the \n                Secretary and shall include exploration costs incurred \n                after the acquisition of the lease and development \n                costs directly related to new production. The terms \n                `exploration' and `development' shall have the same \n                meaning contained in subsections (k) and (l) of section \n                2 of this Act except the term `development' shall also \n                include any similar additional development activities \n                which take place after production has been initiated \n                from such lease. Such capital costs shall not include \n                any amounts paid as bonus bids but shall be adjusted to \n                reflect changes in the consumer price index, as defined \n                in section (1)(f)(4) of title 26 of the United States \n                Code; and\n                    ``(bb) `new production' is--\n                            ``(I) any production from a lease from \n                        which no royalties are due on production, other \n                        than test production, prior to the date of \n                        enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep \n                        Water Royalty Relief Act; or\n                            ``(II) any production resulting from lease \n                        development activities pursuant to a \n                        Development Operations Coordination Document \n                        approved by the Secretary after the date of \n                        enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep \n                        Water Royalty Relief Act; and\n            ``-(-i-i-i-) (iv) In any month during which the arithmetic \n        average of the closing prices for the earliest delivery month \n        on the New York Mercantile Exchange for Light Sweet crude oil \n        exceeds $28.00 per barrel, any production of oil subject to \n        relief from the requirement to pay royalties under clause (i) \n        of this subparagraph shall be subject to royalties at the lease \n        stipulated rate, and the lessee's gross proceeds from such oil \n        production, less Federal royalties, during such month shall be \n        counted toward the recovery of capital costs under clause (i) \n        of this subparagraph.\n            ``-(-i-v-) (v) In any month during which the arithmetic \n        average of the closing prices for the earliest delivery month \n        on the New York Mercantile Exchange for natural gas exceeds \n        $3.50 per million British thermal units, any production of \n        natural gas subject to relief from the requirement to pay \n        royalties under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be \n        subject to royalties at the lease stipulated rate, and the \n        lessee's gross proceeds from such natural gas production, less \n        Federal royalties, during such month shall be counted toward \n        the recovery of capital costs under clause (i) of this \n        subparagraph.\n            ``-(-v-) (vi) The prices referred to in -c-l-a-u-s-e-s \n        -(-i-i-i-) -a-n-d -(-i-v-) clauses (iv) and (v) of this \n        subparagraph shall be changed during any calendar year after \n        -1-9-9-3 1994 by the percentage if any by which the consumer \n        price index changed during the preceding calendar year, as \n        defined in section (1)(f)(4) of title 26 of the United States \n        Code.''.\n    Sec. 3. Regulations.--The Secretary shall promulgate such rules and \nregulations as are necessary to implement the provisions of this Act \nwithin one hundred and eighty days after the date of enactment of this \nAct.\n    Sec. 4. Area-Wide Leasing.--The Secretary shall not implement the \nsystem of tract nomination for oil and gas leasing in the Central and \nWestern Planning Areas of the Gulf of Mexico under the Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands Act, and shall use the existing area-wide \nsystem of leasing in such areas.\n    Sec. 5. Report to Congress.--(a) The Secretary shall review Federal \nregulations and policies within the Secretary's jurisdiction which \ncreate barriers and disincentives that unnecessarily preclude new \nproduction, or result in premature abandonment or suspension of \nexisting production of oil and gas on Federal lands, including the \nOuter Continental Shelf. Such review, conducted with the participation \nof all interested parties, shall assess how Federal policies could be \nmodified to reduce compliance costs and improve the cash flow of oil \nand gas operations on Federal lands. The review shall include \nadministrative compliance, royalty collection, timing of operational \nand production management requirements, such as permanent plugging and \nabandonment of wells, and any other requirements which unduly burden \nnatural gas and oil exploration, production and transportation on \nFederal lands.\n    (b) The Secretary shall evaluate the impact, if any, of current \nroyalty rates for oil and gas on Federal lands, both onshore and \noffshore, on the viability of undeveloped fields by general category, \nsuch as production volume, crude quality, water depth, and distance \nfrom existing infrastructure. The review shall be based on current \nindustry technology and cost information, and shall assess how a \nreduction in Federal oil and natural gas royalties would encourage \ndevelopment.\n    (c) The Secretary shall report to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources of the United States Senate and to the United States \nHouse of Representatives on the review required by this section and \nactions taken as recommended pursuant to such review, or the reason \nsuch actions have not been taken, within ninety days of the date of \nenactment of this Act."
