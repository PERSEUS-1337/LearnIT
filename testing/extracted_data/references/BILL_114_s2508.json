FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Scientific advancements and a greater understanding of \n        the issues that affect the health and safety of young athletes \n        are key to reducing sports related concussions in youth.\n            (2) The National Academies issued a report in 2013 finding \n        limited evidence that current helmet designs reduce the risk of \n        sports-related concussions and no evidence that mouthguards or \n        facial protection reduce concussion risk, and recommending that \n        the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense \n        fund research on biomechanical factors that influence injury \n        risk in youth.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the Consumer Product Safety Commission should review \n        the National Academies' report and future research in this \n        area, including research as recommended by the National \n        Academies, for any matter that may impact products under the \n        Commission's jurisdiction;\n            (2) if protective equipment manufacturers choose to adopt \n        voluntary consumer product safety standards, the voluntary \n        standards should include mechanisms to ensure substantial \n        compliance by covered entities; and\n            (3) the Federal Trade Commission should review the National \n        Academies' report and future research in this area, including \n        research as recommended by the National Academies, for any \n        matter that may inform efforts to protect consumers from unfair \n        or deceptive practices in or affecting commerce.\n\nSEC. 3.
