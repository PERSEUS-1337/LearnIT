or\n                    (D)(i) disclosure of the identity of such a source \n                is essential to identify in a criminal investigation or \n                prosecution a person who without authorization \n                disclosed properly classified information and who at \n                the time of such disclosure had authorized access to \n                such information; and\n                    (ii) such unauthorized disclosure has caused or \n                will cause significant and articulable harm to the \n                national security; and\n            (4) that the public interest in compelling disclosure of \n        the information or document involved outweighs the public \n        interest in gathering or disseminating news or information.\n    (b) Authority to Consider National Security Interest.--For purposes \nof making a determination under subsection (a)(4), a court may consider \nthe extent of any harm to national security.\n    (c) Limitations on Content of Information.--The content of any \ntestimony or document that is compelled under subsection (a) shall--\n            (1) not be overbroad, unreasonable, or oppressive and, as \n        appropriate, be limited to the purpose of verifying published \n        information or describing any surrounding circumstances \n        relevant to the accuracy of such published information;

The previous sentence shall not apply, and \nsubsections (a) and (b) shall apply, in the case that the alleged \ncriminal conduct observed by the covered person or the alleged criminal \nor tortious conduct committed by the covered person is the act of \ntransmitting or communicating the information, record, document, or \nitem sought for disclosure.\n\nSEC. 3.
