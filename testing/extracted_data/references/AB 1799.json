For purposes of this subdivision, an election of directors is uncontested if the number of candidates for election, including write-in candidates, if applicable, does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at that election and the association has declared the election is uncontested.\n(1) An association may declare an election of directors is uncontested only if all of the following procedures have been satisfied:\n(A) The election rules required by Section 5105 have been adopted and complied with for the election.\n(B) All declared candidates were nominated before the deadline for nominations and in accordance with all lawful provisions of the association\u2019s governing documents.\n(C) The inspector of elections has informed the board that the number of candidates does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at that election.\n(D) The board votes in open session to declare the election is uncontested after a hearing during an open board meeting where members are able to make objections to the board making that declaration.\n(E) At least 20 days before the board meeting for the vote to declare the election is uncontested, the association provides general notice to all members as set forth in Section 4045 of all of the following:\n(i) The intention of the board to vote at a regular board meeting to declare the election of directors is uncontested, and giving date, time, and place of that board meeting.\n(ii) A disclosure to members of the names of all candidates, however nominated, including self-nomination, who will be declared elected if the board declares the election is uncontested.\n(iii) The right of any member to appear at the board meeting and make an objection to the board declaring the election is uncontested before the board votes on the matter.\n(F) The names of all candidates, however nominated, the general notice required by subparagraph (E), any objection to the board making the declaration that the election of directors is uncontested, and the board vote declaring the election of directors is uncontested shall be recorded in the meeting minutes.\n(2) (A) If the association\u2019s governing documents provide for write-in votes on the ballot, the association shall allow 15 days after the board meeting described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) for a write-in candidate to submit his or her name to the inspector of elections. In the event one or more write-in candidates are timely submitted and additional candidates result in the total number of candidates exceeding the number of directors to be elected at that election, an election shall be held pursuant to general election rules as provided in this article. If after the 15-day period the total number of candidates, including the number of write-in candidates, does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at that election, the uncontested election results shall be sealed and become effective immediately, with any write-in candidates added as members. The new board shall take office immediately following the sealing of the election.\n(B) If an association\u2019s governing documents do not provide for write-in votes on the ballot, as provided by subparagraph (A), then the association must provide at least 15 days\u2019 general notice of a self-nomination process following the board determination described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1).\nSEC. 2.\nSection 5105 of the Civil Code is amended to read:\n5105.\n(a) An association shall adopt rules, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by Article 5 (commencing with Section 4340) of Chapter 3, that do all of the following:\n(1) Ensure that if any candidate or member advocating a point of view is provided access to association media, newsletters, or Internet Web sites during a campaign, for purposes that are reasonably related to that election, equal access shall be provided to all candidates and members advocating a point of view, including those not endorsed by the board, for purposes that are reasonably related to the election. The association shall not edit or redact any content from these communications, but may include a statement specifying that the candidate or member, and not the association, is responsible for that content.\n(2) Ensure access to the common area meeting space, if any exists, during a campaign, at no cost, to all candidates, including those who are not incumbents, and to all members advocating a point of view, including those not endorsed by the board, for purposes reasonably related to the election.\n(3) Specify the qualifications for candidates for the board and any other elected position, and procedures for the nomination of candidates, consistent with the governing documents.

Those rules may permit write-in candidates for ballots.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 5145 of the Civil Code is amended to read:\n5145.\n(a) A member of an association may bring a civil action for declaratory or equitable relief for a violation of this article by the association, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, restitution, or a combination thereof, within one year of the date the cause of action accrues. Upon a finding that the election procedures of this article, or the adoption of and adherence to rules provided by Article 5 (commencing with Section 4340) of Chapter 3, were not followed, a court may void any results of the election.\n(b) A member who prevails in a civil action to enforce the member\u2019s rights pursuant to this article shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs, and the court may impose a civil penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500) for each violation, except that each identical violation shall be subject to only one penalty if the violation affects each member of the association equally. A prevailing association shall not recover any costs, unless the court finds the action to be frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\n(c) A cause of action under Sections 5100 to 5130, inclusive, with respect to access to association resources by a candidate or member advocating a point of view, the receipt of a ballot by a member, the counting, tabulation, or reporting of, or access to, ballots for inspection and review after tabulation, or a violation of a rule required by Section 5105 may be brought in small claims court if the amount of the demand does not exceed the jurisdiction of that court."
