    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Spending Reductions through \nInnovations in Therapies Agenda Act of 2012'' or the ``SPRINT Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Half of health care expenses in the United States are \n        spent on 5 percent of the population. Many of the most \n        expensive health conditions to treat are also the leading \n        causes of death.\n            (2) Improving a patient's quality of life by developing \n        innovative treatments that improve health outcomes and lead to \n        a cure will improve productivity in the United States, reduce \n        government spending, and enhance public health.\n            (3) More than a quarter of all Americans--and 2 out of 3 \n        older Americans--have multiple chronic conditions, and \n        treatment for these individuals accounts for 66 percent of the \n        health care budget of the United States.\n            (4) Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, for \n        instance, have a disproportionate health and economic impact on \n        patients, particularly those suffering from multiple chronic \n        conditions. In 2004, Medicare payments per person for \n        beneficiaries aged 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease and \n        other dementias were almost 3 times as high as average Medicare \n        payments for other Medicare beneficiaries in the same age \n        group. In addition, Alzheimer's patients often depend on full-\n        time at home or institutional care. Medicaid payments per \n        person for Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older with \n        Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were more than 9 times \n        as great as average Medicaid payments for other Medicare \n        beneficiaries in the same age group.\n            (5) The Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \n        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and the Medicaid program \n        under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et \n        seq.) cover about 70 percent of the total costs of caring for \n        people with Alzheimer's disease. In 2011, Medicare is expected \n        to spend approximately $93,000,000,000 for the care of \n        individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and \n        this amount is projected to increase to $627,000,000,000 in \n        2050. Medicaid costs are expected to increase nearly 400 \n        percent, from $34,000,000,000 in 2011 to $178,000,000,000 in \n        2050.\n            (6) Researchers believe sustained and targeted investment \n        in outcomes oriented research for the leading causes of death \n        will improve health treatments and make cures more obtainable.\n            (7) The United States Government has, in the past, \n        successfully addressed major research challenges by committing \n        resources in high-risk and high-reward basic and applied \n        research.\n\nSEC. 3. SPRINT PROGRAM.\n\n    Part A of title II of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 202 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 230.
