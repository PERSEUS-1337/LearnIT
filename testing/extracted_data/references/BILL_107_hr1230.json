FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The Detroit River, one of North America's greatest rivers, \n    was created some 14,000 years ago during the retreat of the \n    Wisconsin Glacier.\n        (2) The present river channel, established when falling water \n    levels permitted erosion of the Lake Plain and moraines, is a \n    connecting channel linking the Upper and Lower Great Lakes, as well \n    as linking the United States to Canada.\n        (3) The Lower Detroit River ecosystem is diverse with a number \n    of distinct channels, numerous shoals that support dense stands of \n    aquatic plants, and many islands. These nationally and \n    internationally significant habitats and ecological features \n    attract as many as 29 species of waterfowl and 65 kinds of fish.\n        (4) The Detroit River is a major migration corridor for fish, \n    butterflies, raptors, and other birds, in addition to waterfowl. \n    Over 300 species of birds have been documented in the Detroit-\n    Windsor area, of which about 150 species breed in the immediate \n    area.\n        (5) Because the Great Lakes are situated at the intersection of \n    the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, the Detroit River is an \n    important waterfowl migration corridor. 3,000,000 ducks, geese, \n    swans, and coots migrate annually through the Great Lakes region.\n        (6) The importance of this corridor is recognized in the \n    Canada-United States North American Waterfowl Management Plan that \n    has identified the Detroit River as part of one of 34 Waterfowl \n    Habitat Areas of Major Concern in the United States and Canada.\n        (7) Some 300,000 diving ducks stop in the Lower Detroit River \n    on their fall migration from Canada to the east and south each year \n    to rest and feed in beds of water celery found in the region.\n        (8) The international importance of the Lower Detroit River \n    area is manifested in the United States congressional designation \n    of the 460-acre Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge.\n        (9) Canada's Canard River Marsh Complex is an internationally \n    significant waterfowl staging area which is one of the main resting \n    and feeding areas for canvasbacks migrating from their nesting \n    grounds in the Canadian prairies to the East Coast. Many over-\n    winter in the area as well.\n        (10) The diversity of biota and habitats in the Lower Detroit \n    River ecosystem provides substantial benefits to the over 5,000,000 \n    people who live in the vicinity. The Lower Detroit River has an \n    international reputation for duck hunting. On an economic basis, \n    retail sales related to waterfowl hunting in Michigan were \n    estimated in 1991 to be $20,100,000. During the same year birding, \n    photography, and other nonconsumptive uses of waterfowl contributed \n    an additional $192,800,000 in Michigan.\n        (11) More than 1,000,000 pleasure boats are registered in \n    Michigan and about half of those are used on the Detroit River and \n    Lake St. Clair, in part to fish for the estimated 10,000,000 \n    walleye that migrate to the Detroit River each spring from Lake \n    Erie to spawn. These walleye have helped create an internationally \n    renowned sport fishery estimated to bring in $1,000,000 to the \n    economy of communities along the lower Detroit River each spring.\n        (12) All of these natural resource values and socioeconomic \n    benefits were acclaimed when the Detroit River was designated an \n    American Heritage River in 1998. The Detroit River is also a \n    Canadian Heritage River, making it the first international heritage \n    river system in the world.\n        (13) The Detroit River has lost over 95 percent of its coastal \n    wetland habitats and despite increased awareness and supporting \n    science of their importance, habitats continue to be destroyed and \n    degraded.\n        (14) Protection of remaining wildlife habitats and enhancement \n    of degraded wildlife habitats are essential to sustain the quality \n    of life enjoyed by so many living along the Detroit River corridor.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n        (1) The term ``Refuge'' means the Detroit River International \n    Wildlife Refuge established by section 5.\n        (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior.\n        (3) The term ``Detroit River'' means those lands and waters \n    within the area described in section 5(a).\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes for which the Refuge is established and shall be \nmanaged are as follows:\n        (1) To protect the remaining high-quality fish and wildlife \n    habitats of the Detroit River before they are lost to further \n    development and to restore and enhance degraded wildlife habitats \n    associated with the Detroit River.\n        (2) To assist in international efforts to conserve, enhance, \n    and restore the native aquatic and terrestrial community \n    characteristics of the Detroit River (including associated fish, \n    wildlife, and plant species) both in the United States and Canada.\n        (3) To facilitate partnerships among the United States Fish and \n    Wildlife Service, Canadian national and provincial authorities, \n    State and local governments, local communities in the United States \n    and in Canada, conservation organizations, and other non-Federal \n    entities to promote public awareness of the resources of the \n    Detroit River.\n\nSEC. 5.
