However, the individual must have demonstrated proficiency in basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills pursuant to the requirements of Section 44252.5. The applicant for the temporary certificate shall make a statement under oath that he or she has duly filed an application for a credential or permit together with the required fee and that, to the best of his or her knowledge, no reason exists why a certificate or permit should not be issued. The certificate or permit shall be valid for not more than one calendar year from the date of issuance.\n(b) The county board of education or city and county board of education shall cancel the temporary certificate or permit immediately upon receipt of certification in writing from the commission that the applicant apparently does not possess adequate academic qualifications or apparently has a criminal record that would disqualify the applicant.\n(c) A temporary certificate issued to a permit applicant is not valid beyond the time that the commission either issues or denies the originally requested permit. A temporary certificate issued to a credential applicant is not valid beyond the time that the commission provides written notification to the county board of education or city and county board of education that the applicant apparently does not possess adequate qualifications or that the commission has received facts that may cause denial of the application, or beyond the time that the commission either issues or denies the originally requested credential.\n(d) A county board of education or city and county board of education may not issue a temporary certificate to an applicant whose teaching credential is revoked or suspended.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 44332.5 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n44332.5.\n(a) (1) A school district that may issue warrants pursuant to Section 42647 may, at its discretion, provide for the registration of a valid certification or other document authorizing the holder to serve in a position requiring certification qualifications as an employee of the school district.\n(2) A school district shall not provide for the registration of a valid certification or other document authorizing the holder to serve in a position requiring certification qualifications as an employee of the school district until the school district has obtained a certificate of clearance from the commission.\n(b) During any period when summary criminal history information is not available from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, an applicant for an initial credential, certificate, or permit shall not be employed in a position requiring certification qualifications until he or she has met the minimum requirements for a temporary certificate of clearance. A temporary certificate of clearance or a credential, certificate, or permit authorizing service in the public schools shall be issued when the applicant has:\n(1) Made full disclosure of all facts necessary to establish his or her true identity.\n(2) Made a statement under penalty of perjury that he or she has not been convicted of a crime which would constitute grounds for the denial of the credential, permit, or certificate applied for.\nAn applicant shall not be required to disclose, and the Committee of Credentials shall not inquire into or consider, any acts or omissions not related to the applicant\u2019s fitness to teach or to perform other duties for which he or she is certificated, or that is related to his or her competence to perform the duties authorized by his or her credential.\n(3) Paid to the commission the amount of twelve dollars ($12) or the fees or costs which have been or will be assessed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the issuance of its summary criminal history of the applicant when this information is once again made available to the commission. The fees authorized by this paragraph shall be applicable to all credentials, permits, and certificates which were applied for or issued after October 1, 1981.\n(c) Upon receipt of a statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it has no summary criminal history information on the applicant, or upon receipt of the summary criminal history information and clearance by the Committee of Credentials, a temporary certificate of clearance shall be converted to a regular certificate of clearance.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 44332.6 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n44332.6.\n(a) (1) Before issuing a temporary certificate pursuant to Section 44332, a county board of education or city and county board of education shall obtain a certificate of clearance from the commission and shall not issue a temporary certificate if the applicant has been convicted of a violent or serious felony.\n(2) Before issuing a temporary certificate of clearance pursuant to Section 44332.5, a school district shall obtain a certificate of clearance from the commission and shall not issue a temporary certificate of clearance if the applicant has been convicted of a violent or serious felony.\n(b) This section applies to any violent or serious offense which, if committed in this state would have been punishable as a violent or serious felony.\n(c) For purposes of this section, a violent felony is any felony listed in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 of the Penal Code and a serious felony is any felony listed in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 of the Penal Code.\n(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a person shall not be denied a temporary certificate or a temporary certificate of clearance solely on the basis that he or she has been convicted of a violent or serious felony if the person has obtained a certificate of rehabilitation and pardon pursuant to Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 4852.01) of Title 6 of Part 3 of the Penal Code.\n(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a person shall not be denied a temporary certificate or a temporary certificate of clearance solely on the basis that the person has been convicted of a serious felony that is not also a violent felony, if that person can prove to the sentencing court of the offense in question, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or she has been rehabilitated for the purposes of school employment for at least one year. If the offense in question occurred outside this state, then the person may seek a finding of rehabilitation from the court in the school district in which he or she is a resident.\n(f) (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), a county board of education or city and county board of education may issue a temporary certificate to an employee currently and continuously employed by a school district within the county who is serving under a valid credential and has applied for a renewal of that credential or for an additional credential without obtaining a certificate of clearance from the commission for that employee.\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), a county board of education or city and county board of education may issue a temporary certificate of clearance to an employee currently and continuously employed by a school district within the county who is serving under a valid credential and has applied for a renewal of that credential or for an additional credential without obtaining a certificate of clearance from the commission for that employee.\nSEC. 4.\nArticle 15 (commencing with Section 44405) is added to Chapter 2 of Part 25 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Education Code, to read:\nArticle  15.

The applicant for a temporary certificate shall make a statement that he or she has duly filed an application with the commission for a credential or permit together with the required fee and that, to the best of his or her knowledge, no reason exists why a certificate or permit should not be issued. The certificate or permit shall be valid for not more than one calendar year from the date of issuance.\n(b) The county board of education or city and county board of education shall cancel the temporary certificate or permit, providing notification to the applicant and the nonpublic, nonsectarian school specified on the temporary certificate or permit, immediately upon receipt of certification in writing from the commission that the applicant apparently does not possess adequate academic qualifications or apparently has a criminal record that would disqualify the applicant.\n(c) A temporary certificate issued to a permit applicant is not valid beyond the time that the commission either issues or denies the originally requested permit.
