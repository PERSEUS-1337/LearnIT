SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Eliminate \nColorectal Cancer Act of 2004''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n        deaths in the United States for men and women combined.\n            (2) It is estimated that in 2004, 146,940 new cases of \n        colorectal cancer will be diagnosed in men and women in the \n        United States.\n            (3) Colorectal cancer is expected to kill 56,730 \n        individuals in the United States in 2004.\n            (4) When colorectal cancer is diagnosed early, at a \n        localized stage, more than 90 percent of patients survive for 5 \n        years or more. Once the disease has metastasized, 92 percent of \n        patients die within 5 years. Yet, only 37 percent of colorectal \n        cancer cases are diagnosed while the disease is still in the \n        localized stage.\n            (5) If all men and women age 50 and over practiced regular \n        colorectal cancer screening, without any new scientific \n        discoveries, the United States could see up to a 50 to 90 \n        percent reduction in deaths from this disease.\n            (6) Currently, many private insurance health plans are not \n        providing coverage for the full range of colorectal cancer \n        screening tests. Lack of insurance coverage can act as a \n        barrier to care.\n            (7) Assuring coverage for the full range of colorectal \n        cancer tests is an important step in increasing screening rates \n        for these life saving tests.\n\nSEC. 2. COVERAGE FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING.\n\n    (a) Group Health Plans.--\n            (1) Public health service act amendments.--The Public \n        Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended by adding \n        at the end the following:\n\n              ``TITLE XXIX--MISCELLANEOUS HEALTH COVERAGE\n\n``SEC. 2901.
