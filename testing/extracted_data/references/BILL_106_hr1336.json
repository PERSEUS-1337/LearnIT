FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) there exists throughout the United States a need for \n        decent, safe and affordable housing;\n            (2) affordable housing is critical to the well-being of \n        vulnerable families, particularly seniors and persons with \n        disabilities;\n            (3) an unprecedented number of contracts for Federal rental \n        assistance are expiring now and will expire in the near future, \n        including contracts covering 2,384,000 units in fiscal year \n        2000 alone;\n            (4) a growing number of private owners of affordable \n        housing developments are choosing to not renew their subsidy \n        contracts with the Federal government;\n            (5) in cases where assistance contracts are not renewed, \n        rent levels in the affected developments may rise dramatically;\n            (6) an overwhelming majority of residents in these \n        developments are seniors or persons with disabilities and have \n        little or no means of paying additional rent from personal \n        income, effectively forcing them to move from what have been \n        their homes for almost a quarter of a century; and\n            (7) the Federal Government should use all appropriate means \n        to ensure that those least able to provide for themselves enjoy \n        the protection and welfare of the people of the United States.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect vulnerable \nresidents of affordable housing, particularly seniors and persons with \ndisabilities, and to help provide those residents with peace of mind \nand security for living--\n            (1) by providing greater rental assistance flexibility to \n        ensure that vulnerable populations are not forced to move from \n        their homes when rent levels rise; and\n            (2) where appropriate, by encouraging private owners of \n        affordable housing developments to continue serving low-income \n        families by allowing such housing providers greater flexibility \n        for refinancing and by ensuring more effective administration \n        by the Federal Government of rental assistance contract \n        renegotiations.\n\nSEC. 3. ENHANCED VOUCHERS FOR RESIDENTS OF PROJECTS WITH EXPIRING \n              CONTRACTS.\n\n    Section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and \nAffordability Act of 1997 (42 U.S.C. 1437f note) is amended by adding \nat the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(b) Enhanced Vouchers Upon Contract Expiration.--In the case of \ncontracts for assistance under section 8 referred to in subsection (a) \nof this section that are not renewed under subsection (a) (or any other \nauthority), the following provisions shall apply:\n            ``(1) In general.--To the extent that amounts for \n        assistance under this subsection are provided in advance in \n        appropriation Acts, upon the date of the expiration of the \n        contract for project-based assistance for a covered project, \n        the Secretary--\n                    ``(A) shall make enhanced voucher assistance under \n                this subsection available on behalf of each covered \n                resident of a covered project;
