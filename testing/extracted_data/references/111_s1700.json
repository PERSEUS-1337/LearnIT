    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Security Through Transparency \nAct of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the interest of the United States to promote \n        good governance in the extractive industries sector because \n        good governance strengthens the national security and foreign \n        policy of the United States, contributes to a better investment \n        climate for businesses in the United States, increases the \n        reliability of commodity supplies upon which businesses and \n        people in the United States rely, and promotes greater energy \n        security.\n            (2) Developing countries that derive a significant portion \n        of revenues from natural resource extraction tend to have \n        higher poverty rates, weaker governance, higher rates of \n        conflict, and poorer development records than countries that do \n        not rely on resource revenues. The consequences of what is \n        known as the ``resource curse'' including the erosion of civil \n        society, a rise in internal conflicts and regional violence, \n        and the proliferation of terrorism are likely to pose a long-\n        term threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \n        economic interests of the United States.\n            (3) Transparency in revenue payments to governments enables \n        citizens to hold their leaders more accountable.\n            (4) There is a growing consensus among oil, gas, and mining \n        companies that transparency in revenue payments is good for \n        business, since it improves the business climate in which they \n        work and fosters good governance and accountability.\n            (5) Transparency in revenue payments benefits shareholders \n        of corporations that make such payments because such \n        shareholders have a desire to know the amount of such payments \n        in order to assess financial risk, compare payments from \n        country to country, and assess whether such payments help to \n        create a more stable investment climate. Undisclosed payments \n        may be perceived as corrupt and as decreasing the value of the \n        corporation.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO TRANSPARENCY FOR EXTRACTIVE \n              INDUSTRIES.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the President should work with foreign governments, \n        including members of the Group of 8 and the Group of 20, to \n        establish domestic requirements that companies under the \n        jurisdiction of each government publicly disclose any payments \n        made to a government relating to the commercial development of \n        oil, natural gas, and minerals; and\n            (2) the United States Government should commit to global \n        leadership of transparency in extractive industries by \n        supporting--\n                    (A) multilateral pro-transparency efforts, such as \n                the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, in \n                revenue collection, budgeting, expenditure, and wealth \n                management;\n                    (B) bilateral efforts to promote good governance in \n                the extractive industries through United States \n                missions and activities abroad;\n                    (C) the implementation of extractive industries \n                reporting requirements for companies under the \n                jurisdiction of the United States similar to the \n                requirements established under section 6 of this Act; \n                and\n                    (D) efforts to persuade other members of the \n                Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \n                and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation to adopt uniform \n                legislation to ensure a coordinated regulatory \n                approach.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY \n              TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the President should commit the \nUnited States to become a Candidate Country of the Extractive Industry \nTransparency Initiative.\n\nSEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior shall disclose to the public any \npayment (as that term is defined in section 13(m) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(m)), as added by section 6 of this \nAct) relating to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, and \nminerals on Federal land made by any person to the Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 6.
