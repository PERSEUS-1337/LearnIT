SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) thousands of Syrian children face a humanitarian crisis \n        due to the sustained civil war violence in Syria and have been \n        displaced to refugee camps in surrounding countries where their \n        personal safety and welfare is threatened;\n            (2) ample numbers of United States citizens, \n        nongovernmental organizations, and state governments and \n        instrumentalities would welcome the opportunity to provide \n        temporary support to young child refugees from Syria during the \n        ongoing humanitarian crisis;\n            (3) the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of \n        Homeland Security, and Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        should make every effort to facilitate the temporary relocation \n        and immediate care of up to 25,000 young Syrian minor children \n        refugees who either are orphaned to the extent that can be \n        established by proper authorities, or whose proper guardians \n        transfer custody of the children to representatives of the \n        United States as established by its proper officials, into the \n        United States over a period of three years from the date of \n        enactment of this Act; and\n            (4) the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of \n        Homeland Security, and Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        should make every effort to facilitate family reunification or \n        safe relocation of these young Syrian child refugees to Syria \n        after there is a sustained, substantial reduction of civil war \n        violence in Syria and a substantial reduction in the numbers of \n        newly displaced Syria inhabitants, such time as defined by the \n        Department of State.\n\nSEC. 3.

Following \nsuch time as the Department of State does make this designation, there \nshall be an additional six months grace period before the visas expire, \nso that due diligence can be done to identify the proper guardians of \nthese young minor children so they may be reunified with their \nfamilies. Only such qualifying children whose established guardians are \nphysically present to relinquish custody to the proper United States \nrepresentatives, or those children who can be established to be \norphaned, shall be eligible for such a visa.\n    (b) Office of Coordination.--\n            (1) Establishment.--\n                    (A) There is established in the Office of Refugee \n                Resettlement of the Department of Health and Human \n                Services a Coordinator of the Save the Children Program \n                (hereinafter, ``Coordinator'').\n                    (B) The Coordinator shall have the supervisory \n                authority for the operations of the Program in the \n                United States.\n                    (C) The Coordinator of the Save the Children \n                Program shall be appointed by and report to the \n                Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n            (2) Staff.--\n                    (A) With the approval of the Office of Personnel \n                Management, the Coordinator may appoint and fix the pay \n                of additional personnel as the Coordinator considers \n                appropriate.
