FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis has led to the \n        widespread and unprecedented abandonment of housing in many \n        urban neighborhoods.\n            (2) Communities that have experienced a significant \n        decrease in population since 1980 due to the loss of well-\n        paying manufacturing jobs and subsequent economic decline were \n        already subject to a severe problem of vacant and abandoned \n        housing when the subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis struck, \n        further exacerbating the problem.\n            (3) Although the prompt demolition and removal of vacant \n        and abandoned housing is necessary in order to protect public \n        health and safety, communities experiencing both economic \n        decline and large numbers of subprime mortgage foreclosures \n        have insufficient resources to demolish and remove such housing \n        in a timely manner.\n            (4) Emergency grant assistance to such communities would \n        enable them to quickly demolish and remove vacant and abandoned \n        housing in order to promote public health and safety, and to \n        create open space that could be used for park land, recreation, \n        future economic and residential development, or other purposes \n        that would benefit such communities.\n\nSEC. 3.
