FINDINGS.\n\n    Section 2 of the Poison Control Enhancement and Awareness Act (42 \nU.S.C. 14801) is amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Poison control centers are our Nation's primary \n        defense against injury and deaths from poisoning. Twenty-four \n        hours a day, the general public as well as health care \n        practitioners contact their local poison centers for help in \n        diagnosing and treating victims of poisoning and other toxic \n        exposures.\n            ``(2) Poisoning is the third most common form of \n        unintentional death in the United States. In any given year, \n        there will be between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 poison exposures. \n        More than 50 percent of these exposures will involve children \n        under the age of 6 who are exposed to toxic substances in their \n        home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 hospitalizations, \n        1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and 13,000 fatalities \n        annually.\n            ``(3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing \n        accessibility to poison control centers will promote the \n        utilization of poison control centers, and reduce the \n        inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other more \n        costly health care services.\n            ``(4) The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the \n        anthrax cases of October 2001, have dramatically changed our \n        Nation. During this time period, poison centers in many areas \n        of the country were answering thousands of additional calls \n        from concerned residents. Many poison centers were relied upon \n        as a source for accurate medical information about the disease \n        and the complications resulting from prophylactic antibiotic \n        therapy.\n            ``(5) The 2001 Presidential Task Force on Citizen \n        Preparedness in the War on Terrorism recommended that the \n        Poison Control Centers be used as a source of public \n        information and public education regarding potential \n        biological, chemical, and nuclear domestic terrorism.\n            ``(6) The increased demand placed upon poison centers to \n        provide emergency information in the event of a terrorist event \n        involving a biological, chemical, or nuclear toxin will \n        dramatically increase call volume.''.\n\nSEC. 3. MAINTENANCE OF A NATIONAL TOLL FREE NUMBER.\n\n    Section 4 of the Poison Control Enhancement and Awareness Act (42 \nU.S.C. 14803) is amended--\n            (1) by striking the section heading and inserting the \n        following:\n\n``SEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF A NATIONAL TOLL-FREE NUMBER.'';\n\n        and\n            (2) in subsection (c), by inserting ``and $2,000,000 for \n        each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009'' after ``2004''.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONWIDE MEDIA CAMPAIGN.\n\n    Section 5 of the Poison Control Enhancement and Awareness Act (42 \nU.S.C. 14804) is amended--\n            (1) by striking the section heading and inserting the \n        following:\n\n``SEC. 5. NATIONWIDE MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE POISON CONTROL CENTER \n              UTILIZATION.'';\n\n        and\n            (2) in subsection (c), by inserting ``and $1,500,000 for \n        each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009'' after ``2004''.\n\nSEC. 5. POISON CONTROL CENTER GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    Section 6 of the Poison Control Enhancement and Awareness Act (42 \nU.S.C. 14805) is amended--\n            (1) by striking the section heading and inserting the \n        following:\n\n``SEC. 6. MAINTENANCE OF THE POISON CONTROL CENTER GRANT PROGRAM.'';\n\n            (2) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:\n    ``(b) Other Improvements.--The Secretary shall also use amounts \nreceived under this section to--\n            ``(1) develop standardized poison prevention and poison \n        control promotion programs;\n            ``(2) develop standard patient management guidelines for \n        commonly encountered toxic exposures;\n            ``(3) improve and expand the poison control data collection \n        systems;\n            ``(4) improve national toxic exposure surveillance;\n            ``(5) expand the toxicologic expertise within poison \n        control centers; and\n            ``(6) improve the capacity of poison control centers to \n        answer high volumes of calls during times of national \n        crisis.'';\n            (3) by striking subsection (d)(2) and inserting the \n        following:\n            ``(2) Renewal.--The Secretary may renew a waiver under \n        paragraph (1).\n            ``(3) Limitation.--In no instance may the sum of the number \n        of years for a waiver under paragraph (1) and a renewal under \n        paragraph (2) exceed 5 years. The preceding sentence shall take \n        effect as if enacted on February 25, 2000.''; and\n            (4) in subsection (h), by inserting ``and $30,000,000 for \n        each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009'' after ``2004''.\n\nSEC. 6.
