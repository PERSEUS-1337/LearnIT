SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Linking Educators \nand Developing Entrepreneurs for Reaching Success (LEADERS) Act of \n2002''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Business incubators housed in academic settings provide \n        unique educational opportunities for students, provide \n        entrepreneurs with enhanced access to a skilled workforce, and \n        bring a wealth of resources to business, academia, and \n        communities.\n            (2) Academic affiliated incubators bridge the missions of \n        academic institutions by bringing together education, economic \n        development, and technology commercialization efforts.\n            (3) Studies have shown that incubator tenant companies have \n        an average success rate of 87 percent, and 90 percent for \n        technology-based incubator tenant companies. These success \n        rates are dramatically higher than the success rates for \n        companies in the general economy.\n            (4) Incubator companies are also more likely to remain in \n        the same communities as they grow and to provide high paying \n        jobs and benefits to their employees.\n            (5) Business incubators help academic institutions \n        contribute to local goals of sustaining economic development in \n        their surrounding communities.\n            (6) Education in entrepreneurship and other business \n        formation skills is essential to business success and \n        sustainable economic development.\n\nSEC. 2.
