    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Americans with Disabilities Act \nRestoration Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n        1990, Congress intended that the Act ``establish a clear and \n        comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of \n        disability'', and provide broad coverage and vigorous and \n        effective remedies without unnecessary and obstructive \n        defenses;\n            (2) decisions and opinions of the Supreme Court have unduly \n        narrowed the broad scope of protection afforded by the \n        Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, eliminating protection \n        for a broad range of individuals whom Congress intended to \n        protect;\n            (3) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n        1990, Congress recognized that physical and mental impairments \n        are natural parts of the human experience that in no way \n        diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects \n        of society, but Congress also recognized that people with \n        physical or mental impairments having the talent, skills, \n        abilities, and desire to participate in society are frequently \n        precluded from doing so because of prejudice, antiquated \n        attitudes, or the failure to remove societal and institutional \n        barriers;\n            (4)(A) Congress modeled the Americans with Disabilities Act \n        of 1990 definition of disability on that of section 504 of the \n        Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (referred to in this section as \n        ``section 504''), which had, prior to the date of enactment of \n        the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, been construed \n        broadly to encompass both actual and perceived limitations, and \n        limitations imposed by society; and\n            (B) the broad conception of the definition contained in \n        section 504 had been underscored by the Supreme Court's \n        statement in its decision in School Board of Nassau County v. \n        Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), that the definition ``acknowledged \n        that society's myths and fears about disability and disease are \n        as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from \n        actual impairment'';\n            (5) in adopting, in the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n        1990, the concept of disability expressed in section 504, \n        Congress understood that adverse action based on a person's \n        physical or mental impairment is often unrelated to the \n        limitations caused by the impairment itself;\n            (6) instead of following congressional expectations that \n        the term ``disability'' would be interpreted broadly in the \n        Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Supreme Court has \n        ruled, in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. \n        Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the elements of the \n        definition ``need to be interpreted strictly to create a \n        demanding standard for qualifying as disabled'' and, consistent \n        with that view, has narrowed the application of the definition \n        in various ways; and\n            (7) contrary to explicit congressional intent expressed in \n        the committee reports for the Americans with Disabilities Act \n        of 1990, the Supreme Court has eliminated from the Act's \n        coverage individuals who have mitigated the effects of their \n        impairments through the use of such measures as medication and \n        assistive devices.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to effect the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990's \n        objectives of providing ``a clear and comprehensive national \n        mandate for the elimination of discrimination'' and ``clear, \n        strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing \n        discrimination'' by restoring the broad scope of protection \n        available under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n            (2) to respond to certain decisions of the Supreme Court, \n        including Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 \n        (1999), Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 527 U.S. 516 \n        (1999), Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555 (1999), \n        and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 \n        U.S. 184 (2002), that have narrowed the class of people who can \n        invoke the protection from discrimination that the Americans \n        with Disabilities Act of 1990 provides; and\n            (3) to reinstate the original congressional intent \n        regarding the definition of disability in the Americans with \n        Disabilities Act of 1990 by clarifying that the protection of \n        that Act is available for all individuals who are--\n                    (A) subjected to adverse treatment based on an \n                actual or perceived impairment, or a record of \n                impairment; or\n                    (B) adversely affected--\n                            (i) by prejudiced attitudes, such as myths, \n                        fears, ignorance, or stereotypes concerning \n                        disability or particular disabilities; or\n                            (ii) by the failure to remove societal and \n                        institutional barriers, including \n                        communication, transportation, and \n                        architectural barriers, or the failure to \n                        provide reasonable modifications to policies, \n                        practices, and procedures, reasonable \n                        accommodations, and auxiliary aids and \n                        services.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS IN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990.\n\n    Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 \nU.S.C. 12101(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n            ``(1)(A) physical and mental disabilities are natural parts \n        of the human experience that in no way diminish a person's \n        right to fully participate in all aspects of society; and\n            ``(B)(i) people with physical or mental disabilities having \n        the talent, skills, abilities, and desire to participate in \n        society are frequently precluded from doing so because of \n        discrimination; and\n            ``(ii) other people who have a record of a disability or \n        are regarded as having a disability have also been subjected to \n        discrimination;''; and\n            (2) by striking paragraph (7) and inserting the following:\n            ``(7)(A) individuals with disabilities have been subjected \n        to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, have had \n        restrictions and limitations imposed upon them because of their \n        disabilities, and have been relegated to positions of political \n        powerlessness in society; and\n            ``(B) classifications and selection criteria that exclude \n        individuals with disabilities should be strongly disfavored, \n        subjected to skeptical and meticulous examination, and \n        permitted only for highly compelling reasons, and never on the \n        basis of prejudice, myths, irrational fears, ignorance, or \n        stereotypes about disability;''.\n\nSEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED.\n\n    Section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n12102) is amended--\n            (1) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n            ``(2) Disability.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `disability' means--\n                            ``(i) a physical or mental impairment;\n                            ``(ii) a record of a physical or mental \n                        impairment; or\n                            ``(iii) being regarded as having a physical \n                        or mental impairment.\n                    ``(B) Rule of construction.--\n                            ``(i) Determination of impairment.--The \n                        determination of whether an individual has a \n                        physical or mental impairment shall be made \n                        without regard to--\n                                    ``(I) whether the individual uses a \n                                mitigating measure;\n                                    ``(II) the impact of any mitigating \n                                measures the individual may or may not \n                                be using;\n                                    ``(III) whether any manifestation \n                                of the impairment is episodic; or\n                                    ``(IV) whether the impairment is in \n                                remission or latent.\n                            ``(ii) Mitigating measures.--The term \n                        `mitigating measure' means any treatment, \n                        medication, device, or other measure used to \n                        eliminate, mitigate, or compensate for the \n                        effect of an impairment, and includes \n                        prescription and other medications, personal \n                        aids and devices (including assistive \n                        technology devices and services), reasonable \n                        accommodations, and auxiliary aids and \n                        services.''; and\n            (2) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (7) and \n        inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n            ``(3) Mental impairment.--The term `mental', used with \n        respect to an impairment, means any mental or psychological \n        disorder such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, \n        emotional or mental illness, or specific learning disability.\n            ``(4) Physical impairment.--The term `physical', used with \n        respect to an impairment, means any physiological disorder or \n        condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting \n        1 or more of the following body systems:\n                    ``(A) Neurological.\n                    ``(B) Musculoskeletal.\n                    ``(C) Special sense organs.\n                    ``(D) Respiratory, including speech organs.\n                    ``(E) Cardiovascular.\n                    ``(F) Reproductive.\n                    ``(G) Digestive.\n                    ``(H) Genitourinary.\n                    ``(I) Hemic and lymphatic.\n                    ``(J) Skin.\n                    ``(K) Endocrine.\n            ``(5) Record of a physical or mental impairment.--The term \n        `record of a physical or mental impairment' means a history of, \n        or a misclassification as having, a physical or mental \n        impairment.\n            ``(6) Regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.--\n        The term `regarded as having a physical or mental impairment' \n        means perceived or treated as having a physical or mental \n        impairment, whether or not the individual involved has an \n        impairment.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
