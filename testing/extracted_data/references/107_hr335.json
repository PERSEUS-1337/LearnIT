    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Advisory Commission on Tax \nReform and Simplification Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study and \nreport back to Congress recommendations on simplifying, reforming, or \nreplacing the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex, \n        imposes significant burdens on individuals, businesses, and the \n        economy, is extremely difficult for the Internal Revenue \n        Service to administer, and is in need of fundamental reform and \n        simplification.\n            (2) Many of the problems encountered by taxpayers in \n        dealing with the Internal Revenue Service--especially those \n        arising from misunderstandings of the Code--could be eliminated \n        or alleviated by fundamental reform and simplification.\n            (3) The Internal Revenue Service faces continual difficulty \n        in administering an overly lengthy, complex, and confusing tax \n        code.\n            (4) Taxpayers and tax experts have repeatedly called for a \n        simplification of the current tax code.\n            (5) The complexity of the current code places a significant \n        burden on individual filers, including extensive record \n        keeping, time requirements to prepare returns, gaining an \n        understanding of the exemptions for which they may qualify, and \n        other burdens. This has forced the majority of taxpayers to \n        turn to tax professionals to prepare their tax returns.\n            (6) Congress is continually modifying and correcting the \n        Code, leading to annual uncertainty and only adding to the \n        patchwork of complexity and confusion.\n            (7) The Federal Government's present fiscal outlook for \n        continuing and sustained budget surpluses provides a unique \n        opportunity for the Congress to consider measures for \n        fundamental reform and simplification of the tax laws.\n            (8) Recent efforts to simplify or reform the tax laws have \n        not been successful due in part to the difficulty of developing \n        broad-based, nonpartisan support for proposals to make such \n        changes.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TAX REFORM AND \n              SIMPLIFICATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--To carry out the purposes of this Act, there is \nestablished within the legislative branch a National Advisory \nCommission on Tax Reform and Simplification (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Commission''), comprised of 15 members. The membership of the \nCommission shall be as follows:\n            (1) 3 members appointed by the President, 2 from the \n        executive branch of the Government and 1 from private life.\n            (2) 4 members appointed by the majority leader of the \n        Senate, 1 from Members of the Senate and 3 from private life.\n            (3) 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the \n        Senate, 1 from Members of the Senate and 1 from private life.\n            (4) 4 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n        Representatives, 1 from Members of the House of Representatives \n        and 3 from private life.\n            (5) 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the House \n        of Representatives, 1 from Members of the House of \n        Representatives and 1 from private life.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nPresident and congressional leadership should draw from a number of \nimportant areas of expertise in composing the Commission, including tax \nexperts familiar with corporate tax issues, international tax issues, \nsmall business tax issues, and family and individual tax issues.\n    (c) Appointments.--Appointments to the Commission shall be made not \nlater than 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. RULES OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Quorum.--Nine members of the Commission shall constitute a \nquorum for conducting the business of the Commission.\n    (b) Initial Meeting.--If, after 60 days from the date of the \nenactment of this Act, 5 or more members of the Commission have been \nappointed, members who have been appointed may meet and select the \nChair (or Co-chairs) who thereafter shall have the authority to begin \nthe operations of the Commission, including the hiring of staff.\n    (c) Rules.--The Commission may adopt such other rules as it \nconsiders appropriate.\n    (d) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its \npowers, but shall be filled in the same manner in which the original \nappointment was made. Any meeting of the Commission or any subcommittee \nthereof may be held in executive session to the extent that the Chair \n(Co-Chairs, if elected) or a majority of the members of the Commission \nor subcommittee determine appropriate.\n    (e) Continuation of Membership.--Any individual who appointed a \nmember to the Commission by virtue of holding a position described in \nsection 4 ceases to hold such position before the report of the \nCommission is submitted, that member may continue as a member for not \nlonger than the 30-day period beginning on the date that such \nindividual ceases to hold such position.\n\nSEC. 6.
