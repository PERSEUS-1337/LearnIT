FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Autism and other pervasive developmental disabilities \n        (fragile X syndrome, Rett's syndrome, childhood disintegrative \n        disorder, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and pervasive developmental \n        disorders not otherwise specified) are biologically based \n        neurodevelopmental diseases which cause severe impairment in \n        cognition, language, and affective abilities.\n            (2) Autism and pervasive developmental disabilities are not \n        rare; they may affect as many as one in every 500 children, and \n        more than 500,000 Americans.\n            (3) There is little information on the prevalence of autism \n        and other pervasive developmental disabilities in the United \n        States. There have never been any national prevalence studies \n        in the United States, and the two studies that were conducted \n        in the 1980s examined only selected areas of the country. \n        Recent studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan suggest that the \n        prevalence of classic autism alone may be 300 percent to 400 \n        percent higher than previously estimated.\n            (4) The cost of caring for individuals with autism and \n        pervasive developmental disabilities is estimated at more than \n        $13,000,000,000 per year for direct costs only.\n            (5) Autism is considered by many scientists to be one of \n        the most heritable of all the developmental disorders, and the \n        most likely to yield to the latest scientific advancements in \n        genetics and neurology.\n            (6) The discovery of effective treatments and a cure for \n        autism will be greatly enhanced when scientists and \n        epidemiologists have an accurate understanding of the \n        prevalence and incidence of autism.\n            (7) Recent research suggests that environmental factors may \n        contribute to autism. As a result, contributing causes of \n        autism, if identified, may be preventable.\n            (8) Finding the answers to the causes of autism and related \n        developmental disabilities may help researchers to understand \n        other disorders, ranging from learning problems, to \n        hyperactivity, to communications deficits that affect millions \n        of Americans.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) National Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disabilities \nSurveillance Program.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in \nthis Act referred to as the ``Secretary''), acting through the Director \nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may make awards of \ngrants and cooperative agreements for the collection, analysis, and \nreporting of data on autism and pervasive developmental disabilities. \nAn entity may receive such an award only if the entity is a public or \nnonprofit private entity (including health departments of States and \npolitical subdivisions of States, and including universities and other \neducational entities). In making such awards, the Secretary may provide \ndirect technical assistance in lieu of cash.\n    (b) Centers of Excellence in Autism and Pervasive Developmental \nDisabilities Epidemiology.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary, acting through the Director \n        of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall \n        (subject to the extent of amounts made available in \n        appropriations Acts) establish not less than three, and not \n        more than five, regional centers of excellence in autism and \n        pervasive developmental disabilities epidemiology for \nthe purpose of collecting and analyzing information on the number, \nincidence, correlates, and causes of autism and related developmental \ndisabilities.\n            (2) Recipients of awards for establishment of centers.--\n        Centers under paragraph (1) shall be established and operated \n        through the award of grants or cooperative agreements to public \n        or nonprofit private entities that conduct research, including \n        health departments of States and political subdivisions of \n        States, and including universities and other educational \n        entities.\n            (3) Certain requirements.--An award for a center under \n        paragraph (1) may be made only if the entity involved submits \n        to the Secretary an application containing such agreements and \n        information as the Secretary may require, including an \n        agreement that the center involved will operate in accordance \n        with the following:\n                    (A) The center will collect, analyze, and report \n                autism and pervasive developmental disabilities data \n                according to guidelines prescribed the Director, after \n                consultation with relevant State and local public \n                health officials, private sector developmental \n                disability researchers, and advocates for those with \n                developmental disabilities;\n                    (B) The center will assist with the development and \n                coordination of State autism and pervasive \n                developmental disabilities surveillance efforts within \n                a region;\n                    (C) The center will provide education, training, \n                and clinical skills improvement for health \n                professionals aimed at better understanding and \n                treatment of autism and related developmental \n                disabilities; and\n                    (D) The center will identify eligible cases and \n                controls through its surveillance systems and conduct \n                research into factors which may cause autism and \n                related developmental disabilities; each program will \n                develop or extend an area of special research expertise \n                (including, but not limited to, genetics, environmental \n                exposure to contaminants, immunology, and other \n                relevant research specialty areas).\n\nSEC. 4. CLEARINGHOUSE.\n\n    The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, shall carry out the following:\n            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall \n        serve as the coordinating agency for autism and pervasive \n        developmental disabilities surveillance activities through the \n        establishment of a clearinghouse for the collection and storage \n        of data generated from the monitoring programs created by this \n        Act. The functions of such a clearinghouse shall include \n        facilitating the coordination of research and policy \n        development relating to the epidemiology of autism and other \n        pervasive developmental disabilities.\n            (2) The Secretary, acting through the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention, shall coordinate the Federal response \n        to requests for assistance from State health department \n        officials regarding potential or alleged autism or \n        developmental disability clusters.\n\nSEC. 5.
