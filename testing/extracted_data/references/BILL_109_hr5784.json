FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States and the Caribbean have enjoyed long-\n        standing friendly relations.\n            (2) As an important regional partner for trade and \n        democratic values, the Caribbean constitutes a ``Third Border'' \n        of the United States.\n            (3) The decrease in tourism revenue in the aftermath of the \n        tragic terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, had an adverse \n        affect on the Caribbean.\n            (4) According to a 2005 World Bank Report on the Caribbean, \n        unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, has severe \n        implications on poverty and income distributions, as well as \n        drug trafficking and addiction.\n            (5) The World Bank Report also concludes that better \n        synchronization is needed between current Caribbean curricula \n        and the skills needed in an evolving job market and economy.\n            (6) Many Caribbean leaders have linked the increase in \n        crime to a decrease in economic alternatives. Consequently, \n        United States and Caribbean leaders have highlighted the need \n        for increased educational opportunities for Caribbean students.\n            (7) By enhancing United States cultural and educational \n        exchange programs in the Caribbean, regional security is \n        improved by expanding human resources and providing \n        opportunities that promote economic growth.\n            (8) Many Caribbean leaders studied at the undergraduate or \n        graduate level in the United States before returning to their \n        respective countries to contribute towards the strengthening of \n        democracy, the economy, or the provision of social services.\n            (9) From 2003 through 2005, 217 Caribbean leaders \n        participated in exchange programs with the United States that \n        focused on good governance, combating drug trafficking, anti-\n        corruption, and other regional issues of concern.\n            (10) The Department of State currently administers public \n        outreach programs that include cultural, academic, and citizen \n        exchange initiatives in Caribbean countries through the Embassy \n        Public Affairs Sections with support from the Office of Public \n        Diplomacy in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.\n            (11) In some Caribbean countries, the United States Agency \n        for International Development coordinates the Center of \n        Excellence for Teacher Training (CETT), a successful \n        Presidential initiative that emphasizes teacher training as a \n        key to the development of a competitive work force.\n            (12) In Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, \n        Barbados, Belize, the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, \n        Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and \n        Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and \n        Trinidad and Tobago, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural \n        Affairs sponsors educational advisors to promote study in the \n        United States.\n            (13) In the 2004-2005 academic year, approximately 14,000 \n        Caribbean students were enrolled in United States universities.\n\nSEC. 4.
