EXTENSION OF PROGRAM APPLYING SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES TO CERTAIN \n              COMMERCIAL ITEMS.\n\n    Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (divisions D and E of \nPublic Law 104-106; 110 Stat. 652; 10 U.S.C. 2304 note) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (e), by striking ``January 1, 2003'' and \n        inserting ``January 1, 2008''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(f) Report.--Not later than December 31, 2004, the Comptroller \nGeneral shall submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of the \nimplementation of the provisions enacted by this section and any \nrecommendations for improving such effectiveness.''.\n\nSEC. 3. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) unless action is taken soon, there will be a crisis in \n        the government's ability to deliver essential services to the \n        American people;\n            (2) by 2006, over 50 percent of the Federal Government's \n        information technology workforce will be eligible to retire, \n        creating a huge demand in the Federal Government for high-skill \n        workers;\n            (3) despite a 44 percent decrease in the demand for \n        information technology workers in the private sector, the \n        Information Technology Association of America reported in 2001 \n        that employers will need to fill over 900,000 new information \n        technology jobs and will be unable to find qualified workers \n        for 425,000 of those jobs;\n            (4) to highlight the urgency of this situation, in January \n        2001, the General Accounting Office added the Federal \n        Government's human capital management to its list of high-risk \n        problems for which an effective solution must be found;\n            (5) despite efforts to increase flexibility in Federal \n        agencies' employment practices, compensation issues continue to \n        severely restrain recruitment for Federal agencies; and\n            (6) an effective, efficient, and economical response to \n        this crisis would be to create a vibrant, ongoing exchange \n        effort designed to share talent, expertise, and advances in \n        management between leading-edge businesses and Federal agencies \n        engaged in best practices.\n    (b) Information Technology Exchange Program.--\n            (1) In general.--Subpart B of part III of title 5, United \n        States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n         ``CHAPTER 37--INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE PROGRAM\n\n``Sec.\n``3701.
