FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for \n        both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer \n        deaths.\n            (2) The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2010, \n        there were 222,520 new diagnoses of lung cancer and 157,300 \n        deaths attributed to the disease.\n            (3) According to projections published in the Journal of \n        Clinical Oncology in 2009, between 2010 and 2030, the incidence \n        of lung cancer will increase by 46 percent for women and by 58 \n        percent for men. The increase in the incidence of lung cancer \n        among minority communities during that time period will range \n        from 74 percent to 191 percent.\n            (4) Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than the next 4 \n        leading causes of cancer deaths, colon cancer, breast cancer, \n        prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer, combined.\n            (5) The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15 \n        percent, while the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is 89 \n        percent, for prostate cancer 99 percent, and for colon cancer \n        65 percent. Yet in research dollars per death, lung cancer is \n        the least funded of the major cancers.\n            (6) In 2001, the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the \n        National Cancer Institute stated that funding for lung cancer \n        research was ``far below the levels characterized for other \n        common malignancies and far out of proportion to its massive \n        health impact'' and it gave the ``highest priority'' to the \n        creation of an integrated multidisciplinary, multi-\n        institutional research program. No comprehensive plan has been \n        developed.\n            (7) While smoking is the leading risk factor for lung \n        cancer, the President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report \n        of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung \n        cancer and listed 15 other environmental contaminants strongly \n        association with lung cancer, and there is accumulating \n        evidence that hormonal and genetic factors may influence the \n        onset.\n            (8) Lung cancer is the most stigmatized of all the cancers \n        and the only cancer blamed on patients, whether they smoked or \n        not.\n            (9) Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never \n        smoked. Sixty percent of individuals diagnosed with lung cancer \n        are former smokers who quit, often decades ago.\n            (10) Lung cancer in men and women who never smoked is the \n        sixth leading cause of cancer death. Of individuals diagnosed \n        with lung cancer who have never smoked, \\2/3\\ of are women.\n            (11) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in \n        the overall population and in every major ethnic grouping, \n        including White, African-American, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific \n        Islander, American Indian, and Alaskan Native, with an even \n        disproportionately higher impact on African-American males that \n        has not been addressed.\n            (12) Military personnel, veterans, and munitions workers \n        exposed to carcinogens such as Agent Orange, crystalline forms \n        of silica, arsenic, uranium, beryllium, and battlefield fuel \n        emissions have increased risk for lung cancer.\n            (13) Only 16 percent of lung cancer is being diagnosed at \n        an early stage and there were no targets for the early \n        detection or treatment of lung cancer included in the \n        Department of Health and Human Services's ``Healthy People \n        2010'' or ``Healthy People 2020''.\n            (14) An actuarial analysis carried out by Milliman Inc. and \n        published in Population Health Management Journal in 2009 \n        indicated that early detection of lung cancer could save more \n        than 70,000 lives a year in the United States.\n            (15) A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 indicated \n        that while the value of life lost to lung cancer will exceed \n        $433,000,000,000 a year by 2020, a 4-percent annual decline in \n        lung cancer mortality would reduce that amount by more than \n        half.\n            (16) In 2010, the National Cancer Institute released \n        initial results from the National Lung Screening Trial, a \n        large-scale randomized national trial that compared the effect \n        of low-dose helical computed tomography (``CT'') and a standard \n        chest x-ray on lung cancer mortality. The study found 20 \n        percent fewer lung cancer deaths among study participants \n        screened with the CT scan.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS CONCERNING INVESTMENT IN LUNG CANCER \n              RESEARCH.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be made a \n        national public health priority; and\n            (2) a comprehensive mortality reduction program coordinated \n        by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is justified and \n        necessary to adequately address all aspects of lung cancer and \n        reduce lung cancer mortality among current smokers, former \n        smokers, and non-smokers.\n\nSEC. 4. LUNG CANCER MORTALITY REDUCTION PROGRAM.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399V-6.
