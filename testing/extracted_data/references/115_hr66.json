FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Route 66 was the Nation's first all-paved highway under \n        the U.S. Highway System connecting the Midwest to California \n        and has played a major role in the history of the United \n        States.\n            (2) Route 66 was the symbol of opportunity to hundreds of \n        thousands of people seeking escape from the Dust Bowl in the \n        1930s, serving as a ``road to opportunity'' in the West and \n        providing employment during the Great Depression, as thousands \n        were put to work on road crews to pave the road.\n            (3) Route 66 was invaluable in transporting troops, \n        equipment, and supplies across the country to the West, where \n        the government established multiple industries and armed force \n        bases during World War II. Upon the conclusion of the war in \n        1945, Route 66 was a key route taken by thousands of troops as \n        they returned home.\n            (4) Route 66 symbolized the Nation's positive outlook \n        during the postwar economic recovery in the 1950s and 1960s, \n        serving as an icon of free-spirited independence and linking \n        people across the United States. During this period, the \n        tourist industry along Route 66 grew tremendously, giving rise \n        to countless tourist courts, motels, service stations, garages, \n        and diners.\n            (5) Since June 27, 1985, when Route 66 was decommissioned \n        as a Federal highway, the popularity and mythical stature of \n        Route 66 has grown domestically and internationally, as the \n        road has experienced a rebirth of interest and support.\n            (6) The year 2026 will be the centennial anniversary of \n        Route 66, and a commission should be established to study and \n        recommend to Congress activities that are fitting and proper to \n        celebrate that anniversary in a manner that appropriately \n        honors America's Mother Road.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the Route 66 \nCentennial Commission (referred to in this Act as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4. DUTIES.\n\n    The Commission shall have the following duties:\n            (1) To study activities that may be carried out by the \n        Federal Government to determine whether the activities are \n        fitting and proper to honor Route 66 on the occasion of its \n        centennial anniversary, including any of the activities \n        described under section 8(b)(2)(B).\n            (2) To recommend to Congress the activities the Commission \n        considers most fitting and proper to honor Route 66 on such \n        occasion, to be carried out by the Department of Transportation \n        and any other entity or entities within the Federal Government \n        that the Commission considers most appropriate to carry out \n        such activities.\n            (3) To plan and host, in cooperation with such partners, a \n        conference on the U.S. Numbered Highway System, and assist in \n        the activities of such a conference.\n\nSEC. 5.
