SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``LEO Fair \nRetirement Act of 2017''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal law enforcement officers are never ``off-\n        duty''. They are counted on to respond at any time of the day \n        or night, regardless of their official duty status, to protect \n        the public safety. Outside of our Nation's armed forces, theirs \n        is the only profession comprised of individuals who are \n        routinely called upon to put their lives on the line to keep \n        America safe.\n            (2) Though the Federal Government may house the largest \n        variety of occupations of any U.S. employer across its panoply \n        of agencies and entities, Federal law enforcement is absolutely \n        unique among them, and the Federal law enforcement officer has \n        no counterpart in the private sector. It is one of the most \n        stressful, most dangerous, and most rewarding careers for those \n        who meet the rigorous requirements of the job.\n            (3) It was in recognition of the unique nature of the \n        occupation, and the demanding schedules required of those who \n        fill its ranks, that Congress established distinct pay and \n        benefit systems for Federal law enforcement positions. This \n        includes basic pay, retirement, and even overtime compensation.\n            (4) Under current law, however, the payment of overtime \n        compensation is limited, and is only payable to the extent that \n        the payments do not cause the aggregate of the law enforcement \n        officer's biweekly or annual pay to exceed the pay caps \n        established under section 5547 of title 5, United States Code. \n        This often results in a law enforcement officer working \n        significant amounts of overtime hours year after year for which \n        the officer is never compensated.\n            (5) In light of the continuing homeland and national \n        security threats facing our Nation, it is in the interest of \n        the Federal Government to ensure that it can continue to \n        recruit and retain the highest caliber personnel by allowing \n        Federal law enforcement officers the opportunity to reclaim \n        full credit in retirement for overtime hours worked but never \n        paid.\n\nSEC. 2. COMPUTATION OF ANNUITY FOR HOURS WORKED IN EXCESS OF LAW \n              ENFORCEMENT PREMIUM PAY LIMITATIONS.\n\n    (a) CSRS.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 8339 of title 5, United States \n        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(v)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, \nincluding sections 5545a and 5547, and consistent with the requirements \nof paragraph (2), any premium pay described in section 5547(a) that \nwould have been received by a law enforcement officer but for the \nlimitation provided in such section shall be included in the average \npay of such officer for purposes of computing the annuity of such \nofficer under this section.\n    ``(2)(A) Paragraph (1) shall not apply unless the law enforcement \nofficer makes a lump-sum payment to the Office in the manner prescribed \nunder this paragraph.\n    ``(B) The officer may--\n            ``(i) not later than 180 days before the date that the \n        officer's annuity will commence, request from the Office an \n        estimate (expressed as a dollar figure) of--\n                    ``(I) the lump-sum payment described under \n                subparagraph (C);\n                    ``(II) the amount of the officer's monthly annuity \n                payment if the officer elects to make the lump-sum \n                payment and receive an amended annuity that includes \n                the application of paragraph (1);
