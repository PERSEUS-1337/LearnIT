    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Holocaust \nAccountability in Insurance Measure''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) between 1933 and 1945, the Nazi regime and its \n        collaborators conducted systematic, bureaucratic, and State-\n        sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million \n        Jews--the genocidal act known as the Holocaust;\n            (2) before and during World War II, millions of European \n        Jews had purchased, in good faith, life insurance policies with \n        certain European insurance companies because these policies \n        were a popular form of savings and investment that provided a \n        means of safeguarding a family's assets, assisting in \n        retirement planning, providing for a dowry, or saving for the \n        education of children;\n            (3) after the Nazis came to power in Germany, they \n        systematically confiscated the insurance assets, including the \n        cash value of life insurance policies, of Jews and other \n        designated enemies of the Nazi regime;\n            (4) after the conclusion of World War II, European insurers \n        often rejected insurance claims of Holocaust victims and heirs \n        who lacked required documentation, such as death certificates;\n            (5) during the 50 years since the end of the war, only a \n        small percentage of Holocaust victims and their families have \n        been successful in collecting on their policies;\n            (6) in 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \n        Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established by U.S. State \n        insurance regulators, European insurers, and certain \n        nongovernmental organizations to act as a facilitator between \n        insurers and beneficiaries to help expedite payouts on \n        contested insurance policies;\n            (7) to date ICHEIC has received over 90,000 claims and has \n        only made 2,281 settlement offers, which amounts to less than a \n        3% success rate;\n            (8) these insurance payments should be expedited to the \n        victims of the most heinous crime of the 20th century to ensure \n        that they do not become victims a second time;\n            (9) States should be allowed to collect Holocaust-era \n        insurance information from foreign-based insurance companies \n        that want to do business in the State; and\n            (10) Holocaust victims and their families should be able to \n        recover claims on Holocaust era insurance policies in Federal \n        court when they deem it necessary to seek redress through the \n        judicial system.\n\nSEC. 3. STATE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS FOR CONDUCTING \n              INSURANCE BUSINESS.\n\n    (a) In General.--A State may establish requirements on insurers as \na condition of doing insurance business in that State, to the extent \nsuch requirements are consistent with the due process guarantees of the \nConstitution of the United States, as follows:\n            (1) Information requirements.--The State may require that \n        an insurer provide to the State the following information \n        regarding Holocaust era insurance policies:\n                    (A) Whether the insurer, or any affiliate or \n                predecessor company, sold any such policies.\n                    (B) The number of such policies sold by the \n                insurer, and any affiliates and predecessor companies, \n                and the number the insurer and its affiliates currently \n                have in their possession.\n                    (C) The identity of the holder and beneficiary of \n                each such policy sold or held and current status of \n                each such policy.\n                    (D) The city of origin, domicile, and address for \n                each policyholder listed.\n                    (E) If an insurer has no such policies to report \n                because records are no longer in the possession of the \n                insurer or its affiliates, a statement explaining the \n                reasons for the lack of possession of such records.\n                    (F) Any other information regarding such policies \n                as the State considers appropriate.\n            (2) Requirements regarding payment of policies.--A State \n        may require that an insurer certify that, with respect to any \n        Holocaust era insurance policies sold or at any time held by \n        the insurer--\n                    (A) the proceeds of the policy were paid;\n                    (B) the beneficiaries of the policy or heirs or \n                such beneficiaries could not, after diligent search, be \n                located, and the proceeds were distributed to Holocaust \n                survivors or charities;\n                    (C) a court of law has certified a plan for the \n                distribution of the proceeds; or\n                    (D) the proceeds have not been distributed.\n    (b) Holocaust Era Insurance Policies.--For purposes of this \nsection, the term ``Holocaust era insurance policy'' means a policy for \ninsurance coverage that--\n            (1) was in force at any time during the 26-year period \n        beginning with 1920 and ending with 1945; and\n            (2) has a policy beneficiary, policyholder, or insured life \n        that is a listed Holocaust victim.\n\nSEC. 4.
