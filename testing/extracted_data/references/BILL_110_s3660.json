FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced \n        by burning any fuel. Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon \n        monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a serious \n        health condition that could result in death.\n            (2) Carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of fuel-burning \n        appliances in residential homes and other dwelling units kills \n        at least 2,000 people each year and sends more than 15,000 to \n        hospital emergency rooms for treatment.\n            (3) Research shows that purchasing and installing carbon \n        monoxide alarms close to the sleeping areas in residential \n        homes and other dwelling units can help avoid fatalities.\n            (4) Congress should promote the purchase and installation \n        of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes and dwelling \n        units nationwide in order to promote the health and public \n        safety of citizens throughout the Nation.\n\nSEC. 3. ADOPTION OF ANSI/UL 2034 AS CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY RULE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n\n``SEC. 43.
