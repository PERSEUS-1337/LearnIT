FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) each year, approximately 3,600,000 pregnancies, or \n        nearly 60 percent of all pregnancies, in this country are \n        unintended;\n            (2) contraceptive services are part of basic health care, \n        allowing families to both adequately space desired pregnancies \n        and avoid unintended pregnancy;\n            (3) studies show that contraceptives are cost effective: \n        for every $1 of public funds invested in family planning, $4 to \n        $14 of public funds is saved in pregnancy and health care-\n        related costs;\n            (4) by reducing rates of unintended pregnancy, \n        contraceptives help reduce the need for abortion;\n            (5) unintended pregnancies lead to higher rates of infant \n        mortality, low-birth weight, and maternal morbidity, and \n        threaten the economic viability of families;\n            (6) the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality \n        determined that ``infant mortality could be reduced by 10 \n        percent if all women not desiring pregnancy used \n        contraception'';\n            (7) most women in the United States, including two-thirds \n        of women of childbearing age, rely on some form of private \n        employment-related insurance (through either their own employer \n        or a family member's employer) to defray their medical \n        expenses;\n            (8) the vast majority of private insurers cover \n        prescription drugs, but many exclude coverage for prescription \n        contraceptives;\n            (9) private insurance provides extremely limited coverage \n        of contraceptives: half of traditional indemnity plans and \n        preferred provider organizations, 20 percent of point-of-\n        service networks, and 7 percent of health maintenance \n        organizations cover no contraceptive methods other than \n        sterilization;\n            (10) women of reproductive age spend 68 percent more than \n        men on out-of-pocket health care costs, with contraceptives and \n        reproductive health care services accounting for much of the \n        difference;\n            (11) the lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance \n        places many effective forms of contraceptives beyond the \n        financial reach of many women, leading to unintended \n        pregnancies; and\n            (12) the Institute of Medicine Committee on Unintended \n        Pregnancy recently recommended that ``financial barriers to \n        contraception be reduced by increasing the proportion of all \n        health insurance policies that cover contraceptive services and \n        supplies''.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF \n              1974.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart B of part 7 of subtitle B of title I of \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as added by \nsection 603(a) of the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of \n1996 and amended by section 702(a) of the Mental Health Parity Act of \n1996) is further amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 713.
