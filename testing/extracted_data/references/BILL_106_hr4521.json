FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The historic significance of the 52-mile Going-to-the-\n        Sun Road is recognized by its listing on the National Register \n        of Historic Places in 1983, designation as a National Historic \n        Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers \n        in 1985, and designation as a National Historic Landmark in \n        1997.\n            (2) A contracted engineering study and Federal Highway \n        Administration recommendations in 1997 of the Going-to-the-Sun \n        Road verified significant structural damage to the road that \n        has occurred since it opened in 1932.\n            (3) Infrastructure at most of the developed areas is \n        inadequate for cold-season (fall, winter, and spring) \n        operation, and maintenance backlog needs exist for normal \n        summer operation.\n            (4) The Many Glacier Hotel and Lake McDonald Lodge are on \n        the National Register of Historic Places and are National \n        Historic Landmarks. Other accommodations operated by the \n        concessioner with possessory interest and listed on the \n        National Register of Historic Places are the Rising Sun Motor \n        Inn and Swiftcurrent Motel.\n            (5) The historic hotels in Glacier National Park, operated \n        under concession agreements with the National Park Service, are \n        essential for public use and enjoyment of the Park.\n            (6) Public consumers deserve safe hotels in Glacier \n        National Park that can meet their basic needs and expectations.\n            (7) The historic hotels in Glacier National Park are \n        significantly deteriorated and need substantial repair.\n            (8) Repairs of the hotels in Glacier National Park have \n        been deferred for so long that, absent any changes to Federal \n        law and the availability of historic tax credits, the \n        remodeling costs for the hotels may exceed the capacity of an \n        investor to finance them solely out of hotel revenues.\n            (9) The current season of operation for hotels is \n        approximately 4 months because the developed areas lack water, \n        sewer, and fire protection systems that can operate in freezing \n        conditions, lack building insulation, and lack heating systems.\n            (10) The National Park Service Concessions Management \n        Improvement Act of 1998 is based upon sound principles and is \n        achieving its basic purposes, but there appear to be selected \n        instances where the National Park Service may need additional \n        authority to conduct demonstration projects.\n            (11) A demonstration project is needed for the repair of \n        the historic hotels in Glacier National Park.\n\nSEC. 2.
