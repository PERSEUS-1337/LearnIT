FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The International Bank for Reconstruction and \n        Development and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have \n        classified 40 countries as heavily indebted poor countries \n        (HIPC).\n            (2) According to the Department of the Treasury, as of \n        August 1998, these countries owe the United States a total of \n        $6,752,100,000 in concessional, nonconcessional, and guarantee \n        debt.\n            (3) 83 percent of these countries are classified by the \n        United Nations as being in its lowest category of human \n        development based on life expectancy, literacy, and per capita \n        national income.\n            (4) Since the early 1980's, these poor countries have had \n        increasing difficulty servicing their debt, resulting in the \n        total amount of money being owed by these countries to external \n        creditors to increasing from an average of $122,000,000,000 for \n        the 1983-1985 period to $221,000,000,000 for the 1993-1995 \n        period.\n            (5) The debt overhang faced by these countries blocks \n        needed spending for development and discourages productive \n        investment.\n            (6) Efforts to promote good governance, accountability, \n        transparency, and active participation of civil society in \n        public decision making and discourage corruption are undermined \n        by diversion of resources to debt service and by the \n        micromanagement of economic policy by external actors which is \n        currently part of debt negotiations.\n            (7) The Jubilee 2000 campaign, an international movement in \n        over 40 countries supported by many prominent religious leaders \n        such as Pope John Paul II, is calling for the cancellation of \n        the external debts of the poorest countries.\n\nSEC. 3. ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``eligible country'' means a heavily indebted \npoor country, as determined by the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund for \npurposes of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative, and \nHaiti.\n\nSEC. 4.
