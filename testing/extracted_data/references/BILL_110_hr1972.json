FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is a growing recognition that urban, low-income, \n        and minority communities tend to be overburdened with polluting \n        facilities such as waste transfer stations, power plants, \n        superfund sites, brownfields, and toxic release inventory \n        sites.\n            (2) Poor and urban neighborhoods are forced to suffer the \n        effects associated with increased waste processing because they \n        often lack the resources to defend their rights and cannot \n        quantify unhealthy environmental factors.\n            (3) Addressing the problem of contaminated surroundings \n        impacting low-income or minority communities must be a priority \n        of this Nation.\n            (4) Health respiratory conditions such as asthma can be \n        traced to environmental conditions impacting a community such \n        as air pollution and biological contaminants.\n            (5) Asthma is one of the leading chronic health conditions \n        in the United States (affecting over 15 million people) and the \n        leading chronic youth illness (affecting 6.5 million children).\n            (6) At risk communities need resources to gather \n        information useful in planning preventive health and \n        environmental strategies to protect residents from polluting \n        conditions.\n            (7) Alliances of community-based organizations and \n        community health centers are often in the best position to \n        develop neighborhood health profiles to assist heath policy \n        makers in assessing the health impact of future growth or \n        redevelopment.\n            (8) Federal resources can help communities protect \n        themselves from being disproportionately exposed to \n        contaminants which can cause respiratory health complications \n        such as asthma.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to prevent any individual or community from being \n        disproportionately exposed to hazardous materials;\n            (2) to enable government agencies to protect individuals \n        and communities from such exposure;\n            (3) to give community-based organizations and community \n        health centers the tools necessary to measure neighborhood \n        impacts of environmental hazards; and\n            (4) to enable such organizations and centers to maintain a \n        health profile for their communities and in this manner prevent \n        discriminatory exposure to hazardous substances.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION REGARDING EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.\n\n    The Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended by \nadding at the end the following title:\n\n  ``TITLE XXX--DISCRIMINATION REGARDING EXPOSURE TO COVERED SUBSTANCES\n\n``SEC. 3001.
