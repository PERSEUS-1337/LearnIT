FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The General Accounting Office has estimated that \n        between 130,000 and 425,000 abandoned industrial sites will \n        need cleanup action to become economically viable once again.\n            (2) The cleanup costs to remediate these ``brownfield'' \n        sites to productive use could reach hundreds of billions of \n        dollars.\n            (3) ``Brownfields'' remediation is the number one economic \n        priority in many American cities.\n            (4) Encouraging private investment for these remediation \n        efforts presents an opportunity to create jobs and promote \n        economic development in localities and the States.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a program \nunder which the Federal Government, in cooperation with appropriate \nState and local entities, shall remediate ``brownfields'' in order to \nreturn them to productive use while conserving prime open space, or \n``greenfields''.\n\nSEC. 3. FOR EPA CERTIFICATION OF STATE BROWNFIELD PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Certification.--The Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n``Administrator'') shall certify any State brownfield program submitted \nto the Administrator under this Act that satisfies the criteria of \nsection 4. Certification of State programs shall be granted only for \nprograms which have jurisdiction over brownfield sites which have been \ncontaminated prior to enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Review.--The Administrator shall review certified State \nbrownfield programs every 2 years after certification to assure \ncompliance with certification criteria, and to provide to the States, \nwhere appropriate, technical assistance and expertise.\n\nSEC. 4.

LANDOWNER LIABILITY.\n\n    In the case of any brownfield site remediation carried out pursuant \nto a State program certified under this Act, upon completion of \nremediation pursuant to such program and release from State liability \nunder any applicable State provisions regarding liability for \ncontaminated sites, the Administrator shall release the owner of the \nbrownfield site or the facility operator at such site, or both, from \nliability under sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental \nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 for the contamination \ndescribed in the site assessment and evaluation carried out under the \nState program at the site concerned.\n\nSEC. 6.
