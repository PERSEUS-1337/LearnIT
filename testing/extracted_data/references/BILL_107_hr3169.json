FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \n        between 7 percent and 10 percent of the world's population, or \n        almost 500,000,000 people, live with disabilities. About 80 \n        percent of these individuals live in developing countries, \n        where only 1 percent to 2 percent have access to the necessary \n        rehabilitation services, and many face numerous physical and \n        social barriers that inhibit their full participation in their \n        communities.\n            (2) Factors contributing to the number of individuals with \n        disabilities include war and other forms of violence, \n        inadequate medical care, and natural and other disasters.\n            (3)(A) According to the International Committee of the Red \n        Cross, there are tens of millions of landmines in over 60 \n        countries around the world, and it has estimated that as many \n        as 24,000 people are maimed or killed each year by landmines, \n        mostly civilians, resulting in amputations and disabilities of \n        various kinds.\n            (B) While the United States Government invests more than \n        $100,000,000 in mine action programs annually, including \n        funding for mine awareness and demining training programs, only \n        about ten percent of these funds go to directly aid landmine \n        victims.\n            (C) The Patrick Leahy War Victims Fund, administered by the \n        United States Agency for International Development, has \n        provided essential prosthetics and rehabilitation for landmine \n        and other war victims in developing countries who are disabled \n        and has provided long-term sustainable improvements in quality \n        of life for victims of civil strife and warfare, addressing \n        such issues as barrier-free accessibility, reduction of social \n        stigmatization, and increasing economic opportunities.\n            (D) Enhanced coordination is needed among Federal agencies \n        that carry out assistance programs in foreign countries for \n        victims of landmines and other victims of civil strife and \n        warfare to make better use of interagency expertise and \n        resources.\n            (4) According to a review of Poverty and Disability \n        commissioned by the World Bank, ``disabled people have lower \n        education and income levels than the rest of the population. \n        They are more likely to have incomes below poverty level than \n        the non-disabled population, and they are less likely to have \n        savings and other assets . . . [t]he links between poverty and \n        disability go two ways--not only does disability add to the \n        risk of poverty, but conditions of poverty add to the risk of \n        disability.''.\n            (5) Numerous international human rights conventions and \n        declarations recognize the need to protect the rights of \n        individuals regardless of their status, including those \n        individuals with disabilities, through the principles of \n        equality and non-discrimination.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize assistance \nfor individuals with disabilities, including victims of landmines and \nother victims of civil strife and warfare.\n\nSEC. 3.
