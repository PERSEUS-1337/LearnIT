FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Hepatitis C is a blood-borne pathogen that is a major \n        cause of chronic liver disease. According to the American Liver \n        Foundation, approximately 1.8 percent of the general population \n        is infected with the disease.\n            (2) There is no known cure for hepatitis C.\n            (3) Emergency response employees and volunteers of units of \n        local government (such as firefighters, paramedics, and \n        emergency medical technicians) are at high risk of contracting \n        the disease due to the unique nature of their jobs.\n            (4) The only emergency response organization that has a \n        comprehensive program to test all of its members for hepatitis \n        C is Local 22 of the International Association of Fire \n        Fighters, representing the firefighters of the City of \n        Philadelphia.\n            (5) According to these tests, 130 of 2,100 firefighters \n        tested positive for the disease, which is approximately 6 \n        percent of those tested.\n            (6) The City of Philadelphia recently made a decision to \n        commit $3,000,000 each year to provide treatment for 200 \n        employees infected with the disease. Philadelphia is the only \n        major city to devote such resources to the epidemic of \n        hepatitis C among emergency response employees.\n            (7) The Federal government should provide for a study to \n        determine the prevalence of hepatitis C among firefighters, \n        paramedics, and emergency medical technicians who are employees \n        or volunteers of units of local government, and should provide \n        for demonstration projects to provide training, testing, and \n        treatment regarding cases of the disease among such employees \n        and volunteers.\n\nSEC. 3.
