FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Fentanyl is a dangerous, synthetic opioid that's 50 to \n        100 times more potent than heroin and morphine and lethal in \n        doses as small as approximately 2 milligrams. Current \n        sentencing enhancements do not reflect the danger fentanyl \n        poses at lower quantities compared to other illicit substances.\n            (2) Because a lethal dose of fentanyl can be accidentally \n        inhaled or absorbed through the skin, it's not just deadly to \n        its users, but it also threatens the lives of law enforcement \n        and customs officials, public health workers, first responders \n        and postal workers who risk unknowingly coming into contact \n        with fentanyl in its different forms.\n            (3) From 2013 to 2014, the number of drug seizures by law \n        enforcement that tested positive for fentanyl increased by 426 \n        percent and synthetic opioid-related deaths increased by 79 \n        percent, with over 700 overdose deaths related to fentanyl. \n        However, due to variations in States' medical examiner and \n        coroner testing and reporting techniques, and deaths attributed \n        to heroin, this figure is believed to be significantly higher.\n            (4) Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, pill press machines, \n        and other supplies needed to manufacture counterfeit pills \n        containing fentanyl are primarily sourced from China and widely \n        available for purchase on the Internet. Traffickers can \n        typically purchase a kilogram of fentanyl powder for as little \n        as $2,000 from a Chinese supplier, transform it into hundreds \n        of thousands of pills, and sell the counterfeit pills for \n        millions of dollars in profit.\n            (5) In 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued \n        nationwide alerts identifying fentanyl as a threat to public \n        health and safety and stating that the rise of counterfeit \n        pills that contain fentanyl in the illicit drug market will \n        likely result in more opioid-dependent individuals, overdoses, \n        and deaths.\n            (6) The DEA has identified two key challenges for using the \n        Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (21 \n        U.S.C. 801 note) to prosecute individuals for violations \n        relating to fentanyl:\n                    (A) The law requires that the substance have a \n                substantially similar chemical structure to a \n                controlled substance in order to be considered an \n                analogue, yet the threshold for ``substantially \n                similar'' has been cited by numerous courts as \n                difficult to apply.\n                    (B) Each case requires additional investigation to \n                determine whether the substance in question was \n                ``intended for human consumption'' and can therefore be \n                considered an analogue.\n            (7) Illicit fentanyl manufacturers are continuously \n        manipulating the chemical structures of the analogues in order \n        to stay ahead of researchers and law enforcement, thus making \n        prosecuting these crimes overly onerous. Furthermore, the speed \n        at which these alterations can be made outpace the current \n        authorities of the Department of Justice to schedule new \n        compounds and analogues under the Controlled Substances Act (21 \n        U.S.C. 801 et seq.).\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n            (1) the trafficking in fentanyl and other synthetic opioids \n        represents a public health emergency in the United States and \n        requires a comprehensive legislative response;\n            (2) the United States Government should use all available \n        measures to reduce the availability of illicit fentanyl, its \n        chemical precursors, and the equipment by which fentanyl may be \n        milled into counterfeit prescription pills;\n            (3) the United States Government should make grants \n        available for State and local medical examiners and coroners to \n        screen for fentanyl in suspected opioid overdose cases in \n        regions reporting increases in fentanyl seizures, fentanyl-\n        related overdose fatalities, or unusually high spikes in heroin \n        or unspecified drug overdose fatalities;\n            (4) State and local law enforcement should, if safe and \n        possible, prioritize and expedite testing of drug samples taken \n        from drug overdose scenes and share the data on fentanyl drug \n        seizures with local health departments, coroners, and medical \n        examiners;\n            (5) grants made available to address the opioid epidemic \n        should be used to improve States' surveillance of fentanyl-\n        related deaths and to expand access to naloxone for first \n        responders, law enforcement, and health care personnel given \n        that multiple doses of naloxone must be administered per \n        overdose event; and\n            (6) the United States Government, including the Secretary \n        of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland \n        Security, and the Director of the Office of National Drug \n        Control Policy, should use the broad diplomatic and law \n        enforcement resources of the United States, in partnership with \n        the Governments of Mexico and China, to stop the trafficking of \n        illicit fentanyl into the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ANALOGUES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of section 102(32)(A) \nof the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(32)(A)) are amended by \nstriking ``substantially'' each place it appears.\n    (b) Rule of Construction.--Section 102(32)(A) of the Controlled \nSubstances Act (21 U.S.C. 82(32)(A)) shall not be construed to require \nthat a substance satisfy more than one of the clauses listed in such \nsection 102(32)(A) to meet the definition of a controlled substance \nanalogue.\n\nSEC. 4. TREATMENT OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ANALOGUES.\n\n    Section 203 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 813) is \namended by striking ``shall, to the extent intended for human \nconsumption, be treated, for the purposes of any Federal law as a \ncontrolled substance in schedule I'' and inserting ``shall, to the \nextent to which it should be reasonably known to the manufacturer, \ndistributor, or dispenser that the controlled substance analogue is \nintended for human consumption, be treated, with respect to such \nmanufacturer, distributor, or dispenser, respectively, for the purpose \nof any Federal law as a controlled substance in schedule I''.\n\nSEC. 5. ENHANCED PENALTIES.\n\n    (a) Controlled Substances Act Amendments.--The Controlled \nSubstances Act is amended--\n            (1) in section 401(b)(1) (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1))--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (A)(vi)--\n                            (i) by striking ``400 grams'' and inserting \n                        ``20 grams''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``100 grams'' and \n                        inserting ``5 grams''; and\n                    (B) in subparagraph (B)(vi)--\n                            (i) by striking ``40 grams'' and inserting \n                        ``2 grams''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``10 grams'' and inserting \n                        ``0.5 grams''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end of section 401(b) (21 U.S.C. \n        841(b)) the following:\n            ``(8) In the case of a violation of subsection (a), if the \n        mixture or substance contains a detectable amount of N-phenyl-\n        [1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide or any analogue \n        of N-phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide and \n        also contains a detectable amount of another controlled \n        substance, then a court shall--\n                    ``(A) not impose a term of probation;\n                    ``(B) in addition to the term of punishment for the \n                violation of this section, impose a term of \n                imprisonment not to exceed 5 years; and\n                    ``(C) no term of imprisonment imposed on a person \n                under subparagraph (B) shall run concurrently with any \n                term of imprisonment imposed on the person under any \n                other provision of law.\n            ``(9) In the case of a violation of subsection (a), if the \n        mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of N-\n        phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide or any \n        analogue of N-phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] \n        propanamide was represented to be or sold as another controlled \n        substance, then a court shall--\n                    ``(A) not impose a term of probation;\n                    ``(B) in addition to the term of punishment for the \n                violation of this section, impose a term of \n                imprisonment not to exceed 5 years; and\n                    ``(C) no term of imprisonment imposed on a person \n                under subparagraph (B) shall run concurrently with any \n                term of imprisonment imposed on the person under any \n                other provision of law.''.\n    (b) Controlled Substances Import and Export Act Amendments.--\nSection 1010(b) of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 \nU.S.C. 960(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(8) In the case of a violation of subsection (a), if the \n        mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of N-\n        phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide or any \n        analogue of N-phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] \n        propanamide also contains a detectable amount of another \n        controlled substance, then a court shall--\n                    ``(A) not impose a term of probation;\n                    ``(B) in addition to the term of punishment for the \n                violation of this section, impose a term of \n                imprisonment not to exceed 5 years; and\n                    ``(C) no term of imprisonment imposed on a person \n                under subparagraph (B) shall run concurrently with any \n                term of imprisonment imposed on the person under any \n                other provision of law.\n            ``(9) In the case of a violation of subsection (a), if the \n        mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of N-\n        phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propanamide or any \n        analogue of N-phenyl-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] \n        propanamide was represented to be or sold as another controlled \n        substance, then a court shall--\n                    ``(A) not impose a term of probation;\n                    ``(B) in addition to the term of punishment for the \n                violation of this section, impose a term of \n                imprisonment not to exceed 5 years; and\n                    ``(C) no term of imprisonment imposed on a person \n                under subparagraph (B) shall run concurrently with any \n                term of imprisonment imposed on the person under any \n                other provision of law.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
