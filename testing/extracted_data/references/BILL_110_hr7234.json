FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Environmental Protection Agency's Office of \n        Research and Development met a pressing national need when it \n        created the Integrated Risk Information System in 1985 to \n        disseminate scientific information on the toxicity of \n        chemicals.\n            (2) The Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) is the \n        Nation's premier database for scientific information on the \n        toxicity of chemicals.\n            (3) Researchers, government officials, public health \n        experts, and members of the public all rely on IRIS for \n        information about health risks associated with exposure to \n        chemicals with some 9 million inquiries of the database each \n        year.\n            (4) IRIS provides important scientific information that \n        supports the development of risk assessments of chemicals.\n            (5) An estimated 700 new chemicals enter the marketplace in \n        the United States each year, presenting a constant challenge to \n        keep the IRIS database up-to-date.\n            (6) The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research \n        and Development's efforts to enter new scientific information \n        about the toxicity of chemicals into the IRIS database has \n        ground to a halt in recent years due to an overly burdensome \n        review process.\n            (7) The burdensome new review process has slowed new \n        entries to the IRIS database to an average of just 2 per year.\n            (8) The Nation needs more, and more timely, scientific \n        assessments of chemicals to guide further research and to \n        inform decisions.\n            (9) The development and review of chemical assessments for \n        inclusion in the IRIS database must be a science-based process \n        managed by the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of \n        Research and Development, and this Office must move more \n        expeditiously to produce assessments without interference by \n        other Federal offices.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``Assistant Administrator'' means the \nAssistant Administrator for the Office of Research and Development of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSEC. 4. RESEARCH AND ASSESSMENT.\n\n    (a) Database.--The Assistant Administrator shall maintain a \npublicly accessible database of scientific information on the toxicity \nof chemicals, including--\n            (1) hazard identification;\n            (2) dose response assessments;\n            (3) reference doses; and\n            (4) any other information that would facilitate the \n        development of risk assessments.\n    (b) Final Assessments.--The Assistant Administrator shall publish \nfinal assessments for at least 15 new chemicals per year and shall \npublish at least 5 updates to existing assessments per year.\n    (c) Nominations for Toxicity Assessments.--The Assistant \nAdministrator shall solicit nominations for chemical assessments from \nEnvironmental Protection Agency program offices, other Federal \nagencies, State, local, and tribal governments, and the public.\n    (d) List.--The Assistant Administrator shall issue a list of \nchemicals proposed for assessment 2 years prior to the initiation of a \nchemical's assessment. A chemical assessment shall be completed and \nmade available on the database maintained under subsection (a) within 4 \nyears after its appearance on a list under this subsection. Such list \nshall not be subject to review or approval by any other Federal agency \nor official.\n\nSEC. 5. ASSESSMENT REVIEW.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Assistant Administrator shall determine the \ninformation to be used to assess a chemical and shall establish a \nprocess for reviewing a chemical assessment prior to its inclusion on \nthe database maintained under section 4(a). The process shall include \nthe following:\n            (1) Opportunity for public comment by the stakeholder \n        community, including other Federal agencies that will use the \n        database.\n            (2) Opportunity for internal deliberation and review in \n        cooperation with other Federal agencies with statutory \n        responsibilities over public health or whose primary mission is \n        to conduct or support research in the areas of public health or \n        environmental protection.\n            (3) Peer review of the chemical assessment by independent \n        scientists prior to its publication in the database.\n    (b) Exclusions.--In establishing the process in subsection (a), the \nAssistant Administrator shall ensure that--\n            (1) Federal agencies with a real or perceived conflict of \n        interest shall not participate in the development or internal \n        review of chemical assessments; and\n            (2) the Assistant Administrator shall develop and review \n        chemical assessments without review by the President and shall \n        publish final assessments without prior review by the President \n        or any other Federal agency or official.\n\nSEC. 6. INAPPLICABILITY OF BULLETINS.\n\n    The preparation and review of chemical assessments shall not be \nsubject to the provisions of Bulletin No. 07-02, Final Bulletin for \nAgency Good Guidance Practices and the Final Information Quality \nBulletin for Peer Review of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nSEC. 7. BACKLOG OF CHEMICAL ASSESSMENTS.\n\n    For chemical assessments that have been in development for IRIS \nentries prior to the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant \nAdministrator shall finalize and publish those entries within 6 months \nafter the date of enactment of this Act."
