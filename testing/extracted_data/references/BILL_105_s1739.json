DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act, the term--\n            (1) ``TIMSS'' means the Third International Mathematics and \n        Science Study; and\n            (2) ``Commission'' means the National Commission on Science \n        and Mathematics Leadership established by section 4.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) students in the United States should be preeminent \n        among the nations of the world in science and mathematics \n        achievement by the year 2000;\n            (2) TIMSS, the largest international study ever undertaken \n        of how students perform in science and mathematics, \n        demonstrated that mathematics skills of American students \n        (including the top 10 percent of students in the United States) \n        lags behind the work of students in many other nations;\n            (3) research shows that the problems of students in the \n        United States in science and mathematics stem from the lack of \n        a unified effort to define and implement a process that will \n        assure national leadership;\n            (4) research shows that the poor performance of students in \n        the United States in science and mathematics also stem from the \n        lack of assessment instruments for curriculum and the lack of a \n        sufficient commitment by colleges and universities in the \n        United States to provide high quality teacher preparation and \n        professional development programs;\n            (5) there are core problems with the courses of study and \n        the teaching styles upon which many schools in the United \n        States rely for instruction in science and mathematics;\n            (6) the National Science Foundation has concluded that \n        schools in the United States teach mathematics concepts in ways \n        that are superficial and, ultimately, ineffective;\n            (7) a coherent framework for mathematics and science must \n        be developed to give balanced attention to basic skills, \n        conceptual understanding, problem solving, reasoning, \n        communication skills, and appropriate use of technology;\n            (8) because of the failure of existing teaching methods in \n        science and mathematics in the United States, a systematic \n        retraining of teachers and an increased emphasis on their \n        professional development is required; and\n            (9) teachers of math and science should be well-trained \n        professionals who combine sound knowledge of subject matter \n        with the necessary skills and a solid understanding of student \nlearning and assessment.\n\nSEC. 4. COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be known \nas the ``National Commission for Science and Mathematics Leadership''.\n    (b) Membership.--The Commission shall be composed of 12 members, of \nwhom--\n            (1) 4 shall be appointed by the President;\n            (2) 4 shall be appointed jointly by the Speaker and the \n        Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, \n        after consultation with the Committee on Science of the House; \n        and\n            (3) 4 shall be appointed jointly by the Majority Leader and \n        the Minority Leader of the United States Senate, after \n        consultation with the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n        Transportation and the Committee on Labor of the Senate.\n    (c) Chairman.--The Commission shall elect one of its members to \nserve as chairman.\n    (d) Quorum.--A quorum for the purpose of conducting meetings of the \nCommission is 7.\n    (e) Compensation; Per Diem.--Members of the Commission shall serve \nwithout pay. While away from their homes or regular places of business \nin the performance of their duties as members of the Commission, \nmembers shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of \nsubsistence, in the same manner as persons employed intermittently in \ngovernment service under section 5703 of title 5, United States Code.\n    (f) Meetings.--The Commission shall meet at such times and such \nplaces, and hold such hearings, as it considers appropriate.\n    (g) National Science Foundation.--The National Science Foundation \nshall--\n            (1) pay the expenses of the Commission, but not in excess \n        of $500,000; and\n            (2) provide administrative support for the Commission.\n    (h) Termination.--The Commission shall terminate after submitting \nits report to the Congress under section 6.\n\nSEC. 5. PURPOSE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of the Commission is to review and \npropose recommendations for assuring leadership in science and \nmathematics training in the United States by the year 2000 in \ncooperation with the National Academy of the Sciences by--\n            (1) reviewing existing research based on mathematics and \n        science education leadership, including the TIMSS findings; and\n            (2) converting the research findings into specific \n        recommendations for implementation by public and private \n        agencies.\n    (b) Functions.--The Commission shall--\n            (1) review the status of science and mathematics training \n        in the United States as compared to the status of science and \n        mathematics education relative to international competitors;\n            (2) review the TIMSS findings and other major research \n        projects and formulate an implementation proposal, including \n        specific recommendations which are reviewed by appropriate \n        public and private agencies, to use the information in those \n        findings and projects to build leadership in science and \n        mathematics in the United States;\n            (3) propose professional development priorities based upon \n        available research to strengthen the teaching of science and \n        mathematics at all educational levels; and\n            (4) coordinate its activities with the National Academy of \n        Sciences.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORT.\n\n    The Commission shall issue a report to the United States Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Committee on \nLabor, and the United States House of Representatives Committee on \nScience no later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act."
