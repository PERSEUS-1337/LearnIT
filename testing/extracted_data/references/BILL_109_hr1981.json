FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Adult day care offers services, including medical care, \n        rehabilitation therapies, dignified assistance with activities \n        of daily living, nutrition therapy, health monitoring, social \n        interaction, stimulating activities, and transportation, to \n        seniors who are frail, physically challenged, or cognitively \n        impaired at no extra cost to the medicare program.\n            (2) The care given at adult day care centers provides \n        seniors and their familial caregivers support that is critical \n        to keeping the senior in the family home.\n            (3) One quarter of all workers provide some form of elder \n        care for those age 65 and older, and by 2007, the number of \n        households involved in caregiving to persons age 50 or older \n        could reach 39 million.\n            (4) The pool of potential family caregivers, who are \n        primarily women and who provide an estimated $257,000,000,000 \n        in ``free'' services annually, is dwindling, from 11 potential \n        caregivers for each person needing care today to a projected 4 \n        to 1 ratio in 2050.\n            (5) Caregiving families tend to have lower incomes than \n        non-caregiving families, and the average caregiver loses \n        $659,139 in wages, pension benefits, and Social Security \n        benefits over a lifetime.\n            (6) The loss in productivity in United States businesses \n        attributable to caregivers for aging or ailing seniors ranges \n        from $11,000,000,000 to $29,000,000,000 annually.\n            (7) Adult day care centers, located in every State in the \n        United States and the District of Columbia, serve as quality \n        health options to treat our Nation's elderly population, which \n        is about to dramatically increase with the aging of the baby \n        boomer generation.\n\nSEC. 3.
