RESEARCH PROGRAM TO IMPROVE AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS.\n\n    The Federal Aviation Administration Administrator shall continue \nthe program to consider awards to nonprofit concrete and asphalt \npavement research foundations to improve the design, construction, \nrehabilitation, and repair of concrete and asphalt airfield pavements \nto aid in the development of safer, more cost-effective, and more \ndurable airfield pavements. The Administrator may use grants or \ncooperative agreements in carrying out this section. Nothing in this \nsection requires the Administrator to prioritize an airfield pavement \nresearch program above safety, security, Flight 21, environment, or \nenergy research programs.\n\nSEC. 5. ENSURING APPROPRIATE STANDARDS FOR AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Federal Aviation Administration Administrator \nshall review and determine whether the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's standards used to determine the appropriate thickness \nfor asphalt and concrete airfield pavements are in accordance with the \nFederal Aviation Administration's standard 20-year-life requirement \nusing the most up-to-date available information on the life of airfield \npavements. If the Administrator determines that such standards are not \nin accordance with that requirement, the Administrator shall make \nappropriate adjustments to the Federal Aviation Administration's \nstandards for airfield pavements.\n    (b) Report.--Within 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Administrator shall report the results of the review conducted \nunder subsection (a) and the adjustments, if any, made on the basis of \nthat review to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, the House of Representatives Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, and the House of Representatives \nCommittee on Science.\n\nSEC. 6. AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) Objective.--The Federal Aviation Administration Administrator, \nin coordination with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nAdministrator, shall participate in a national initiative with the \nobjective of defining and developing an air traffic management system \ndesigned to meet national long-term aviation security, safety, and \ncapacity needs.
