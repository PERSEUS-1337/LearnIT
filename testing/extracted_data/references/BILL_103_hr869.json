FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The elements of biological diversity offer many actual \n        and yet-to-be-discovered medical, biotechnological, \n        agricultural, and industrial uses.\n            (2) Tropical forests, which contain 50 to 90 percent of the \n        species estimated to exist on the earth, are being cleared at \n        the approximate rate of 17,000,000 hectares per year.\n            (3) At the rate that tropical forests are disappearing, \n        scientists estimate conservatively that 5 to 10 percent of \n        tropical forest species could disappear within the next 30 \n        years.\n            (4) Poverty and limited economic opportunity in Latin \n        America and the Caribbean and other areas of the developing \n        world contribute significantly to the loss of tropical forests \n        and other areas important for biodiversity conservation.\n            (5) Cooperation between United States institutions \n        interested in the potential applications of biological \n        resources of tropical forests and other areas rich in \n        biodiversity, and governments and nonprofit organizations in \n        Latin America and the Caribbean interested in preserving \n        biological diversity and enhancing its economic value, can \n        effectively serve the interests of both conservation and \n        economic growth.\n            (6) Maintaining access to a continuing and reliable supply \n        of biological resources will enhance United States \n        competitiveness.\n            (7) The Convention on Biological Diversity is consistent \n        with the protection of intellectual property rights and with \n        resource exchange agreements.\n            (8) As was made evident through the United Nations \n        Conference on Environment and Development, there is \n        international recognition of the important link between the \n        protection of the environment and biodiversity and economic \n        growth.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to encourage the conservation of biological resources \n        and the sustainable use of tropical forests in Latin America \n        and the Caribbean, and to secure a continuing and reliable \n        supply of biological resources for United States companies, \n        research institutes, botanical laboratories, universities, and \n        other institutions interested in the potential uses and \n        benefits of such resources, by--\n                    (A) assisting the countries of Latin America and \n                the Caribbean to establish and strengthen biodiversity \n                management organizations;\n                    (B) creating incentives for resource-sharing \n                entities to enter into resource exchange agreements \n                with biodiversity management organizations;\n                    (C) ensuring that such agreements provide for \n                conservation of biological diversity and for technology \n                transfer and training related to the purposes set forth \n                in the agreements; and\n                    (D) ensuring increased understanding of what \n                constitutes properly protected intellectual property \n                rights and fair and equitable distribution of any \n                benefits arising from the commercial or other use of \n                products developed under such agreements; and\n            (2) to provide for a study of the feasibility of \n        establishing a Western Hemisphere Environmental Partnership to \n        promote hemispheric technological cooperation on environmental \n        problems.\n\nSEC. 4. WESTERN HEMISPHERE BIODIVERSITY COOPERATION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Administrator of the Agency for \nInternational Development shall establish within the Agency a Western \nHemisphere Biodiversity Cooperation Program to assist in the \nestablishment and strengthening of biodiversity management \norganizations.\n    (b) Uses of Assistance.--Assistance under the program described in \nsubsection (a) shall be used to establish biodiversity management \norganizations and strengthen the ability of such organizations to study \nand protect biological diversity and to enhance the economic value of \nthe biological resources of Latin America and the Caribbean, including \nassistance for--\n            (1) cataloging and studying biological resources;\n            (2) preparing data bases of biological resources to be used \n        for monitoring the status and distribution of such resources \n        and for commercial purposes;\n            (3) creating the institutional capacity for biodiversity \n        management organizations to negotiate, enter into, and \n        implement resource exchange agreements with resource-sharing \n        entities through training in areas such as research, contract \n        law and negotiation, quality control, and management;\n            (4) advising the governments in countries in which \n        biodiversity management organizations operate on legislation \n        and policies that will conserve biological diversity and \n        encourage sustainable economic development;\n            (5) facilitating cooperation and exchange of information \n        among such organizations;\n            (6) developing and studying the uses of biological samples \n        from tropical forests and other areas rich in biodiversity that \n        may provide sustainable economic opportunities for communities \n        located in or near such forests and areas; and\n            (7) facilitating cooperation and close consultation with \n        indigenous peoples in the geographic areas in which \n        biodiversity management organizations operate.\n    (c) Debt Exchanges.--Assistance under this section shall include, \nwhere appropriate, assistance to biodiversity management organizations \nfor the purchase on the open market of discounted commercial debt of \nthe governments of the countries in which such organizations operate, \npursuant to the section 462 entitled ``Assistance for Commercial Debt \nExchanges'', of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2282), in \norder to provide such organizations with a steady income for \naccomplishing the purposes of this section.\n    (d) Consultation.--In administering the program described in \nsubsection (a), the Administrator shall consult with and use the \nexpertise of appropriate United States Government agencies and \nnongovernmental conservation organizations in the United States, Latin \nAmerica, and the Caribbean.\n    (e) Collaboration With National Governments.--The Administrator \nshall, in carrying out the program described in subsection (a), \nencourage and seek to facilitate close collaboration between \nbiodiversity management organizations and the governments of the \ncountries in which the organizations operate.\n\nSEC. 5.
