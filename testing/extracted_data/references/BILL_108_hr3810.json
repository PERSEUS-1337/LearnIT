FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Every minute, 1 woman dies from pregnancy-related \n        complications. 95 percent of these women live in Africa and \n        Asia.\n            (2) For every woman who dies from pregnancy-related \n        complications, 15 to 30 women survive but experience chronic \n        disabilities. The worst is obstetric fistula which is caused \n        when a woman who needs trained medical assistance for a safe \n        delivery, including Caesarian section, cannot get it.\n            (3) Obstetric fistula is a hole that is formed between the \n        bladder and the vagina, or the rectum and the vagina, after a \n        woman suffers from prolonged obstructed labor. In the struggle \n        to pass through the birth canal, the fetus puts constant \n        pressure, sometimes for several days, on the bladder and \n        vaginal or rectal wall, destroying the tissue and leaving a \n        wound.\n            (4) According to the Department of State: ``Pregnancy at an \n        early age often leads to obstetric fistulae and permanent \n        incontinence. [In Ethiopia], treatment is available at only 1 \n        hospital in Addis Ababa that performs over 1,000 fistula \n        operations a year. It estimates that for every successful \n        operation performed, 10 other young women need the treatment. \n        The maternal mortality rate is extremely high due, in part, to \n        food taboos for pregnant women, poverty, early marriage, and \n        birth complications related to FGM [Female Genital Mutilation], \n        especially infibulation.''.\n            (5) Obstetric fistula affects women who survive obstructed \n        labor.\n            (6) In nearly every case of obstetric fistula, the baby \n        will be stillborn and the mother will have physical pain as \n        well as social and emotional trauma from the loss of her child.\n            (7) The physical symptoms of obstetric fistula include \n        incontinence or constant uncontrollable leaking of urine or \n        feces, frequent bladder infections, infertility, and foul odor.\n            (8) The social consequences for women with obstetric \n        fistula include isolation and lack of opportunity, divorce or \n        abandonment, ridicule and shame, inability to start a family, \n        illness, and risk of violence.\n            (9) Although data on obstetric fistula are scarce, the \n        World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there are more than \n        2,000,000 women living with fistula and 50,000 to 100,000 new \n        cases each year.\n            (10) Obstetric fistula was once common throughout the \n        world, but over the last century has been eradicated in Europe, \n        North America, and other developed regions through improved \n        medical care.\n            (11) Obstetric fistula is fully preventable by having a \n        trained medical attendant present during labor and childbirth, \n        delaying early marriage and childbirth, and gaining access to \n        family planning.\n            (12) Obstetric fistula can also be surgically repaired. \n        Surgery requires a specially trained surgeon and support staff, \n        access to an operating theater and to attentive post-operative \n        care. Success rates for surgical repair of fistula are close to \n        90 percent and cost between $100 and $400.\n            (13) In 2003, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) \n        launched a global campaign to identify and address the \n        incidence of obstetric fistula in Africa and Asia in an effort \n        to develop a means to repair those who are suffering and \n        provide the necessary health services to prevent further cases. \n        The campaign currently supports 20 countries in Africa and Asia \n        and provides surgery to women, trains doctors and nurses, \n        equips hospitals, and undertakes community outreach to prevent \n        further cases.\n            (14) The United States Government provided a voluntary \n        contribution of $21,500,000 to UNFPA for fiscal year 2001 and \n        the Administration's budget request for fiscal year 2002 \n        allocated $25,000,000 for UNFPA.\n            (15) The UNFPA is working in 89 countries to reduce \n        maternal death and disability, including obstetric fistula, \n        through preventive, curative, and rehabilitative methods.\n            (16) In the winter of 2001, the Secretary of State \n        submitted written testimony to the Committee on Foreign \n        Relations of the Senate expressing support for the invaluable \n        work of the UNFPA and for securing funding for the \n        organization.\n            (17) The United States Government, as part of its efforts \n        to improve the dire health conditions of Afghan women, pledged \n        in October 2001 an additional $600,000 to the UNFPA to address \n        the reproductive health care needs of Afghan refugees in \n        surrounding nations and of internally displaced persons within \n        Afghanistan.\n            (18) Congress demonstrated its strong bipartisan support \n        for a voluntary United States contribution to the UNFPA of up \n        to $34,000,000 in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n        Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2002, which was passed by \n        the House of Representatives on a vote of 357 to 66 and by the \n        Senate by unanimous consent and signed into law (Public Law \n        107-115) by the President on January 10, 2002. However, the \n        President decided not to obligate the funds.\n            (19) In May 2002, the President sent a 3-person delegation \n        to investigate UNFPA programs in China and allegations that the \n        agency was involved in coercive abortion practices.\n            (20) This independent delegation concluded that such \n        allegations were untrue.\n            (21) On May 29, 2002, the delegation sent a letter to the \n        Secretary of State stating the following: ``First Finding: We \n        find no evidence that UNFPA has knowingly supported or \n        participated in the management of a program of coercive \n        abortion or involuntary sterilization in the PRC. First \n        Recommendation: We therefore recommend that not more than \n        $34,000,000 which has already been appropriated be released to \n        UNFPA.''.\n            (22) Regrettably, the Administration overruled the \n        recommendation of its own delegation and invoked an overly \n        broad interpretation of the law in order to eliminate funding \n        for UNFPA.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNITED NATIONS \n              POPULATION FUND.\n\n    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in addition to amounts \notherwise available to carry out the purposes of chapter 3 of part 1 of \nthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, there are authorized to be \nappropriated $34,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and each subsequent \nfiscal year to be available only for United States voluntary \ncontributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) only for \nprevention, remedy, and repair of obstetric fistula."
