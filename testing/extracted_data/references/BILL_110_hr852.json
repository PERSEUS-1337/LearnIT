FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) customer telephone records may be accessed without \n        authorization of the customer by--\n                    (A) an employee of the telephone company selling \n                the data;\n                    (B) ``pretexting'', whereby a data broker or other \n                person pretends to be the owner of the phone and \n                convinces the telephone company's employees to release \n                the data to them; or\n                    (C) unauthorized access of accounts via the \n                Internet; and\n            (2) because telephone companies encourage customers to \n        manage their accounts online, many set up the online capability \n        in advance. Many customers never access their Internet \n        accounts, however. If someone seeking the information activates \n        the account before the customer, he or she can gain unfettered \n        access to the telephone records and call logs of that customer.\n\nSEC. 3. UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES IN CONNECTION WITH \n              OBTAINING CONFIDENTIAL PHONE RECORDS INFORMATION OF A \n              COVERED ENTITY.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Obtaining Confidential Phone Records Information \nUnder False Pretenses.--It shall be unlawful for any person in \ninterstate or foreign commerce to knowingly and intentionally obtain, \nor attempt to obtain, confidential phone records information of a \ncovered entity, by--\n            (1) making false or fraudulent statements or \n        representations to an employee of a covered entity;\n            (2) making such false or fraudulent statements or \n        representations to a customer of a covered entity;\n            (3) providing a document to a covered entity knowing that \n        such document is false or fraudulent; or\n            (4) accessing customer accounts of a covered entity via the \n        Internet, or by means of conduct that violates section 1030 of \n        this title, without prior authorization from the customer to \n        whom such confidential phone records information relates.\n    (b) Prohibition on Sale or Transfer of Confidential Phone Records \nInformation.--\n            (1) Except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, it \n        shall be unlawful for any person in interstate or foreign \n        commerce to knowingly and intentionally sell or transfer, or \n        attempt to sell or transfer, confidential phone records \n        information of a covered entity, without prior authorization \n        from the customer to whom such confidential phone records \n        information relates, or knowing or having reason to know such \n        information was obtained fraudulently.\n            (2) For purposes of this subsection, the exceptions \n        specified in section 222(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 \n        (47 U.S.C. 222(d)) shall apply for the use of confidential \n        phone records information by any covered entity, as defined in \n        section 7.\n    (c) Prohibition on Purchase or Receipt of Confidential Phone \nRecords Information.--\n            (1) Except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, it \n        shall be unlawful for any person in interstate or foreign \n        commerce to knowingly and intentionally purchase or receive, or \n        attempt to purchase or receive, confidential phone records \n        information of a covered entity, without prior authorization \n        from the customer to whom such confidential phone records \n        information relates, or knowing or having reason to know such \n        information was obtained fraudulently.\n            (2) For purposes of this subsection, the exceptions \n        specified in section 222(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 \n        (47 U.S.C. 222(d)) shall apply for the use of confidential \n        phone records information by any covered entity, as defined in \n        section 7.\n\nSEC. 4. NONAPPLICABILITY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.\n\n    Section 3 shall not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, \nprotective, or intelligence activity of a law enforcement agency of the \nUnited States, a State, or political subdivision of a State, or of an \nintelligence agency of the United States.\n\nSEC. 5.

ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.\n\n    A violation of section 3 shall be treated as an unfair or deceptive \nact or practice in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade \nCommission Act (15 U.S.C. 45). All of the functions and powers of the \nFederal Trade Commission under that Act are available to the Commission \nto enforce compliance by any person with such section, irrespective of \nwhether that person is engaged in commerce or meets any other \njurisdictional tests in the Federal Trade Commission Act, including the \npower to enforce the provisions of such section in the same manner as \nif the violation had been a violation of a Federal Trade Commission \ntrade regulation rule.\n\nSEC. 7.
