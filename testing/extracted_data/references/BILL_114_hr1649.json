FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tunnels have been used for centuries around the world \n        as a means of avoiding detection or circumventing defenses.\n            (2) Tunnels can be used for criminal purposes, such as \n        smuggling drugs, weapons, or humans, or for terrorist or \n        military purposes, such as launching surprise attacks or \n        detonating explosives underneath infrastructure.\n            (3) Tunnels have been a growing threat on the southern \n        border of the United States for many years, and the Department \n        of Homeland Security has been working to address this threat.\n            (4) The conflict in Gaza in 2014 showed that terrorists are \n        now actively using tunnels as a means of attack, and news \n        reports indicate that tunnels are being used in Syria as well.\n            (5) Terrorist organizations are quick to adopt successful \n        tactics, and it is only a matter of time before other terrorist \n        organizations begin using tunnels.\n            (6) The facilities of the United States, and those of the \n        allies of the United States, could be under threat very quickly \n        if tunnel threats continue to proliferate.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) it is in the best interests of the United States to \n        develop technology to detect and counter tunnels, and the best \n        way to do this is to partner with other affected countries; and\n            (2) Israel is facing serious threats posed by tunnels and \n        should be the first partner of the United States in addressing \n        this significant challenge.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF TUNNEL DETECTION TECHNOLOGY.\n\n    (a) Partnerships.--\n            (1) Israel.--The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with \n        the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, \n        shall seek to enter into an agreement with Israel to partner \n        and coordinate in developing and deploying technologies to \n        detect and counter tunnels, including by--\n                    (A) carrying out research, development, testing, \n                and evaluation activities with respect to tunnel \n                detection technologies; and\n                    (B) carrying out operational testing of such \n                technologies in both the United States and Israel.\n            (2) Other allies.--In addition to the agreement described \n        in paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense, in coordination \n        with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland \n        Security, may seek to enter into similar agreements with allies \n        of the United States to develop technologies to detect and \n        counter tunnels.\n    (b) Lead Development Agency.--The Secretary of Defense, in \ncoordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall designate a \nmilitary department or other element of the Department of Defense to \ncarry out subsection (a) as the lead agency of the Federal Government \nfor developing technology to detect and counter tunnels.\n    (c) Lead Intelligence Officer.--The Director of National \nIntelligence shall designate a senior intelligence officer to manage \nthe collection and analysis of intelligence regarding the tactical use \nof tunnels by state and non-state actors.\n    (d) Annual Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and each year thereafter through 2020, the \nSecretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report containing, with \nrespect to the period covered by each such report, the following:\n            (1) Instances of tunnels being used to attack installations \n        of the United States or allies of the United States.\n            (2) Trends or developments in tunnel attacks throughout the \n        world.\n            (3) Key technologies used and challenges faced by potential \n        adversaries of the United States with respect to using tunnels.\n            (4) The capabilities of the Department of Defense for \n        defending fixed or forward locations from tunnel attacks.\n            (5) Partnerships entered into with allies of the United \n        States under this section, and potential opportunities for \n        increased partnerships with other allies with respect to \n        researching tunnel detection technologies.\n            (6) The plans, including with respect to funding, of the \n        Secretary for countering threats posed by tunnels.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to amounts \notherwise authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 2016, to carry \nout this section there is authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year \n2016--\n            (1) for research, development, test, and evaluation, Army, \n        for sensors and electronic survivability, $5,000,000;\n            (2) for research, development, test, and evaluation, \n        Defense-wide, for the physical security program of the \n        Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office, $8,000,000; and\n            (3) for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund, \n        $10,000,000."
