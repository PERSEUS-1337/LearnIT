    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThis act shall be known and may be cited as the California Israel Commerce Protection Act.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares as follows:\n(a) The United States and Israel have a unique bond based on their shared, enduring values, which are reflected in the virtues and principles of freedom and democracy, and have stood together as allies since Israel was first formed as a nation.\n(b) For years, California and Israel have established business partnerships and trade relations with each other, and those partnerships have helped enhance the agricultural, educational, energy, entertainment, health, medical, scientific, and water policies in California, Israel, and the United States.\n(c) On March 5, 2014, as the culmination of an effort started as Assembly Bill 1032 of the 2009\u201310 Regular Session, the Governor of California and the Prime Minister of Israel signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for strategic partnerships for joint innovation, exchanges, and cooperation between California and Israel.\n(d) In July 2015, the Legislature affirmed its support for the MOU by passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 25, noting that participants in the MOU had already expanded cooperation between Israel and California in areas such as alternative energy, agriculture, business innovation, and academia, and declaring that collaboration with Israel will foster peace and democracy in the Middle East.\n(e) Public retirement systems in this state currently invest on behalf of the citizens of California in publicly traded foreign companies that may be at risk due to ties with businesses that are publicly boycotting Israel.\n(f) Investments in publicly traded foreign companies that have business operations with a company that boycotts Israel risk the pensions of the dedicated public employees of this state.\n(g) Excluding and divesting from companies that boycott Israel and from portfolios that include those companies will help protect the public retirement systems in this state from investment losses related to these business activities and may improve the investment performance of the public retirement systems.\n(h) Israel is recognized around the world as the strongest democratically elected government in the Middle East and is an American ally, and that nation\u2019s democracy and relationship with the United States add to the security and strength of California.\n(i) It is unconscionable for this state to invest in companies that boycott Israel, as California has long standing social, political, and economic partnerships with the State of Israel.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 16649.80 of the Government Code is amended to
