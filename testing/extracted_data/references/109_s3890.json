    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Energy for America Act of \n2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) rising energy costs and uncertain long term energy \n        supplies threaten to undermine the growth of the United States \n        economy;\n            (2) since 2003, fuel and fertilizer costs have nearly \n        doubled for agricultural producers;\n            (3) there are continuing and increasing risks to the energy \n        security of the United States;\n            (4) having an affordable, reliable, and plentiful energy \n        supply will strengthen the United States economy and improve \n        domestic energy security;\n            (5) the agricultural sector can provide a significant \n        source of clean, sustainable energy for the United States that \n        can reduce the dependence of the United States on imported \n        energy and lower energy costs for all people of the United \n        States;\n            (6) agriculture-based energy--\n                    (A) boosts rural economic development;\n                    (B) increases farm-based income;\n                    (C) creates manufacturing, construction, and \n                service jobs;\n                    (D) expands economic opportunity for all people; \n                and\n                    (E) improves environmental quality;\n            (7) it is a goal of this Act to help the agricultural \n        sector to provide at least 25 percent of the energy consumed in \n        the United States by calendar year 2025;\n            (8) expanding agriculture-based renewable energy resources \n        (including wind, solar, and geothermal energy, ethanol, and \n        biodiesel) and improving energy efficiency will help to achieve \n        that goal;\n            (9) section 9006 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment \n        Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 8106) established the renewable energy \n        systems and energy efficiency improvements program, which is \n        the first agricultural program to catalyze broad renewable \n        energy and energy efficiency measures for the agricultural and \n        rural business sectors;\n            (10) since establishment, the program has been a strong \n        success, providing during the first 3 years of the program \n        nearly $64,000,000 in grants and loan guarantees for 412 \n        renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in 37 States, \n        which leveraged approximately $699,000,000 in additional \n        investments in farms and rural communities;\n            (11) projects assisted by the grants and loan guarantees \n        will--\n                    (A) produce or save more than 17,000,000,000,000 \n                British thermal units of energy each year in the form \n                of fuel, electricity, thermal energy, and energy \n                efficiency;\n                    (B) produce 124,000,000 gallons of ethanol and \n                biodiesel fuel annually; and\n                    (C) reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than \n                4,000,000 tons annually; and\n            (12) applications for assistance under the program--\n                    (A) in 2003, nearly matched the available funding \n                for the program;\n                    (B) in 2004, were nearly twice the available \n                funding for the program; and\n                    (C) in 2005 and 2006, were nearly triple the \n                available funding for the program.\n\nSEC. 3. RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA PROGRAM.\n\n    Section 9006 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 \n(7 U.S.C. 8106) is amended--\n            (1) by striking the section designation and heading and \n        inserting the following:\n\n``SEC. 9006.
