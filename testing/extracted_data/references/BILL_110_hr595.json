SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Stimulating \nLeadership in Limiting Expenditures (or `SLICE') Act of 2007''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Congressional Budget Office has projected that \n        unless current laws and policies are changed Federal \n        expenditures will exceed revenues during and after fiscal year \n        2007, which will require the Government to borrow funds to \n        offset these deficits;\n            (2) substantial Federal appropriations will continue to be \n        required for ongoing costs of national defense and homeland \n        security, as well as for other urgent purposes;\n            (3) rescinding previously-mandated spending on lower-\n        priority items would help reduce the extent to which such \n        necessary appropriations for urgent purposes would require \n        increases in the national debt that must be repaid, with \n        interest, in the future; and\n            (4) however, under current law, while the President can \n        propose rescinding such spending, the Congress is not required \n        to act on any such proposals by the President.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to enable the President to \nrequire Congress to debate and vote on certain presidential proposals \nfor reducing spending.\n\nSEC. 2. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN PROPOSED RESCISSIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part B of title X of the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 681 et seq.) is amended by \nredesignating sections 1013 through 1017 as sections 1014 through 1018, \nrespectively, and inserting after section 1012 the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 1013. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN PROPOSED RESCISSIONS.\n\n    ``(a) Proposed Rescission of Budget Authority.--In addition to the \nmethod of rescinding budget authority specified in section 1012, the \nPresident may propose, at the time and in the manner provided in \nsubsection (b), the rescission of any budget authority provided in an \nappropriation Act. Funds made available for obligation under this \nprocedure may not be proposed for rescission again under this section \nor section 1012.\n    ``(b) Transmittal of Special Message.--\n            ``(1) Not later than 3 calendar days after the date of \n        enactment of an appropriation Act, the President may transmit \n        to Congress one special message proposing to rescind amounts of \n        budget authority provided in that Act and include with that \n        special message a draft bill that, if enacted, would only \n        rescind that budget authority. That bill shall clearly identify \n        the amount of budget authority that is proposed to be rescinded \n        for each program, project, or activity to which that budget \n        authority relates.\n            ``(2) In the case of an appropriation Act that includes \n        accounts within the jurisdiction of more than one subcommittee \n        of the Committee on Appropriations, the President in proposing \n        to rescind budget authority under this section shall send a \n        separate special message and accompanying draft bill for \n        accounts within the jurisdiction of each such subcommittee.\n            ``(3) Each special message shall specify, with respect to \n        the budget authority proposed to be rescinded, the matters \n        referred to in paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 1012(a).\n    ``(c) Procedures for Expedited Consideration.--\n            ``(1)(A) Before the close of the second legislative day of \n        the House of Representatives after the date of receipt of a \n        special message transmitted to Congress under subsection (b), \n        the majority leader or minority leader of the House of \n        Representatives shall introduce (by request) the draft bill \n        accompanying that special message. If the bill is not \n        introduced as provided in the preceding sentence, then, on the \n        third legislative day of the House of Representatives after the \n        date of receipt of that special message, any Member of that \n        House may introduce the bill.\n            ``(B) The bill shall be referred to the Committee on \n        Appropriations of the House of Representatives. The Committee \n        shall report the bill without substantive revision and with or \n        without recommendation. The bill shall be reported not later \n        than the seventh legislative day of that House after the date \n        of receipt of that special message.
