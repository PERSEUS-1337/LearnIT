    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on the Abolition of the \nTransatlantic Slave Trade Act''.\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n        (1) On March 2, 1807, President Thomas Jefferson signed into \n    law a bill approved by the Congress ``An Act to prohibit the \n    importation of slaves into any port or place within the \n    jurisdiction of the United States'' (hereinafter in this Act \n    referred to as the ``1808 Transatlantic Slave Trade Act'') and made \n    it unlawful ``to import or bring into the United States or \n    territories thereof from any foreign kingdom, place or country, any \n    negro, mulatto, or person of colour, with intent to hold, sell, or \n    dispose of such * * * as a slave, or to be held to service or \n    labour''.\n        (2) Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution \n    clearly spelled out that the international slave trade could not be \n    banned before 1808, and it is only on January 1, 1808, that the \n    1808 Transatlantic Slave Trade Act went into effect.\n        (3) An Act entitled ``An Act to continue in force `An act to \n    protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of \n    piracy,' and also to make further provisions for punishing the \n    crime of piracy'', enacted May 15, 1820, made it unlawful for any \n    citizen of the United States to engage ``in the slave trade, or * * \n    *, being of the crew or ship's company of any foreign ship * * *, \n    seize any negro or mulatto * * * with the intent to make * * * a \n    slave * * * or forcibly bring * * * on board any such ship * * \n    *.''.\n        (4) The transatlantic slave trade entailed the kidnapping, \n    purchase, and commercial export of Africans, mostly from West and \n    Central Africa, to the European colonies and new nations in the \n    Americas, including the United States, where they were enslaved in \n    forced labor between the 15th and mid-19th centuries.\n        (5) The term ``Middle Passage'' refers to the horrific part of \n    the transatlantic slave trade when millions of Africans were \n    chained together and stowed by the hundreds in overcrowded ships \n    where they were forced into small spaces for months without relief \n    as they were transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas.\n        (6) During the Middle Passage, enslaved Africans resisted their \n    enslavement through non-violent and violent means, including hunger \n    strikes, suicide, and shipboard revolts, the most historically-\n    recognized events taking place on board the Don Carlos in 1732 and \n    on board the Amistad in 1839.\n        (7) Scholars estimate that, at a minimum, between 10,000,000 \n    and 15,000,000 Africans survived the Middle Passage, were imported \n    as chattel through customs houses and ports across the Americas, \n    and were sold into slavery.\n        (8) The thirteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n    States recognizes that ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, \n    except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been \n    duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place \n    subject to their jurisdiction.''.\n        (9) The slave trade and the legacy of slavery continue to have \n    a profound impact on social and economic disparity, hatred, bias, \n    racism, and discrimination, and continue to affect people in the \n    Americas, particularly those of African descent.\n        (10) In 2007, the British Parliament marked the 200th \n    anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the former \n    British Empire with plans launched by the Department for Education \n    and Skills which provided joint funding of  910,000 ($1,800,000) \n    for the Understanding Slavery Initiative, and the Heritage Lottery \n    Fund announced awards of over  20,000,000 ($40,000,000) for \n    projects to commemorate the anniversary.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the \nCommission on the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade to--\n        (1) ensure a suitable national observance of the bicentennial \n    anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade by \n    sponsoring and supporting commemorative programs;\n        (2) cooperate with and assist programs and activities \n    throughout the United States in observance of the bicentennial \n    anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade;\n        (3) assist in ensuring that the observations of the \n    bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic \n    slave trade are inclusive and appropriately recognize the \n    experiences of all people during this period in history;\n        (4) support and facilitate international involvement in \n    observances of the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the \n    transatlantic slave trade; and\n        (5) study the impact of the transatlantic slave trade on the \n    United States and the Americas.\nSEC. 3.
