FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A United States passport is an official government \n        document issued by the Department of State, which can be \n        obtained by United States nationals.\n            (2) A valid United States passport has many uses, \n        including--\n                    (A) certifying an individual's identity and \n                verifying that a person is a United States national;\n                    (B) allowing the passport holder to travel to \n                foreign countries with an internationally recognized \n                travel document;\n                    (C) facilitating international travel;\n                    (D) obtaining further identification documents; and\n                    (E) setting up bank accounts.\n            (3) A United States national may obtain a United States \n        passport for the first time by applying in person to a passport \n        acceptance facility with 2 passport photographs, proof of \n        United States nationality, and a valid form of photo \n        identification, such as a driver's license. Passport acceptance \n        facilities are located throughout the United States.\n            (4) Because United States passports issued under a false \n        identity enable individuals to conceal their movements and \n        activities, passport fraud could facilitate--\n                    (A) acts of terrorism;\n                    (B) espionage; and\n                    (C) other crimes, such as illegal immigration, \n                money laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and \n                alien smuggling.\n            (5) Since malicious individuals may seek to exploit \n        potential vulnerabilities in the passport issuance process, it \n        is important that personnel who are involved in the granting, \n        refusal, revocation, or adjudication of United States passport \n        applications have access to relevant information contained in \n        Federal, State, and other records and databases for the \n        purposes of lawfully--\n                    (A) verifying the identity of a passport applicant;\n                    (B) detecting passport fraud; and\n                    (C) denying or revoking a passport.\n            (6) In its final report, the National Commission on \n        Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the \n        ``9/11 Commission'')--\n                    (A) noted the ease with which terrorists could \n                obtain United States identity documents, such as \n                fraudulent driver's licenses, birth certificates, and \n                other sources of identification, which could be used by \n                terrorists to obtain United States passports that would \n                allow them to board airlines, rent cars, open bank \n                accounts, and carry on other activities needed to \n                facilitate their mission; and\n                    (B) concluded that funding and completing a \n                ``biometric entry-exit screening system'' for travelers \n                to and from the United States is essential to our \n                national security.\n            (7) The use of biometrics and technology for foreign \n        nationals who are visiting the country--\n                    (A) helps to make travel simple, easy, and \n                convenient for legitimate visitors; and\n                    (B) dramatically improves the ability to detect the \n                activities of those who wish to do harm or violate the \n                laws of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. ACCESS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION IN FEDERAL, STATE, AND OTHER \n              RECORDS AND DATABASES.\n\n    Section 104 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1104) \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(f) Authorized Data Sharing Activities.--(1) For data sharing \npurposes only, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, when \nDepartment of State personnel authorized by the Secretary of State to \ngrant, refuse, revoke, deny, or adjudicate United States passports are \nlawfully engaged in authorized data sharing activities relating to the \ngranting, refusal, revocation, or adjudication of such passports, such \nactivities shall be considered law enforcement activities that involve \nthe administration of criminal justice (as defined in section 20.3 of \ntitle 28, Code of Federal Regulations).\n    ``(2) Designated Department of State personnel with the authority \nto grant, refuse, revoke, deny or adjudicate United States passports \nare engaged in `authorized data sharing activities' (as set forth in \nparagraph (1) and the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 4 of \nthe Passport Identity Verification Act) if such personnel act in \ncompliance with such regulations and are seeking to lawfully--\n            ``(A) verify the identity of a passport applicant;\n            ``(B) detect passport fraud; or\n            ``(C) deny or revoke a passport.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
