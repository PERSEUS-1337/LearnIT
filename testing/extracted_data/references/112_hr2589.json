ANTIBOYCOTT PROVISIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the secondary \n        boycott of United States firms that have commercial ties with \n        Israel, are an impediment to investment, trade, economic \n        development, and peace in the Middle East and North Africa;\n            (2) it is in the common interest of the people of Israel \n        and the Arab states that the Arab League boycott be terminated, \n        that the Central Office for the Boycott of Israel be closed, \n        and that Arab League states normalize relations with their \n        neighbor Israel; and\n            (3) the President, the Secretary of State, and the \n        Secretary of Commerce should continue to vigorously oppose the \n        Arab League boycott of Israel and use the authorities enacted \n        into law by Congress to take concrete steps to seek an end to \n        the Arab League boycott.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to oppose restrictive trade practices or boycotts \n        fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other \n        countries friendly to the United States or against any United \n        States person;\n            (2) to encourage and, in specified cases, require United \n        States persons engaged in the export of goods or technology or \n        other information to refuse to take actions, including \n        furnishing information or entering into or implementing \n        agreements, which have the effect of furthering or supporting \n        the restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed \n        by any foreign country against a country friendly to the United \n        States or against any United States person; and\n            (3) to foster international cooperation and the development \n        of international rules and institutions to assure reasonable \n        access to world supplies.\n    (c) Prohibitions and Exceptions.--\n            (1) Prohibitions.--In order to carry out the purposes set \n        forth in subsection (b), the Secretary of Commerce (in this Act \n        referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall issue regulations \n        prohibiting any United States person, with respect to that \n        person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of \n        the United States, from taking or knowingly agreeing to take \n        any of the following actions with intent to comply with, \n        further, or support any boycott fostered or imposed by a \n        foreign country against a country that is friendly to the \n        United States and is not itself the object of any form of \n        boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation:\n                    (A) Refusing, or requiring any other person to \n                refuse, to do business with or in the boycotted \n                country, with any business concern organized under the \n                laws of the boycotted country, with any national or \n                resident of the boycotted country, or with any other \n                person, pursuant to an agreement with, or requirement \n                of, or a request from or on behalf of the boycotting \n                country. The mere absence of a business relationship \n                with or in the boycotted country with any business \n                concern organized under the laws of the boycotted \n                country, with any national or resident of the boycotted \n                country, or with any other person, does not indicate \n                the existence of the intent required to establish a \n                violation of regulations issued to carry out this \n                subparagraph.\n                    (B) Refusing, or requiring any other person to \n                refuse, to employ or otherwise discriminate against any \n                United States person on the basis of the race, \n                religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of \n                any owner, officer, director, or employee of such \n                person.\n                    (C) Furnishing information with respect to the \n                race, religion, sex, or national origin of any United \n                States person or of any owner, officer, director, or \n                employee of such person.\n                    (D) Furnishing information about whether any person \n                has, has had, or proposes to have any business \n                relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, \n                purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping \n                or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) \n                with or in the boycotted country, with any business \n                concern organized under the laws of the boycotted \n                country, with any national or resident of the boycotted \n                country, or with any other person which is known or \n                believed to be restricted from having any business \n                relationship with or in the boycotting country.

or\n                            (ii) prohibiting the shipment of items to \n                        the boycotting country on a carrier of the \n                        boycotted country or by a route other than that \n                        prescribed by the boycotting country or the \n                        recipient of the shipment;\n                    (B) compliance, or agreement to comply, with import \n                and shipping document requirements with respect to the \n                country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of \n                shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment, or \n                the name of the provider of other services, except \n                that, for purposes of applying any exception under this \n                subparagraph, no information knowingly furnished or \n                conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated \n                in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary \n                terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of \n                shipment as may be permitted by such regulations in \n                order to comply with precautionary requirements \n                protecting against war risks and confiscation;\n                    (C) compliance, or agreement to comply, in the \n                normal course of business with the unilateral and \n                specific selection by a boycotting country, or a \n                national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurers, \n                suppliers of services to be performed within the \n                boycotting country, or specific items which, in the \n                normal course of business, are identifiable by source \n                when imported into the boycotting country;\n                    (D) compliance, or agreement to comply, with export \n                requirements of the boycotting country relating to \n                shipment or transshipment of exports to the boycotted \n                country, to any business concern of or organized under \n                the laws of the boycotted country, or to any national \n                or resident of the boycotted country;\n                    (E) compliance by an individual, or agreement by an \n                individual to comply, with the immigration or passport \n                requirements of any country with respect to such \n                individual or any member of such individual's family or \n                with requests for information regarding requirements of \n                employment of such individual within the boycotting \n                country;
