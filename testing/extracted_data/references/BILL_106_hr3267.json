Reserve forces are part of all \n                war plans. No major operation can be successful without \n                them.''.\n                    (B) The National Defense Panel, in its report \n                issued in 1997, called for the ``full integration'' of \n                the reserve components with active duty forces and \n                specifically called on the Army to rely more upon its \n                reserve components to ``reduce pressure on the active \n                Army''.\n                    (C) The Reserve Component Employment 20005 Study, \n                issued on August 8, 1999, concludes that ``while much \n                progress has been made in recent years to ensure equity \n                in the benefit packages that are provided to AC [active \n                component] and RC [reserve component] personnel, the \n                study determined that disparities continue to exist for \n                RC personnel.''.\n            (5) Secretary of Defense William Cohen has made ``quality \n        of life'' issues for all servicemembers a major priority for \n        the Department of Defense.\n            (6) The significant recent increase in overseas active-duty \n        assignments for reserve component members warrants enhancement \n        of military benefits for the Nation's citizen soldiers.\n            (7) Those enhancements should include--\n                    (A) extending eligibility of reserve component \n                members for space available (``Space-A'') travel on \n                military aircraft to travel outside the continental \n                United States (``OCONUS'');\n                    (B) providing for reserve component members \n                traveling away from their homes for inactive-duty \n                training to be eligible for billiting in military \n                quarters on the same basis as members on active duty;\n                    (C) raising the annual reserve retirement point \n                maximum from 75 to 90; and\n                    (D) extending the legal services provided by the \n                Department of Defense to reserve component members.\n\nSEC. 3.
