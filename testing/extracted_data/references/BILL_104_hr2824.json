FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in June 1995, Salt Lake City, Utah, was selected to \n        host the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, and the Snowbasin Ski \n        Resort, which is owned by the Sun Valley Company, was \n        identified as the site of six Olympic events: the men's and \n        women's downhills, men's and women's Super-Gs, and men's and \n        women's combined downhills;\n            (2) in order to adequately accommodate these events, which \n        are traditionally among the most popular and heavily attended \n        at the Winter Olympic Games, major new skiing, visitor, and \n        support facilities will have to be constructed at the Snowbasin \n        Ski Resort on land currently administered by the United States \n        Forest Service;\n            (3) while certain of these new facilities can be \n        accommodated on National Forest land under traditional Forest \n        Service permitting authorities, the base area facilities \n        necessary to host visitors to the ski area and the Winter \n        Olympics are of such a nature that they should logically be \n        located on private land;\n            (4) land exchanges have been routinely utilized by the \n        Forest Service to transfer base area lands to many other ski \n        areas, and the Forest Service and the Sun Valley Company have \n        concluded that a land exchange to transfer base area lands at \n        the Snowbasin Ski Resort to the Sun Valley Company is both \n        logical and advisable;\n            (5) an environmental impact statement and numerous resource \n        studies have been completed by the Forest Service and the Sun \n        Valley Company for the lands proposed to be transferred to the \n        Sun Valley Company by this Act;\n            (6) the Sun Valley Company has assembled lands with \n        outstanding environmental, recreational, and other values to \n        convey to the Forest Service in return for the lands it will \n        receive in the exchange, and the Forest Service has identified \n        such lands as desirable for acquisition by the United States; \n        and\n            (7) completion of a land exchange and approval of a \n        development plan for Olympic related facilities at the \n        Snowbasin Ski Resort is essential to ensure that all necessary \n        facilities can be constructed, tested for safety and other \n        purposes, and become fully operational in advance of the 2002 \n        Winter Olympics and earlier pre-Olympic events.\n    (b) Determination.--The Congress has reviewed the previous analyses \nand studies of the lands to be exchanged and developed pursuant to this \nAct, and has made its own review of these lands and issues involved, \nand on the basis of those reviews hereby finds and determines that a \nlegislated land exchange and development plan approval is necessary to \nmeet Olympic goals and timetables.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE AND INTENT.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to authorize and direct the Secretary to \nexchange 1,320 acres of federally-owned land within the Cache National \nForest in the State of Utah for lands of approximately equal value \nowned by the Sun Valley Company. It is the intent of Congress that this \nexchange be effected without delay within the period specified by \nsection 5.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Sun Valley Company'' means the Sun Valley \n        Company, a division of Sinclair Oil Corporation, a Wyoming \n        Corporation, or its successors or assigns; and\n            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture.\n\nSEC. 5.

On the basis of such review, Congress hereby \nfinds that the Phase I facilities identified and described in the \nMaster Plan to be located on National Forest System lands, or any \nmodifications thereof mutually agreed to by the Secretary and the Sun \nValley Company, are reasonable and necessary to accommodate the 2002 \nOlympics and directs the Secretary to issue all necessary permits and \nauthorizations for construction and operation of such facilities in \naccordance with the procedures and provisions of this section.\n    (b) Phase I Facility Approval, Conditions and Timetable.--Within \n120 days of receipt of an application by the Sun Valley Company to \nauthorize construction and operation of any particular Phase I \nfacility, facilities, or group of facilities, the Secretary, in \nconsultation with the Sun Valley Company, shall authorize construction \nand operation of such facility, facilities, or group of facilities, \nsubject to the general policies of the Forest Service pertaining to the \nconstruction and operation of ski area facilities on National Forest \nSystem lands. In providing authorization to construct and operate a \nfacility, facilities, or group of facilities, the Secretary may not \nimpose any condition that would significantly change the location, \nsize, or scope of the applied for Phase I facility unless (1) the \nmodification is mutually agreed to by the Secretary and the Sun Valley \nCompany; or (2) the change is necessary to protect public health and \nsafety. In providing any such authorization, the Secretary shall \nprovide for resource protection without regard to section 102(2)(C) of \nthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 or the participation \nrequirements of section 6(d) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable \nResources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604(d)). Nothing in this \nsection shall be construed to affect the Secretary's responsibility to \nmonitor and assure compliance with the conditions set forth in the \nconstruction and operation authorization.\n    (c) Congressional Directions.--Notwithstanding any other provision \nof law, Congress finds consummation of the land exchange directed by \nthis Act and all determinations, authorizations, and actions taken by \nthe Secretary pursuant to this Act pertaining to Phase I facilities (or \nmodifications thereof mutually agreed to by the Secretary and the Sun \nValley Company) to be non-discretionary actions authorized and directed \nby Congress and hence to comply with all procedural and other \nrequirements of the laws of the United States.\n    (d) Report to Congress.--The Secretary shall report to the \nCommittee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives \nand the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States \nSenate as to whether construction and operation of Phase I facilities \nhave provided for sufficient environmental protection on National \nForest System lands affected by such facilities."
