FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to article I, section 8 of the United States \n        Constitution, Congress has the power to raise and support \n        armies and to provide and maintain a navy; and to make all laws \n        necessary and proper to carry out these powers.\n            (2) The First Amendment states: ``Congress shall make no \n        law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the \n        free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or \n        of the press; or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, \n        and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.''.\n            (3) According to the United States Supreme Court, the right \n        to peaceable assembly is a right similar to those of free \n        speech and free press and is equally essential. (De Jonge v. \n        Oregon).\n            (4) The key word being ``peaceably'', the First Amendment \n        protects peaceful, not violent, assembly and protest.\n            (5) The successful recruiting of men and women to serve in \n        the armed services of the United States is fundamental to the \n        security of the American people.\n            (6) Serving in the military is highly honorable, and often \n        requires great sacrifice and courage by the men and women of \n        our armed services.\n            (7) United States military recruiters have been subject to \n        an escalating number of acts of vandalism and violent protest, \n        including but not limited to:\n                    (A) March 2003: Anti-war protestors in Ithaca, NY, \n                target a recruitment center that had been hit before \n                with Molotov cocktails. On St. Patrick's Day, wielding \n                cups of their own blood, they entered a Lansing \n                military recruitment office and splashed their blood \n                over recruiter posters, military cutouts and the \n                American flag.\n                    (B) January 20, 2005: At Seattle Central Community \n                College, Army recruiter Sgt. Jeff Due and his colleague \n                Sgt. 1st Class Douglas Washington were hounded by an \n                angry mob of approximately 500 anti-war students. The \n                recruiters' table was destroyed; their handouts, torn \n                apart. Protesters threw water bottles and newspapers at \n                the soldiers. A far-left anti-war group had been \n                agitating to kick the recruiters off campus. The \n                college administration refused to punish the radicals.\n                    (C) January 31, 2005: Recruiters in Manhattan \n                reported that a door to their office had been beaten \n                in.

On the same day, New York police \n                arrested a young Manhattan College junior and charged \n                him with throwing a burning rag into an Army recruiting \n                station and ruining the door locks with super glue.\n                    (D) February 1, 2005: At a South Toledo, Ohio, \n                recruitment center, protesters hurled manure all over \n                the building.

Vandals at the University of North \n                Carolina at Chapel Hill tossed cans of red paint in \n                front of an ROTC office and spray-painted vulgarities \n                all over its doors. University of Minnesota students \n                splattered red paint all over an Army recruiting \n                station.\n                    (I) December 2006: Protesters in Lawrence, Kansas \n                crippled business at an Army/Navy recruitment center, \n                where workers' car tires were slashed and bomb-proof \n                glass had to be installed.\n                    (J) January 2007: Pittsburgh protestors shut down a \n                recruitment station for a day, wielding signs calling \n                recruiters ``child predators''.\n                    (K) March 2007: Vandals broke into a Milwaukee \n                recruitment station wielding crowbars.\n                    (L) July 2007: A protestor in Bremerton, Wash., \n                slashed tires of Army recruiting vehicles to protest \n                the Iraq war because he ``hated the military''. In \n                Maryland, vandals smashed a Rockville Air Force career \n                center. In Lufkin, Texas, Navy recruiters were the \n                targets of vandals who keyed their cars, smashed their \n                windows and shot at their vehicles with ``what appeared \n                to be a high-powered pellet gun''.\n                    (M) August 2007: In Stamford, Conn., a protestor \n                twice left a fake bomb package at a military \n                recruitment office.\n                    (N) September 2007: An anti-war group calls on \n                followers to commit fraud to interfere with military \n                recruiters.
