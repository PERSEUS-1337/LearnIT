FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Cooperative Threat Reduction program, initially \n        established in 1991 by Senators Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn, \n        provided funding and expertise to secure and dismantle nuclear, \n        chemical, and biological weapons and delivery systems in former \n        Soviet Union states.\n            (2) After the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \n        program was signed into law, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and \n        Kazakhstan all agreed to implement the program.\n            (3) Russia developed programs to improve security at \n        nuclear weapons facilities and together with Ukraine opened \n        science and technology centers to help employ former Soviet \n        weapons scientists.\n            (4) Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan agreed to remove all \n        nuclear warheads from their territories, and accomplished this \n        objective within three years.\n            (5) In 1996, the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness \n        Initiative built on the initial goals of the Cooperative Threat \n        Reduction program to train civilians to assist following an \n        attack by a weapon of mass destruction.\n            (6) In recent years, funding provided through the Nunn-\n        Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has focused on \n        export and border control programs and on the detection of \n        radiological weapons, sometimes referred to as ``dirty bombs''.\n            (7) In 2013, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \n        program provided funding for Libya to dispose of the chemical \n        weapons and munitions discovered after the fall of the Gadhafi \n        regime.\n            (8) In 2014, under the umbrella of the Nunn-Lugar \n        Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the United States played \n        a role in carrying out the removal of chemical weapons from \n        Syria.\n            (9) The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program has \n        been a success, but as the world continues to change, new \n        partnerships and strategies will be required to deal with new \n        threats posed by weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSEC. 3.
