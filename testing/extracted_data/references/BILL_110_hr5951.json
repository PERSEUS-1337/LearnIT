FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While the Federal highway program has helped achieve \n        its original goal of providing for fast and convenient \n        automobile travel, the national transportation system needs to \n        provide better service to those who take public transit, ride \n        bicycles, or travel on foot or with mobility aids.\n            (2) Initiatives to promote sustainable and modern \n        transportation choices like public transit, bicycling, and \n        walking have had limited success because many State and local \n        transportation agencies have treated these modes as optional \n        amenities, instead of as integral parts of the national highway \n        programs.\n            (3) Many new and improved streets across the United States, \n        particularly in developing areas, do not provide to all users \n        the safe and equitable access to public rights-of-way.\n            (4) The official design guidance from the Federal Highway \n        Administration titled ``Accommodating Bicycle and Pedestrian \n        Travel: A Recommended Approach'' states that, ``the resulting \n        highway environment discourages bicycling and walking and has \n        made the two modes more dangerous. Further, the ability of \n        pedestrians with disabilities to travel independently and \n        safely has been compromised.''.\n            (5) One-third of the population is either unable to or \n        chooses not to drive due to age, medical condition, ability, \n        lifestyle, legal status, or other factors.\n            (6) More than 1 in 5 Americans over age 65 do not drive, \n        more than 50 million Americans have a disability of some kind, \n        and in different times of his or her life virtually every \n        American will suffer from a mobility impairment of some kind.\n            (7) The full integration of all modes in the design of \n        streets and highways will increase the capacity and efficiency \n        of the road network, reduce traffic congestion by improving \n        mobility options, clean the air, limit greenhouse gas \n        emissions, and improve the general quality of life.\n            (8) Requiring accommodation of the needs of nonmotorized \n        users will eliminate hazards and improve safety for pedestrians \n        and cyclists, who now make up more than 12 percent of all \n        traffic fatalities.\n            (9) Improving the road network will allow more disabled \n        people to gain a higher level of independence through the use \n        of standard transit services, easing the economic burden on \n        transit systems which must provide paratransit options at great \n        cost.\n            (10) Public health officials across the country have called \n        for the construction of more bicycle and pedestrian facilities \n        as an important tool in fighting the obesity epidemic.\n            (11) The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n        explicitly supports the implementation of a complete streets \n        policy.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Transportation.\n            (2) The term ``complete streets'' means roadways that \n        accommodate all travelers, particularly users of public \n        transit, bicyclists, pedestrians (including individuals of all \n        ages as well as individuals with mobility, sensory, \n        neurological, or hidden disabilities), and motorists to enable \n        all users to use the roadway safely and efficiently.\n            (3) The terms ``complete streets policy'' and ``complete \n        streets principles'' refer to transportation laws, policies, or \n        principles at the local, State, regional, or Federal level \n        which ensure--\n                    (A) all users of the transportation system, \n                including pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users as \n                well as children, older people, motorists, and those \n                with disabilities, are adequately accommodated in all \n                phases of project planning and development; and\n                    (B) that the safety and convenience of all users \n                are considered in all phases of project planning and \n                development.\n            (4) The term ``transportation improvement program'' has the \n        same meaning such term has in section 134 of title 23, United \n        States Code.\n            (5) The term ``metropolitan planning organization'' has the \n        same meaning such term has in section 134(b) of such title.\n            (6) The term ``senior manager'' means--\n                    (A) the director of a State department of \n                transportation or a designee;\n                    (B) the director of a metropolitan planning \n                organization or a designee; or\n                    (C) the director of a regional or county \n                transportation agency if such agency is primarily \n                responsible for planning and approval of transportation \n                projects, or a designee.\n\nSEC. 4.
