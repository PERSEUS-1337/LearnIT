FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Past investments in biomedical research have resulted \n        in better health, an improved quality of life for all \n        Americans, and a reduction in national health care \n        expenditures.\n            (2) The Nation's commitment to biomedical research has \n        expanded the base of scientific knowledge about health and \n        disease and revolutionized the practice of medicine.\n            (3) Research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \n        is responsible for the identification of genetic mutations \n        relating to nearly 100 diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, \n        cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, osteoporosis, many forms \n        of cancer, and immune deficiency disorders.\n            (4) Many Americans still face serious and life-threatening \n        health problems, both acute and chronic.\n            (5) Neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly, such as \n        Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, threaten to destroy the \n        lives of millions of Americans.\n            (6) Cancer remains a comprehensive threat to any tissue or \n        organ of the body at any age, and remains a leading cause of \n        morbidity and mortality.\n            (7) The extent of psychiatric and neurological diseases \n        poses considerable challenges in understanding the workings of \n        the brain and nervous system.\n            (8) Diabetes, both insulin and noninsulin forms, afflicts \n        16 million Americans and places them at risk for acute and \n        chronic complications, including blindness, kidney failure, \n        atherosclerosis, and nerve degeneration.\n            (9) Recent scientific developments show that human stem \n        cell research based on ethically responsible stem cell sources \n        may lead to exponential improvements in the treatment of many \n        terminal and debilitating conditions, from cancer to \n        Parkinson's to Alzheimer's to diabetes to heart disease.\n            (10) To take full advantage of the tremendous potential for \n        finding a cure or effective treatment for many debilitating \n        diseases, the Federal investment in ethical stem cell research \n        must be expanded.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL STEM CELL DONOR BANK.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nby contract establish and maintain a National Stem Cell Donor Bank (in \nthis section referred to as the ``Donor Bank''). The purpose of the \nDonor Bank shall be to seek and preserve donations of qualifying human \nstem cells and to make such donated cells available for biomedical \nresearch and for therapeutic purposes.\n    (b) Qualifying Human Stem Cells.--For purposes of this Act, the \nterm ``qualifying human stem cells'' means human stem cells obtained \nfrom human placentas, umbilical cord blood, organs or tissues of a \nliving or deceased human being who has been born, or organs or tissues \nof unborn human offspring who died of natural causes (such as \nspontaneous abortion).\n    (c) Administration of Donor Bank.--The Donor Bank shall be under \nthe general supervision of the Secretary, and under the direction of a \nboard of directors meeting such criteria as the Secretary may \nestablish.\n    (d) Patient Registry.--The Donor Bank shall with respect to \nqualifying human stem cells--\n            (1) operate a registry of patients who are transplant \n        candidates;\n            (2) establish a system for finding donors who are unrelated \n        to the candidate patients and are suitably matched to the \n        patients; and\n            (3) carry out informational and educational activities.\n    (e) Criteria.--The Secretary shall establish criteria for the Donor \nBank and other entities that participate in the program under this \nsection, including--\n            (1) quality standards and standards for tissue typing and \n        obtaining the informed consent of donors, or the parents or \n        legal representatives of donors as appropriate;\n            (2) donor selection criteria, based on established medical \n        criteria, to protect both donors and transplant recipients and \n        to prevent the transmission of potentially harmful infectious \n        diseases;\n            (3) procedures to ensure the proper collection and \n        transportation of qualifying human stem cells; and\n            (4) standards that--\n                    (A) require the establishment of a system of strict \n                confidentiality of records relating to the identity and \n                address of and medical information on patients and \n                donors; and\n                    (B) prescribe the purposes for which the records \n                described in subparagraph (A) may be disclosed, and the \n                circumstances and extent of the disclosure.\n    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying \nout this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as \nmay be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2006.\n\nSEC. 4. USE OF QUALIFYING HUMAN STEM CELLS IN RESEARCH CONDUCTED OR \n              SUPPORTED BY NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary, acting through the Director of the \nNational Institutes of Health, may conduct and support research that \nuses qualifying human stem cells.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying \nout subsection (a), there are authorized to be appropriated $30,000,000 \nfor fiscal year 2002, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the \nfiscal years 2003 through 2006.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``qualifying human stem cells'' has the \n        meaning given such term in section 3.\n            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health \n        and Human Services."
