STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n     It is the policy of the United States to support the advancement \nof human rights, democracy, and economic freedom in the Federal \nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia, in concert with United States security \ninterests, in order to better enable Ethiopia to play a leading role in \nparticipating with the United States and other countries in fostering \nstability, democracy, and economic development in Africa.\n\nSEC. 3. SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN ETHIOPIA.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Despite improvements in its human rights record, as \n        noted by the Department of State in its 2004 Country Reports on \n        Human Rights Practices, the Government of the Federal \n        Democratic Republic of Ethiopia continues to violate the \n        internationally-established rights of its citizens, including \n        unlawful killings by security forces (including the June 2005 \n        shootings by government security forces of more than 40 \n        election demonstrators), arbitrary or politically-motivated \n        arrests, long detentions without charge or trial and beatings \n        and torture, with human rights violations increasing in the \n        aftermath of the May 15, 2005, elections and subsequent \n        protests of suspected election fraud.\n            (2) According to the 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights \n        Practices, the Ethiopian judiciary has demonstrated encouraging \n        signs of independence, but the justice system--from the police \n        to the courts to the prisons--remains inadequate and does not \n        effectively uphold the human and civil rights of the citizens \n        of Ethiopia.\n            (3) According to the Department of State's International \n        Religious Freedom Report for 2004, Ethiopia generally provides \n        for freedom of religion, although local authorities continue to \n        infringe on this right.\n            (4) The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that \n        Ethiopia continues to imprison journalists and the Government \n        of Ethiopia continues to refuse to revise a repressive media \n        bill that further endangers the right to free speech.\n            (5) Because literacy in Ethiopia is less than 50 percent, \n        broadcasting is a key source of information for citizens, but \n        the Ethiopian Government has delayed accepting licenses for \n        private radio or television since a licensing law was passed in \n        1999, leaving the Ethiopian Broadcasting Service as a radio and \n        television monopoly and infringing on freedom of information.\n    (b) Support for Human Rights Training.--The President, acting \nthrough the Administrator of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, shall revise the Agency's country plan for Ethiopia to \nprovide support for capacity building for more effective independent \nhuman rights monitoring operations in Ethiopia and provide training for \ngovernment officials on international human rights standards.\n    (c) Training for Police, Security, and Prison Personnel.--The \nPresident, acting through the head of the International Criminal \nInvestigative Training Assistance Program of the Department of Justice, \nshall provide necessary training for Ethiopian police, security, and \nprison personnel in recognizing and maintaining international standards \nfor arresting and interrogating suspects and otherwise handling \nprisoners and detainees.\n    (d) Training for Court System Personnel.--The President, acting \nthrough the Administrator of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, shall support programs directed at increasing the \nindependence and competence of the Ethiopian judicial system, \nespecially training for Ethiopian court personnel on handling suspects \nand defendants throughout the pre-trial and trial process in order to \nensure their human and civil rights as defined by international \naccords.\n    (e) Free Media.--The President, Secretary of State, and other \nrelevant officials of the Government of the United States, shall \nencourage the Government of Ethiopia to abide by its own laws and \nensure the open and transparent licensing of independent radio and \ntelevision and use all available means to support the establishment of \nindependent radio and television as means of broadening the access of \naverage citizens to information.\n\nSEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIZATION IN ETHIOPIA.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic \n        Front has held power through three improving general elections \n        since the overthrow of the government of President Mengistu \n        Hailemariam in 1991.\n            (2) Human Rights Watch has reported the harassment, \n        detention, and even torture of critics of the Government of the \n        Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, especially in the \n        Oromia region of Ethiopia, ostensibly to silence political \n        opponents.\n            (3) The European Union election observers in the May 15, \n        2005, elections accused the Government of Ethiopia of employing \n        ``hate speech'' and listed acts of violence and intimidation in \n        a letter to the National Electoral Board.\n            (4) The Government of Ethiopia on March 30, 2005, expelled \n        three internationally respected United States nongovernmental \n        organizations--the International Republican Institute, the \n        National Democratic Institute, and the International Foundation \n        for Electoral Systems--that were promoting democratic \n        development, ostensibly due to their failure to register for \n        such activities.\n            (5) Complaints about the conduct of the May 15, 2005, \n        elections were lodged by the main opposition coalition and the \n        ruling party in 299 of Ethiopia's 547 constituencies, but more \n        than 90 percent of opposition party filings were thrown out by \n        the Ethiopian agency investigating electoral complaints, while \n        only 10 percent of ruling party complaints have been found to \n        be unsubstantiated.\n            (6) International election observers reported the turnout \n        of millions of eligible voters in the May 15, 2005, elections, \n        further confirming the desire of the citizens of Ethiopia to \n        express their political will through the ballot.\n            (7) The Government of Ethiopia failed to meet its stated \n        July 8, 2005, deadline for releasing full results of the May \n        15, 2005, elections and continues to refuse to release \n        customary detailed results of balloting, creating ongoing \n        uncertainty and suspicion about the validity of the election.\n    (b) Transparency of Election Results.--Congress urges the \nGovernment of Ethiopia to allow and facilitate a transparent review of \nthe May 15, 2005, election results and to support a legal review of \nthose results that are credibly shown to be questionable.\n    (c) Readmittance of United States Democracy Organizations.--\nCongress urges the Government of Ethiopia to readmit the International \nRepublican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, and the \nInternational Foundation for Electoral Systems which were expelled \nprior to the May 15, 2005, elections and expeditiously work out any \nlegitimate issues involving their registration.\n    (d) Training of Political Parties and Civil Society Election \nObservers.--In order to better ensure continued progress in the conduct \nof the electoral process in Ethiopia, the President, acting through the \nAdministrator of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, shall revise the Agency's country plan for Ethiopia to \nprovide support for training political parties on organization building \nand message development and for training political parties and civil \nsociety groups in election monitoring.\n    (e) Facilitation of Equitable Electoral Environment.--As part of \nits support for democratization in Ethiopia, the President, acting \nthrough the Administrator of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, shall provide assistance to facilitate ongoing \ncommunication between political parties and the Government of Ethiopia \nthrough the National Electoral Board in order to address issues \ninvolving delimitation of constituencies, voter registration, party \nregistration, candidate registration, and related matters to ensure the \ncredibility of the next election in Ethiopia.\n\nSEC. 5. SUPPORT FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ETHIOPIA.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the World Bank Institute's governance \n        ratings for 2004, the rating of the Federal Democratic Republic \n        of Ethiopia is measurably worse than its last rating in 2002 in \n        government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and control of \n        corruption, which examine a government's capacity to formulate \n        and implement economic policies.\n            (2) The 2005 Index of Economic Freedom ranks Ethiopia's \n        economy as mostly unfree, largely due to a cumbersome \n        bureaucracy that deters investment, a judicial system that does \n        not offer sufficient protection of property rights, and a \n        system of higher tariffs on imported products.\n            (3) The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service reports in its \n        2005 country commercial guide for Ethiopia that Ethiopia's \n        continuing refusal to alter its policy of considering all land \n        to be public property that can only be leased and not owned \n        prevents financing of ventures in which land would be \n        collateral for a loan and also makes investors vulnerable to \n        smallholders claiming the right to use part of their land.\n            (4) Members of the Ethiopian diaspora in the United States \n        have accused the Government of Ethiopia of failing to live up \n        to promises of repatriation of property confiscated by the \n        Mengistu government, and in some cases, allowing others to \n        profit from these seized properties.\n            (5) According to Ethiopia's poverty reduction strategy \n        paper, its per capita income is among the lowest of even least \n        developed countries, and poverty is widespread, affecting \n        nearly half the country's population in both urban and rural \n        areas.\n            (6) Lack of water is a major reason for the cause of \n        famine, but the dire situation in Ethiopia's agriculture sector \n        is exacerbated by Ethiopian Government policies, including its \n        refusal to allow private ownership of land, excessive taxation \n        of farmers, and the high cost of fertilizer sold by companies \n        affiliated with the Ethiopian Government.\n    (b) Economic Policy Assistance.--Utilizing training and other \ntechnical assistance programs offered by the Department of the \nTreasury, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and the \nDepartment of Justice, the President shall assist the Government of \nEthiopia in developing policies that will address key economic \nobstacles, including such areas as budgeting, taxation, debt \nmanagement, bank supervision, and anti-money laundering, that inhibit \nprivate sector development and limit participation in donor programs \nsuch as the United States Millennium Challenge Account.\n    (c) Resource Policy Assistance.--The President, acting through the \nAdministrator of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, shall provide assistance for sustainable development of \nEthiopia's Nile and Awash River resources, including assistance to help \nEthiopia with the technology necessary for the construction of dams, \nirrigation systems, and hydroelectric power that might prevent future \nfamine.\n    (d) Financing for United States-Ethiopian Commercial Ventures.--The \nPresident shall use all available financing programs to provide \nadequate financing of United States and Ethiopian commercial ventures, \nincluding programs of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, the Small Business Administration (including the Export \nExpress and Export Working Capital programs), the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation (including the Small Business Center and the \nSmall and Medium Enterprise and Structural Finance programs), and the \nExport-Import Bank of the United States (including the Short-Term \nAfrica Pilot Program).\n\nSEC. 6. ENSURING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND \n              ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is an \n        important United States partner in the Horn of Africa region, \n        whose stability is vital to United States interests in East \n        Africa and the Middle East.\n            (2) Ethiopia has been a strong United States ally in the \n        fight against global terrorism by its participation in the \n        coalition of the willing in Iraq.\n            (3) Ethiopia has a strong military, which has been involved \n        in international peacekeeping operations since the Korean \n        conflict in the 1950s.\n            (4) Two ethnically-based opposition groups--the Oromo \n        Liberation Front and the Ogadeni National Liberation Front--\n        have been committed to waging an armed struggle against the \n        Government of Ethiopia, but the incidence of actual armed \n        attacks has been limited and sporadic.\n            (5) Historically a nation with a large Christian majority, \n        Ethiopia has experienced significant growth in its Muslim \n        population, and Christians and Muslims for the first time are \n        nearly equal in numbers, which places this key East African \n        nation on a religious fault line that will require proactive \n        efforts to minimize conflict.\n    (b) Suspension of Joint Security Activities.--\n            (1) Suspension.--The President shall suspend all joint \n        security activities of the Government of the United States with \n        the Government of Ethiopia, including activities through the \n        U.S. East Africa Counterterrorism Initiative until such time as \n        the certification described in paragraph (2) is made in \n        accordance with such paragraph.\n            (2) Certification.--The certification described in this \n        subsection is a certification by the President to Congress that \n        the Government of Ethiopia is observing international standards \n        of human rights and enforcing the principle of the rule of law, \n        especially by conducting a credible investigation of the \n        killing of civilian protesters by security forces, as well as \n        trying or releasing detainees and granting access for detainees \n        to their families, counsel, and the International Red Cross.\n    (c) Resolution of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Boundary Dispute.--\n            (1) Declaration of policy.--Congress declares that the \n        current stalemate in the border dispute between Ethiopia and \n        Eritrea has the potential to lead to conflict and must be \n        addressed.\n            (2) Prohibition on assistance.--\n                    (A) Prohibition.--Except as provided in \n                subparagraph (B), funds available to any department of \n                agency of the Government of the United States may not \n                be made available for assistance for the central \n                Governments of Ethiopia or Eritrea unless the Secretary \n                of State certifies and reports to the Committee on \n                Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the \n                Committee on Appropriations of the Senate that the \n                central Government of Ethiopia or Eritrea, as the case \n                may be, is taking steps to comply with the terms of the \n                Algiers Agreements.\n                    (B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) does not apply to \n                assistance for democracy, rule of law, peacekeeping \n                programs and activities, child survival and health, \n                basic education, and agriculture programs.\n    (d) Democracy Enhancement.--\n            (1) Assistance.--United States technical assistance for \n        democracy promotion in Ethiopia may be made available to the \n        ruling party as well as opposition parties in Ethiopia.\n            (2) Restriction.--\n                    (A) In general.--Non-essential United States \n                assistance may not be made available to the Government \n                of Ethiopia if the Government of Ethiopia acts to \n                obstruct United States technical assistance for \n                opposition parties in Ethiopia.\n                    (B) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``non-\n                essential United States assistance'' means assistance \n                under any provision of law, other than humanitarian \n                assistance, assistance under emergency food programs, \n                assistance to combat HIV/AIDS, and other health care \n                assistance, including assistance for fistula treatment, \n                health service planning, training, delivery and \n                reporting, post-partum hemorrhage, safe motherhood, and \n                abandonment of harmful traditional practices.\n    (e) Support for OLF Reintegration.--In light of recent reports that \nthe Oromo Liberation Front in Ethiopia may be prepared to abandon its \narmed struggle and participate in the democratic process, it is the \nsense of Congress that the Government of the United States should \nencourage the Government of Ethiopia to take advantage of this \nopportunity to enter into discussions with the Oromo Liberation Front \nto bring them into full participation in the political and economic \naffairs of Ethiopia, including their legalization as a political party, \nand the Government of the United States should provide such assistance \nas is warranted and necessary to help achieve this goal.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORT.\n\n     Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the President shall transmit a report to Congress on the \nimplementation of this Act, including a description of a comprehensive \nplan to address the security, human rights, democratization, and \neconomic freedom concerns that potentially threaten the stability of \nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to carry \nout this Act $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008.\n    (b) Availability.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to the \nauthorization of appropriations under subsection (a) are authorized to \nremain available until expended."
