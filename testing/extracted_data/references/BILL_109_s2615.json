FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Cape Fox Corporation (referred to in this Act as \n        ``Cape Fox'') is a Village Corporation for the Native Village \n        of Saxman, Alaska, organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n        Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n            (2) similar to other Village Corporations in southeast \n        Alaska, under section 16 of that Act (43 U.S.C. 1615), Cape Fox \n        could select only 23,040 acres from land withdrawn for the \n        purpose of that selection;\n            (3) under section 22(l) of that Act (43 U.S.C. 1621(l))--\n                    (A) the Village Corporations in southeast Alaska, \n                other than Cape Fox, were restricted with respect to \n                the selection of land within 2 miles of a home rule \n                city (as that term is used in that Act); and\n                    (B) to protect the watersheds in the vicinity, Cape \n                Fox was restricted with respect to the selection of \n                land within 6 miles of the boundary of the home rule \n                city of Ketchikan, Alaska;\n            (4) the 6-mile restriction described in paragraph (3)(B) \n        precluded Cape Fox from selecting valuable timber land, \n        industrial sites, and other commercial property located--\n                    (A) within the townships in which the Native \n                Village of Saxman is located, more particularly \n                described as T.75 S., T.76 S., R.91 E., Copper River \n                Meridian; and\n                    (B) on surrounding land that is far removed from \n                Ketchikan, Alaska, and its watersheds;\n            (5) as a result of that 6-mile restriction, only the \n        remote, mountainous, northeast corner of the property described \n        in paragraph (4)(A), which is nonproductive and has no known \n        economic value, was available for selection by Cape Fox, as \n        required under section 16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1615(b));\n            (6) land selections by Cape Fox under that Act were further \n        limited by the fact that--\n                    (A) the Annette Island Indian Reservation is \n                located within the applicable selection area; and\n                    (B) land of that reservation is unavailable for \n                selection by Cape Fox;\n            (7) Cape Fox is the only Village Corporation affected by \n        the restrictions described in paragraphs (3)(B) and (6);\n            (8) the Secretary of the Interior (referred to in this Act \n        as the ``Secretary'') has advised Congress that the predicament \n        of Cape Fox is sufficiently unique to warrant the legislative \n        remedy provided by this Act; and\n            (9) the adjustment of the selections available and \n        conveyances of land to Cape Fox under the Alaska Native Claims \n        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and the related \n        adjustment of selections available and conveyances of land to \n        the Regional Corporation for Sealaska established pursuant to \n        that Act, are in accordance with--\n                    (A) the purposes of that Act; and\n                    (B) the public interest.\n\nSEC. 2. WAIVER OF CORE TOWNSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN LAND.\n\n    Notwithstanding section 16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1615(b)), Cape Fox shall not be required to \nselect or receive conveyance of the approximately 160 acres of \nunconveyed Federal land located within sec. 1, T.75 S., R.91 E., Copper \nRiver Meridian.\n\nSEC. 3.
