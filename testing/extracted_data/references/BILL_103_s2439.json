FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) fire losses in the United States are estimated at 5,000 \n        deaths and 29,000 injuries annually, producing an economic loss \n        conservatively estimated at $10,000,000,000 per year, plus more \n        than $1,000,000,000 a year in health care costs;\n            (2) sustained and targeted fire safety and prevention \n        education at the State and local levels, particularly in \n        identifiable high-risk populations, produces dramatic results \n        in preventing fires, fire deaths, and dollar losses from fire;\n            (3) in recent years, the fire safety and prevention \n        education budgets of fire departments in the United States have \n        been cut dramatically or, in many cases, eliminated;\n            (4) there is a need to expand the availability of State and \n        local fire safety and prevention education programs and \n        supporting resources and materials to help State agencies and \n        local fire departments in carrying out effective public \n        education;\n            (5) fire departments in other countries with fewer fire \n        deaths per capita than the United States spend an average of 4 \n        to 10 percent of the budgets of the departments on fire \n        prevention, versus less than 3 percent for United States fire \n        departments; and\n            (6) only by accurately collecting and analyzing data on \n        fire deaths, injuries, and dollar losses can United States fire \n        departments target the populations and regions where \n        educational efforts are most needed to create a more efficient \n        and effective use of resources.\n\nSEC. 3.
