FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Witness and victim intimidation at the juvenile and \n        young adult level is a serious, growing concern for State and \n        local prosecutors and law enforcement agencies.\n            (2) Each year, thousands of young people witness violent \n        crimes such as assaults, robbery, homicide, domestic violence, \n        and sexual abuse.\n            (3) In many cases, the lack of juvenile and young adult \n        witness participation has seriously impeded efforts to bring \n        violent perpetrators to justice.\n            (4) Prosecutors and police officers have become \n        increasingly frustrated by their inability to prosecute cases \n        successfully when young witnesses refuse to testify because \n        they fear retaliation by the defendant, or the defendant's \n        family or friends.\n            (5) Factors that contribute to the reluctance of young \n        witnesses to step forward include--\n                    (A) the fear and trauma associated with witnessing \n                a violent crime;\n                    (B) a personal connection with the perpetrator or \n                their associates;\n                    (C) geographic proximity to the perpetrator; and\n                    (D) membership in a culturally vulnerable group.\n            (6) The cooperation and participation of young victims and \n        witnesses in the criminal justice process, from crime reporting \n        through prosecution, are essential to the successful operation \n        of the criminal justice system.\n            (7) Though most States have witness assistance programs, \n        very few, if any, have adequate resources to address the unique \n        needs associated with juvenile and young adult witnesses.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage and promote \nthe creation and development of policies and programs by State and \nlocal prosecutors and law enforcement authorities that provide \nassistance to juvenile and young adult witnesses who cooperate with \nefforts to bring violent criminals to justice.\n\nSEC. 3.
