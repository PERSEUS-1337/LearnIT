FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) fiscal discipline, resulting from the Balanced Budget \n        Act of 1997, and strong economic growth have ended decades of \n        deficit spending and have produced budget surpluses without \n        using the social security surplus;\n            (2) fiscal pressures will mount in the future as the aging \n        of the population increases budget obligations;\n            (3) until Congress and the President agree to legislation \n        that strengthens Social Security, the social security surplus \n        should be used to reduce the debt held by the public;\n            (4) strengthening the Government's fiscal position through \n        public debt reduction increases national savings, promotes \n        economic growth, reduces interest costs, and is a constructive \n        way to prepare for the Government's future budget obligations; \n        and\n            (5) it is fiscally responsible and in the long-term \n        national economic interest to use a portion of the nonsocial \n        security surplus to reduce the debt held by the public.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) reduce the debt held by the public with the goal of \n        eliminating this debt by 2013; and\n            (2) decrease the statutory limit on the public debt.\n\nSEC. 3.
