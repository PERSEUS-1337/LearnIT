SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer \nProtection Act of 1997''.\n    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings and purpose.\nSec. 3. No preemption of State tort law.\nSec. 4. Limitation on liability for volunteers.\nSec. 5. Certification requirement and adjustment of Social Services \n                            Block Grant Program allotments.\nSec. 6. Definitions.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n        is deterred by potential personal liability for simple mistakes \n        made in the course of volunteer service;\n            (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n        organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n        associations, social service agencies, educational \n        institutions, local governments, foundations, and other civic \n        programs, have been adversely affected through the withdrawal \n        of volunteers from boards of directors and service in other \n        capacities;\n            (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n        is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n        programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were \n        participating; and\n            (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n        effective social service programs which depend heavily on \n        volunteer participation, protection of voluntarism through \n        clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n        assumed by the volunteer in connection with such participation \n        is an appropriate subject for Federal encouragement of State \n        reform.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote the \ninterests of social service program beneficiaries and taxpayers and to \nsustain the availability of programs and nonprofit organizations and \ngovernmental entities which depend on volunteer contributions by \nencouraging reasonable reform of State laws to provide protection from \npersonal financial liability to volunteers serving with nonprofit \norganizations and governmental entities for actions undertaken in good \nfaith on behalf of such organizations.\n\nSEC. 3. NO PREEMPTION OF STATE TORT LAW.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preempt the laws of any \nState governing tort liability actions.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n    (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as provided in \nsubsections (b) and (d), any volunteer of a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity shall incur no personal financial liability for any \ntort claim alleging damage or injury from any act or omission of the \nvolunteer on behalf of the organization or entity if--\n            (1) such volunteer was acting in good faith and within the \n        scope of such volunteer's official functions and duties with \n        the organization or entity; and\n            (2) such damage or injury was not caused by willful and \n        wanton misconduct by such volunteer.\n    (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers With Respect to \nOrganizations.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \nany civil action brought by any nonprofit organization or any \ngovernmental entity against any volunteer of such organization or \nentity.\n    (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization.--Nothing in this \nsection shall be construed to affect the liability of any nonprofit \norganization or governmental entity with respect to injury caused to \nany person.\n    (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--A State may \nimpose one or more of the following conditions on and exceptions to the \ngranting of liability protection to any volunteer of an organization or \nentity required by subsection (a):\n            (1) The organization or entity must adhere to risk \n        management procedures, including mandatory training of \n        volunteers, as defined by the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services by regulation.\n            (2) The organization or entity shall be liable for the acts \n        or omissions of its volunteers to the same extent as an \n        employer is liable, under the laws of that State, for the acts \n        or omissions of its employees.\n            (3) The protection from liability does not apply--\n                    (A) if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, \n                vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which the State \n                involved requires the operator or vehicle owner to \n                maintain insurance;\n                    (B) in the case of a suit brought by an appropriate \n                officer of a State or local government to enforce a \n                Federal, State, or local law; and\n                    (C) to the extent the claim would be covered under \n                any insurance policy.\n            (4) The protection from liability shall apply only if the \n        organization or entity provides a financially secure source of \n        recovery for individuals who suffer injury as a result of \n        actions taken by a volunteer on behalf of the organization or \n        entity. A financially secure source of recovery may be an \n        insurance policy within specified limits, comparable coverage \n        from a risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or \n        alternative arrangements that satisfy the State that the entity \n        will be able to pay for losses up to a specified amount. \n        Separate standards for different types of liability exposure \n        may be specified.\n\nSEC. 5. CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT AND ADJUSTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES \n              BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM ALLOTMENTS.\n\n    (a) Certification and Block Grant Allotments.--In the case of any \nState which certifies, not later than 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, to the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nthat it has enacted, adopted, or otherwise has in effect State law \nwhich substantially complies with section 4(a), the Secretary shall \nincrease by 1 percent the fiscal year allotment which would otherwise \nbe made to such State to carry out the Social Services Block Grant \nProgram under title XX of the Social Security Act.\n    (b) Continuation of Increase.--Any increase made under subsection \n(a) in an allotment to a State shall remain in effect only if the State \nmakes a certification to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nnot later than the end of each 1-year period occurring successively \nafter the end of the 2-year period described in subsection (a), that it \nhas in effect State law which substantially complies with section 4(a).\n\nSEC. 6.
