FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) The Government of Sudan has intensified its prosecution of \n    the war against areas outside of its control, which has already \n    cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than \n    4,000,000 people.\n        (2) A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored \n    peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best \n    chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of human \n    rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.\n        (3) Continued strengthening and reform of humanitarian relief \n    operations in Sudan is an essential element in the effort to bring \n    an end to the war.\n        (4) Continued leadership by the United States is critical.\n        (5) Regardless of the future political status of the areas of \n    Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, the \n    absence of credible civil authority and institutions is a major \n    impediment to achieving self-sustenance by the Sudanese people and \n    to meaningful progress toward a viable peace process. It is \n    critical that credible civil authority and institutions play an \n    important role in the reconstruction of post-war Sudan.\n        (6) Through the manipulation of traditional rivalries among \n    peoples in areas outside of its full control, the Government of \n    Sudan has used divide-and-conquer techniques effectively to \n    subjugate its population. However, internationally sponsored \n    reconciliation efforts have played a critical role in reducing \n    human suffering and the effectiveness of this tactic.\n        (7) The Government of Sudan utilizes and organizes militias, \n    Popular Defense Forces, and other irregular units for raiding and \n    enslaving parties in areas outside of the control of the Government \n    of Sudan in an effort to disrupt severely the ability of the \n    populations in those areas to sustain themselves. The tactic helps \n    minimize the Government of Sudan's accountability internationally.\n        (8) The Government of Sudan has repeatedly stated that it \n    intends to use the expected proceeds from future oil sales to \n    increase the tempo and lethality of the war against the areas \n    outside of its control.\n        (9) By regularly banning air transport relief flights by the \n    United Nations relief operation OLS, the Government of Sudan has \n    been able to manipulate the receipt of food aid by the Sudanese \n    people from the United States and other donor countries as a \n    devastating weapon of war in the ongoing effort by the Government \n    of Sudan to starve targeted groups and subdue areas of Sudan \n    outside of the Government's control.\n        (10) The acts of the Government of Sudan, including the acts \n    described in this section, constitute genocide as defined by the \n    Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n    Genocide (78 U.N.T.S. 277).\n        (11) The efforts of the United States and other donors in \n    delivering relief and assistance through means outside of OLS have \n    played a critical role in addressing the deficiencies in OLS and \n    offset the Government of Sudan's manipulation of food donations to \n    advantage in the civil war in Sudan.\n        (12) While the immediate needs of selected areas in Sudan \n    facing starvation have been addressed in the near term, the \n    population in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the \n    Government of Sudan are still in danger of extreme disruption of \n    their ability to sustain themselves.\n        (13) The Nuba Mountains and many areas in Bahr al Ghazal and \n    the Upper Nile and the Blue Nile regions have been excluded \n    completely from relief distribution by OLS, consequently placing \n    their populations at increased risk of famine.\n        (14) At a cost which has sometimes exceeded $1,000,000 per day, \n    and with a primary focus on providing only for the immediate food \n    needs of the recipients, the current international relief \n    operations are neither sustainable nor desirable in the long term.\n        (15) The ability of populations to defend themselves against \n    attack in areas outside of the control of the Government of Sudan \n    has been severely compromised by the disengagement of the front-\n    line states of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda, fostering the belief \n    among officials of the Government of Sudan that success on the \n    battlefield can be achieved.\n        (16) The United States should use all means of pressure \n    available to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war in \n    Sudan, including--\n            (A) the multilateralization of economic and diplomatic \n        tools to compel the Government of Sudan to enter into a good \n        faith peace process;\n            (B) the support or creation of viable democratic civil \n        authority and institutions in areas of Sudan outside of \n        government control;\n            (C) continued active support of people-to-people \n        reconciliation mechanisms and efforts in areas outside of \n        government control;\n            (D) the strengthening of the mechanisms to provide \n        humanitarian relief to those areas; and\n            (E) cooperation among the trading partners of the United \n        States and within multilateral institutions toward those ends.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n    ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on \n    International Relations of the House of Representatives and the \n    Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n        (2) Government of sudan.--The term ``Government of Sudan'' \n    means the National Islamic Front government in Khartoum, Sudan.\n        (3) OLS.--The term ``OLS'' means the United Nations relief \n    operation carried out by UNICEF, the World Food Program, and \n    participating relief organizations known as ``Operation Lifeline \n    Sudan''.\n\nSEC. 4. CONDEMNATION OF SLAVERY, OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, AND TACTICS \n              OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN.\n\n    The Congress hereby--\n        (1) condemns--\n            (A) violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict \n        in Sudan;\n            (B) the Government of Sudan's overall human rights record, \n        with regard to both the prosecution of the war and the denial \n        of basic human and political rights to all Sudanese;\n            (C) the ongoing slave trade in Sudan and the role of the \n        Government of Sudan in abetting and tolerating the practice;\n            (D) the Government of Sudan's use and organization of \n        ``murahalliin'' or ``mujahadeen'', Popular Defense Forces, and \n        regular Sudanese Army units into organized and coordinated \n        raiding and slaving parties in Bahr al Ghazal, the Nuba \n        Mountains, and the Upper Nile and the Blue Nile regions; and\n            (E) aerial bombardment of civilian targets that is \n        sponsored by the Government of Sudan; and\n        (2) recognizes that, along with selective bans on air transport \n    relief flights by the Government of Sudan, the use of raiding and \n    slaving parties is a tool for creating food shortages and is used \n    as a systematic means to destroy the societies, culture, and \n    economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and Nuba peoples in a policy of low-\n    intensity ethnic cleansing.\n\nSEC. 5.

SUPPORT FOR AN INTERNATIONALLY SANCTIONED PEACE PROCESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress hereby--\n        (1) recognizes that--\n            (A) a single, viable internationally and regionally \n        sanctioned peace process holds the greatest opportunity to \n        promote a negotiated, peaceful settlement to the war in Sudan; \n        and\n            (B) resolution to the conflict in Sudan is best made \n        through a peace process based on the Declaration of Principles \n        reached in Nairobi, Kenya, on July 20, 1994, and on the \n        Machakos Protocol in July 2002; and\n        (2) commends the efforts of Special Presidential Envoy, Senator \n    Danforth and his team in working to assist the parties to the \n    conflict in Sudan in finding a just, permanent peace to the \n    conflict in Sudan.\n    (b) Measures of Certain Conditions Not Met.--\n        (1) Presidential determination.--\n            (A) The President shall make a determination and certify in \n        writing to the appropriate congressional committees within 6 \n        months after the date of enactment of this Act, and each 6 \n        months thereafter, that the Government of Sudan and the Sudan \n        People's Liberation Movement are negotiating in good faith and \n        that negotiations should continue.\n            (B) If, under subparagraph (A) the President determines and \n        certifies in writing to the appropriate congressional \n        committees that the Government of Sudan has not engaged in good \n        faith negotiations to achieve a permanent, just, and equitable \n        peace agreement, or has unreasonably interfered with \n        humanitarian efforts, then the President, after consultation \n        with the Congress, shall implement the measures set forth in \n        paragraph (2).\n            (C) If, under paragraph (A) the President determines and \n        certifies in writing to the appropriate congressional \n        committees that the Sudan People's Liberation Movement has not \n        engaged in good faith negotiations to achieve a permanent, \n        just, and equitable peace agreement, then paragraph (2) shall \n        not apply to the Government of Sudan.\n            (D) If the President certifies to the appropriate \n        congressional committees that the Government of Sudan is not in \n        compliance with the terms of a permanent peace agreement \n        between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n        Liberation Movement, then the President, after consultation \n        with the Congress, shall implement the measures set forth in \n        paragraph (2).\n            (E) If, at any time after the President has made a \n        certification under subparagraph (B), the President makes a \n        determination and certifies in writing to the appropriate \n        congressional committees that the Government of Sudan has \n        resumed good faith negotiations, or makes a determination and \n        certifies in writing to the appropriate congressional \n        committees that the Government of Sudan is in compliance with a \n        peace agreement, then paragraph (2) shall not apply to the \n        Government of Sudan.\n        (2) Measures in support of the peace process.--Subject to the \n    provisions of paragraph (1), the President--\n            (A) shall, through the Secretary of the Treasury, instruct \n        the United States executive directors to each international \n        financial institution to continue to vote against and actively \n        oppose any extension by the respective institution of any loan, \n        credit, or guarantee to the Government of Sudan;\n            (B) should consider downgrading or suspending diplomatic \n        relations between the United States and the Government of \n        Sudan;\n            (C) shall take all necessary and appropriate steps, \n        including through multilateral efforts, to deny the Government \n        of Sudan access to oil revenues to ensure that the Government \n        of Sudan neither directly nor indirectly utilizes any oil \n        revenues to purchase or acquire military equipment or to \n        finance any military activities;
