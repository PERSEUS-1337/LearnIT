For \n        purposes of this paragraph, allowable offsets based on such \n        benefits consist of offsets equal to all or part of the actual \n        benefit payment amounts, reasonable projections or estimations \n        of such benefit payment amounts, or actuarial equivalents of \n        such actual benefit payment amounts, projections, or \n        estimations (determined on the basis of reasonable actuarial \n        assumptions).\n            (4) Compliance with rules permitting disparity in plan \n        contributions or benefits.--A pension plan described in \n        subsection (c) shall not be treated as failing to meet the \n        requirements of section 204(b)(1)(H) of the Employee Retirement \n        Income Security Act of 1974 or section 411(b)(1)(H) of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 solely because the plan provides \n        a disparity in contributions or benefits with respect to which \n        the requirements of section 401(l) of the Internal Revenue Code \n        of 1986 are met.\n            (5) Pre-retirement indexing.--\n                    (A) In general.--A pension plan described in \n                subsection (c) shall not be treated as failing to meet \n                the requirements of section 204(b)(1)(H) of the \n                Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or \n                section 411(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n                1986 solely because the plan provides for pre-\n                retirement indexing of accrued benefits under the plan.\n                    (B) Definition.--For purposes of this clause, the \n                term ``pre-retirement indexing'' means, in connection \n                with an accrued benefit, the periodic adjustment of the \n                accrued benefit by means of the application of a \n                recognized index or methodology so as to protect the \n                economic value of the benefit against inflation prior \n                to distribution.\n    (b) Determinations of Accrued Benefit as Balance of Benefit \nAccount.--\n            (1) In general.--A pension plan described in subsection (c) \n        under which the accrued benefit payable under the plan upon \n        distribution (or any portion thereof) is expressed as the \n        balance of a hypothetical account maintained for the \n        participant shall not be treated as failing to meet the \n        requirements of section 203(a)(2) or 205(g) of the Employee \n        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or section 411(a)(2) or \n        417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 solely because of \n        the amount actually made available for such distribution under \n        the terms of the plan, in any case in which the applicable \n        interest rate that would be used under the terms of the plan to \n        project the amount of the participant's account balance to \n        normal retirement age is not greater than a market rate of \n        return.\n            (2) Regulations.--The Secretary of the Treasury may provide \n        by regulation for rules governing the calculation of a market \n        rate of return for purposes of paragraph (1) and for \n        permissible methods of crediting interest to the account \n        (including variable interest rates) resulting in effective \n        rates of return meeting the requirements of paragraph (1).\n    (c) Pension Plan Described.--A pension plan described in this \nsubsection is a defined benefit plan (as defined in section 3(35) of \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or section 414(j) \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) maintained by the Young Women's \nChristian Association Retirement Fund, a corporation created by an Act \nof the State of New York which became law on April 12, 1924.\n\nSEC. 3.
