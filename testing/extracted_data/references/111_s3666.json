    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Passport Identity Verification \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A United States passport is an official government \n        document issued by the Department of State, which can be \n        obtained by United States nationals.\n            (2) A valid United States passport has many uses, \n        including--\n                    (A) certifying an individual's identity and \n                verifying that a person is a United States national;\n                    (B) allowing the passport holder to travel to \n                foreign countries with an internationally recognized \n                travel document;\n                    (C) facilitating international travel;\n                    (D) obtaining further identification documents; and\n                    (E) setting up bank accounts.\n            (3) A United States national may obtain a United States \n        passport for the first time by applying in person to a passport \n        acceptance facility with 2 passport photographs, proof of \n        United States nationality, and a valid form of photo \n        identification, such as a driver's license. Passport acceptance \n        facilities are located throughout the United States.\n            (4) Because United States passports issued under a false \n        identity enable individuals to conceal their movements and \n        activities, passport fraud could facilitate--\n                    (A) acts of terrorism;\n                    (B) espionage; and\n                    (C) other crimes, such as illegal immigration, \n                money laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and \n                alien smuggling.\n            (5) Since malicious individuals may seek to exploit \n        potential vulnerabilities in the passport issuance process, it \n        is important that personnel who are involved in the granting, \n        refusal, revocation, or adjudication of United States passport \n        applications have access to certain information contained in \n        Federal, State, and other databases for the purpose of--\n                    (A) verifying the identity of a passport applicant; \n                or\n                    (B) detecting passport fraud.\n            (6) In its final report, the National Commission on \n        Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the \n        ``9/11 Commission'') concluded that funding and completing a \n        ``biometric entry-exit screening system'' for travelers to and \n        from the United States is essential to our national security.\n            (7) The use of biometrics and technology for foreign \n        nationals who are visiting the country helps to make travel \n        simple, easy, and convenient for legitimate visitors and \n        dramatically improves the ability to detect the activities of \n        those who wish to do harm or violate United States laws.\n\nSEC. 3. ACCESS TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND OTHER DATABASES.\n\n    (a) Powers and Duties of the Secretary of State.--Section 104 of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1104) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(f) Law Enforcement Activities.--Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, the powers, duties, and functions conferred upon \nDepartment of State personnel relating to the granting, refusal, \nrevocation, or adjudication of passports shall be considered law \nenforcement activities that involve the administration of criminal \njustice (as defined in section 20.3 of title 28, Code of Federal \nRegulations) when such personnel seek to--\n            ``(1) verify the identity of a passport applicant;
