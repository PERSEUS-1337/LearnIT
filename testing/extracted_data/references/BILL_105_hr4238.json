FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) over 51 million American workers, representing about \n        half of the private-sector workforce, do not have an employer-\n        provided pension;\n            (2) 600,000 private pension plans are sponsored by firms \n        with less than 100 employees;\n            (3) 32 million Americans working for small businesses do \n        not have employer-provided pensions;\n            (4) over $3,500,000,000,000 is invested in the private \n        pension system;\n            (5) approximately $400,000,000,000 is invested in pension \n        plans serving companies with less than 100 employees;\n            (6) billions of dollars in small pension plans are \n        potentially at risk because they are held by unregulated \n        persons;\n            (7) public confidence in the private pension system is \n        eroded when workers and their families lose their retirement \n        assets due to fraud, embezzlement, or mismanagement;\n            (8) it is a goal of the Congress to improve private pension \n        security for employees of small businesses;\n            (9) it is a goal and the responsibility of the Congress to \n        protect the assets of small plans, not only for the benefit of \n        workers and their families, but also to increase public \n        confidence in the private pension system, thereby encouraging \n        greater participation in the system; and\n            (10) protection of the assets of small pension plans must \n        be balanced against regulatory burdens which can discourage \n        small businesses from offering pension plans.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide an enhanced level of protection for the \n        assets of small pension plans;\n            (2) to give the employees and owners of small businesses \n        the tools to ensure that their retirement assets are being \n        handled in a secure fashion;\n            (3) to increase public confidence in the private pension \n        system;\n            (4) to ensure that the employees of small businesses know \n        how to obtain accurate information about their pension plan \n        assets; and\n            (5) to provide clear, enforceable standards governing \n        disclosure of financial information by custodians of small \n        pension plans to workers and their families.\n\nSEC. 3.
