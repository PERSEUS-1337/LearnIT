FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Information technology is central to the effectiveness, \n        efficiency, and reliability of the industry and commercial \n        services, Armed Forces and national security systems, and the \n        critical infrastructure of the United States.\n            (2) Cyber criminals, terrorists, and agents of foreign \n        powers have taken advantage of the connectivity of the United \n        States to inflict substantial damage to the economic and \n        national security interests of the Nation.\n            (3) The cyber security threat is sophisticated, relentless, \n        and massive, exposing all consumers in the United States to the \n        risk of substantial harm.\n            (4) Businesses in the United States are bearing enormous \n        losses as a result of criminal cyber attacks, depriving \n        businesses of hard-earned profits that could be reinvested in \n        further job-producing innovation.\n            (5) Hackers continuously probe the networks of Federal and \n        State agencies, the Armed Forces, and the commercial industrial \n        base of the Armed Forces, and already have caused substantial \n        damage and compromised sensitive and classified information.\n            (6) Severe cyber security threats will continue, and will \n        likely grow, as the economy of the United States grows more \n        connected, criminals become increasingly sophisticated in \n        efforts to steal from consumers, industries, and businesses in \n        the United States, and terrorists and foreign nations continue \n        to use cyberspace as a means of attack against the national and \n        economic security of the United States.\n            (7) Public awareness of cyber security threats is essential \n        to cyber security defense. Only a well-informed public and \n        Congress can make the decisions necessary to protect consumers, \n        industries, and the national and economic security of the \n        United States.\n            (8) As of 2011, the level of public awareness of cyber \n        security threats is unacceptably low. Only a tiny portion of \n        relevant cyber security information is released to the public. \n        Information about attacks on Federal Government systems is \n        usually classified. Information about attacks on private \n        systems is ordinarily kept confidential. Sufficient mechanisms \n        do not exist to provide meaningful threat reports to the public \n        in unclassified and anonymized form.\n\nSEC. 3. CYBER INCIDENTS AGAINST GOVERNMENT NETWORKS.\n\n    (a) Department of Homeland Security.--Not later than 180 days after \nthe date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security shall submit to Congress a report that--\n            (1) summarizes major cyber incidents involving networks of \n        executive agencies (as defined in section 105 of title 5, \n        United States Code), except for the Department of Defense;\n            (2) provides aggregate statistics on the number of breaches \n        of networks of executive agencies, the volume of data \n        exfiltrated, and the estimated cost of remedying the breaches; \n        and\n            (3) discusses the risk of cyber sabotage.\n    (b) Department of Defense.--Not later than 180 days after the date \nof enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of \nDefense shall submit to Congress a report that--\n            (1) summarizes major cyber incidents against networks of \n        the Department of Defense and the military departments;\n            (2) provides aggregate statistics on the number of breaches \n        against networks of the Department of Defense and the military \n        departments, the volume of data exfiltrated, and the estimated \n        cost of remedying the breaches; and\n            (3) discusses the risk of cyber sabatoge.\n    (c) Form of Reports.--Each report submitted under this section \nshall be in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex as \nnecessary to protect sources, methods, and national security.\n\nSEC. 4.
