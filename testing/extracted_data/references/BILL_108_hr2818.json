a Dream''.\n            (2) Raul Julia, after only 3 years of living in New York \n        City, was instrumental in opening doors for nontraditional \n        parts for Hispanic actors by taking the

Hispanic Shakespearean actor \n        in New York and the first to establish a decades-long \n        association with Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare \n        Festival.\n            (4) Raul Julia began an impressive and productive 28-year \n        association with Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare \n        Festival as Macduff in the Festival's Mobile Unit, Spanish \n        language production of MacBeth.\n            (5) Raul Julia became the first Puerto Rican actor to \n        conquer Broadway stages by having his work be nominated for 4 \n        different Tony

      (8) Raul Julia's dedication to help Hispanic-American film \n        and television writers develop their work led him to co-found \n        the Latino Playwrights Reading Workshops.\n

world hunger.\n            (12) Raul Julia was tireless in his commitment to the \n        Puerto Rican film industry and to the making of Spanish \n        language films and continued to participate in small, \n        independent, Spanish-language films even after having become a \n        Hollywood star.\n            (13) Raul Julia was an extremely successful stage, film and \n        television actor who never abandoned his Puerto Rican heritage, \n        never changed his name and never gave up his accent, thereby \n        becoming an enduring role model for hundreds of Latino actors.\n            (14) Raul Julia received the Hispanic Heritage Award \n        recognizing his many career achievements for the Latino \n        community, including his involvement in ``La

Julia was given a state funeral in Puerto Rico \n        and since that time there have been many awards and honors \n        created in his name: a scholarship at Julliard, a scholarship \n        given to a promising young actor for the purpose of studying \n        and performing Shakespeare at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, \n        the Raul Julia Award for Excellence given annually by the \n        National Endowment for the Hispanic Arts in Washington, DC, El \n        Teatro Raul Julia in San Juan Puerto Rico, and the Raul Julia \n        Global Citizen Award, an annual award being given this year for \n        the first time by the Puerto Rican Family Institute based in \n        New York City.\n            (19) Raul Julia was recognized by the office of the Mayor \n        of
