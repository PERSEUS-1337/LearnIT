FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to a 2003 Government Accountability Office \n        report, even after accounting for factors such as occupation, \n        industry, race, marital status, job tenure, and differing work \n        patterns, all of which affect earnings, women are paid, on \n        average, 80 cents compared to every dollar that men are paid.\n            (2) According to the same report, the earnings gap between \n        men and women has persisted without statistically significant \n        changes for the past two decades.\n            (3) According to a 2001 report by the Bureau of Labor \n        Statistics, the earnings gap among working men and women is \n        widest among parents.\n            (4) Some women choose to trade advancing in their careers \n        or higher earnings for a job offering the flexibility to manage \n        family responsibilities alongside work.\n            (5) According to a 2001 Government Accountability Office \n        study, in 1995 and 2000, female full-time managers earned less \n        than their male counterparts.\n            (6) According to the same study, in 7 of the 10 industries \n        studied, the earnings gap between female and male full-time \n        managers actually widened between 1995 and 2000.\n            (7) Women make up 46 percent of the workforce but represent \n        just 12 percent of all corporate officers.\n            (8) A reason for the continuing earnings disparity might be \n        discrimination as to which roles are considered acceptable for \n        men and women and how women are viewed in the workplace.\n            (9) According to the February 2004 Monthly Labor Review of \n        the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Labor \n        projects that the United States work force is growing at a rate \n        of 1 percent per year, in part due to the continually increased \n        presence of women.\n\nSEC. 2.
