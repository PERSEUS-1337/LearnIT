    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Identity Theft Prevention Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the crime of identity theft has become one of the major \n        law enforcement challenges of the new economy, as vast \n        quantities of sensitive, personal information are now \n        vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;\n            (2) in November 2002, Americans were alerted to the dangers \n        of identity theft when Federal prosecutors announced that 3 \n        individuals had allegedly sold the credit and personal \n        information of 30,000 people, the largest single identity theft \n        case in United States history;\n            (3) hundreds of thousands of Americans are victims of \n        identity theft each year, resulting in an annual cost to \n        industry of more than $3,500,000,000.\n            (4) several indicators reveal that despite increased public \n        awareness of the crime, the number of incidents of identity \n        theft continues to rise;\n            (5) in December 2001, the Federal Trade Commission received \n        an average of more than 3,000 identity theft calls per week, a \n        700 percent increase since the Identity Theft Data \n        Clearinghouse began operation in November 1999;\n            (6) allegations of social security number fraud increased \n        by 500 percent between 1998 and 2001, from 11,000 to 65,000;\n            (7) a national credit reporting agency reported that \n        consumer requests for fraud alerts increased by 53 percent \n        during fiscal year 2001;\n            (8) identity theft violates the privacy of American \n        citizens and ruins their good names;\n            (9) victims of identity theft may suffer restricted access \n        to credit and diminished employment opportunities, and may \n        spend years repairing the damage to credit histories caused by \n        identity theft;\n            (10) businesses and government agencies that handle \n        sensitive personal information of consumers have a \n        responsibility to protect this information from identity \n        thieves; and\n            (11) the private sector can better protect consumers by \n        implementing effective fraud alerts, affording greater consumer \n        access to credit reports, truncating of credit card numbers, \n        and establishing other prevention measures.\n\nSEC. 3. IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION.\n\n    (a) Changes of Address.--\n            (1) Duty of issuers of credit.--Section 132 of the Truth in \n        Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1642) is amended--\n                    (A) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``No \n                credit''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(b) Confirmation of Changes of Address.--If a card issuer \nreceives a request for an additional credit card with respect to an \nexisting credit account not later than 30 days after receiving \nnotification of a change of address for that account, the card issuer \nshall--\n            ``(1) not later than 5 days after sending the additional \n        card to the new address, notify the cardholder of the request \n        at both the new address and the former address; and\n            ``(2) provide to the cardholder a means of promptly \n        reporting incorrect changes.''.\n            (2) Enforcement.--\n                    (A) Federal trade commission.--Except as provided \n                in subparagraph (B), compliance with section 132(b) of \n                the Truth in Lending Act (as added by this subsection) \n                shall be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission in \n                the same manner and with the same power and authority \n                as the Commission has under the Fair Debt Collection \n                Practices Act to enforce compliance with that Act.\n                    (B) Other agencies in certain cases.--\n                            (i) In general.--Compliance with section \n                        132(b) of the Truth in Lending Act shall be \n                        enforced under--\n                                    (I) section 8 of the Federal \n                                Deposit Insurance Act, in the case of a \n                                card issuer that is--\n                                            (aa) a national bank or a \n                                        Federal branch or Federal \n                                        agency of a foreign bank, by \n                                        the Office of the Comptroller \n                                        of the Currency;\n                                            (bb) a member bank of the \n                                        Federal Reserve System (other \n                                        than a national bank), a branch \n                                        or agency of a foreign bank \n                                        (other than a Federal branch, \n                                        Federal agency, or insured \n                                        State branch of a foreign \n                                        bank), a commercial lending \n                                        company owned or controlled by \n                                        a foreign bank, or an \n                                        organization operating under \n                                        section 25 or 25A of the \n                                        Federal Reserve Act, by the \n                                        Board of Governors of the \n                                        Federal Reserve System;\n                                            (cc) a bank insured by the \n                                        Federal Deposit Insurance \n                                        Corporation (other than a \n                                        member of the Federal Reserve \n                                        System or a national nonmember \n                                        bank) or an insured State \n                                        branch of a foreign bank, by \n                                        the Board of Directors of the \n                                        Federal Deposit Insurance \n                                        Corporation;
