FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) New scientific research shows that experiences in the \n        first 3 years of life have a dramatic impact on brain \n        development.\n            (2) Experiences in the earliest years of a child's life are \n        critical to their cognitive, emotional, and physical \n        development.\n            (3) Nurturing and stimulating children in the first years \n        of life prepare them for the challenges of school and later \n        life.\n            (4) According to a Carnegie Corporation publication \n        entitled ``Years of Promise: A Comprehensive Strategy for \n        America's Children,'' kindergarten teachers estimate that 1 out \n        of every 3 children enters the classroom unprepared to meet the \n        challenges of kindergarten.\n            (5) Children who receive high quality child care services \n        are less likely to need special education, be retained a grade, \n        or engage in juvenile delinquency or other antisocial behavior \n        as they grow up.\n            (6) According to ``The State of America's Children, \n        Yearbook 1997,'' published by the Children's Defense Fund, \n        approximately 7,700,000 children less than 5 years of age are \n        being cared for by someone other than their parents while their \n        mothers work.\n            (7) Documented in the 1997 edition of ``Key Facts About \n        Child Care and Early Education: A Briefing Book,'' also \n        published by the Children's Defense Fund, is the fact that 60 \n        percent of mothers with children less than 6 years of age, and \n        52 percent of mothers with children less than 1 year of age, \n        are working outside the home.\n            (8) Demand for child care services in low-income \n        communities will rise dramatically through 2002 as a result of \n        the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work \n        Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193).\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide financial assistance to train, to support, \n        and to place as early childhood teaching professionals, parents \n        in families that receive assistance under State programs funded \n        under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act,\n            (2) to increase nationwide the number of qualified \n        individuals who provide early childhood education,\n            (3) to reduce dependency on assistance under State programs \n        funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act, and\n            (4) to increase the number of children who receive high \n        quality child care services.\n\nSEC. 3.
