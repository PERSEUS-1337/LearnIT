and\n            (E) institutions of higher education, eligible lenders, \n        guaranty agencies, and other entities participating in the \n        student assistance programs under title IV of the Act that are \n        located in areas that are declared disaster areas by any \n        Federal, State or local official in connection with a national \n        emergency, or whose operations are significantly affected by \n        such a disaster, may be granted temporary relief from \n        requirements that are rendered infeasible or unreasonable by a \n        national emergency, including due diligence requirements and \n        reporting deadlines.\n    (b) Notice of Waivers or Modifications.--\n        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 437 of the General \n    Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232) and section 553 of title \n    5, United States Code, the Secretary shall, by notice in the \n    Federal Register, publish the waivers or modifications of statutory \n    and regulatory provisions the Secretary deems necessary to achieve \n    the purposes of this section.\n        (2) Terms and conditions.--The notice under paragraph (1) shall \n    include the terms and conditions to be applied in lieu of such \n    statutory and regulatory provisions.\n        (3) Case-by-case basis.--The Secretary is not required to \n    exercise the waiver or modification authority under this section on \n    a case-by-case basis.\n    (c) Impact Report.--The Secretary shall, not later than 15 months \nafter first exercising any authority to issue a waiver or modification \nunder subsection (a), report to the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions of the Senate on the impact of any \nwaivers or modifications issued pursuant to subsection (a) on affected \nindividuals and the programs under title IV of the Act, and the basis \nfor such determination, and include in such report the Secretary's \nrecommendations for changes to the statutory or regulatory provisions \nthat were the subject of such waiver or modification.\n    (d) No Delay in Waivers and Modifications.--Sections 482(c) and 492 \nof the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1089(c), 1098a) shall \nnot apply to the waivers and modifications authorized or required by \nthis Act.\n\nSEC. 3.
