FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the safety and welfare of the public depends on the \n        provision of accurate and timely weather information;\n            (2) in general, the National Implementation Plan for \n        modernization of the National Weather Service required under \n        the Weather Service Modernization Act provides a cost effective \n        approach to initiation of weather service modernization;\n            (3) some geographic areas, including northern Alabama, \n        north central, northeastern, and southwestern Indiana, \n        southeastern Tennessee, southeastern Illinois, northern \n        California, southwestern and northeastern Texas, central \n        Oregon, central Idaho, central Nevada, northwestern Ohio, \n        northern Louisiana, northeastern Iowa, north-central Florida, \n        and northeastern Arizona, may not realize the full benefits of \n        weather service implementation under the plan; and\n            (4) there is a need to ensure, by means of an independent, \n        technical review, that the implementation of the weather \n        service modernization plan at specific sites fully meets the \n        intent of law and does not result in a degradation of existing \n        service, including no reduction in existing weather radar \n        coverage at an elevation of 10,000 feet.\n\nSEC. 3. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECRETARY.\n\n    (a) The Secretary of Commerce (in this Act referred to as the \n``Secretary'') shall provide for the public safety by ensuring that the \nimplementation of the National Implementation Plan for the \nmodernization of the National Weather Service required under the \nWeather Service Modernization Act (in this Act referred to as the \n``National Implementation Plan'') does not result in a degradation of \nservice in any specific geographic area, which shall include \nmaintaining radar coverage with no degradation of service for areas \nserved by the National Weather Service system, and also shall provide \nfor radar coverage in some areas which might not otherwise be adequate \nwith respect to specific unique weather phenomena which pose a \nsubstantial threat to public safety.\n    (b) Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and \nbiennially thereafter until 2 years have passed after the \nimplementation of the National Implementation Plan is completed, the \nSecretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register soliciting \npublic comment for a period of 60 days on specific geographic areas \nwhere there is uncertainty whether such implementation will result in \nor has resulted in any degradation in service.\n    (c) Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and \nwithin 60 days after the end of each biennial comment period under \nsubsection (b), the Secretary shall enter into an agreement for an \nindependent review, to be completed within 180 days, by the National \nResearch Council of the National Academy of Sciences. Such review \nshall, for each geographical area identified through a public comment \nperiod under subsection (b)--\n            (1) evaluate any unique or extraordinary weather conditions \n        in the area;\n            (2) consider the proposed NEXRAD radar coverage for the \n        area, particularly to determine if the area is or will be in an \n        area of weak radar coverage;\n            (3) consider the effects of closing any local Weather \n        Service office on local weather service and interaction with \n        local emergency management agencies; and\n            (4) consider the effects of transferring local warning \n        responsibility to a remote Weather Forecast Office, including \n        the effect on issuing weather warnings by that remote office \n        and communicating with emergency management personnel with \n        regard to weather emergencies.\n    (d) The National Research Council shall submit recommendations, \nincluding any dissenting views, to the Secretary regarding the need to \nsupplement the National Implementation Plan, revise any specific siting \nplans, establish radar coverage at altitudes less than 10,000 feet, or \nimprove radar coverage service.\n    (e) Within 60 days after receiving recommendations from the \nNational Research Council under subsection (d), the Secretary shall \ntransmit to the Congress a report containing--\n            (1) the recommendations of the National Research Council; \n        and\n            (2) the actions the Secretary proposes to take in response \n        to those recommendations.\n    (f) For any area identified through a public comment period under \nsubsection (b), the Secretary shall take no action which may result in \na reduction of public safety, including the closure of weather service \noffices, transfer of responsibilities or duties of those offices, \ndecommissioning of any warning radar, or transfer or reduction in \npersonnel in those offices, until such time as the independent review \nunder subsection (c) is completed and a report with respect to such \nreview is transmitted to the Congress under subsection (e).\n    (g) In carrying out this Act, the Secretary shall consult with the \nSecretary of Defense and with the Secretary of Transportation with \nrespect to coverage of those Department of Defense radars and \nDepartment of Transportation radars, respectively, which supplement the \ncivil system."
