    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the Howard M. Metzenbaum ``Menu Education \nand Labeling Act'' or the ``MEAL Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) research continues to reveal that--\n                    (A) there is a strong link between diet and health; \n                and\n                    (B) diet-related diseases start early in life;\n            (2)(A) increased caloric intake is a key factor \n        contributing to the alarming increase in obesity in the United \n        States;\n            (B) according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, \\2/3\\ of American adults are overweight or obese, \n        and the rates of obesity have doubled in children and tripled \n        in teens since 1980;\n            (C) obesity increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, \n        stroke, several types of cancer, and other health problems; and\n            (D) the annual cost of obesity to families, businesses, and \n        governments in the United States is $117,000,000,000;\n            (3) over the past 2 decades, there has been a significant \n        increase in the number of meals prepared or eaten outside the \n        home, with an estimated \\1/3\\ of calories and almost half of \n        total food dollars being spent on food purchased from or eaten \n        at restaurants and other food-service establishments;\n            (4)(A) excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor \n        for heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the \n        United States; and\n            (B) heart disease is a leading cause of disability among \n        working adults and its impact on the United States economy is \n        significant, estimated in 2005 to total $142,000,000,000 in \n        healthcare expenditures and lost productivity;\n            (5)(A) increased sodium intake is associated with increased \n        risk of high blood pressure, or hypertension, a condition that \n        can lead to cardiovascular disease, especially stroke; and\n            (B) the proportion of adults with high blood pressure is 45 \n        percent at age 50, 60 percent at age 60, and more than 70 \n        percent at age 70;\n            (6) the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 \n        (Public Law 101-535) requires food manufacturers to provide \n        nutrition information on almost all packaged foods, however, \n        restaurant foods are exempt from those requirements unless a \n        nutrient content or health claim is made for a menu item;\n            (7) about 75 percent of adults report using food labels on \n        packaged foods, which is associated with eating more healthful \n        diets, and approximately half of people report that the \n        nutrition information on food labels has caused them to change \n        their minds about buying a food product;\n            (8) it is difficult for consumers to limit their intake of \n        calories at restaurants, given the limited availability of \n        nutrition information;\n            (9) studies show that consumers would like nutrition \n        information to be provided at the time of ordering their food \n        at a restaurant, at the point of the sale, so as to enable them \n        to make an educated decision regarding what to order; and\n            (10) a call to action from the Surgeon General and \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services recommends that, to \n        reduce the incidence of obesity, there be increased \n        availability of nutrition information for foods eaten and \n        prepared away from home.\n\nSEC. 3. NUTRITION LABELING OF STANDARD MENU ITEMS AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS.\n\n    Section 403(q)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \nU.S.C. 343(q)(5)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (A)--\n                    (A) in subclause (i), by inserting ``except as \n                provided in clauses (H) and (I),'' before ``which'' the \n                first place it appears;
