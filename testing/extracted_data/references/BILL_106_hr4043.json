FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) a sharp, sustained increase in the price of crude oil \n        would negatively affect the overall economic well-being of the \n        United States;\n            (2) the United States currently imports roughly 55 percent \n        of its oil;\n            (3) the oil market is often greatly influenced by \n        nonmarket-based supply manipulations, including price fixing \n        and production quotas; and\n            (4) heating oil price increases disproportionately harm the \n        poor and the elderly.\n\nSEC. 102.
