FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There should be no unreasonable barriers or impediments \n        to the ability of individuals enrolled in health care plans to \n        obtain appropriate specialized medical services.\n            (2) The patient's first point of contact in a health care \n        plan must be encouraged to make all appropriate medical \n        referrals and should not be constrained financially from making \n        such referrals.\n            (3) Some health care plans may impede timely access to \n        specialty care.\n            (4) At any time, patients must be able to access out-of-\n        network items, treatment, and services at an additional cost to \n        the patient which is not so prohibitive that they are deterred \n        from seeing the health care provider of their own choice.\n            (5) Specialty care must be available for the full duration \n        of the patient's medical needs and not limited by time or \n        number of visits.\n            (6) Direct access to specialty care is essential for \n        patients in emergency and nonemergency situations and for \n        patients with chronic and temporary conditions.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION FOR MEDICARE HMO ENROLLEES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1876 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395mm) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (c)(1), by striking ``subsection (e)'' \n        and inserting ``subsections (e) and (k)'', and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(k) Beneficiary Protection.--\n            ``(1) Minimum loss ratio.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Each eligible organization shall \n                have a loss-ratio that is not less than 85 percent for \n                each contract year.\n                    ``(B) Loss ratio defined.--In subparagraph (A), the \n                term `loss-ratio' means, with respect to an \n                organization for a contract year, the ratio of (i) the \n                anticipated aggregate benefits provided under this \n                section to enrollees for the year, to (ii) the \n                aggregate amount of the premiums collected (including \n                payments to the organization under subsection (a) for \n                the year, as estimated on the basis of incurred claims \n                experience and earned premium for the year.\n            ``(2) Assuring adequate in-network access.--\n                    ``(A) Timely access.--An eligible organization that \n                restricts the providers from whom benefits may be \n                obtained must guarantee to enrollees under this section \n                timely access to primary and specialty health care \n                providers who are appropriate to the enrollee's \n                condition.\n                    ``(B) Access to specialized care.--Enrollees must \n                have access to specialized treatment when the treating \n                provider deems necessary.
