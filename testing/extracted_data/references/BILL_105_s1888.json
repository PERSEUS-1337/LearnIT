FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) By exercising its authority under article I, section 8, \n        clause 3 of the United States Constitution, Congress may best \n        achieve a consistent and coherent national policy regarding \n        regulation and taxation of Internet activity and the \n        concomitant uniformity, simplicity, and fairness that is needed \n        to avoid burdening this evolving form of interstate and foreign \n        commerce.\n            (2) Because the Federal Government and State and local \n        governments will have numerous reasons to interact over the \n        Internet with the individuals and companies that use it, a \n        lexicon of terms relating to the Internet and its use is vital.\n            (3) A limited number of States have already adopted by law \n        or regulation various forms of taxes that apply to commercial \n        activity that are unique to the Internet or to providers of \n        Internet services.\n            (4) There are approximately 30,000 separate taxing \n        jurisdictions in the United States, thus presenting the \n        potential for an enormous variety of taxes and tax rates on \n        Internet activity.\n            (5) The unique character of the Internet transcends \n        physical and political boundaries and permits commercial and \n        intellectual communications to move from city to city, State to \n        State, and nation to nation without any set path in a manner \n        that is virtually unparalleled in history.\n            (6) The Internet is a global network that offers the \n        potential for entrepreneurial individuals and small businesses \n        throughout the United States to reach customers and markets \n        throughout the world with their products and services.\n            (7) The United States must create an example for the rest \n        of the world by preventing discriminatory taxation on Internet \n        activities so that the United States can persuade our trading \n        partners to resist the temptation to tax such activities and \n        thereby limit the potential growth of such activities.\n            (8) The innovation and creativity that has helped computer \n        technology evolve into the present-day Internet has thrived in \n        a tax-free environment and should be granted protection from \n        local, State, and Federal taxation in order to permit this new \n        medium to reach its fullest potential.\n            (9) The President should seek bilateral and multilateral \n        agreements through the World Trade Organization, the \n        Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Asia \n        Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, and other appropriate \n        international organizations and fora to establish that \n        commercial transactions using the Internet are free from tariff \n        and discriminatory taxation.\n\nSEC. 3.
