APPROVAL OF APPLICATIONS FOR CERTAIN DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL IMAGING \n              DEVICES.\n\n    Section 520 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (42 U.S.C. \n360j) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n   ``Diagnostic Imaging Devices Intended for Use With Contrast Agents\n\n    ``(p)(1) The Secretary may, subject to the succeeding provisions of \nthis subsection, approve an application (or supplement to such an \napplication) submitted under section 515 with respect to an applicable \nmedical imaging device, or, in the case of an applicable medical \nimaging device for which a notification was submitted under section \n510(k) (or a supplement to such a notification), may make a substantial \nequivalence determination with respect to such applicable medical \nimaging device, if the indications and conditions of use proposed in \nsuch application or notification do not involve the use of a contrast \nagent--\n            ``(A) in a concentration, rate of administration, or route \n        of administration that is different from those described in the \n        approved labeling of the contrast agent;\n            ``(B) in a region, organ, or system of the body that is \n        different from those described in the approved labeling of the \n        contrast agent, unless the Secretary determines, based on \n        information contained in the application or notification \n        involved, that the difference does not reduce the safety of the \n        contrast agent when used with the device;\n            ``(C) in a new patient population for which the contrast \n        agent is determined by the Secretary to pose an increased risk; \n        or\n            ``(D) in an imaging modality (such as an ultrasonic, \n        ionizing radiation, or magnetic resonance imagine modality) \n        that is different from those described in the approved labeling \n        of the contrast agent.\n    ``(2) The agency center charged with premarket review of devices \nshall have primary jurisdiction with respect to the review of an \napplication or notification described in paragraph (1).
