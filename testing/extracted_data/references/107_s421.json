    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Gifted and Talented Students \nEducation Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Gifted and talented students give evidence of high \n        performance capability in specific academic fields, or in areas \n        such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership \n        capacity, and require services or activities not ordinarily \n        provided by a school in order to fully develop such \n        capabilities. Gifted and talented students are from all \n        cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic \n        groups. Some such students have disabilities and for some, \n        English is not their first language. Many students from such \n        diverse backgrounds have been historically underrepresented in \n        gifted education programs.\n            (2) Because gifted and talented students generally are more \n        advanced academically, are able to learn more quickly and study \n        in more depth and complexity than others their age, the \n        students have special educational needs that require \n        opportunities and experiences that are different from those \n        generally available in regular education programs.\n            (3) Parents and families are essential partners to schools \n        in developing appropriate educational services for gifted and \n        talented students. They need access to information, research, \n        and support regarding the characteristics of gifted children \n        and their educational and social and emotional needs, as well \n        as information on available strategies and resources for \n        education in State and local communities.\n            (4) There currently is no Federal requirement to identify \n        or serve the Nation's approximately 3,000,000 gifted and \n        talented students.\n            (5) While some States and local educational agencies \n        allocate resources to educate gifted and talented students, \n        others do not. Additionally, State laws and State and local \n        funding, identification, and accountability mechanisms vary \n        widely, resulting in a vast disparity of services for this \n        special-needs population.\n            (6) If the United States is to compete successfully in the \n        global economy, it is important that more students achieve to \n        higher levels, and that highly capable students receive an \n        education that prepares them to perform the most highly \n        innovative and creative work that is necessary in today's \n        workplace.\n            (7) The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in \n        the United States on the Third International Mathematics and \n        Science Study (TIMSS) was among the lowest in the world. In \n        each of 5 physics content areas in the study and in each of 3 \n        math content areas in the study, the performance of physics and \n        advanced mathematics students in the United States was among \n        the lowest of the participating countries.\n            (8) Elementary school students who are gifted and talented \n        have already mastered 35 to 50 percent of the material covered \n        in a school year in several subject areas before the school \n        year begins.\n            (9) In 1990, fewer than 2 cents out of every $100 spent on \n        elementary and secondary education in the United States was \n        devoted to providing challenging programming for the Nation's \n        gifted and talented students.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to \nStates to support programs, classes, and other services designed to \nmeet the needs of the Nation's gifted and talented students in \nelementary schools and secondary schools.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION AND ACTIVITIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--If the amount appropriated under section 11 for a \nfiscal year equals or exceeds $50,000,000, then the Secretary may award \ngrants to State educational agencies from allotments under section 4 to \nenable the State educational agencies to award grants to local \neducational agencies under section 6 for developing or expanding gifted \nand talented education programs, and providing direct educational \nservices and materials through 1 or more of the following activities:\n            (1) Developing and implementing programs to address State \n        and local needs for inservice training programs for general \n        educators, specialists in gifted and talented education, \n        administrators, school counselors, or other personnel at the \n        elementary and secondary levels.\n            (2) Making materials and services available through State \n        regional education service centers, universities, colleges, or \n        other entities.\n            (3) Providing direct educational services and materials to \n        gifted and talented students, which may include curriculum \n        compacting, modified or adapted curriculum, acceleration, \n        independent study, and dual enrollment.\n            (4) Supporting innovative approaches and curricula used by \n        local educational agencies, individual schools, or consortia of \n        schools or local educational agencies.\n            (5) Providing challenging, high-level course work to \n        individual students or groups of students in schools and school \n        districts that do not have the resources to otherwise provide \n        the courses through new and emerging technologies, including \n        distance learning, developing curriculum packages, compensating \n        distance-learning educators, or providing other relevant \n        activities or services, but not for purchasing or upgrading of \n        technological hardware.\n    (b) State Infrastructure Costs.--\n            (1) In general.--A State educational agency may use not \n        more than 10 percent of the funds received under this Act for--\n                    (A) establishment and implementation of a peer \n                review process for grant applications under section 7;\n                    (B) supervision of the awarding of funds to local \n                educational agencies (including consortia of local \n                educational agencies) to support gifted and talented \n                students in the State;\n                    (C) planning, supervision, and processing of funds \n                made available under this Act;\n                    (D) monitoring and evaluation of programs and \n                activities assisted under this Act;\n                    (E) dissemination of general program information;\n                    (F) creating a State gifted education advisory \n                board; and\n                    (G) providing technical assistance under this \n                section.\n            (2) Education and support.--Not more than 2 percent of the \n        total amount received under this Act by the State may be used \n        by the State educational agency to provide information, \n        education, and support to parents and caregivers of gifted and \n        talented children to enhance their ability to participate in \n        decisions regarding their children's educational programs.
