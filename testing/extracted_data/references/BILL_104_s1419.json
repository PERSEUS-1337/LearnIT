FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nigeria is one of the most important countries in \n        Africa, with the largest population on the continent, a \n        critically important role in West Africa, and tremendous \n        economic and human potential.\n            (2) The American and Nigerian people have enjoyed a long \n        history of friendship and cooperation.\n            (3) Since independence in 1960, Nigeria has experienced a \n        series of military and civilian governments, marked by coups \n        and political instability, including the devastating and tragic \n        civil war in the Biafra region.\n            (4) On June 12, 1993, Nigeria held a presidential election, \n        which most observers believe generally represented the will of \n        the Nigerian people despite imperfections in the electoral \n        process, but the Nigerian military government nullified that \n        election and later installed an interim government.\n            (5) On September 23, 1993, General Sani Abacha overthrew \n        the interim government and assumed power in a military coup, \n        and more than two years later, on October 1, 1995, he announced \n        a three-year transition to democratic elections, a period \n        widely regarded as unnecessarily long.\n            (6) The rule of General Abacha has been marked by egregious \n        human rights abuses, a devastating economic decline, and \n        rampant corruption.\n            (7) On November 10, 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa, an \n        internationally-recognized human rights activist, and eight \n        others, were executed following a seriously-flawed judicial \n        proceeding despite numerous pleas for clemency from the \n        international community; others, including M.K.O. Abiola, \n        General Obasanjo, Beko Ransome-Kuti, and General Sheu Musa \n        Yar'Adua, have been sentenced in secret tribunals to long \n        prison terms.\n            (8) Since 1993, the United States and other members of the \n        international community, including Great Britain, have imposed \n        limited sanctions against Nigeria to promote human rights and \n        an expeditious transition to civilian, democratic government, \n        but these efforts have had limited impact.\n            (9) The continued military rule of General Abacha \n        undermines confidence in the Nigerian economy, damages \n        relations between Nigeria and the United States, threatens the \n        political and economic stability of West Africa, and harms the \n        lives of the people of Nigeria.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    The Congress declares that the United States, working in concert \nwith the international community, should maintain a policy toward the \nGovernment of Nigeria that is designed to protect internationally \nrecognized human rights, expedite the transition to civilian, \ndemocratic government, and promote equitable economic development in \nNigeria.\n\nSEC. 4.
