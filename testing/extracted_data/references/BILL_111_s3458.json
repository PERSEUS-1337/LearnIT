FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Despite the significant progress businesses owned by \n        socially and economically disadvantaged individuals have made \n        as a result of the business development program under section \n        8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)), such \n        businesses remain subject to discrimination that creates \n        substantial barriers to success in the marketplace. The \n        business development program under section 8(a) of the Small \n        Business Act reflects the commitment of the Nation to \n        eradicating discriminatory barriers to the formation and \n        development of viable businesses by socially and economically \n        disadvantaged individuals.\n            (2) Recent evidence presented in Congressional hearings, \n        roundtables, and academic studies demonstrates, among other \n        things, the following:\n                    (A) Significant disparities still exist between the \n                number, size, and income of businesses owned by \n                socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and \n                other businesses. These disparities remain even after \n                controlling for factors such as industry, geography, \n                education, age, and labor market status.\n                    (B) Discrimination still limits the ability of \n                socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to \n                access capital. Socially and economically disadvantaged \n                individuals are more often denied loans than \n                individuals who are not minorities, and often pay \n                higher rates of interest on small business loans.\n                    (C) Socially and economically disadvantaged \n                individuals who own businesses often experience--\n                            (i) discrimination from prime contractors \n                        and exclusion from critical business networks; \n                        and\n                            (ii) discrimination by bonding companies \n                        and suppliers that impedes the ability of the \n                        businesses to compete equally for Government \n                        contracts.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act, the terms ``Administration'' and ``Administrator'' \nmeans the Small Business Administration and the Administrator thereof, \nrespectively.\n\nSEC. 4.
