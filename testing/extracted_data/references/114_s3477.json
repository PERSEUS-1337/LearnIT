FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is caused by the \n        reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that causes \n        chickenpox in childhood. The virus can reactivate later in \n        life, resulting in a painful, itchy rash that can persist for \n        weeks, months, or years. Not only does the risk of herpes \n        zoster itself increase with age, but, among individuals who \n        experience herpes zoster, older individuals are much more \n        likely to experience postherpetic neuralgia non-pain \n        complications, hospitalizations, and interference with \n        activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and \n        bathing.\n            (2) Postherpetic neuralgia, a complication of shingles, \n        occurs rarely among individuals under age 40 but can occur in \n        up to \\1/3\\ of untreated individuals age 60 and older.\n            (3) The Food and Drug Administration approved the herpes \n        zoster vaccine for individuals age 50 and older. The Advisory \n        Committee on Immunization Practices presently recommends the \n        herpes zoster vaccine for all individuals age 60 and older.\n            (4) The Healthy People 2020 target baseline for the herpes \n        zoster vaccine is 30 percent coverage for individuals age 60 \n        and over. This benchmark is unfortunately low compared to that \n        of other adult vaccines such as influenza (70 percent) and \n        pneumococcal disease (60 percent). Even at such a low target, \n        the coverage rate is not being met. The Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention reported that in 2014, only 28 percent \n        of adults age 60 and older reported receiving the herpes zoster \n        vaccine.\n            (5) According to the 2014 National Health Interview Survey \n        of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccination \n        rates for adults are 20 percent for Tetanus, Diphtheria, and \n        Pertussis, 28 percent for shingles, 24 percent for Hepatitis B, \n        and 61 percent for pneumonia. There are also disparities across \n        adult vaccination rates. Adult immunization rates are generally \n        lower among Hispanics, African-Americans, and Asians.\n            (6) Medicare coverage for the herpes zoster vaccine under \n        the Prescription Drug Program under part D of title XVIII of \n        the Social Security Act has resulted in many barriers to \n        optimal and consistent uptake to prevent shingles and its \n        costly and painful complications.\n            (7) Lack of awareness and logistical and financial \n        challenges are the most often cited reasons for Medicare \n        beneficiaries not being immunized against the varicella-zoster \n        virus.\n            (8) Herpes zoster is estimated to account for more than \n        87,000 emergency room visits and 28,000 inpatient admissions \n        each year. Average costs across the episode of care were $1,835 \n        and $14,428 per patient in the outpatient and inpatient \n        settings, respectively.\n\nSEC. 3.
