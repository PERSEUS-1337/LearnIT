STRATEGY FOR PROMOTING THE SECURITY OF AFGHAN WOMEN AND GIRLS \n              DURING THE SECURITY TRANSITION PROCESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Department of Defense's April 2012 \n        Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n        Afghanistan:\n                    (A) ``U.S. and coalition forces will continue to \n                degrade the Taliban-led insurgency in order to provide \n                time and space to increase the capacity of the Afghan \n                National Security Forces and the Afghan Government so \n                they can assume full responsibility for Afghanistan's \n                security by the end of 2014.''.\n                    (B) ``Transition to Afghan security lead began in \n                July 2011 and transition to full Afghan security \n                responsibility will be complete country-wide by the end \n                of 2014.''.\n                    (C) ``The security of the Afghan people and the \n                stability of the government are used to judge \n                provincial readiness to move to each successive stage \n                of transition implementation.''.\n                    (D) For each area designated for transition, a \n                transition implementation plan is developed by the \n                Government of Afghanistan, NATO, and ISAF and approved \n                by the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB). JANIB \n                is also responsible for recommending areas to enter and \n                exit the transition process.\n            (2) According to a 2002 study on Women, Peace and Security \n        submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations \n        pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), ``the \n        suspension of or restriction on women's enjoyment of their \n        human rights'' can act as an early-warning indicator of \n        impending or renewed conflict. In Afghanistan, restrictions on \n        women's mobility and rights can signal the presence of \n        extremist or insurgent elements in a community.\n            (3) The security of Afghan women and girls in areas \n        undergoing security transitions will be an important gauge of \n        the transition strategy's success. Indicators by which to \n        measure women's security include the mobility of women and \n        girls, the participation of women in local government bodies, \n        the rate of school attendance for girls, women's access to \n        government services, and the prevalence of violence against \n        women.\n            (4) Maintaining and improving physical security for Afghan \n        women and girls throughout the country is critical in order for \n        women and girls to take advantage of opportunities in \n        education, commerce, politics, and other areas of public life, \n        which in turn is essential for the future stability and \n        prosperity of Afghanistan.\n            (5) Women who serve as public officials at all levels of \n        the Government of Afghanistan face serious threats to their \n        personal security and that of their families. Many female \n        officials have been the victims of violent crimes, but they are \n        generally not afforded official protection by the Government of \n        Afghanistan or security forces.\n            (6) Protecting the security and human rights of Afghan \n        women and girls requires the involvement of Afghan men and boys \n        through education about the important benefits of women's full \n        participation in social, economic, and political life. Male \n        officials and security personnel can play a particularly \n        important role in supporting and protecting women and girls.\n            (7) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n        2012 states: ``As the Afghan National Police further develop \n        and professionalize, they will evolve towards a sustainable, \n        credible, and accountable civilian law enforcement force that \n        will shoulder the main responsibility for domestic security. \n        This force should be capable of providing policing services to \n        the Afghan population as part of the broader Afghan rule of law \n        system.''.\n            (8) Women face significant barriers to full participation \n        in the ANA and ANP, including a discriminatory or hostile work \n        environment and the lack of separate facilities designed for \n        female personnel.\n            (9) As of September 2012, female recruitment and retention \n        rates for the Afghan National Security Forces are far below \n        published targets, as follows:\n                    (A) Approximately 1,700 women serve in the Afghan \n                National Security Forces, or less than half of one \n                percent of the total force.\n                    (B) In 2010, President Hamid Karzai announced plans \n                to recruit and train 5,000 women in the Afghan National \n                Police, or approximately 3 percent of the force, by \n                2014. Currently, there are approximately 1,370 women in \n                the ANP, or 0.87 percent of the police force.\n                    (C) Approximately 350 women currently serve in the \n                Afghan National Army, representing only 0.17 percent of \n                the force. The Government of Afghanistan has said that \n                its goal is to achieve a force that is 10 percent \n                female. As of May 2012, approximately 3 percent of new \n                ANA recruits were women.\n            (10) Male security personnel often do not respond to \n        threats or incidences of violence against women, particularly \n        at the local level. They largely lack the training and \n        understanding needed to respond appropriately and effectively \n        to situations involving women. According to the Department of \n        Defense's April 2012 Report on Progress Toward Security and \n        Stability in Afghanistan:\n                    (A) The Afghan Ministry of Defense ``lacks the \n                combination of policies, procedures, and execution to \n                promote opportunity and fair and respectful treatment \n                of women in the force''.\n                    (B) The Afghan Ministry of Interior ``faces \n                significant challenges in fully integrating and \n                protecting women in the ANP workforce, especially among \n                operational units at the provincial and district \n                levels''.\n                    (C) In the Afghan National Police, ``Many \n                Provincial Headquarters Commanders do not accept \n                policewomen, as they prefer male candidates and lack \n                adequate facilities to support females.''.\n                    (D) ``While women are greatly needed to support \n                police operations, a combination of cultural \n                impediments, weak recruitment, and uneven application \n                of policies hinder significant progress.''.\n                    (E) ``Although stronger documentation, \n                implementation, and enforcement of policies, \n                procedures, and guidance to better integrate women will \n                help, time will be needed to change the cultural mores \n                that form the basis of many of the current \n                impediments.''.\n            (11) The United States, the North American Treaty \n        Organization, and United States coalition partners have made \n        firm commitments to support the human rights of the women and \n        girls of Afghanistan, as evidenced by the following actions:\n                    (A) According to the United States National Action \n                Plan on Women, Peace and Security, ``integrating women \n                and gender considerations into peace-building processes \n                helps promote democratic governance and long-term \n                stability,'' which are key United States strategic \n                goals in Afghanistan.\n                    (B) The National Action Plan also states that ``the \n                engagement and protection of women as agents of peace \n                and stability will be central to United States efforts \n                to promote security, prevent, respond to, and resolve \n                conflict, and rebuild societies.'' This policy applies \n                to United States Government efforts in Afghanistan, \n                where addressing the security vulnerabilities of Afghan \n                women and girls during the period of security \n                transition is an essential step toward long-term \n                stability.\n                    (C) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO \n                in May 2012 states: ``We emphasize the importance of \n                full participation of all Afghan women in the \n                reconstruction, political, peace and reconciliation \n                processes in Afghanistan and the need to respect the \n                institutional arrangements protecting their rights. We \n                remain committed to the implementation of United \n                Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on \n                women, peace and security. We recognize also the need \n                for the protection of children from the damaging \n                effects of armed conflict as required in relevant \n                UNSCRs.''.\n            (12) The Strategic Partnership Agreement signed between the \n        United States and Afghanistan by President Obama and President \n        Karzai in June 2012 states, ``Consistent with its Constitution \n        and international obligations, Afghanistan shall ensure and \n        advance the essential role of women in society, so that they \n        may fully enjoy their economic, social, political, civil and \n        cultural rights.''.\n    (b) Strategy To Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in \n        concurrence with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the \n        appropriate congressional committees a strategy to be \n        implemented by the Department of Defense, working with the NATO \n        Training Mission Afghanistan (NTM-A) and Afghan partners, to \n        promote the security of Afghan women during the security \n        transition process.\n            (2) Elements.--The strategy required under paragraph (1) \n        shall include the following elements:\n                    (A) A strategy to monitor and respond to changes in \n                women's security conditions in areas undergoing \n                transition, including the following actions:\n                            (i) Seeking to designate a Civilian Impact \n                        Advisor on the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board \n                        (JANIB) to assess the impact of transition on \n                        male and female civilians and ensure that \n                        efforts to protect women's rights and security \n                        are included in each area's transition \n                        implementation plan.\n                            (ii) Reviewing existing indicators against \n                        which sex-disaggregated data is collected and, \n                        if necessary, developing additional indicators, \n                        to ensure the availability of data that can be \n                        used to measure women's security, such as--\n                                    (I) the mobility of women and \n                                girls;\n                                    (II) the participation of women in \n                                local government bodies;\n                                    (III) the rate of school attendance \n                                for girls;\n                                    (IV) women's access to government \n                                services;
