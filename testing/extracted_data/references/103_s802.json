    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Congress has previously directed the Secretary of \n        Defense to seek to enter into multiyear burden sharing support \n        agreements with economically strong North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization (NATO) allies of the United States in order to \n        obtain increased host nation contributions toward defraying the \n        overseas basing costs for forces of the Armed Forces of the \n        United States in that host country.\n            (2) In fiscal year 1992--\n                    (A) the government of Germany contributed \n                approximately 23 percent of the overseas basing costs \n                for United States forces in that country;\n                    (B) the government of Italy contributed \n                approximately 20 percent of the overseas basing costs \n                for United States forces in that country;\n                    (C) the government of the United Kingdom \n                contributed approximately 14 percent of the overseas \n                basing costs for United States forces in that country; \n                and\n                    (D) the United States paid the remainder of such \n                costs.\n            (3) The Japanese government will pay 75.1 percent of \n        overseas basing costs according to the host nation burden \n        sharing support agreement between the United States and Japan.\n            (4) In accordance with that agreement, the government of \n        Japan contributed in fiscal year 1992 approximately 70 percent \n        of the overseas basing costs for United States forces in that \n        country, and the United States paid the remainder of such \n        costs.\n            (5) If the economically strong NATO allies of the United \n        States had contributed 75 percent of the overseas basing costs \n        that were incurred for fiscal year 1992 for United States \n        forces in the countries of such allies, the United States would \n        have saved an estimated $5,000,000,000 of the amount paid by \n        the United States for overseas basing costs for that fiscal \n        year.\n            (6) It is in the national interest of the United States for \n        the United States and our economically strong allies to enter \n        into burden sharing support agreements that provide for such \n        allies to defray most or all of the overseas basing costs for \n        the United States forces stationed in the allied countries.\n\nSEC. 2.
