FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Payday lending is a rapidly expanding form of high-\n        cost, short-term credit that uses a borrower's personal check \n        as collateral and targets individuals with limited access to \n        affordable credit who are in desperate need of cash to meet \n        immediate obligations.\n            (2) Consumer group studies indicate that the average annual \n        percentage rate on payday loans nationally is 474 percent for a \n        two-week loan, and that a typical payday loan is renewed ten or \n        more times before repayment at equivalent annual interest rates \n        that exceed 1000 percent.\n            (3) While State law has traditionally prohibited such high \n        cost lending through usury limits, small loan interest caps and \n        other restrictions, these laws have either been revised to \n        exempt payday loan transactions, or payday lenders have \n        affiliated with insured depository institutions to invoke the \n        most favored lender principle under Federal law to circumvent \n        interest rate regulation in State law.\n            (4) Lending that fails to assess borrowers ability to \n        repay, that requires consumers to write checks on insufficient \n        funds, that encourages perpetual debt or default on other \n        obligations, and that facilitates violations of State law, is \n        an unacceptable banking practice for insured depository \n        institutions that threatens the safety of the participating \n        institution and the broader banking system.\n            (5) While Congress clearly intended for the credit \n        protections of the Truth in Lending Act to apply broadly to all \n        credit transactions, including payday loan transactions, and \n        such application to payday loan transactions has been correctly \n        affirmed in recent court decisions, the provision of Truth in \n        Lending credit disclosures is not standard practice among \n        payday lenders across the country and should be a more explicit \n        requirement in Federal statutes and regulations.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to encourage fair \nlending practices by prohibiting insured depository institutions from \nengaging in any form of payday lending, by restricting the use of \npersonal checks drawn on, or forms of withdrawals from, accounts at \ninsured depository institutions for purposes of making payday loans, \nand by clarifying what the Congress has always intended by explicitly \nstating in the Truth in Lending Act that appropriate interest rate \ndisclosure and other consumer protections of the Act do apply to all \npayday loans.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT AMENDMENT.\n\n    Section 18 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828) is \namended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(v) Prohibition on Certain Unsafe and Unsound Banking \nPractices.--\n            ``(1) In general.--An insured depository institution may \n        not--\n                    ``(A) make any payday loan, either directly or \n                indirectly; or\n                    ``(B) make any loan to any other lender for \n                purposes of financing a payday loan or refinancing or \n                extending any payday loan.\n            ``(2) Payday loan defined.--For purposes of this \n        subsection, the term `payday loan' means any transaction in \n        which a short-term cash advance is made to a consumer in \n        exchange for--\n                            ``(i) a consumer's personal check or share \n                        draft, in the amount of the advance plus a fee, \n                        where presentment or negotiation of such check \n                        or share draft is deferred by agreement of the \n                        parties until a designated future date; or\n                            ``(ii) a consumer's authorization to debit \n                        the consumer's transaction account, in the \n                        amount of the advance plus a fee, where such \n                        account will be debited on or after a \n                        designated future date.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
