FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) the Federal Power Marketing Administrations, over the \n        years, have served to help bring electricity to many areas in \n        the Nation;\n            (2) they have done so with the investment of the American \n        taxpayer;\n            (3) the necessity of federally owned power generation and \n        transmission facilities has passed and halting this practice is \n        in the best national interest of the United States;\n            (4) in fairness to the longtime consumers of Federal Power \n        Marketing Administrations, any process of sale should be open \n        to them;\n            (5) the taxpayers, through investing in the construction \n        and operation, have established equity in the facilities; and\n            (6) this equity entitles the American taxpayer to expect \n        the highest possible return in the sale process.\n\nSEC. 3.

If any \nportion of a structure or other facility is used for flood control, \nwater supply or other purposes in addition to the generation of \nelectric energy, such term refers only to that portion of the structure \nor facility used exclusively for the generation of electric energy, \nincluding turbines, generators, controls, substations, and primary \nlines used for transmitting electric energy therefrom to the point of \njuncture with the interconnected primary transmission system. Such term \nshall not include any portion of a facility used for navigation, flood \ncontrol, irrigation, water supply, or recreation."
