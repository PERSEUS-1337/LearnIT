FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Before a manufacturer of a new drug or device can \n        market its new product, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n        requires that the manufacturer conduct laboratory and clinical \n        trials to ascertain the product's safety and effectiveness.\n            (2) Federal regulations mandate that an Institutional \n        Review Board (IRB), which is comprised of scientists, \n        physicians, and lay people, review the protocol or research \n        plan and the informed consent form of the proposed clinical \n        trial to ensure, among other things, that the health and safety \n        of the human participants are not unnecessarily endangered.\n            (3) Institutional Review Boards also verify that the \n        manufacturer's clinical researchers implement appropriate \n        additional safeguards to protect the rights and welfare of \n        potentially vulnerable populations, such as women, children, \n        the elderly, the physically or mentally disabled, and persons \n        who are economically or educationally disadvantaged.\n            (4) Most importantly, the IRBs help assure the FDA that \n        manufacturers of new drugs and medical devices adequately \n        inform human participants of the anticipated risks and the \n        likelihood of projected benefits derived from their \n        participation in the clinical trials, and then secure the \n        voluntary consent of the participants.\n            (5) For the purpose of supporting the safety and efficacy \n        of the test article, the FDA, however, may accept the results \n        of clinical trials with human participants which are conducted \n        outside of the United States and do not meet United States IRB \n        and ethical requirements.\n            (6) Foreign clinical trials involving human participants \n        only need to conform to either international norms on clinical \n        investigations or the laws and regulations of the country in \n        which the research is to be conducted. However, neither \n        international nor most host-country standards meet the \n        stringent requirements in the United States.\n            (7) International and most foreign-country legal \n        protections do not adequately shield participants in clinical \n        investigations of a new drug or device from unethical, \n        dangerous, or unscrupulous research practices.\n            (8) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services (HHS), the number of countries in which clinical \n        investigators conduct drug research for FDA-approval purposes \n        mushroomed from 29 in 1990 to 79 in 1999. Russia and countries \n        in Eastern Europe and Latin America experienced the largest \n        growth of clinical research.\n            (9) Some researchers exploit the fragile regulatory \n        systems, high illiteracy rates, and public health failures of \n        developing countries to test their experimental drugs and \n        devices on misinformed and unwilling human participants.\n            (10) On December 17, 2000, the Washington Post began a six-\n        part series of articles which documented the abuses and \n        unethical practices of some United States-based pharmaceutical \n        companies conducting clinical investigations of drugs and other \n        test articles on human participants overseas.\n            (11) The Washington Post articles chronicled numerous cases \n        where individuals in clinical trials had not given informed \n        consent, researchers did not follow protocols for investigation \n        and falsified results, and poor people were paid to participate \n        in trials without fully understanding the risks of their \n        participation.\n            (12) On April 30, 2001, the National Bioethics Advisory \n        Commission (NBAC) presented to the President a report, entitled \n        ``Ethical and Policy Issues in International Research: Clinical \n        Trials in Developing Countries'', which discussed the ethical \n        issues generated by research on human participants in \n        developing countries and recommended ways to help ensure the \n        health and safety of these human participants. The NBAC \n        highlighted the inadequate regulatory protections which are \n        afforded to human participants in many clinical trials abroad.\n            (13) In September 2001, the Office of the Inspector General \n        within HHS released the report ``The Globalization of Clinical \n        Trials: A Growing Challenge in Protecting Human Subjects''. In \n        the report, the Inspector General acknowledged that key \n        entities which oversee or study foreign research, including \n        United States regulatory agencies and the World Health \n        Organization, have raised concerns about the lack of experience \n        and insufficient monitoring practices of many foreign IRBs.\n            (14) Also, the Inspector General recommended, among other \n        things, that the FDA collect more information about the \n        performance of foreign IRBs, and the growth and location of \n        foreign clinical investigations.\n            (15) While Federal regulation should accelerate, whenever \n        possible, the delivery from laboratory to patients of new drugs \n        which are designed to treat devastating illnesses, existing law \n        permits manufacturers to profit from the misery and pain of \n        uniformed, misinformed, and unwilling patients in developing \n        countries.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of Congress to control the export of test articles \nwhich are intended for clinical investigations involving human \nparticipants in order to--\n            (1) foster public health and safety;\n            (2) prevent injury to the foreign policy of the United \n        States; and\n            (3) preserve the credibility of the United States as a \n        responsible trading partner.\n\nSEC. 4. MEASURES TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH.\n\n    (a) In General.--In order to carry out the policy set forth in \nsection 3, test articles intended for clinical investigations may be \nexported only pursuant to an export license approved by the President. \nThe President may exercise the authorities of the Export Administration \nAct of 1979, as continued in effect pursuant to the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act, to carry out this section.\n    (b) Criteria for Export License.--In addition to any other \nrequirements that may apply, including under the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and regulations issued \nunder either such Act, the President shall require, as a prerequisite \nfor approval of an export license for a test article required by \nsubsection (a) of this section, that an applicant for such license--\n            (1) identify each clinical investigation for which the test \n        article is intended; and\n            (2) submit proof that each of the protocols for every \n        clinical investigation identified under paragraph (1) has been \n        reviewed by an institutional review board and has, at a \n        minimum, met substantially the same standards for the \n        protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects as the \n        standards that would be required for IRB approval of the \n        protocol if the protocol were for a clinical investigation of \n        such test article pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and \n        Cosmetic Act.\n    (c) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than one year after the date \nof the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the President \nshall prepare and submit to the appropriate congressional committees a \nreport regarding the approval of export licenses required by subsection \n(a). Such report shall include--\n            (1) the names of the applicants for such export licenses;\n            (2) the names of approved applicants for such export \n        licenses; and\n            (3) the destination country or countries for each \n        application for such export licenses.\n    (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Application for research or marketing permit.--The term \n        ``application for research or marketing permit'' has the \n        meaning given that term in section 56.102(b) of title 21, Code \n        of Federal Regulations, or successor regulations.\n            (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on \n        International Relations of the House of Representatives and the \n        Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.\n            (3) Clinical investigation.--\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``clinical \n                investigation'' means any experiment that involves a \n                test article and one or more human subjects, and that \n                either must meet the requirements for prior submission \n                to the Food and Drug Administration under section \n                505(i), 507(d), or 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, \n                and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i), 357(d), or \n                360j(g)), or need not meet the requirements for prior \n                submission to the Food and Drug Administration under \n                those sections, but the results of which are intended \n                to be later submitted to, or held for inspection by, \n                the Food and Drug Administration as part of an \n                application for a research or marketing permit.\n                    (B) Exclusion.--The term ``clinical investigation'' \n                does not include experiments that must meet the \n                provisions of part 58 of title 21, Code of Federal \n                Regulations, or successor regulations, regarding \n                nonclinical laboratory studies.\n            (4) Destination country.--The term ``destination country'' \n        means the country into which test articles are being exported.\n            (5) Human subject.--The term ``human subject'' means an \n        individual who is or becomes a participant in research, either \n        as a recipient of a test article or as a control.
