FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Council on Foreign Relations, 60 \n        percent of U.S. employers are having difficulties finding \n        qualified workers to fill vacancies at their companies.\n            (2) Office of Science and Technology and Policy states that \n        ``STEM occupations will grow 1.7 times faster than non-STEM \n        occupations over the period from 2008 through 2018''.\n            (3) According to the National Governors Association Center \n        for Best Practices, at all levels of educational attainment, \n        STEM job holders earn 11 percent higher wages compared with \n        their same-degree counterparts in other jobs.\n            (4) The National Governors Association Center for Best \n        Practices also states that ``The top 10 bachelor-degree majors \n        with the highest median earnings are all in STEM fields''.\n            (5) According to the Harris STEM Survey, although most \n        parents of K-12 students (93 percent) believe that STEM \n        education should be a priority in the U.S., only half (49 \n        percent) agreed that it actually is a top priority for this \n        country.\n            (6) The Harris STEM Survey also states that ``Only one in \n        five STEM college students felt that their K-12 education \n        prepared them extremely well for their college courses in \n        STEM.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
