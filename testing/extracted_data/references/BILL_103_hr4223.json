CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a \n        fundamental right;\n            (2) Federal, State, and local governments have a duty to \n        promote the exercise of the right to vote to the greatest \n        extent possible;\n            (3) the power to tax is only guardedly granted to Federal, \n        State, and local governments by the citizens of the United \n        States;\n            (4) the only regular contact that most Americans have with \n        their government consists of filing personal income tax returns \n        and voting in Federal, State, and local elections;\n            (5) in 1992, almost 115,000,000 Federal income tax returns \n        were filed by individuals and couples, but only approximately \n        104,000,000 votes were cast in the year's presidential \n        election; and\n            (6) more closely tying the rights of individuals as voters \n        to their obligations as taxpayers will provide additional \n        incentives for individuals to both participate in the electoral \n        process and scrutinize the costs and benefits of government \n        policies.\n\nSEC. 3.
