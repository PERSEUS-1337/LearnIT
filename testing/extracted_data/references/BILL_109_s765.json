FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States can have a secure and prosperous \n        future only by having a robust and inventive scientific and \n        technical enterprise.\n            (2) Such an enterprise will require the United States to \n        produce more scientists and engineers.\n            (3) The United States education system must do more to \n        encourage students at every level to study science and \n        mathematics and to pursue careers related to those fields.\n            (4) The current performance of United States students in \n        science and mathematics lags behind their international peers, \n        and not enough students are pursuing science and mathematics.\n            (5) The United States is still reaping the benefits of past \n        investments in research and development and education, but we \n        are drawing down that capital.\n            (6) The United States needs to recommit itself to \n        leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, especially \n        as advances are being made in such areas as nanotechnology.\n            (7) A program of loan forgiveness designed to attract \n        students to careers in science, mathematics, engineering, and \n        technology, including teaching careers, can help the United \n        States maintain its technological leadership.\n\nSEC. 3.
