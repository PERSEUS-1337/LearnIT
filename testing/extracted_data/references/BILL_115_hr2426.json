SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Secure Government \nBuildings from Espionage Act of 2017''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Government Accountability Office has reported that \n        the Federal Government often leases high-security space from \n        private sector landlords;\n            (2) the General Services Administration and other Federal \n        agencies with leasing authority are not currently required to \n        collect beneficial ownership information and therefore do not \n        know if foreign owners have a stake in the buildings leased by \n        the agencies, even when the leased space is used for classified \n        operations or to store sensitive data; and\n            (3) according to a report of the Government Accountability \n        Office, dated January 2017, that examined the risks of foreign \n        ownership of Government-leased real estate, ``leasing space in \n        foreign-owned buildings could present security risks such as \n        espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access''.\n\nSEC. 2.
