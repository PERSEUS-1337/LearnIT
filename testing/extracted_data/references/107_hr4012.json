FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted to \n        foster the deployment of telecommunications and information \n        technologies to all Americans by promoting competition and \n        reducing regulation.\n            (2) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 specifically \n        recognized the unique challenges in delivering services in \n        rural and underserved areas.\n            (3) Small wireless carriers in rural areas are uniquely \n        positioned to offer quality services and competitive \n        initiatives to benefit consumers in such less densely populated \n        regions.\n            (4) Existing regulations are typically tailored to the \n        circumstances of larger carriers and therefore often impose \n        disproportionate burdens on small rural wireless carriers \n        inhibiting the ability of these carriers to expand \n        telecommunications services and offer new competitive \n        initiatives to consumers living in rural areas.\n            (5) Reducing regulatory burdens on small rural wireless \n        carriers located in and serving rural areas will enable these \n        carriers to commit resources to the deployment of expanded \n        telecommunications services and competitive initiatives to \n        benefit consumers living in such areas.\n            (6) Reducing regulatory burdens on small rural wireless \n        carriers located in and serving rural areas will increase \n        carriers' abilities to respond to marketplace conditions \n        allowing them to accelerate deployment of wireless services and \n        competitive initiatives to benefit businesses and residents in \n        rural areas.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to accelerate deployment of wireless telecommunications \n        and the development of competition in the telecommunications \n        industry in all regions of the Nation, consistent with the \n        Telecommunications Act of 1996, by reducing regulatory burdens \n        on small rural wireless carriers located in and serving rural \n        communities;\n            (2) to improve such carriers' abilities to offer new \n        competitive initiatives; and\n            (3) to allow such carriers to redirect resources from \n        paying the costs of such regulatory burdens to increasing \n        investment in such initiatives.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (40) through (52) as \n        paragraphs (41) through (53), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (39) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(40) Small rural wireless carriers.--The term `small \n        rural wireless carriers' means any wireless company (together \n        with all affiliates) whose wireless subscribers are fewer than \n        1 percent of the Nation's wireless subscribers in the aggregate \n        nationwide.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REDUCED REGULATORY BURDENS ON SMALL RURAL WIRELESS CARRIERS.\n\n    Section 332(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(9) Small rural wireless carriers.--\n                    ``(A) Commission to take into account \n                differences.--In adopting rules that apply to small \n                rural wireless carriers (as defined in this Act) the \n                Commission shall separately evaluate the burden that \n                any proposed regulatory, compliance, or reporting \n                requirements would have on small rural wireless \n                carriers.\n                    ``(B) Effect of commission's failure to take into \n                account differences.--If the Commission adopts a rule \n                that applies to small rural wireless carriers and fails \n                to separately evaluate the burden that any proposed \n                regulatory, compliance, or reporting requirement would \n                have on small rural wireless carriers, the Commission \n                shall not enforce the rule against small rural wireless \n                carriers until the Commission performs such separate \n                evaluation.\n                    ``(C) If commission determines the rules are \n                burdensome.--If its evaluation determines that any \n                proposed regulatory, compliance, or reporting \n                requirement would create a financial burden on small \n                rural wireless carriers by imposing additional costs \n                that require small rural wireless carriers to divert \n                resources from improving existing and advanced \n                services, making infrastructure investments, and other \n                competitive initiatives for the benefit of businesses \n                and residents in rural areas, the Commission shall \n                forbear from imposing such requirement on small rural \n                wireless carriers unless it determines such forbearance \n                is not in the public interest.\n                    ``(D) If forbearance is not in the public \n                interest.--If the Commission determines that such \n                forbearance is not in the public interest, the \n                Commission shall state its reasons for such \n                determination, develop an alternative schedule that \n                provides additional time for small rural wireless \n                carriers to comply with such requirements, and report \n                such actions to the Congress 30 days prior to \n                finalizing the regulatory, compliance, or reporting \n                requirements.\n                    ``(E) Additional review not required.--The \n                Commission is not required to conduct a separate \n                evaluation under subparagraph (A) if the rules adopted \n                do not apply to small rural wireless carriers.''.\n\nSEC. 5. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR \n              WAIVER.\n\n    Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 405) is \namended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) Expedited Action Required.--Not later than 90 days after \nreceiving from a small rural wireless carrier a petition for \nreconsideration or other review filed under this section or a petition \nfor waiver of a rule, policy, or other Commission requirement, the \nCommission shall issue an order granting or denying such petition. If \nthe Commission fails to act on a petition for waiver subject to the \nrequirements of this section within this 90-day period, the relief \nsought in such petition shall be deemed granted. If the Commission \nfails to act on a petition for reconsideration or other review subject \nto the requirements of this section within such 90-day period, the \nCommission's enforcement of any rule the reconsideration or other \nreview of which was specifically sought by the petitioning party shall \nbe stayed with respect to that party.''.\n\nSEC. 6. ESTABLISHING OFFICE OF RURAL ADVOCACY IN THE FEDERAL \n              COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION.\n\n    Title I of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 12.
