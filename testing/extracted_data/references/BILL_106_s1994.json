FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is desirable to make funds available from individual \n        retirement plans to encourage first time home ownership, and\n            (2) the tax and penalty on the premature withdrawal of \n        funds from individual retirement plans are substantial \n        impediments to making such funds available for that purpose.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the Congress to remove impediments \nto home investment by first-time homebuyers by permitting owners of \nindividual retirement plans to direct the trustees of such plans to \ninvest plan funds as home equity or debt in the homes of such owners or \nin the home of family members who are first-time homebuyers.\n\nSEC. 3.
