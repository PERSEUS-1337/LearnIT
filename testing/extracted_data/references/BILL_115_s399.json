FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The manufacturing sector consists of establishments \n        that are primarily engaged in the transformation of materials, \n        substances, or components into products.\n            (2) The Federal Government supports manufacturing in a \n        variety of ways; manufacturing-related activities are scattered \n        in several agencies in the executive branch.\n            (3) Manufacturing employment, output, and exports are \n        impacted by tax policies, the state of infrastructure and \n        transportation, small business regulations, environmental \n        regulations, trade policies, innovation ecosystems, workforce \n        development, and education initiatives, with national security \n        implications.\n            (4) Manufacturers account for 12 percent of the total gross \n        domestic product output in the United States, employing 9 \n        percent of the workforce. Total output from manufacturing is \n        more than 2 trillion dollars. There are more than 12 million \n        manufacturing employees in the United States, with an average \n        annual compensation of about $80,000.\n            (5) Legislative policies and executive actions often result \n        in unintended, inconsistent, and conflicting outcomes with \n        respect to the growth of manufacturing in the United States.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a well-\ndesigned national manufacturing strategy would benefit the United \nStates economy in several important ways:\n            (1) A revitalized manufacturing sector would enable the \n        United States to derive more of its economic growth from \n        exports and domestic production than the United States has in \n        the past two decades.\n            (2) Average domestic wages would rise in response to \n        growing manufacturing output, as manufacturing jobs \n        historically have paid higher wages and benefits than \n        nonmanufacturing jobs.\n            (3) A growing manufacturing sector would help lay a \n        foundation for future United States economic growth, since \n        manufacturing industries perform the vast share of private-\n        sector research and development, which fuels the innovation \n        that serves as a primary engine of economic growth.\n            (4) The United States would expand its long-standing \n        leadership in advanced manufacturing technologies with Federal \n        investments in manufacturing research and development, \n        education, and workforce training.\n            (5) There has always been a strong connection between \n        domestic manufacturing and national defense and homeland \n        security. A strong and innovative manufacturing industry will \n        maintain the superiority of the United States military and will \n        allow for an unquestionable ability to respond quickly to \n        threats and catastrophes.\n\nSEC. 3.
