FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the main missions of the Federal Communications \n        Commission, and a compelling governmental interest, is to \n        ensure that there is a diversity of ownership and viewpoints in \n        the broadcasting industry.\n            (2) The Commission should continue to collect relevant data \n        and conduct studies on such diversity and make appropriate \n        recommendations to Congress on how to increase the number of \n        minority- and women-owned broadcast stations.\n            (3) Data from 2014 shows that, of the over 1,700 commercial \n        broadcast television stations in the United States, less than 6 \n        percent are owned by women, and less than 3 percent are \n        minority-owned. With respect to radio stations, women owned \n        approximately 7 percent of FM broadcast radio stations, and \n        minorities owned less than 3 percent of such stations.\n            (4) Women and minority ownership is 5 to 10 times higher in \n        other industries than in the broadcasting industry.\n            (5) During the 17 years that a minority tax certificate \n        program was in place at the Commission (from 1978 to 1995), the \n        Commission issued 287 certificates for radio stations and 40 \n        certificates for television stations.\n            (6) The Commission can also support minority- and women-\n        owned entrants into the broadcasting industry by implementing \n        an incubator program in which existing licensees assist new \n        entrants in the operation of broadcast stations.\n\nSEC. 3. FCC REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Biennial Report Containing Recommendations for Increasing \nNumber of Minority- and Women-Owned Broadcast Stations.--Not later than \n180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and not less \nfrequently than every 2 years thereafter, the Commission shall submit \nto Congress a report containing recommendations for how to increase the \ntotal number of broadcast stations that are owned or controlled by \nmembers of minority groups or women, or by both members of minority \ngroups and women.\n    (b) Biennial Report on Number of Minority- and Women-Owned \nBroadcast Stations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and not less frequently than every 2 years \nthereafter, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report that \nstates the total number of broadcast stations that are owned or \ncontrolled by members of minority groups or women, or by both members \nof minority groups and women, based on data reported to the Commission \non Form 323.\n\nSEC. 4.
