    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Long-Term Care Hospital \nImprovement Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Long-term care hospitals (in this section referred to \n        as ``LTCHs'') serve a valuable role in the post-acute care \n        continuum by providing care to medically complex patients \n        needing long hospital stays.\n            (2) The Medicare program should ensure that patients \n        receive post-acute care in the most appropriate setting. The \n        use of additional certification criteria for LTCHs, including \n        facility and patient criteria, will promote the appropriate \n        placement of severely ill patients into LTCHs. Further, patient \n        admission screening tools and continued stay and discharge \n        assessment tools can guide appropriate patient placement.\n            (3) Certain long-term care diagnosis related groups (LTC-\n        DRGs) are associated with higher severity of illness levels, as \n        measured by the APR-DRG system, and that patients grouped into \n        those LTC-DRGs are predicted to be appropriate for LTCH \n        services.\n            (4) Measuring and reporting on quality of care is an \n        important function of any Medicare provider and that a national \n        quality initiative for LTCHs should be similar to short-term \n        general acute care hospitals in the Medicare program.\n            (5) To conform the prospective payment system for LTCHs \n        with certain aspects of the prospective payment system for \n        short-term general acute care hospitals and promote payment \n        stability, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this \n        Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') should--\n                    (A) perform an annual market basket update;\n                    (B) conduct the LTC-DRG reweighting and wage level \n                adjustments in a budget neutral manner each year;\n                    (C) not perform a proposed one-time budget \n                neutrality adjustment, and\n                    (D) not extend the 25 percent limitation on \n                reimbursement of co-located hospital patient admissions \n                to freestanding LTCHs.\n\nSEC. 3. NEW DEFINITION OF A LONG-TERM CARE HOSPITAL WITH FACILITY AND \n              PATIENT CRITERIA.\n\n    (a) Definition.--Section 1861 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395x) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n\n                       ``Long-Term Care Hospital\n\n    ``(ccc) The term `long-term care hospital' means an institution \nwhich--\n            ``(1) is primarily engaged in providing inpatient care, by \n        or under the supervision of a physician, to medically complex \n        patients needing long hospital stays;\n            ``(2) has an average inpatient length of stay (as \n        determined by the Secretary) for Medicare beneficiaries of \n        greater than 25 days, or as otherwise defined in section \n        1886(d)(1)(B)(iv);\n            ``(3) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) through \n        (9) of subsection (e), except the first sentence of paragraph \n        (9);\n            ``(4) meets the following facility criteria:\n                    ``(A) the institution has a patient review process, \n                documented in the patient medical record, that screens \n                patients prior to admission, validates within 48 hours \n                of admission that patients meet admission criteria, \n                regularly evaluates patients throughout their stay, and \n                assesses the available discharge options when patients \n                no longer meet the continued stay criteria;\n                    ``(B) the institution applies a standard patient \n                assessment tool, as determined by the Secretary, that \n                is a valid clinical tool appropriate for this level of \n                care, uniformly used by all long-term care hospitals, \n                to measure the severity of illness and intensity of \n                service requirements for patients for the purposes of \n                making admission, continuing stay and discharge medical \n                necessity determinations taking into account the \n                medical judgment of the patient's physician, as \n                provided for under sections 1814(a)(3) and \n                1835(a)(2)(B);\n                    ``(C) the institution has active physician \n                involvement with patients during their treatment \n                through an organized medical staff, on-site physician \n                presence and physician review of patient progress on a \n                daily basis, and consulting physicians on call and \n                capable of being at the patient's side within a \n                moderate period of time, as determined by the \n                Secretary;\n                    ``(D) the institution has interdisciplinary team \n                treatment for patients, requiring interdisciplinary \n                teams of health care professionals, including \n                physicians, to prepare and carry out an individualized \n                treatment plan for each patient; and\n                    ``(E) the institution maintains a minimum staffing \n                level of licensed health care professionals, as \n                determined by the Secretary, to ensure that long-term \n                care hospitals provide an intensive level of care that \n                is sufficient to meet the needs of medically complex \n                patients needing long hospital stays; and\n            ``(5) meets patient criteria relating to patient mix and \n        severity appropriate to the medically complex cases that long-\n        term care hospitals are uniquely designed to treat, as measured \n        under section 1886(m).''.\n    (b) New Patient Criteria for Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective \nPayment.--Section 1886 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) is amended by \nadding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(m) Patient Criteria for Prospective Payment to Long-Term Care \nHospitals.--\n            ``(1) In general.--To be eligible for prospective payment \n        as a long-term care hospital, a long-term care hospital must \n        discharge the percentage established in paragraph (4) of each \n        hospital's total patients who are entitled to benefits under \n        part A and who were admitted with one or more of the medical \n        conditions specified in paragraph (2).\n            ``(2) Selection of ltc-drgs.--The Secretary shall determine \n        the long-term care diagnosis related groups (LTC-DRGs) under \n        section 307(b) of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits \n        Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, that are associated \n        with a high severity of illness for the following specified \n        medical conditions:\n                    ``(A) Circulatory conditions.\n                    ``(B) Digestive, endocrine, and metabolic \n                conditions.\n                    ``(C) Infectious disease.\n                    ``(D) Neurological conditions.\n                    ``(E) Renal conditions.\n                    ``(F) Respiratory conditions.\n                    ``(G) Skin conditions.\n                    ``(H) Other medically complex conditions as defined \n                by the Secretary.\n            ``(3) Change to different patient classification system.--\n        If the Secretary changes the patient classification system for \n        the long-term care hospital prospective payment system (LTCH \n        PPS) to a classification system other than the long-term care \n        diagnosis related group (LTC-DRG) system, the Secretary shall \n        determine the new patient classification categories that are \n        associated with a high severity of illness for the medical \n        conditions specified in paragraph (2) in a manner that \n        maintains the same proportion of Medicare discharges as the \n        long-term care diagnosis related groups (LTC-DRGs) in effect at \n        the time.\n            ``(4) Percentage of medicare patient discharges.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), for \n                each long-term care hospital, the proportion of \n                discharges from the long-term care diagnosis related \n                groups (LTC-DRGs) determined under paragraph (2), or \n                other patient classification categories designated \n                pursuant to paragraph (3) if applicable, in a cost \n                reporting year must be a percentage, as determined by \n                the Secretary, that is not less than 50 percent and not \n                greater than 75 percent.\n                    ``(B) Transition period.--The Secretary shall \n                provide for a three-year transition period beginning on \n                October 1, 2007, for hospitals that were certified as \n                long-term care hospitals before such date.
