FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Medicare covers approximately 2 million women with \n        disabilities that are of childbearing age.\n            (2) Women with disabilities give birth to 50,000 children \n        annually.\n            (3) The Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research reports \n        that these women are without appropriate access to primary care \n        services.\n            (4) Their average time between gynecological visits was 10-\n        12 years.\n            (5) They were less likely to have received a recent \n        mammogram.\n            (6) The medicare program reimburses Certified Nurse \n        Midwives (CNMs) at 65 percent of the physician fee schedule, on \n        average, only $14 per annual exam.\n            (7) CNMs who serve these women are forced to subsidize care \n        with their own money or turn away patients because they cannot \n        afford to operate at a financial loss.\n            (8) Professional liability premiums for CNMs are \n        skyrocketing, leaving no monies to subsidize care.\n            (9) CNMs are forced to leave the marketplace as other \n        public and private payers adopt Medicare payment policies.\n            (10) Midwives are highly educated and available to serve \n        this special population.\n\nSEC. 3.
