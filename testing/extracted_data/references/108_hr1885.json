    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Military Pay Comparability Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the underlying principles of the all-volunteer \n        Armed Forces is the principle that military pay increases must \n        remain comparable to private sector pay growth, as measured by \n        the Employment Cost Index.\n            (2) The capping of military pay raises below private sector \n        pay growth for extended periods during the past 30 years has \n        led to significant retention problems among second-term and \n        career members of the Armed Forces.\n            (3) Such retention problems cost the United States more in \n        terms of lost military experience, decreased readiness, and \n        increased training costs than maintaining the principle of pay \n        comparability.\n            (4) Since military pay was last deemed reasonably \n        comparable with private sector pay in 1982, military pay raises \n        have lagged a cumulative 6.4 percent behind private sector wage \n        growth, although recent efforts of the President and Congress \n        have reduced the gap significantly from its peak of 13.5 \n        percent in 1999.\n            (5) Under existing law, while military pay increases must \n        exceed growth in the Employment Cost Index through fiscal year \n        2006, increases in subsequent years will be capped one-half \n        percentage point below the Employment Cost Index, to the \n        detriment of retention and readiness over the long term.\n            (6) The remaining so-called pay comparability gap should be \n        eliminated as quickly as possible, and military pay increases \n        must sustain full comparability with increases in the \n        Employment Cost Index.\n\nSEC. 3. ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS IN MONTHLY BASIC PAY FOR MEMBERS OF THE \n              UNIFORMED SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Annual Adjustment Required.--Section 1009 of title 37, United \nStates Code, is amended by striking subsections (a), (b), and (c) and \ninserting the following new subsections:\n    ``(a) Requirement for Annual Adjustment.--Effective on January 1 of \neach year, the rates of basic pay for members of the uniformed services \nunder section 203(a) of this title shall be increased under this \nsection.\n    ``(b) Effectiveness of Adjustment.--An adjustment under this \nsection shall have the force and effect of law.\n    ``(c) Equal Percentage Increase for All Members.--(1) Subject to \nsubsection (d), an adjustment made under this section in a year shall \nprovide all eligible members with an increase in the monthly basic pay \nthat is the percentage (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) \nby which the Employment Cost Index for the base quarter of the year \nbefore the preceding year exceeds the Employment Cost Index for the \nbase quarter of the second year before the preceding calendar year (if \nat all).\n    ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), but subject to subsection (d), \nthe percentage of the adjustment taking effect under this section \nduring each of fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006, shall be one-half of \none percentage point higher than the percentage that would otherwise be \napplicable under such paragraph.''.\n    (b) Publication of Adjusted Rates.--Subsection (e) of such section \nis amended--\n            (1) by striking ``(e) Notice of Allocations.--'' and \n        inserting ``(e) Notification and Publication Requirements.--\n        (1)''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(2) The rates of basic pay that take effect under this section \nshall be printed in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal \nRegulations.''.\n    (c) Presidential Determination of Need for Alternative Pay \nAdjustment.--Such section is further amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h); and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (f) the following new \n        subsection (g):\n    ``(g) Effect of National Emergency or Serious Economic \nConditions.--(1) If, because of national emergency or serious economic \nconditions affecting the general welfare, the President determines that \nthe pay adjustment otherwise required by this section for a year is \ninappropriate, the President may prepare a plan proposing such \nalternative pay adjustments as the President considers appropriate. The \nPresident shall submit the plan, together with the reasons for the \nalternative pay adjustments, to Congress before March 1 of the \npreceding year.\n    ``(2) In evaluating an economic condition affecting the general \nwelfare under this subsection, the President shall consider pertinent \neconomic measures including the Indexes of Leading Economic Indicators, \nthe Gross National Product, the unemployment rate, the budget deficit, \nthe Consumer Price Index, the Producer Price Index, the Employment Cost \nIndex, and the Implicit Price Deflator for Personal Consumption \nExpenditures.\n    ``(3) The President shall include in the plan submitted under \nparagraph (1) an assessment of the impact that the alternative pay \nadjustments proposed in the plan will have on the ability to recruit \nand retain well-qualified members of the uniformed services.\n    (d) Definitions.--Such section, as amended by subsection (c), is \nfurther amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(i) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) The term `Employment Cost Index' means the Employment \n        Cost Index (wages and salaries, private industry workers) \n        published quarterly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n            ``(2) The term `base quarter' for any year is the three-\n        month period ending on September 30 of such year.''.\n    (e) Conforming Amendment.--Subsection (d)(2) of such section is \namended by striking ``in the General Schedule rates of basic pay for \ncivilian employees.'' and inserting ``in the rates of monthly basic pay \nunder this section.''."
