    "title": "AB 197",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) authorizes the State Air Resources Board to adopt regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emission reductions.\n(b) The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) requires the State Air Resources Board to reduce statewide emissions of greenhouse gases to at least the 1990 emissions level by 2020 and to maintain and continue reductions thereafter.\n(c) Continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is critical for the protection of all areas of the state, but especially for the state\u2019s most disadvantaged communities, as those communities are affected first, and most frequently, by adverse impacts of climate change, including increased frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, heat, and flooding. The state\u2019s most disadvantaged communities are also disproportionately impacted by the deleterious effects of climate change on public health.\n(d) The State Air Resources Board\u2019s actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be done in a manner that is transparent and accountable to the public and the Legislature. To this end, the State Air Resources Board must enhance the accessibility of information used to inform and evaluate regulatory measures developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n(e) Transparency and accountability also are essential to ensuring the state\u2019s actions are done in an equitable fashion that is protective and mindful of the effects on the state\u2019s most disadvantaged communities.\n(f) In recognition of the need for ongoing, permanent oversight over the implementation of the state\u2019s climate policies, the Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies will be established. The committee will uniquely provide an oversight perspective that connects the jurisdictions of several legislative standing committees, including those that have the issues of air quality, transportation, energy, and local government within their jurisdiction, which is critical given that the state has integrated climate change policies throughout the activities of many state agencies in addition to the State Air Resources Board.\nSEC. 2.\nArticle 7.6 (commencing with Section 9147.10) is added to Chapter 1.5 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:\nArticle  7.6. Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies\n9147.10.\n(a) The Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies is hereby created. The committee shall ascertain facts and make recommendations to the Legislature concerning the state\u2019s programs, policies, and investments related to climate change. Those recommendations shall be shared with other appropriate legislative standing committees, including the Assembly Committee on Budget and the Senate Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review.\n(b) The joint committee shall consist of at least three Members of the Senate and at least three Members of the Assembly who shall be selected in the manner provided for in the Joint Rules of the Senate and Assembly. The membership shall reflect the perspectives of multiple standing committees.\n(c) The chair of the State Air Resources Board shall annually appear before the joint committee to present the state board\u2019s annual informational report on the reported emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants from all sectors covered by the scoping plan, as required pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 38531 of the Health and Safety Code. This presentation may be done at a hearing that is held jointly with the relevant Assembly and Senate standing committees.\n(d) In recognition of the technical complexity involved in reviewing the state\u2019s climate policies, the joint committee may establish a panel of experts to provide an independent analysis of the state\u2019s policies to better inform the joint committee\u2019s recommendations.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 38506 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n38506.\nFor purposes of this division, \u201csocial costs\u201d means an estimate of the economic damages, including, but not limited to, changes in net agricultural productivity; impacts to public health; climate adaptation impacts, such as property damages from increased flood risk; and changes in energy system costs, per metric ton of greenhouse gas emission per year.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 38531 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n38531.\n(a) (1) The state board shall make available, and update at least annually, on its Internet Web site the emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants for each facility that reports to the state board pursuant to Section 38530. The data shall be displayed in a manner that illustrates the changes in emissions levels over time.\n(2) No later than January 1, 2018, the state board shall add toxic air contaminant emissions to the information made available pursuant to paragraph (1).\n(3) The criteria pollutant and toxic air contaminant emissions data for stationary sources shall be based on data provided to the state board by air pollution control and air quality management districts collected pursuant to Section 39607 and Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 44340) of Part 6 of Division 26.\n(b) At least once a year at a hearing of the Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies, the state board shall present an informational report on the reported emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants from all sectors covered by the scoping plan prepared pursuant to Section 38561. The report shall evaluate emission trends and include a discussion of the regulatory requirements, initiatives, and other programs that may influence those trends. The report also may include recommendations from the state board for legislative action and consideration.\nSEC. 5.\nSection 38562.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n38562.5.\nWhen adopting rules and regulations pursuant to this division to achieve emissions reductions beyond the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit and to protect the state\u2019s most impacted and disadvantaged communities, the state board shall follow the requirements in subdivision (b) of Section 38562, consider the social costs of the emissions of greenhouse gases, and prioritize both of the following:\n(a) Emission reduction rules and regulations that result in direct emission reductions at large stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions sources and direct emission reductions from mobile sources.\n(b) Emission reduction rules and regulations that result in direct emission reductions from sources other than those specified in subdivision (a).\nSEC. 6.\nSection 38562.7 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n38562.7.\nEach scoping plan update developed pursuant to Section 38561 shall identify for each emissions reduction measure, including each alternative compliance mechanism, market-based compliance mechanism, and potential monetary and nonmonetary incentive the following information:\n(a) The range of projected greenhouse gas emissions reductions that result from the measure.\n(b) The range of projected air pollution reductions that result from the measure.\n(c) The cost-effectiveness, including avoided social costs, of the measure.\nSEC. 7.\nSection 39510 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n39510.\n(a) The State Air Resources Board is continued in existence in the California Environmental Protection Agency. The state board shall consist of 14 voting members.\n(b) Twelve members shall be appointed by the Governor, with the consent of the Senate, on the basis of their demonstrated interest and proven ability in the field of air pollution control and their understanding of the needs of the general public in connection with air pollution problems.\n(c) Of the members appointed pursuant to subdivision (b), six members shall have the following qualifications:\n(1) One member shall have training and experience in automotive engineering or closely related fields.\n(2) One member shall have training and experience in chemistry, meteorology, or related scientific fields, including agriculture or law.\n(3) One member shall be a physician and surgeon or an authority on health effects of air pollution.\n(4) Two members shall be public members.\n(5) One member shall have the qualifications specified in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) or shall have experience in the field of air pollution control.\n(d) Of the members appointed pursuant to subdivision (b), six members shall be board members from districts who shall reflect the qualitative requirements of subdivision (c) to the extent practicable.

One member shall be appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules. One member shall be appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly.\nSEC. 8.\nSection 39607 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n39607.\nThe state board shall:\n(a) Establish a program to secure data on air quality in each air basin established by the state board.\n(b) (1) Inventory sources of air pollution within the air basins of the state and determine the kinds and quantity of air pollutants, including, but not limited to, the contribution of natural sources, mobile sources, and area sources of emissions, including a separate identification of those sources not subject to district permit requirements, to the extent feasible and necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. The state board shall use, to the fullest extent, the data of local agencies and other state and federal agencies in fulfilling this purpose.\n(2) Make available on the state board\u2019s Internet Web site the emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants throughout the state broken down to a local and subcounty level for stationary sources and to at least a county level for mobile sources. The emissions reported shall include data on the emissions of criteria pollutants and toxic air contaminants emitted by stationary sources as provided to the state board by districts. The information shall be displayed graphically and updated at least once a year.\n(c) Monitor air pollutants in cooperation with districts and with other agencies to fulfill the purpose of this division.\n(d) Adopt test procedures to measure compliance with its nonvehicular emission standards and those of districts.\n(e) Establish and periodically review criteria for designating an air basin attainment or nonattainment for any state ambient air quality standard set forth in Section 70200 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. In developing and reviewing these criteria, the state board shall consider instances where there is poor or limited ambient air quality data, and shall consider highly irregular or infrequent violations. The state board shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposed criteria, and shall adopt the criteria after a public hearing.\n(f) Evaluate, in consultation with the districts and other interested parties, air quality-related indicators that may be used to measure or estimate progress in the attainment of state standards and establish a list of approved indicators. On or before July 1, 1993, the state board shall identify one or more air quality indicators to be used by districts in assessing progress as required by subdivision (b) of Section 40924. The state board shall continue to evaluate the prospective application of air quality indicators and, upon a finding that adequate air quality modeling capability exists, shall identify one or more indicators that may be used by districts in lieu of the annual emission reductions mandated by subdivision (a) of Section 40914. In no case shall any indicator be less stringent or less protective, on the basis of overall health protection, than the annual emission reduction requirement in subdivision (a) of Section 40914.\n(g) Establish, not later than July 1, 1996, a uniform methodology that may be used by districts in assessing population exposure, including, but not limited to, reduction in exposure of districtwide subpopulations, such as children, the elderly, and persons with respiratory disease, to ambient air pollutants at levels above the state ambient air quality standards, for estimating reductions in population exposure for the purposes of Sections 40913, 40924, and 41503, and for the establishment of the means by which reductions in population exposures may be achieved. The methodology adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall be consistent with the federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 7401 et seq.), and with this division, including, but not limited to, Section 39610.\nSEC. 9.\nThis act shall become operative only if Senate Bill 32 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session is enacted and becomes effective on or before January 1, 2017."
