DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Advanced fission reactor.--The term ``advanced fission \n        reactor'' means a nuclear fission reactor with significant \n        improvements over the most recent generation of nuclear \n        reactors, which may include inherent safety features, lower \n        waste yields, greater fuel utilization, superior reliability, \n        resistance to proliferation, and increased thermal efficiency.\n            (2) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the \n        Department of Energy.\n            (3) National laboratories.--The term ``National \n        Laboratories'' has the meaning given the term in section 2 of \n        the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801).\n            (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n\nSEC. 3. HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTATION AND SUPPORTIVE RESEARCH.\n\n    (a) Modeling and Simulation.--The Secretary shall carry out a \nprogram to enhance the Nation's capabilities to develop new reactor \ntechnologies through high-performance computation modeling and \nsimulation techniques. This program shall coordinate with relevant \nFederal agencies through the National Strategic Computing Initiative \ncreated under Executive Order 13702 (July 29, 2015) while taking into \naccount the following objectives:\n            (1) Utilizing expertise from the private sector, \n        universities, and National Laboratories to develop \n        computational software and capabilities that prospective users \n        may access to accelerate research and development of advanced \n        fission reactor systems, nuclear fusion systems, and reactor \n        systems for space exploration.\n            (2) Developing computational tools to simulate and predict \n        nuclear phenomena that may be validated through physical \n        experimentation.\n            (3) Increasing the utility of the Department's research \n        infrastructure by coordinating with the Advanced Scientific \n        Computing Research program within the Office of Science.\n            (4) Leveraging experience from the Energy Innovation Hub \n        for Modeling and Simulation.\n            (5) Ensuring that new experimental and computational tools \n        are accessible to relevant research communities.\n    (b) Supportive Research Activities.--The Secretary shall consider \nsupport for additional research activities to maximize the utility of \nits research facilities, including physical processes to simulate \ndegradation of materials and behavior of fuel forms and for validation \nof computational tools.\n\nSEC. 4. ENABLING NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION.\n\n    (a) National Reactor Innovation Center.--The Secretary shall carry \nout a program to enable the testing and demonstration of reactor \nconcepts to be proposed and funded by the private sector. The Secretary \nshall leverage the technical expertise of relevant Federal agencies and \nNational Laboratories in order to minimize the time required to enable \nconstruction and operation of privately funded experimental reactors at \nNational Laboratories or other Department-owned sites while ensuring \nreasonable safety for persons working within these sites. Such reactors \nshall operate to meet the following objectives:\n            (1) Enabling physical validation of novel reactor concepts.\n            (2) Resolving technical uncertainty and increasing \n        practical knowledge relevant to safety, resilience, security, \n        and functionality of first-of-a-kind reactor concepts.\n            (3) General research and development to improve nascent \n        technologies.\n    (b) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date \nof enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the \nNational Laboratories, relevant Federal agencies, and other \nstakeholders, shall transmit to the Committee on Science, Space, and \nTechnology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources of the Senate a report assessing the Department's \ncapabilities to authorize, host, and oversee privately funded fusion \nand advanced fission experimental reactors as described under \nsubsection (a). The report shall address the following:\n            (1) The Department's safety review and oversight \n        capabilities, including options to leverage expertise from the \n        Nuclear Regulatory Commission and National Laboratories.\n            (2) Potential sites capable of hosting activities described \n        under subsection (a).\n            (3) The efficacy of the Department's available contractual \n        mechanisms to partner with the private sector and Federal \n        agencies, including cooperative research and development \n        agreements, strategic partnership projects, and agreements for \n        commercializing technology.\n            (4) Potential cost structures related to physical security, \n        decommissioning, liability, and other long term project costs.\n            (5) Other challenges or considerations identified by the \n        Secretary."
