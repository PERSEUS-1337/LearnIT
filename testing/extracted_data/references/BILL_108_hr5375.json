FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There have been allegations of mismanagement, fraud, \n        and corruption in the United Nations Oil-for-Food program.\n            (2) The United Nations Office of Internal Oversight \n        Services (OIOS) conducted audits of the United Nations Oil-for-\n        Food program.\n            (3) These OIOS audits identified mismanagement and \n        ``uneconomical'' arrangements in the contract entered into by \n        the United Nations for the provision of independent Oil-for-\n        Food inspection agents in Iraq, and observed that the \n        contractor providing inspection services in Iraq on behalf of \n        the United Nations ``had not fully performed its contractual \n        duties''.\n            (4) The ``overall conclusion'' of the OIOS audit was that \n        ``management of the Contract'' had ``not been adequate and \n        certain provisions of the contract had not been adhered to''.\n            (5) Specifically, the OIOS audit concluded the contractor \n        failed to maintain inspection agents at staffing levels \n        required by the contract, overcharged the United Nations, \n        engaged in ``unprofessional conduct'', and reported figures for \n        goods as having arrived that were vastly different than the \n        figures reported by the United Nations.\n            (6) The OIOS concluded that the United Nations Office of \n        Iraq Programs needed ``to strengthen its management of \n        contracts'', had failed to designate anyone in Iraq to manage \n        the contract, and that in the ``absence of a contract \n        manager'', the United Nations Office of Iraq Programs had ``no \n        assurance that the services provided were in consonance with \n        the spirit and letter of the contract''.\n            (7) It has been and continues to be the policy and practice \n        of the United Nations not to release OIOS audit reports to \n        member states.\n            (8) The United Nations has denied the United States access \n        to OIOS audits of the Oil-for-Food Program both during and \n        after the life of the program, despite repeated requests by the \n        United States for access to such audits.\n            (9) The ability of member states to fulfill their \n        responsibilities in connection with United Nations programs is \n        undermined by the nondisclosure policy of the United Nations \n        barring full and timely access by member states to OIOS audit \n        reports.\n\nSEC. 3. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MEASURES FOR THE UNITED \n              NATIONS.\n\n    (a) Access by Member States to OIOS Audits.--Congress urges the \nPresident to instruct the Permanent Mission of the United States to the \nUnited Nations to use the voice and vote of the United States to seek \nto ensure the United Nations has procedures in place to ensure that all \nreports prepared by the OIOS are made available, in a timely fashion, \nfully and without modification (except to the extent necessary to \nprotect the privacy rights of individuals) to member states of the \nUnited Nations.\n    (b) Report on Financial Disclosure Requirements of United Nations \nOfficials.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act, the Department of State shall submit to the appropriate \ncongressional committees a report assessing the adequacy of financial \ndisclosure rules and practices for United Nations officials together \nwith recommendations for any needed reforms identified in the course of \nthe assessment.\n\nSEC. 4.
