FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) there are 65,000,000 homeowners in the United States, \n        representing approximately two-thirds of all households, who \n        have a strong and justified interest in preserving and \n        enhancing the value of their property;\n            (2) the value of a homeowner's home is based in large part \n        on the location of the property relative to other features of \n        the built and natural environment, and the increase or decrease \n        in the value of a home over time is inextricably linked to \n        changes in the quality of the neighborhood and environment in \n        which the home is located, including but not limited to the \n        quality of the water for drinking, fishing, and swimming, the \n        clarity and healthfulness of the air, the risk of flooding, the \n        scenic beauty of the community, the presence or absence of \n        offensive odors and excessive noise, the health and abundance \n        of wildlife resources, and other factors;\n            (3) the value of homes in the United States is frequently \n        reduced, and sometimes destroyed, by certain types of land \n        development, industrial activity, and other actions that occur \n        on neighboring properties or at other locations, including \n        sites upwind, upstream, or upslope from private homes;\n            (4) protecting private homeowners from the adverse affects \n        of irresponsible actions of certain entities and individuals \n        which cause injury to homeowners' property values is important \n        not only to homeowners but also to their communities and \n        society as a whole; and\n            (5) current public information and participation procedures \n        are often insufficient to provide individual homeowners with \n        notice of activities and the opportunity to effectively \n        participate in decisionmaking procedures that have the \n        potential to significantly affect the value of their homes.\n\nSEC. 3. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT ACTIVITIES THAT \n              COULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES.\n\n    (a) Notice.--\n            (1) General requirement.--Within 90 days after the \n        enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of Management \n        and Budget shall establish uniform Federal procedures \n        applicable to all agencies under this section. In accordance \n        with such procedures, each agency shall require any person \n        required to file any application to conduct property impacting \n        activity with the agency to provide the notice described in \n        this section. The Director shall designate a lead agency in the \n        case of any application under this section that involves more \n        than one agency.\n            (2) Application to conduct property impacting activity.--\n        For purposes of this section, the term an ``application to \n        conduct property impacting activity'' means an application for \n        a permit, license, or other approval form, or contract, lease, \n        or other arrangement, with an agency, that would authorize the \n        applicant, pursuant to Federal law, to conduct an activity that \n        generates pollutants or produces other adverse impacts with the \n        potential to reduce the value of any private home.\n            (3) Homeowners required to receive notice.--The notice \n        under this section shall be provided by delivery, by certified \n        mail, of individual written notice to each homeowner whose \n        property lies within \\1/4\\ mile of the perimeter of the site at \n        which the activity that is the subject of the application will \n        be carried out. The applicant shall also publish notice under \n        this subsection at least 3 times in the newspapers of general \n        circulation in the affected community. The agency may also \n        provide notice under this subsection by mail to the owner of \n        any home identified by the agency as reasonably likely \nto suffer a reduction in value as a result of the proposed activity.\n            (4) Notice contents.--The notice referred to in paragraph \n        (2) shall describe the nature of the application to conduct \n        property impacting activity, the potential impacts of the \n        proposed activity on the value of private homes, potential \n        impacts on homeowners and other members of the public, the name \n        and telephone number of the applicant and an agency \n        representative assigned to provide further information about \n        the application, and any opportunities available for homeowner \n        or other affected members of the public to comment on the \n        proposed activity.\n    (b) Public Response; Identification of Alternatives to Reduce \nProperty Impacts.--In addition to and not in lieu of any other \nprocedures established by law, each agency shall establish a toll-free \ntelephone number which homeowners may call to register concerns about \nthe potential effects on property values of an application for a \nproposed activity or to request additional information concerning \napplications to conduct property impacting activities filed with the \nagency and opportunities to submit public comment. If requested by an \napplicant or any homeowner whose property is reasonably likely to \nsuffer a reduction in value as a result of the activity to be \nauthorized by such application, the agency shall thoroughly investigate \nthe potential impact of the proposed activity on the value of private \nhomes, and seek to identify alternatives to the proposed action which \nreduce the adverse effects on the value of private homes.\n\nSEC. 4.

If either the homeowner or the defendant requests \nthat the agency resolve the claim, the agency head shall convene a \nmeeting of the parties and use his or her best efforts to arrive at a \njust resolution of the claim in order to avoid unnecessary litigation \ncosts.
