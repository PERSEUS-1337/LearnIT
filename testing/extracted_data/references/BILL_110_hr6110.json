After the introduction of the first such \njoint resolution in either House of Congress in any calendar year, then \nno other joint resolution introduced pursuant to this section shall be \nsubject to the procedures set forth in this section.\n    (b) Procedures for Consideration of Joint Resolutions.--\n            (1) Any committee of the House of Representatives to which \n        an alternative spending compliance measure is referred shall \n        report it to the House without amendment not later than the \n        seventh legislative day after the date of its introduction. If \n        a committee fails to report the bill within that period or the \n        House has adopted a concurrent resolution providing for \n        adjournment sine die at the end of a Congress, it shall be in \n        order to move that the House discharge the committee from \n        further consideration of the bill.

Such a motion shall not be in order after a committee \n        has reported a spending compliance measure with respect to that \n        special message or after the House has disposed of a motion to \n        discharge with respect to that special message. The previous \n        question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its \n        adoption without intervening motion except twenty minutes of \n        debate equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an \n        opponent. If such a motion is adopted, the House shall proceed \n        immediately to consider the spending compliance measure bill in \n        accordance with paragraph (3). A motion to reconsider the vote \n        by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in order.\n            (2) After a spending compliance measure is reported or a \n        committee has been discharged from further consideration, or \n        the House has adopted a concurrent resolution providing for \n        adjournment sine die at the end of a Congress, it shall be in \n        order to move to proceed to consider the spending compliance \n        measure in the House. Such a motion shall be in order only at a \n        time designated by the Speaker in the legislative schedule \n        within two legislative days after the day on which the \n        proponent announces his intention to offer the motion. Such a \n        motion shall not be in order after the House has disposed of a \n        motion to proceed with respect to that special message. The \n        previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion \n        to its adoption without intervening motion. A motion to \n        reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of shall \n        not be in order.\n            (3) The spending compliance measure shall be considered as \n        read. All points of order against an approval bill and against \n        its consideration are waived. The previous question shall be \n        considered as ordered on an approval bill to its passage \n        without intervening motion except five hours of debate equally \n        divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent and one \n        motion to limit debate on the bill. A motion to reconsider the \n        vote on passage of the bill shall not be in order.\n            (4) A spending compliance measure received from the Senate \n        shall not be referred to committee.\n    (c) Voting.--The vote on final passage of a joint resolution or \nconference report thereon referred to in paragraph (1) shall require \napproval of not less than three-fifths of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\nSEC. 709. ALTERNATE SPENDING REDUCTION LEGISLATION IN THE SENATE.\n\n    (a) Introduction of Joint Resolution.--At any time after OMB issues \na final order for a fiscal year, but before the end of the session of \nCongress in session on the date of the issuance of such order, the \nmajority leader of either House of Congress may introduce a joint \nresolution which contains provisions directing the President to modify \nthe most recent final order provide an alternative to eliminate the \nspending excess for such fiscal year or years. After the introduction \nof the first such joint resolution in either House of Congress in any \ncalendar year, then no other joint resolution introduced in such House \nin such calendar year shall be subject to the procedures set forth in \nthis section.\n    (b) Procedures for Consideration of Joint Resolutions.--\n            (1) Referral to committee.--A joint resolution introduced \n        in the Senate under subsection (a) shall not be referred to a \n        committee of the Senate and shall be placed on the calendar \n        pending disposition of such joint resolution in accordance with \n        this subsection.\n            (2) Consideration in the senate.--On or after the third \n        calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) \n        beginning after a joint resolution is introduced under \n        subsection (a), notwithstanding any rule or precedent of the \n        Senate, including rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the \n        Senate, it is in order (even though a previous motion to the \n        same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the Senate \n        to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint \n        resolution. The motion is not in order after the eighth \n        calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) \n        beginning after a joint resolution (to which the motion \n        applies) is introduced. The joint resolution is privileged in \n        the Senate. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion \n        is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion \n        to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution is \n        agreed to, the Senate shall immediately proceed to \n        consideration of the joint resolution without intervening \n        motion, order, or other business, and the joint resolution \n        shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate until \n        disposed of.\n            (3) Debate in the senate.--\n                    (A) In the Senate, debate on a joint resolution \n                introduced under subsection (a), amendments thereto, \n                and all debatable motions and appeals in connection \n                therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, \n                which shall be divided equally between the majority \n                leader and the minority leader (or their designees).\n                    (B) A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to \n                the consideration of other business is not in order. A \n                motion to reconsider the vote by which the joint \n                resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in \n                order, and a motion to recommit the joint resolution is \n                not in order.\n                    (C)(i) No amendment that is not germane to the \n                provisions of the joint resolution shall be in order in \n                the Senate. In the Senate, an amendment, any amendment \n                to an amendment, or any debatable motion or appeal is \n                debatable for not to exceed 30 minutes to be equally \n                divided between, and controlled by, the mover and the \n                majority leader (or their designees), except that in \n                the event that the majority leader favors the \n                amendment, motion, or appeal, the minority leader (or \n                the minority leader's designee) shall control the time \n                in opposition to the amendment, motion, or appeal.\n                    (ii) In the Senate, an amendment that is otherwise \n                in order shall be in order notwithstanding the fact \n                that it amends the joint resolution in more than one \n                place or amends language previously amended. It shall \n                not be in order in the Senate to vote on the question \n                of agreeing to such a joint resolution or any amendment \n                thereto unless the figures then contained in such joint \n                resolution or amendment are mathematically consistent.\n            (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n        conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution introduced under \n        subsection (a), a single quorum call at the conclusion of the \n        debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate, \n        and the disposition of any pending amendments under paragraph \n        (3), the vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall \n        occur.\n            (5) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair shall \n        be decided without debate.\n            (6) Conference reports.--In the Senate, points of order \n        under titles III and IV of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n        are applicable to a conference report on the joint resolution \n        or any amendments in disagreement thereto.\n            (7) Resolution from other house.--If, before the passage by \n        the Senate of a joint resolution of the Senate introduced under \n        subsection (a), the Senate receives from the House of \n        Representatives a joint resolution introduced under subsection \n        (a), then the following procedures shall apply:\n                    (A) The joint resolution of the House of \n                Representatives shall not be referred to a committee \n                and shall be placed on the calendar.\n                    (B) With respect to a joint resolution introduced \n                under subsection (a) in the Senate--\n                            (i) the procedure in the Senate shall be \n                        the same as if no joint resolution had been \n                        received from the House; but\n                            (ii)(I) the vote on final passage shall be \n                        on the joint resolution of the House if it is \n                        identical to the joint resolution then pending \n                        for passage in the Senate; or\n                            (II) if the joint resolution from the House \n                        is not identical to the joint resolution then \n                        pending for passage in the Senate and the \n                        Senate then passes the Senate joint resolution, \n                        the Senate shall be considered to have passed \n                        the House joint resolution as amended by the \n                        text of the Senate joint resolution.\n                    (C) Upon disposition of the joint resolution \n                received from the House, it shall no longer be in order \n                to consider the resolution originated in the Senate.\n            (8) Senate action on house resolution.--If the Senate \n        receives from the House of Representatives a joint resolution \n        introduced pursuant to this section after the Senate has \n        disposed of a Senate originated resolution which is identical \n        to the House passed joint resolution, the action of the Senate \n        with regard to the disposition of the Senate originated joint \n        resolution shall be deemed to be the action of the Senate with \n        regard to the House originated joint resolution. If it is not \n        identical to the House passed joint resolution, then the Senate \n        shall be considered to have passed the joint resolution of the \n        House as amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.\n            (9) The vote on final passage of a joint resolution or \n        conference report thereon referred to in paragraph (1) shall \n        require approval of not less than three-fifths of the Members \n        of the Senate.\n\nSEC. 710.
