That exemption is in the following amounts:\n(1) Seven thousand dollars ($7,000) of the full value of the dwelling through the 2015\u201316 fiscal year.\n(2) (A) Beginning with the lien date for the 2016\u201317 fiscal year, twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of the full value of the dwelling.\n(B) Beginning with the lien date for the 2017\u201318 fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, the assessor shall adjust the exemption amount of the prior fiscal year by the percentage change, rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of 1 percent, in the House Price Index for California for the first three quarters of the prior calendar year, as determined by the federal Housing Finance Agency.\n(b) (1) The exemption does not extend to property that is rented, vacant, under construction on the lien date, or that is a vacation or secondary home of the owner or owners, nor does it apply to property on which an owner receives the veteran\u2019s exemption.\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if a person receiving the exemption is not occupying the dwelling on the lien date because the dwelling was damaged in a misfortune or calamity, the person shall be deemed to occupy that same dwelling as his or her principal place of residence on the lien date, provided the person\u2019s absence from the dwelling is temporary and the person intends to return to the dwelling when possible to do so. Except as provided in paragraph (3), when a dwelling has been totally destroyed, and thus no dwelling exists on the lien date, the exemption provided by this section shall not be applicable until the structure has been replaced and is occupied as a dwelling.\n(3) A dwelling that was totally destroyed in a disaster for which the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency, that qualified for the exemption provided by this section prior to the commencement date of the disaster and that has not changed ownership since the commencement date of the disaster, shall be deemed occupied by the person receiving the exemption on the lien date provided the person intends to reconstruct a dwelling on the property and occupy the dwelling as his or her principal place of residence when it is possible to do so.\n(c) For purposes of this section, all of the following apply:\n(1) \u201cOwner\u201d includes a person purchasing the dwelling under a contract of sale or who holds shares or membership in a cooperative housing corporation, which holding is a requisite to the exclusive right of occupancy of a dwelling.\n(2) (A) \u201cDwelling\u201d means a building, structure, or other shelter constituting a place of abode, whether real property or personal property, and any land on which it may be situated.

Each exemption allowed pursuant to this subdivision shall be deducted from the total assessed valuation of the cooperative housing corporation. The exemption shall be taken into account in apportioning property taxes among owners of share or membership interests in the cooperative housing corporations so as to benefit those owners who qualify for the exemption.\n(d) The exemption provided for in subdivision (k) of Section 3 of Article XIII of the California Constitution shall first be applied to the building, structure, or other shelter and the excess, if any, shall be applied to any land on which it may be located.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 17053.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:\n17053.5.\n(a) (1) For a qualified renter, there shall be allowed a credit against his or her \u201cnet tax,\u201d as defined in Section 17039.
