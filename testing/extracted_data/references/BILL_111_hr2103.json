FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Child marriage, also known as ``forced marriage'' or \n        ``early marriage'', is a harmful traditional practice that \n        deprives girls of their dignity and human rights.\n            (2) Child marriage as a traditional practice, as well as \n        through coercion or force, is a violation of article 16 of the \n        Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, ``Marriage \n        shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of \n        intending spouses.''.\n            (3) According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n        (UNICEF), an estimated 60,000,000 girls in developing countries \n        now ages 20-24 were married under the age of 18, and if present \n        trends continue more than 100,000,000 more girls in developing \n        countries will be married as children over the next decade, \n        according to the Population Council.\n            (4) Child marriage ``treats young girls as property'' and \n        ``poses grave risks not only to women's basic rights but also \n        their health, economic independence, education, and status in \n        society'', according to the Department of State in 2005.\n            (5) In 2005, the Department of State conducted a world-wide \n        survey and found child marriage to be a concern in 64 out of \n        182 countries surveyed, with child marriage most common in sub-\n        Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia.\n            (6) In Ethiopia's Amhara region, about half of all girls \n        are married by age 14 with 95 percent not knowing their \n        husbands before marriage, 85 percent unaware they were to be \n        married, and 70 percent reporting their first sexual initiation \n        within marriage taking place before their first menstrual \n        period, according to a 2004 Population Council survey.\n            (7) In some areas of northern Nigeria, 45 percent of girls \n        are married by age 15 and 73 percent by age 18, with age gaps \n        between girls and the husbands averaging between 12 and 18 \n        years.\n            (8) Between half and three-quarters of all girls are \n        married before the age of 18 in the following countries: Niger, \n        Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the Central African Republic, \n        Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and Nepal, according to Demographic \n        Health Survey data.\n            (9) Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, a \n        lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls, \n        parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within marriage, \n        the dowry system, and the perceived lack of value of girls.\n            (10) Child marriage has negative effects on girls' health, \n        including significantly increased risk of maternal death and \n        morbidity, infant mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula, \n        and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.\n            (11) According to the United States Agency for \n        International Development (USAID), increasing the age at first \n        birth for a woman will increase her chances of survival. \n        Currently, pregnancy and childbirth complications are the \n        leading cause of death for women 15 to 19 years old in \n        developing countries.\n            (12) In developing countries, girls 15 years of age are \n        five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their \n        20s.\n            (13) Child marriage can result in bonded labor or \n        enslavement, commercial sexual exploitation, and violence \n        against the victims, according to UNICEF.\n            (14) Out-of-school or unschooled girls are at greater risk \n        of child marriage while girls in school face pressure to \n        withdraw from school when secondary school requires monetary \n        costs, travel, or other social costs, including lack of \n        lavatories and supplies for menstruating girls and increased \n        risk of sexual violence.\n            (15) In Mozambique 60 percent of girls with no education \n        are married by age 18, compared to 10 percent of girls with \n        secondary schooling and less than 1 percent of girls with \n        higher education.\n            (16) According to UNICEF, in 2005 it was estimated that \n        ``about half of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa who drop out of \n        primary school do so because of poor water and sanitation \n        facilities''.\n            (17) UNICEF reports that investments in improving school \n        sanitation resulted in a 17 percent increase in school \n        enrollment for girls in Guinea and an 11 percent increase for \n        girls in Bangladesh.\n            (18) Investments in girls' schooling, creating safe \n        community spaces for girls, and programs for skills building \n        for out-of-school girls are all effective and demonstrated \n        strategies for preventing child marriage and creating a pathway \n        to empower girls by addressing conditions of poverty, low \n        status, and norms that contribute to child marriage.\n            (19) Most countries with high rates of child marriage have \n        a legally established minimum age of marriage, yet child \n        marriage persists due to strong traditional norms and the \n        failure to enforce existing laws.\n            (20) In Afghanistan, where the legal age of marriage for \n        girls is 16 years, 57 percent of marriages involve girls below \n        the age of 16, including girls younger than 10 years, according \n        to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).\n            (21) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that \n        ``child marriage is a clear and unacceptable violation of human \n        rights, and that the Department of State denounces all cases of \n        child marriage as child abuse''.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) child marriage is a violation of human rights and the \n        prevention and elimination of child marriage should be a \n        foreign policy goal of the United States;\n            (2) the practice of child marriage undermines United States \n        investments in foreign assistance to promote education and \n        skills building for girls, reduce maternal and child mortality, \n        reduce maternal illness, halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS, \n        prevent gender-based violence, and reduce poverty; and\n            (3) expanding educational opportunities for girls, economic \n        opportunities for women, and reducing maternal and child \n        mortality are critical to achieving the Millennium Development \n        Goals and the global health and development objectives of the \n        United States, including efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS.\n\nSEC. 4.
