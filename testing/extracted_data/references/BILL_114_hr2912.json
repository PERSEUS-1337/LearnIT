FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Constitution endows Congress with the power ``to \n        coin money, regulate the value thereof''.\n            (2) Following the financial crisis known as the Panic of \n        1907, Congress established the National Monetary Commission to \n        provide recommendations for the reform of the financial and \n        monetary systems of the United States.\n            (3) Incorporating several of the recommendations of the \n        National Monetary Commission, Congress created the Federal \n        Reserve System in 1913. As currently organized, the Federal \n        Reserve System consists of the Board of Governors in \n        Washington, District of Columbia, and the Federal Reserve Banks \n        organized into 12 districts around the United States. The \n        stockholders of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks include national \n        and certain State-chartered commercial banks, which operate on \n        a fractional reserve basis.\n            (4) Originally, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System a \n        monetary mandate to provide an elastic currency, within the \n        context of a gold standard, in response to seasonal \n        fluctuations in the demand for currency.\n            (5) Congress also gave the Federal Reserve System a \n        financial stability mandate to serve as the lender of last \n        resort to solvent but illiquid banks during a financial crisis.\n            (6) In 1977, Congress changed the monetary mandate of the \n        Federal Reserve System to a dual mandate for maximum employment \n        and stable prices.\n            (7) Empirical studies and historical evidence, both within \n        the United States and in other countries, demonstrate that \n        price stability is desirable because both inflation and \n        deflation damage the economy.\n            (8) The economic challenge of recent years--most notably \n        the bursting of the housing bubble, the financial crisis of \n        2008, and the ensuing anemic recovery--have occurred at great \n        cost in terms of lost jobs and output.\n            (9) Policymakers are reexamining the structure and \n        functioning of financial institutions and markets to determine \n        what, if any, changes need to be made to place the financial \n        system on a stronger, more sustainable path going forward.\n            (10) The Federal Reserve System has taken extraordinary \n        actions in response to the recent economic challenges.\n            (11) The Federal Open Market Committee has engaged in \n        multiple rounds of quantitative easing, providing unprecedented \n        liquidity to financial markets, while committing to holding \n        short-term interest rates low for a seemingly indefinite \n        period, and pursuing a policy of credit allocation by \n        purchasing Federal agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.\n            (12) In the wake of the recent extraordinary actions of the \n        Federal Reserve System, Congress--consistent with its \n        constitutional responsibilities and as it has done periodically \n        throughout the history of the United States--has once again \n        renewed its examination of monetary policy.\n            (13) Central in such examination has been a renewed look at \n        what is the most proper mandate for the Federal Reserve System \n        to conduct monetary policy in the 21st century.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Centennial \nMonetary Commission'' (in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 4. DUTIES.\n\n    (a) Study of Monetary Policy.--The Commission shall--\n            (1) examine how United States monetary policy since the \n        creation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n        System in 1913 has affected the performance of the United \n        States economy in terms of output, employment, prices, and \n        financial stability over time;\n            (2) evaluate various operational regimes under which the \n        Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the \n        Federal Open Market Committee may conduct monetary policy in \n        terms achieving the maximum sustainable level of output and \n        employment and price stability over the long term, including--\n                    (A) discretion in determining monetary policy \n                without an operational regime;\n                    (B) price level targeting;\n                    (C) inflation rate targeting;\n                    (D) nominal gross domestic product targeting (both \n                level and growth rate);\n                    (E) the use of monetary policy rules; and\n                    (F) the gold standard;\n            (3) evaluate the use of macro-prudential supervision and \n        regulation as a tool of monetary policy in terms of achieving \n        the maximum sustainable level of output and employment and \n        price stability over the long term;\n            (4) evaluate the use of the lender-of-last-resort function \n        of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a \n        tool of monetary policy in terms of achieving the maximum \n        sustainable level of output and employment and price stability \n        over the long term; and\n            (5) recommend a course for United States monetary policy \n        going forward, including--\n                    (A) the legislative mandate;\n                    (B) the operational regime;\n                    (C) the securities used in open market operations; \n                and\n                    (D) transparency issues.\n    (b) Report on Monetary Policy.--Not later than December 1, 2016, \nthe Commission shall submit to Congress and make publicly available a \nreport containing a statement of the findings and conclusions of the \nCommission in carrying out the study under subsection (a), together \nwith the recommendations the Commission considers appropriate.\n\nSEC. 5.
