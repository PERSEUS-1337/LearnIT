FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the Armed \n        Forces is the element of the Armed Forces of the United States \n        that has the capability quickly to augment the active duty \n        forces of the Armed Forces successfully in times of crisis.\n            (2) The Selected Reserve has been assigned increasingly \n        critical levels of responsibility for carrying out the \n        worldwide military missions of the Armed Forces since the end \n        of the Cold War.\n            (3) Members of the Selected Reserve have served proudly as \n        mobilized forces in numerous theaters from Europe to the \n        Pacific and South America, indeed, around the world.\n            (4) The active duty forces of the Armed Forces cannot \n        successfully perform all of the national security missions of \n        the Armed Forces without augmentation by the Selected Reserve.\n            (5) The high and increasing tempo of activity of the \n        Selected Reserve causes turbulence in the relationships of \n        members of the Selected Reserve with their families, employers, \n        and reserve units.\n            (6) The turbulence often results from lengthy, sometimes \n        year-long, absences of the members of the Selected Reserve from \n        their families and their civilian jobs in the performance of \n        military duties necessary for the execution of essential \n        missions.\n            (7) Family turbulence includes the difficulties associated \n        with vacillation between coverage of members' families for \n        health care under civilian health benefits plans and coverage \n        under the military health benefits options.\n            (8) Up to 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve, \n        including, in particular, self-employed members, do not have \n        adequate health benefits.\n\nSEC. 2.
