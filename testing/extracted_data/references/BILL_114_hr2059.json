    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Edwin Cole ``Ed'' Bearss was born June 26, 1923, in \n        Billings, Montana, to Omar and Virginia Bearss.\n            (2) During a 40-year career with the National Park Service, \n        Mr. Bearss distinguished himself as one of America's preeminent \n        historians, particularly in the field of the Civil War, not \n        only through his work to preserve the places in which our \n        nation's history was forged but also through his captivating \n        interpretive storytelling about the people and events that \n        shaped those places.\n            (3) His own family traces its genealogy to the Mayflower on \n        his mother's side and to 1636 on his father's side.\n            (4) Mr. Bearss' lifelong love affair with the Civil War was \n        kindled during his youth when he read a biography of \n        Confederate cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart. Even at an early \n        age, Mr. Bearss demonstrated a knack for committing facts to \n        memory, a skill that helped him win school contests in history, \n        current events, and geography.\n            (5) He graduated high school in May 1941 and the following \n        year joined the U.S. Marine Corps, serving with the 3rd Marine \n        Raider Battalion during the invasion of Guadalcanal and the \n        Russell Islands. He was badly wounded in gunfire at ``Suicide \n        Creek'', Cape Gloucester, New Britain, while serving with the \n        7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division.\n            (6) Upon returning home, Mr. Bearss attended Georgetown \n        University, obtaining a bachelor's degree in Foreign Service \n        studies, and later attended Indiana University, earning a \n        master's degree in history.\n            (7) It was during a fortuitous visit to the Shiloh National \n        Military Park in Tennessee, on a tour with the park historian, \n        where the seeds were planted for Mr. Bearss' future career with \n        the National Park Service.\n            (8) In 1955, he landed a job as park historian at the \n        National Battlefield Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi, where his \n        research helped fill in missing pieces of Civil War history. \n        None were more significant than the discovery of the U.S.S. \n        Cairo, a long-lost Union ironclad gunboat sunk by Confederate \n        submarine torpedoes in 1862 that was buried in the mud of the \n        Yazoo River. Mr. Bearss later authored a book on the ``sinking \n        and salvage'' of the ironclad.\n            (9) It was during his tenure at Shiloh that he met his \n        wife, Margie, a teacher who shared Mr. Bearss' love of history. \n        They had three children, Sara, Cole, and Jenny.\n            (10) Mr. Bearss became the National Park Service's chief \n        historian in 1981. Following his retirement in 1994, he was \n        recognized with the title Chief Historian Emeritus, a fitting \n        title as his research and recounting of our nation's history \n        continues to this day.\n            (11) He still travels throughout the year to our nation's \n        Civil War battlefields. He once said, ``You can't describe a \n        battlefield unless you walk it.''. Anyone who has spent time \n        with Mr. Bearss touring a battlefield, sometimes braving the \n        elements, enthralled by his prodigious tales regards him as a \n        National Treasure. His unique chronicling of our nation's \n        history has been described as a ``transcendental experience'' \n        of ``Homeric monologues'' punctuated by ``colorful, vivid \n        images''. Mr. Bearss himself has been described as a cross \n        between ``a good-natured platoon sergeant and Walter \n        Cronkite''. He lectures with his eye closed, so he can ``see'' \n        the history better, he once said.\n            (12) Mr. Bearss has received multiple honors for his \n        contributions to the preservation of our nation's history: the \n        Harry S. Truman Award in 1961 for Meritorious Service in the \n        field of Civil War history, Man of the Year at Vicksburg in \n        1963, inducted a member of the Company of Military Historians \n        in 1964, the Nevins-Freeman Award from the Chicago Civil War \n        Roundtable in 1980, the Department of the Interior's \n        Distinguished Service Award in 1983, and a commendation from \n        the Secretary of the Army in 1985. The Secretary of the \n        Interior at the time, James Watt, called Mr. Bearss \n        ``unquestionably the most productive historian in the history \n        of the National Park Service''.\n            (13) To this day, Mr. Bearss continues to tour the country \n        visiting battlefields and Civil War organizations, keeping \n        America's history fresh in the minds of future generations.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make \nappropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of the \nCongress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to Edwin Cole ``Ed'' \nBearss, in recognition of his contributions to preservation of American \nCivil War history and continued efforts to bring our nation's history \nalive for new generations through his interpretive storytelling.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation referred \nto in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this \nAct referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with \nsuitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the \nSecretary.\n\nSEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold \nmedal struck pursuant to section 2 under such regulations as the \nSecretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost \nthereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \noverhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal.\n\nSEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n    The medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for \npurposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code."
