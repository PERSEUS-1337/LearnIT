EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL \n              FOR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Introduction and Expedited Consideration in the House of \nRepresentatives.--\n            (1) Introduction in house of representatives.--The \n        legislative proposal submitted pursuant to section 2(f)(2) \n        shall be in the form of a joint resolution (in this subsection \n        referred to as the ``resolution''). Such resolution shall be \n        introduced in the House of Representatives by the Speaker \n        immediately upon receipt of the language and shall be referred \n        non-sequentially to the appropriate committee (or committees) \n        of the House of Representatives. If the resolution is not \n        introduced in accordance with the preceding sentence, the \n        resolution may be introduced by any member of the House of \n        Representatives.\n            (2) Committee consideration.--Not later than 15 calendar \n        days after the introduction of the resolution described in \n        paragraph (1), each committee of the House of Representatives \n        to which the resolution was referred shall report the \n        resolution. The report may include, at the committee's \n        discretion, a recommendation for action by the House. If a \n        committee has not reported such resolution (or an identical \n        resolution) at the end of 15 calendar days after its \n        introduction or at the end of the first day after there has \n        been reported to the House a resolution, whichever is earlier, \n        such committee shall be deemed to be discharged from further \n        consideration of such resolution and such resolution shall be \n        placed on the appropriate calendar of the House of \n        Representatives.\n            (3) Expedited procedure in house.--Not later than 5 \n        legislative days after the date on which all committees have \n        been discharged from consideration of a resolution, the Speaker \n        of the House of Representatives, or the Speaker's designee, \n        shall move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. \n        It shall also be in order for any member of the House of \n        Representatives to move to proceed to the consideration of the \n        resolution at any time after the conclusion of such 5-day \n        period. All points of order against the resolution (and against \n        consideration of the resolution) are waived. A motion to \n        proceed to the consideration of the resolution is highly \n        privileged in the House of Representatives and is not \n        debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, to a motion \n        to postpone consideration of the resolution, or to a motion to \n        proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n        reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed is agreed to \n        or not agreed to shall not be in order. If the motion to \n        proceed is agreed to, the House of Representatives shall \n        immediately proceed to consideration of the resolution without \n        intervening motion, order, or other business, and the \n        resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the House of \n        Representatives until disposed of. A motion to recommit the \n        resolution shall not be in order. Upon its passage in the \n        House, the clerk of the House shall provide for its immediate \n        transmittal to the Senate.\n    (b) Expedited Consideration in the Senate.--\n            (1) Referral to committee.--If the resolution is agreed to \n        by the House of Representatives, upon its receipt in the Senate \n        the Majority Leader of the Senate, or the Leader's designee, \n        the resolution shall be referred to the appropriate committee \n        (or committees) of the Senate.\n            (2) Committee consideration.--Not later than 15 calendar \n        days after the referral of the resolution under paragraph (1), \n        each committee of the Senate to which the resolution was \n        referred shall report the resolution. The report may include, \n        at each such committee's discretion, a recommendation for \n        action by the Senate. If a committee has not reported such \n        resolution (or an identical resolution) at the end of 15 \n        calendar days after its referral or at the end of the first day \n        after there has been reported to the Senate a resolution, \n        whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be \n        discharged from further consideration of such resolution and \n        such resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of \n        the Senate.\n            (3) Expedited floor consideration.--Not later than 5 \n        legislative days after the date on which all committees have \n        been discharged from consideration of a resolution, the \n        Majority Leader of the Senate, or the Majority Leader's \n        designee, shall move to proceed to the consideration of the \n        resolution. It shall also be in order for any member of the \n        Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of the \n        resolution at any time after the conclusion of such 5-day \n        period. All points of order against the resolution (and against \n        consideration of the resolution) are waived. A motion to \n        proceed to the consideration of the resolution in the Senate is \n        privileged and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to \n        amendment, to a motion to postpone consideration of the \n        resolution, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n        other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n        motion to proceed is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in \n        order. If the motion to proceed is agreed to, the Senate shall \n        immediately proceed to consideration of the resolution without \n        intervening motion, order, or other business, and the \n        resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate \n        until disposed of.\n    (c) Rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.--This section \nis enacted by Congress--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n        and House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed to be \n        part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable \n        only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House \n        in the case of a resolution under this subsection, and it \n        supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is \n        inconsistent with such rules; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to the \n        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n        House."
