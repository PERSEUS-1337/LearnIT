    "title": "An act to add Chapter 13 (commencing with Section 49010) to Division 17 of the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to food and agriculture.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Scaling up the Market Match program throughout the state would be beneficial to the health of local economies and the state economy while simultaneously improving the health of the most vulnerable families throughout California.\n(b) Since its inception in 2009, the Market Match program has encouraged the purchase and consumption of California fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables by directly linking California specialty crop producers with nutrition benefit clients and doubling the purchasing value of the nutrition assistance received by nutrition benefit clients when purchasing California fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables.\n(c) Market Match dollars provide incentives for new consumers to visit local farmers\u2019 markets and purchase healthy produce, benefiting both their health and the health of local economies.\n(d) The Market Match program has acted as an economic stimulus to local agricultural economies throughout the state by increasing the number of loyal customers and their purchasing power, including in food deserts where California fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables are scarce.\n(e) Data shows that between 2009 and 2012, the Market Match program increased CalFresh redemption amongst 37,000 new farmers\u2019 market customers at 140 participating farmers\u2019 markets in over 16 counties, from 132 percent to 700 percent.\n(f) Data shows that Market Match dollars have had a six-fold return on investment in farmers\u2019 market sales.\n(g) The Pacific Coast Farmers\u2019 Market Association\u2019s business analysis of returns on investment (ROI) for Market Match programs in 2012 held in various areas and cities shows the following rates of ROI throughout the state:\n(1) East Bay and San Francisco: 132 percent ROI.\n(2) Long Beach: 257 percent ROI.\n(3) Huntington Park: 403 percent ROI.\n(4) Davis: 390 percent ROI.\n(5) Woodland: 576 percent ROI.\n(6) Monterey: 717 percent ROI.\n(h) The enactment of the 2014 federal Farm Bill includes $100 million in grants to states for programs that supplement nutrition benefits if they incentivize healthier eating by beneficiaries.\n(i) The first round of grants awarded in 2015 proves that a statewide framework is an effective way to draw down these federal funds. The State of Washington was the largest first-round grant recipient, awarded almost $6 million to help low-income families afford fresh produce. California must act now and tap into this federal funding before it is too late.\n(j) Creation of a statewide Nutrition Incentive Matching Grant Program modeled after the successful experience of the Market Match program would help draw down federal funds to further maximize access to fresh healthy foods and stimulate local economies in a more equitable cross-section of communities.\nSEC. 2.\nChapter 13 (commencing with Section 49010) is added to Division 17 of the Food and Agricultural Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  13.
