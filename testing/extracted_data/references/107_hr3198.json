    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Agricultural Terrorism Prevention \nand Response Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. ENHANCED SECURITY FOR UNITED STATES AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND \n              FOOD SUPPLY SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The agricultural production sector of the United States \n        economy accounts for approximately 13 percent of the United \n        States gross national product.\n            (2) The strength, importance, and value of the United \n        States agricultural production and food supply system increases \n        the possibility that the system could become a target for \n        international terrorism, particularly a terrorism incident \n        specifically targeted to key animal or plant commodities used \n        in the production of food.\n            (3) Targeted terrorism activities could include the \n        deliberate introduction of chemical or biological agents that \n        would be harmful or infectious to crops or livestock and could \n        disrupt the processing and distribution of food products.\n            (4) A successful terrorist attack against the United States \n        agricultural sector involving the release of a contagious agent \n        against crops or livestock could damage public confidence in \n        the safety of the United States food supply.\n            (5) The United States agricultural sector is particularly \n        susceptible to a foreign crop or livestock disease, against \n        which domestic animals and plants do not have a natural \n        resistance. With crops and animals concentrated in fewer \n        production facilities, and with the frequent transport among \n        these facilities, a single pathogen introduction could cause \n        widespread infection.\n            (6) Terrorism threats to the agricultural production and \n        food supply system need to receive the same level of priority \n        as other terrorism threats, and should be treated in a highly \n        coordinated and integrated manner.\n            (7) An awareness of the terrorism threat against the United \n        States agricultural sector has increased within the \n        intelligence and counterterrorism agencies of the Federal \n        Government, and efforts must be undertaken to position the \n        agricultural sector to anticipate and defend against such a \n        threat.\n            (8) The internal and external agency structures of the \n        Department of Agriculture must be strengthened to enable to the \n        United States agricultural sector to fully realize its \n        strengths and vulnerabilities in the face of international \n        terrorism.\n            (9) The Department of Agriculture is a critical component \n        of the collaborative infrastructure needed to deal with \n        terrorism threats to the United States agricultural production \n        and food supply system.\n    (b) Interagency Agricultural Terrorism Committee.--(1) The \nPresident shall establish an Interagency Agricultural Terrorism \nCommittee to coordinate the counterterrorism effort for the protection \nof the United States agricultural production and food supply system. \nGreater coordination between Federal and State government agencies is \nnecessary to effectively address potential terrorism threats against \nthe system. Primary agencies of concern include--\n            (A) The Department of Agriculture, in particular the Animal \n        and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of \n        Agriculture.\n            (B) The United States Customs Service.\n            (C) The Food and Drug Administration.\n            (D) State departments of agriculture.\n    (2) The responsibilities of the Interagency Agricultural Terrorism \nCommittee shall include--\n            (A) preparing a plan defining the role of each agency in \n        safeguarding agricultural production, processing and marketing \n        systems;\n            (B) improving domestic crisis planning and management \n        criteria;\n            (C) safeguarding critical infrastructures in agricultural \n        production and food supply system; and\n            (D) supporting research efforts to enhance counterterrorism \n        capabilities related to the agricultural production and food \n        supply system.\n    (c) Department of Agriculture Cooperation With Other Agencies.--The \nSecretary of Agriculture shall continue and strengthen cooperation with \nthe National Security Council, the Department of Justice, and other \ndepartments and agencies with responsibilities under Presidential \nDecision Directive 62 concerning the role of the Department of \nAgriculture in counterterrorism programs of the Federal Government. The \nSecretary of Agriculture shall engage in active partnership with the \nWeapons of Mass Destruction Preparedness Group of the National Security \nCouncil focusing on the role of the Department of Agriculture regarding \nfood and agricultural protection issues.\n    (d) Department of Agriculture Counterterrorism Policy Council.--The \nDepartment of Agriculture Counterterrorism Policy Council, established \nin 1999 and chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, shall \ncontinue to serve as the Department of Agriculture's senior policy \nforum for coordinating and leveraging departmental-wide support \nregarding terrorism issues. The Secretary of Agriculture shall appoint \nan agricultural liaison on terrorism to report to the Homeland Security \nOffice and serve as a liaison on all agricultural matters involving \nsecurity and agricultural terrorism threats.\n    (e) Agricultural Industry Involvement.--The Secretary of \nAgriculture shall establish an Industry Working Group on Agricultural \nTerrorism comprised of agricultural producer, processing, distribution, \nand retail organizations to serve in a consultative manner with the \nDepartment of Agriculture to develop measures to counteract terrorist \nthreats against the agricultural production and food supply system. The \nSecretary shall also establish training and information programs for \nagricultural producers to counter the threat of pests and disease at \nthe farm level and to convey counterterrorism information to \nagricultural producers.\n    (f) Increased Surveillance, Detection and Interdiction.--Greater \nfinancial and staff resources should be dedicated at the State and \nFederal Government levels for the detection and interdiction of \nagricultural terrorism threats. Critical among these priorities are \nincreasing the number of inspectors and detection devices at ports of \nentry for the interception of prohibited and damaging agricultural \nproducts or agriculturally related products.\n    (g) Diagnostic Facilities.--To improve the capability of Federal \ndiagnostic facilities to accurately and efficiently identify diseases \nand substances that are hazardous to plants and animals used in food \nproduction, the Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a Biosafety \nLevel 4 facility within the Department of Agriculture at the Plum \nIsland Diagnostic Laboratory, to create the diagnostic tests and \nvaccines needed to protect the United States swine industry from acts \nof biological terrorism and disease, such as the Nipah virus. The \nBiosafety Level 4 facility shall be designed to prevent contact between \nmicroorganisms and personnel as well as escape into the environment. A \ndatabase shall be established to link animal and human disease \ninformation systems."
