FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) The United States failure to manage its solid waste has \n        resulted in critical regional and national problems.\n            (2) Successful solid waste management requires creative use \n        of the entire hierarchy of solid waste management, including \n        waste reduction, recycling, waste-to-energy operations, and \n        landfilling.\n            (3) Recycling can play a significant role in reducing \n        municipal waste.\n            (4) Recycling can prevent depletion of valuable landfill \n        space, save energy and natural resources, and provide useful \n        products from discarded materials.\n            (5) The failure to recycle and reuse materials is a \n        significant and unnecessary waste of important national energy \n        and material resources.\n            (6) Comprehensive, multimaterial recycling programs \n        represent the most cost-effective and efficient method of \n        meeting recycling goals.\n            (7) Limited or selective approaches to recycling may work \n        to the detriment of a comprehensive national recycling effort \n        by imposing additional costs and creating inefficiencies in the \n        overall program.\n            (8) The responsibility to recycle should be shared by all \n        consumers of recyclable goods, including individual households, \n        municipalities, and commercial and institutional \n        establishments.\n            (9) All Americans should be provided with an opportunity to \n        recycle in their community, including at home and at their \n        place of employment.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To require each State to develop and implement a \n        comprehensive, multimaterial recycling plan to provide its \n        citizens with the opportunity to recycle.\n            (2) To require each State, under its plan, to eventually \n        recycle at least 25 percent of its municipal waste stream.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL POLICY.\n\n    The Congress hereby establishes as a national goal the recycling of \nmunicipal waste to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with \nmarket demand for recycled materials.\n\nSEC. 4. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.\n\n    For purposes of assisting States in carrying out this Act, the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall provide \ntechnical assistance and guidance to the States on recycling methods \nand opportunities, including the development of the elements for an \neffective comprehensive State recycling program. Such a program shall \ninclude, at a minimum, the following elements:\n            (1) Proven approaches to separation and collection of \n        municipal waste according to material, including metals, glass, \n        paper, plastics, yard waste, used oil, used tires, and used \n        batteries.\n            (2) Guidance on local or regional drop-off centers for \n        municipal waste separated at home or business.\n            (3) Planning and information exchange services on \n        successful strategies for municipal, commercial, and industrial \n        recycling programs.\n            (4) Planning and information exchange services on the \n        creation of State and regional information clearinghouses on \n        markets for secondary materials and recycled goods.\n\nSEC. 5. RECYCLING PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Requirement for State Programs.--\n            (1) Within 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, \n        each State shall develop and implement a comprehensive \n        multimaterial recycling program to provide its residents with \n        an opportunity to participate and engage in recycling.\n            (2) Each State program shall be designed to provide at \n        least 20 percent of the State's population with an opportunity \n        to participate in the program within 2 years after the date of \n        enactment of this Act. Every 2 years thereafter, such program \n        must be available to an additional 20 percent of the State's \n        population, until such time that 100 percent of the population \n        is provided an opportunity to participate in the recycling \n        program.\n    (b) Program Components.--Each State recycling program under this \nsection shall include, at a minimum, each of the following elements:\n            (1) Material separation and recycling.--Provisions, as \n        determined by the States, for the separation of recyclable \n        materials from other municipal waste generated at residential, \n        commercial, industrial, and institutional establishments. The \n        types of recyclable materials covered shall be designated by \n        the State and may include metal cans, glass bottles and jars, \n        paper, and containers made of plastic such as polyethylene \n        terephthalate (PET) and high density polyethylene (HDPE).\n            (2) Yard waste.--Persons at residential, commercial, and \n        institutional establishments shall separate yard waste from \n        other municipal waste generated at those establishments, unless \n        those persons have provided for the composting of their yard \n        waste.\n            (3) Notice.--Each State or its political subdivisions shall \n        establish a comprehensive and sustained public information and \n        education program concerning recycling program features and \n        requirements.\n            (4) Preference.--In implementing its recycling program, a \n        State or its political subdivisions shall accord consideration \n        for the collection, processing, and marketing of recyclable \n        materials to persons engaged in the business of recycling.\n    (c) Alternative Programs.--A State or its municipalities, or both, \nshall be deemed to comply with this section if it has in place an \nexisting program for the collection of separated materials which may \nprovide for curbside collection, drop-off centers, regional collection \ncenters or similar methods of collection which, in its discretion, best \nmeets the needs of the State and its political subdivisions and which \ncomply with the intent and requirements of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. PROGRAM APPROVAL.\n\n    Within 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, a State \nshall include its comprehensive recycling program in the State solid \nwaste management plan required by subtitle D of the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6941 et seq.). Upon approval of the recycling \nprogram component of the plan by the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the State shall be eligible to apply for Federal \ngrants under section 4011 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as added by \nsection 7, to implement the recycling program.\n\nSEC. 7. STATE GRANTS FOR RECYCLING.\n\n    (a) Grants.--Subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. \n6941 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 4011. RECYCLING GRANTS.\n\n    Upon application of a State and from funds appropriated pursuant to \nsections 4008 and 4009, the Administrator shall make grants, subject to \nsuch terms and conditions as the Administrator considers appropriate, \nunder this section to such State for the purpose of assisting the State \nin implementing the comprehensive recycling program developed by the \nState and approved by the Administrator under the Comprehensive \nRecycling Act of 1993, including activities to promote the use of \nrecycling techniques by businesses, local governments, and regional \nwaste management authorities. In reviewing grant applications, the \nAdministrator shall give specific consideration to the needs of rural \nareas regarding the collection, separation, and transportation of such \nmaterials and the availability and maturity of the region's recyclers \nand markets.''.\n    (b) Technical Amendment.--The table of contents for such Act \n(contained in section 1001) is amended by inserting after the item \nrelating to section 4010 the following new item:\n\n``4011.
