DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Mid-level ethanol blend.--The term ``mid-level ethanol \n        blend'' means an ethanol-gasoline blend containing greater than \n        10 and up to and including 20 percent ethanol by volume that is \n        intended to be used in any conventional gasoline-powered \n        onroad, nonroad, or marine engine, or onroad or nonroad \n        vehicle.\n\nSEC. 2. EVALUATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Administrator, acting through the Assistant \nAdministrator of the Office of Research and Development at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, shall--\n            (1) not later than 45 days after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, enter into an agreement with the National Academy of \n        Sciences to provide, within 18 months after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, a comprehensive assessment of the \n        scientific and technical research on the implications of the \n        use of mid-level ethanol blends, comparing mid-level ethanol \n        blends to gasoline blends containing 10 percent or zero percent \n        ethanol; and\n            (2) not later than 30 days after receiving the results of \n        the assessment under paragraph (1), submit a report to the \n        Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of \n        Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public \n        Works of the Senate on the findings of the assessment, together \n        with the agreement or disagreement of the Administrator with \n        each of its findings.\n    (b) Waivers.--Prior to the submission of the report under \nsubsection (a)(2), any waiver granted under section 211(f)(4) of the \nClean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(f)(4)) before the date of enactment of \nthis Act that allows the introduction into commerce of mid-level \nethanol blends for use in motor vehicles shall have no force or effect. \nThe Administrator shall grant no new waivers under such section \n211(f)(4) until after the submission of the report described under \nsubsection (a)(2).\n    (c) Contents.--The assessment performed under subsection (a)(1) \nshall include the following:\n            (1) An evaluation of the short-term and long-term \n        environmental, safety, durability, and performance effects of \n        the introduction of mid-level ethanol blends on onroad, \n        nonroad, and marine engines, onroad and nonroad vehicles, and \n        related equipment. Such evaluation shall consider the impacts \n        of qualifying mid-level ethanol blends or blends with higher \n        ethanol concentrations as a certification fuel, and shall \n        consider the effect mid-level ethanol blends have on carbon \n        emissions, taking into account carbon emissions from their \n        life-cycle production, as compared to gasoline blends \n        containing 10 percent or zero percent ethanol. Such evaluation \n        shall include a review of all available scientific evidence, \n        including all relevant government and industry data and \n        testing, including that relied upon by the Administrator and \n        published at 75 Fed. Reg. 68094 et seq. (November 4, 2010), 76 \n        Fed. Reg. 4662 et seq. (January 26, 2011), and 76 Fed. Reg. \n        44406 et seq. (July 25, 2011), and identify gaps in \n        understanding and research needs related to--\n                    (A) tailpipe emissions;\n                    (B) evaporative emissions;\n                    (C) engine and fuel system durability;\n                    (D) onboard diagnostics;\n                    (E) emissions inventory and other modeling effects;\n                    (F) materials compatibility;\n                    (G) operability and drivability;\n                    (H) fuel efficiency;\n                    (I) fuel economy;\n                    (J) consumer education and satisfaction;\n                    (K) cost-effectiveness for the consumer;\n                    (L) catalyst durability; and\n                    (M) durability of storage tanks, piping, and \n                dispensers for retail.\n            (2) An identification of areas of research, development, \n        and testing necessary to--\n                    (A) ensure that existing motor fuel infrastructure \n                is not adversely impacted by mid-level ethanol blends, \n                including an examination of potential impacts of mid-\n                level ethanol blends on metal, plastic, rubber, or any \n                other materials used in pipes or storage tanks; and\n                    (B) reduce the risk of misfueling by users at \n                various points in the distribution and supply chain, \n                including at bulk storage, retail storage, and \n                distribution configurations by--\n                            (i) assessing the best methods and \n                        practices to prevent misfueling;\n                            (ii) examining misfueling mitigation \n                        strategies for blender pumps, including \n                        volumetric purchase requirements and labeling \n                        requirements;\n                            (iii) assessing the adequacy of misfueling \n                        mitigation plans approved by the Environmental \n                        Protection Agency; and\n                            (iv) examining the technical standards and \n                        recommendations of the National Institute of \n                        Standards and Technology, the American National \n                        Standards Institute, and the International \n                        Organization for Standardization regarding fuel \n                        pump labeling.\n\nSEC. 3.
