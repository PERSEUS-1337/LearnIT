FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Recent data show that United States manufacturing \n        companies cannot fill as many as 600,000 skilled positions, \n        even as unemployment numbers hover at historically high levels.\n            (2) The unfilled positions are mainly in the skilled \n        production category, and in occupations such as machinist, \n        operator, craft worker, distributor, or technician.\n            (3) In less than 20 years, an overall loss of expertise and \n        management skill is expected to result from the gradual \n        departure from the workplace of 77,200,000 workers.\n            (4) Postsecondary success and workforce readiness can be \n        achieved through attainment of a recognized postsecondary \n        credential.\n            (5) The Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook \n        estimates that 746,500 new jobs in computer-related occupations \n        will be generated from 2010 to 2020. This would equate to a 23 \n        percent net growth in computer-related occupations.\n            (6) Computer-related occupations with the highest projected \n        growth rates include database administrators, software \n        developers, and network and computer systems administrators.\n            (7) As of June 2012, there were approximately 301,214 job \n        openings in the information technology sector.\n            (8) According to a recent report, 64 percent of managers \n        hiring for information technology jobs rate certifications as \n        having extremely high or high value in validating information \n        technology skills and expertise, and that value is rated \n        highest by senior managers, such as chief information officers, \n        and by medium-size firms.\n\nSEC. 3.
