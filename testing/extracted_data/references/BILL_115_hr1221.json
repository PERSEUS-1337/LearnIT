FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Peaceful co-existence in the Middle East between \n        Israelis and Palestinians, and between Muslims, Christians, \n        Jews, and those of all backgrounds is in the interests of the \n        United States, Israel, the Palestinian people, and the world.\n            (2) While the United States and its international allies \n        continue to support diplomatic and political negotiations \n        between the representatives of the parties to the conflict as \n        well as others, in the long run such efforts require broad \n        popular support among people in order to succeed. In order to \n        achieve lasting peace in the region, the people who live there \n        must, over time, sustain any potential high-level agreements.\n            (3) Through many independent individual and nongovernmental \n        activities, tens of thousands of people of different \n        backgrounds are already working together to build better \n        relations between people, through people-to-people coexistence \n        and trust-building measures, activities, and other cooperative \n        efforts.\n            (4) By working cooperatively on shared goals and addressing \n        mutual understanding, participants in such activities, \n        including youth, can come to reject violence and understand the \n        promise of peaceful coexistence.\n            (5) Through support for people-to-people exchanges in the \n        region and joint economic initiatives, millions of ordinary \n        citizens affected by this conflict can assist in building \n        support for lasting peace.\n            (6) Working together, the United States, countries around \n        the world, and the private sector can, and often seek to \n        support opportunities that, help sustain support for peace with \n        the establishment and funding of an independent International \n        Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace (referred to in this Act as \n        the ``International Fund''), to promote and support contact, \n        cooperation, dialogue, shared community building, peaceful \n        coexistence, joint economic development, and reconciliation \n        between Israelis and Palestinians.\n            (7) United States and international support for grassroots \n        people-to-people efforts can help serve as an antidote to false \n        propaganda by terrorist groups and the growing issue of \n        incitement.\n            (8) The International Fund shall serve as a coordinating \n        entity offering expertise and support, adhering to best \n        practices for governance, transparency, assessment and \n        accountability. The International Fund will be an ongoing \n        presence and catalyst for rejecting violence and building broad \n        public support for sustaining peace in the region. The \n        International Fund is not intended to be a political forum, but \n        a grant-making body to facilitate enduring people-to-people \n        relationships and sustained joint economic development.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To urge the President to make every effort, in \n        conjunction with the Government of Israel, the Palestinian \n        Authority, regional governments, and the international \n        community to establish a non-political, mutually acceptable \n        International Fund to promote and support contact, cooperation, \n        dialogue, shared community building, peaceful coexistence, \n        joint economic development, and reconciliation between Israelis \n        and Palestinians.\n            (2) To provide for United States contributions to consist \n        of amounts made available to carry out chapter 4 of part II of \n        the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq. \n        (relating to the Economic Support Fund)) for payment to the \n        International Fund to carry out the activities described in \n        paragraph (1), in addition to overhead costs of the \n        establishment of said fund and the function of its oversight \n        board.\n\nSEC. 3.
