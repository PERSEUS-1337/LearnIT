SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Caguana Indigenous \nCeremonial Park and Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center Study Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Caguana indigenous ceremonial park.--\n                    (A) The Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park is \n                comprised of approximately 13.5 acres located at the \n                center of Puerto Rico, in the Caguana Ward at the \n                Municipality of Utuado.\n                    (B) The park is visited by approximately 60,000 \n                students and tourists every year.\n                    (C) Efforts to protect the park began in 1915, when \n                archeologist John Alden Mason, together with Robert T. \n                Aitken, started research on this archeological site. A \n                final report was issued in 1941.\n                    (D) In 1949, the Puerto Rican anthropologist and \n                archeologist, Ricardo E. Alegria started a series of \n                excavations and, in 1964, as Director of the Institute \n                of Puerto Rican Culture, ordered the restoration of the \n                park.\n                    (E) During 1992, after years of studies and \n                investigations, the National Park Service included the \n                park in the National Register of Historic Places. In \n                1993, the park received the distinction of a National \n                Historic Landmark.\n                    (F) The park has one of the most surprising \n                archeological sites of the Antilles, including 22 \n                petroglyphs on calcareous slates, monoliths located in \n                its main square, and the Cemi Mountain as sentinel.\n                    (G) The park museum has a permanent exhibition of \n                more than 80 archeological pieces from the Taino \n                ancestors. Other pieces are exhibited at the University \n                of Puerto Rico Museum, the Puerto Rico Historical \n                Archives, the National Museum of American Indians in \n                New York City, and at Yale University, among other \n                private collections.\n                    (H) The Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park has \n                unique pieces belonging to precolonial culture, from \n                Puerto Rico and from the Caribbean, and the best way to \n                ensure their protection of these treasures may be the \n                inclusion of the park as a unit of the National Park \n                Service.\n            (2) Tibes indigenous ceremonial center.--\n                    (A) The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is \n                located between the wards of Tibes and Portugues in the \n                municipality of Ponce, and is considered one of the \n                most significant indigenous sites in the Caribbean. The \n                center is visited by approximately 80,000 students and \n                tourists every year.\n                    (B) In 1975, Don Luis Hernandez--a sugar cane \n                worker--discovered the remnants of indigenous cultures \n                after the massive flooding caused by Hurricane Eloisa.\n                    (C) Just after the discovery, the Guaynia Society \n                of Archeology and History from the Pontifical Catholic \n                University of Puerto Rico started the excavations and \n                restoration on the site. The group was assisted by the \n                renowned Antillean archeologist, Ricardo Alegria.\n                    (D) After months of excavations, the Society had \n                discovered the oldest Antillean indigenous ceremonial \n                site in Puerto Rico, including the largest indigenous \n                cemetery on the Island with more than 186 human remains \n                from the Igneri and Pre-Taino cultures.\n                    (E) Additionally, the Society discovered nine \n                plazas used by the indigenous to dance the areyto, play \n                ball and celebrate ceremonies of great importance. The \n                plazas varied in size from 42 feet long by 35.8 feet \n                wide to 115 feet long by 30.5 feet wide, and were named \n                as follows: Horseshoe Ball Court, Cemi Ball Court, \n                Santa Elena Ball Court, One Row Ball Court, Principal \n                Plaza, Oval or Elliptical Plaza, Bat Ball Court, and \n                Chief Ball Court. The ninth court remains unnamed.\n                    (F) The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is key \n                in the education of the current and next generations of \n                Puerto Ricans about our indigenous roots. Thus, the \n                best way to preserve our heritage may be the inclusion \n                of the center as a unit of the National Park Service.\n\nSEC. 2. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STUDY.\n\n    (a) Study.--The Secretary of the Interior shall--\n            (1) carry out a study regarding the suitability and \n        feasibility of designating Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park \n        and Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center as units of the National \n        Park System; and\n            (2) consider management alternatives for the Caguana \n        Indigenous Ceremonial Park and Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial \n        Center.\n    (b) Study Process and Completion.--Except as provided by subsection \n(c) of this section, section 100507(c) of title 54, United States Code, \nshall apply to the conduct and completion of the study required by this \nsection.\n    (c) Submission of Study Results.--Not later than 1 year after the \ndate that funds are made available for this section, the Secretary \nshall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \nthe Senate a report describing the results of the study."
