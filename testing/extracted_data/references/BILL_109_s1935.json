FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has been effectively engaged in the \n        Northern Ireland peace process by participating in negotiations \n        and contributing to the economic development of both Northern \n        Ireland and the border areas of the Republic of Ireland that \n        are affected by the conflict in Northern Ireland.\n            (2) The Government of Ireland, the Irish people, the \n        Government of the United Kingdom, and the British people are \n        longstanding friends of the United States Government and the \n        people of the United States.\n            (3) In 1986, the United States, in support of the Agreement \n        Between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the \n        United Kingdom dated November 15, 1985 (``Anglo-Irish \n        Agreement''), established the International Fund for Ireland \n        (``International Fund'') to help bolster economic development \n        and support programs that would foster peace and reconciliation \n        in Northern Ireland and the affected border areas of the \n        Republic of Ireland.\n            (4) The United States has been a generous and faithful \n        donor to the International Fund, contributing more than \n        $386,000,000 to help improve relations between Catholics and \n        Protestants in Northern Ireland through the creation of \n        thousands of jobs and the development of business opportunities \n        that allow Catholics and Protestants to work together.\n            (5) More than 80 percent of the International Fund's \n        investments have been in disadvantaged areas. Programs funded \n        by the investments offer work experience and important job \n        training programs to disadvantaged and unemployed youth through \n        the economic, social, and physical regeneration of such areas.\n            (6) The International Fund has also developed a series of \n        community-building programs promoting greater dialogue and \n        understanding between Catholics and Protestants and leadership \n        programs designed to develop a new generation of leaders in \n        Northern Ireland to bring about a more peaceful and prosperous \n        future in the region.\n            (7) Section 2(b) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act \n        of 1986 (Public Law 99-415; 100 Stat. 947), states that the \n        purpose of the contributions from the United States to the \n        International Fund is to support the promotion of \n        ``reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a \n        society in Northern Ireland in which all may live in peace, \n        free from discrimination, terrorism, and intolerance, and with \n        the opportunity for both communities to participate fully in \n        the structures and processes of government''.\n            (8) Assistance from the United States to the International \n        Fund has contributed greatly to the economic development of \n        Northern Ireland and to accomplishing the objectives of the \n        Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986, namely economic \n        development and reconciliation, which are critical to achieving \n        a just and lasting peace in the region, especially in the \n        economically depressed areas of Northern Ireland.\n            (9) The Agreement Reached in the Multi-Party Negotiations \n        in Belfast on April 10, 1998 (the ``Good Friday Agreement'') \n        created the Northern Ireland Executive Assembly and Executive \n        Committee and provided for a ``democratically elected Assembly \n        in Northern Ireland which is inclusive in its membership, \n        capable of exercising executive and legislative authority, and \n        subject to safeguards to protect the rights and interests of \n        all sides of the community''.\n            (10) The Good Friday Agreement also called for police \n        reform and establishment of a ``new beginning'' in policing in \n        Northern Ireland with an effective, accountable, and fair \n        police service, which is capable of attracting and sustaining \n        support from the community as a whole, capable of maintaining \n        law and order, and based on principles of protection of human \n        rights.\n            (11) In 1999, the Independent Commission on Policing in \n        Northern Ireland, a commission required by the Good Friday \n        Agreement, made 175 recommendations for policing reform in \n        Northern Ireland, some of which have been implemented.\n            (12) In 2002, the Department of State issued a report \n        required by section 701(d) of the Foreign Relations \n        Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228; 116 \n        Stat. 1419), called the ``Report on Policing Reform and Human \n        Rights in Northern Ireland''. The report concluded that a new \n        police training facility and an increase in funding for police \n        training programs were critically needed in Northern Ireland.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT SUPPORT ACT OF 1986.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) Assistance from the United States for the International \n        Fund for Ireland (``International Fund'') has contributed \n        greatly to the economic development of Northern Ireland and \n        that both objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act \n        of 1986 (Public Law 99-415; 100 Stat. 947), namely economic \n        development and reconciliation, remain critical to achieving a \n        just and lasting peace in the region, especially in the \n        economically-depressed areas; and\n            (2) since policing reform is a significant part of winning \n        public confidence in and acceptance of the new form of \n        government in Northern Ireland, the International Fund is \n        encouraged to support programs that enhance relations between \n        communities and enhance relations between the police and the \n        communities they serve, promote human rights training for \n        police, and enhance peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of \n        continued conflict.\n    (b) Amendments.--\n            (1) Findings and purposes.--Section 2(b) of the Anglo-Irish \n        Agreement Support Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-415; 100 Stat. \n        947) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n        sentence: ``Furthermore, the International Fund is encouraged \n        to support programs that enhance relations between communities \n        and enhance relations between the police and the communities \n        they serve, promote human rights training for police, enhance \n        peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of continued conflict, \n        promote training programs to enhance the new district \n        partnership police boards recommended by the Patten Commission, \n        and assist in the transition of former British military \n        installations and prisons into sites for peaceful, community-\n        supported activities, such as housing, retail, and commercial \n        development.''.\n            (2) United states contributions to the international \n        funds.--Section 3 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of \n        1986 (Public Law 99-415; 100 Stat. 947) is amended by adding at \n        the end, the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007.--Of the amounts made available \nfor fiscal years 2006 and 2007 to carry out chapter 4 of part II of the \nForeign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.; relating to the \neconomic support fund), there are authorized to be appropriated \n$20,000,000 for each such fiscal year for United States contributions \nto the International Fund. Amounts appropriated pursuant to the \nauthorization of appropriations under the preceding sentence are \nauthorized to remain available until expended. Of the amount authorized \nto be appropriated for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 under this \nsubsection, it is the sense of Congress that not less than 35 percent \nof such amount for each such fiscal year should be used to carry out \nthe last sentence of section 2(b).''.\n    (c) Annual Reports.--Section 6(1) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement \nSupport Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-415; 100 Stat. 947) is amended by \ninserting before the semicolon the following: ``, specifically through \nimproving local community relations and relations between the police \nand the people they serve''."
