FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The effectiveness of United States foreign assistance \n        can be greatly enhanced by fostering innovation, applying \n        science and technology, and leveraging the expertise and \n        resources of the private sector to find low-cost, common sense \n        solutions to today's most pressing development challenges.\n            (2) Breakthroughs that accelerate economic growth and \n        produce better health outcomes in developing countries can help \n        support the growth of healthier, more stable societies and \n        foster trade relationships that translate into jobs and \n        economic growth in the United States.\n            (3) In 2014, the Office of Science and Technology and the \n        Office of Innovation and Development Alliances at the United \n        States Agency for International Development (USAID) were \n        streamlined and merged into the United States Global \n        Development Lab.\n            (4) The Lab partners with entrepreneurs, experts, \n        nongovernmental organizations, universities, and science and \n        research institutions to find solutions to specific development \n        challenges in a faster, more cost-efficient, and more \n        sustainable way.\n            (5) The Lab utilizes competitive innovation incentive \n        awards, a ``pay-for-success'' model, whereby a development \n        challenge is identified, competitions are launched, ideas with \n        the greatest potential for success are selected and tested, and \n        awards are provided only after the objectives of a competition \n        have been substantially achieved.\n            (6) Enhancing the authorities that support this pay-for-\n        success model will better enable the Lab to diversify and \n        expand both the number and sources of ideas that may be \n        developed, tested, and brought to scale, thereby increasing \n        USAID's opportunity to apply high value, low-cost solutions to \n        specific development challenges.\n\nSEC. 3.
