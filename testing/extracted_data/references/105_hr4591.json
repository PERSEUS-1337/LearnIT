SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Home \nHealth Case Manager Act of 1998''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) A Medicare beneficiary experiencing a severe or chronic \n        illness faces a bewildering array of home health and post-acute \n        care hospital services at a time in life when the Medicare \n        beneficiary is least able to ``manage'' the choices, especially \n        for beneficiaries who do not have family members to help them \n        consider the choices.\n            (2) Such a Medicare beneficiary may be unaware of the \n        financial relationships between institutions and agencies which \n        may cause the patient to be referred for home health services \n        that are unnecessary or not furnished in the most appropriate \n        setting.\n            (3) Medicare fee-for-service does not currently have a \n        system in which a physician or other health care provider is \n        encouraged to guide the patient through this maze of services \n        and help ensure that choices are made that maximize benefits \n        while minimizing costs.\n            (4) Chronically ill medicare patients need an independent \n        ombudsman to help develop a plan of care and to periodically \n        adjust the plan for the sole benefit of the patient and the \n        patient's family.\n\nSEC. 2.
