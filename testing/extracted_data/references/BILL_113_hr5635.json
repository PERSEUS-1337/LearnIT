FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) At a time of constrained budgets, it is fiscally \n        prudent to understand the amount and the scope of the Federal \n        Government's involvement in providing disaster-related \n        assistance to communities in need.\n            (2) The Federal Government does not provide a single, \n        publicly available estimate of the amount it is spending on \n        disaster-related assistance.\n            (3) Because recovery is a long-term process, providing \n        disaster-related assistance requires significant Federal \n        resources to support a multi-agency, multi-year restoration of \n        infrastructure and commerce in affected communities.\n            (4) Understanding the expenditures of individual Federal \n        agencies for disaster-related assistance will help better \n        inform the congressional appropriations process, as well as \n        presidential budget requests.\n            (5) Knowledge about disaster-related expenses will \n        illustrate opportunities for reducing these expenses through \n        efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to future natural disasters.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to require the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget to annually submit to Congress a report on all \ndisaster-related assistance provided by the Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 4.
