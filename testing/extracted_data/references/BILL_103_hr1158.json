FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) although prescription drugs represent one of the most \n        frequently used medical care interventions in treating common \n        acute and chronic diseases, many Americans, especially elderly \n        and other vulnerable populations, are unable to afford their \n        medications because of excessive and persistent prescription \n        drug price inflation;\n            (2) between 1980 and 1990, prescription drug price \n        inflation was 3 times the rate of general inflation;\n            (3) between 1985 and 1991, the prices of the 20 top selling \n        prescription drugs, which account for almost a third of \n        prescription sales, rose 79 percent--nearly 4 times the general \n        rate of inflation;\n            (4) prescription drug manufacturers continue to make \n        enormous profits on the backs of the elderly, poor, and other \n        vulnerable populations that are unable to afford their \n        medications;\n            (5) because of the limited availability of private or \n        public prescription drug coverage for the elderly, prescription \n        drugs represent the highest out-of-pocket medical care cost for \n        3 of 4 elderly patients, surpassed only by costs of long-term \n        care services;\n            (6) individuals over 65 fill an average of 15 prescriptions \n        a year to treat chronic health conditions compared to 5 \n        prescriptions for those under 65;\n            (7) the Federal Government and American taxpayer provide \n        substantial subsidies to the pharmaceutical industry in the \n        form of tax incentives, tax write-offs, and grants for non-\n        research activities;\n            (8) for example, in 1987 alone, the pharmaceutical industry \n        received a section 936 tax credit of more than $1,400,000,000, \n        and such credit is estimated to have yielded over \n        $2,000,000,000 in tax breaks in 1990 to such industry;\n            (9) when Congress enacted section 936 in 1976, it sought to \n        help Puerto Rico obtain employment-producing investments, \n        however, in 1987 the pharmaceutical industry received over half \n        of the tax benefits provided by section 936 but employed less \n        than 20 percent of the workers;\n            (10) the Department of the Treasury will lose \n        $15,000,000,000 in tax revenues during the 1993 through 1997 \n        period due to section 936; and\n            (11) 17 of the 21 most prescribed drugs in the United \n        States in 1990 are authorized for Puerto Rican manufacture.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to insure that the \nelderly, the chronically ill, and all Americans have access to \nreasonably-priced pharmaceutical products.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION IN POSSESSIONS TAX CREDIT FOR EXCESSIVE \n              PHARMACEUTICAL INFLATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n(relating to Puerto Rico and possession tax credit) is amended by \nadding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(i) Reduction for Excessive Pharmaceutical Inflation.--\n            ``(1) In general.--In the case of any manufacturer of \n        single source drugs or innovator multiple source drugs, the \n        amount by which the credit under this section for the taxable \n        year (determined without regard to this subsection) exceeds the \n        manufacturer's wage base for such taxable year shall be reduced \n        by the product of--\n                    ``(A) the amount of such excess, multiplied by\n                    ``(B) the sum of the reduction percentages for each \n                single source drug or innovator multiple source drug of \n                the manufacturer for such

such term by section 3121(a).\n            ``(3) Reduction percentage.--For purposes of this \n        subsection--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The reduction percentage for any \n
