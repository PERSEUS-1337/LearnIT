    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Routine HIV \nScreening Coverage Act of 2012''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) HIV/AIDS continues to infect and kill thousands of \n        Americans, more than 30 years after the first cases were \n        reported.\n            (2) It has been estimated that approximately 1.7 million \n        Americans have been infected with HIV since the beginning of \n        the epidemic and over 600,000 of them have died.\n            (3) The HIV/AIDS epidemic has disproportionately impacted \n        African-Americans, Latino-Americans, and other racial and \n        ethnic minorities.\n            (4) It has been estimated that 20 percent of those infected \n        with HIV in the United States do not know they are infected.\n            (5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        determined that increasing the proportion of people who know \n        their HIV status is an essential component of comprehensive \n        HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention efforts and that early \n        diagnosis is critical in order for people with HIV/AIDS to \n        receive life-extending therapy.\n            (6) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        recommends routine HIV screening in health care settings for \n        all patients aged 13-64, regardless of risk.\n            (7) Some health plans do not cover routine HIV screening, \n        but only cover HIV tests for patients with known or perceived \n        risk factors for HIV/AIDS and patients who demonstrate symptoms \n        of AIDS.\n            (8) Not all individuals who have been infected with HIV \n        fall into high-risk categories or demonstrate symptoms of AIDS.\n            (9) If health plans covered routine HIV screenings, health \n        providers would be more likely to recommend routine HIV \n        screening for their patients.\n            (10) Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 300gg-13), as amended by section 1001 of the Patient \n        Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), \n        requires that health plans cover preventive health services \n        without imposing cost sharing requirements.\n            (11) Routine HIV screening is a preventive health service.\n            (12) Requiring health plans to cover routine HIV screening \n        as a preventive health service without imposing cost sharing \n        requirements could play a critical role in preventing the \n        spread of HIV and allowing infected individuals to receive \n        effective treatment.\n\nSEC. 2. COVERAGE FOR ROUTINE HIV SCREENING UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS, \n              HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND FEHBP.\n\n    (a) Group Health Plans.--\n            (1) Public health service act amendments.--Subpart II of \n        part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act is \n        amended by inserting the following new section after section \n        2719A:\n\n``SEC. 2719B.
