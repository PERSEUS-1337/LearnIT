FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Unsustainable debt in the world's poorest countries \n        constitutes a serious impediment to the development of stable \n        democratic political structures, broad-based economic growth, \n        poverty eradication, and food security.\n            (2) Financing should be appropriate for the purposes for \n        which it is used and should, to the maximum extent possible, \n        generate a return sufficient to pay the principal and interest \n        due. As such, long-term lending for perishable goods, such as \n        food commodities, may be construed as inappropriate to the \n        extent that it places a long-term debt burden on the recipient \n        country without generating sufficient revenues with which to \n        service the debt.\n            (3) Since 1955, the United States has extended more than \n        $27,800,000,000 in loans for food under title I of the \n        Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 \n        (commonly referred to as ``PL 480''), $10,632,858,000 of which \n        remained outstanding at the end of 2002.\n            (4) As of December 31, 2002, arrears on principal and \n        interest payments under title I of PL 480 totaled \n        $1,241,472,000.\n            (5) Since 1992 the United States provided the independent \n        states of the former Soviet Union with $1,601,500,000 in loans \n        for food under title I of PL 480, for which these countries are \n        estimated to have paid $112,748,000 in principal and interest \n        in 2003. Russia alone has received $1,035,000,000 in credits, \n        paying an estimated $79,695,000 in principal and interest in \n        2003.\n            (6) Rising debt stocks and debt-to-export ratios may \n        undermine a country's credit worthiness and jeopardize its \n        ability to borrow from commercial lenders.\n            (7) Debt reduction contributes marginally to a country's \n        development prospects if new debt is allowed to create the next \n        generation of heavy indebtedness. Therefore, President Bush's \n        initiative, adopted by Group of Seven (G-7) leaders at the June \n        2002 summit, to increase World Bank grant assistance to the \n        most heavily indebted poor countries is a crucial step toward \n        alleviating poverty, curbing future unsustainable debt, and \n        providing for urgent human needs in countries in which people \n        live on less than one dollar a day. Replacing loans with \n        targeted grants will eliminate the need for governments to \n        repay long-term investments in people, especially for \n        education, health, nutrition, water supply, and sanitation \n        purposes.\n            (8) The G-7 agreement at the June 2002 summit to fully fund \n        the remaining costs of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor \n        Country (HIPC) initiative is essential to ensuring that \n        eligible debt-distressed nations receive full benefits under \n        the HIPC debt relief measure.\n            (9) The United States has been a leading voice for more \n        than a decade in international debt reduction initiatives for \n        poor countries, including a 1991 initiative to cancel \n        $689,000,000 in food loans under title I of PL 480 owed by 15 \n        sub-Saharan African countries.\n            (10) The United States must continue its leadership role to \n        encourage full participation by all Paris Club creditors in \n        multilateral debt negotiations.\n            (11) Several poor countries that are not eligible for \n        enhanced HIPC debt reduction terms face a severe debt overhang \n        that undermines increased resource allocation for development \n        and discourages productive investment.\n            (12) The World Bank, which has provided over $1,700,000,000 \n        since 1986 to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS, should continue to \n        place the highest priority on programs to combat infectious \n        diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n            (13) Debt reduction is an important, but only partial \n        solution to long-term development. Promoting an environment \n        that will stimulate internal economic growth, promote trade and \n        external investment, and encourage responsible governance are \n        the most important ingredients for sustainable growth.\n\n                   TITLE I--MULTILATERAL DEBT RELIEF\n\nSEC. 101. SUPPORT FOR THE HIPC TRUST FUND.\n\n    Section 801(b)(1) of H.R. 5526 of the 106th Congress, as introduced \non October 24, 2000, and enacted into law by section 101(a) of Public \nLaw 106-429 (and contained in the appendix thereto) is amended by \nstriking ``2003, $435,000,000'' and inserting ``2006, such sums as may \nbe necessary''.\n\nSEC. 102.
