FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Huntington's Disease is a progressive degenerative \n        neurological disease that causes total physical and mental \n        deterioration over a 12 to 15 year period. It affects 30,000 \n        patients and 200,000 individuals are genetically ``at risk'' in \n        the United States.\n            (2) Huntington's Disease has a triad of clinical features, \n        including motor abnormalities, dementia, and disorders of mood \n        and perception. While movement disorders are most commonly \n        associated with Huntington's Disease, early symptoms are often \n        emotional and psychiatric. This may include personality \n        changes, irritability, mood swings, depression, obsessive-\n        compulsive behavior, inability to concentrate, and decreased \n        motivation.\n            (3) Because of its incapacitating nature, people with \n        Huntington's disease, including those in the early stages of \n        the disease, are unable to retain employment. As a result, many \n        people with Huntington's Disease rely solely on Social Security \n        Disability Income.\n            (4) Despite significant advances in medicine and greater \n        understanding of disability, the Social Security Administration \n        has not comprehensively revised its rules for the medical \n        evaluation of neurological disabilities since 1985.\n            (5) Because people with Huntington's Disease are frequently \n        not employed, many families have lost their employer-provided \n        health insurance benefits. As a result, many people with \n        Huntington's Disease do not receive necessary treatment during \n        the early stages of the disease.\n            (6) In 2000, the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services \n        waived the 24-month waiting period requirement for people \n        disabled by ALS (amyotropic lateral sclerosis), a degenerative \n        neurological condition similar to Huntington's Disease.\n\nSEC. 3. REVISION OF THE MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING DISABILITY \n              CAUSED BY ADULT-ONSET HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE.\n\n    The Commissioner of Social Security shall revise the regulations \nprescribed by the Commissioner set forth as Appendix 1 to subpart P of \npart 404 of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations (relating to \nthe listing of impairments, published by the Social Security \nAdministration as ``Disability Evaluation Under Social Security'', and \ncommonly referred to as the ``Blue Book''), as follows:\n            (1) The Commissioner shall insert after 11.00G the \n        following:\n``H. Huntington's Disease.  Huntington's Disease is an inherited \nneuropsychiatric disorder that is progressive and terminates in death \nof the affected person. Recovery or remission never occurs. Treatment \nis ineffective in terms of halting or slowing the progression of the \ndisease. The usual age of adult onset is between the ages of 30 and 50, \nalthough the age of adult onset may be younger or older. Incapacitation \noccurs relatively early in the course of this debilitating illness with \nprogression to total disability and dependency for all activities of \ndaily living. There are three characteristic clinical features: (1) \nloss of ability to control bodily movements; (2) loss of ability to \nthink and act quickly, to learn new material and to remember, and (3) \napathy, personality changes, irritability, mood swings, depression, \nanxiety, inability to concentrate, decreased motivation, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, and severe depression. Individuals with \nHuntingon's Disease also exhibit poor social judgment and may be \nirritable and aggressive. Inability to work is due to a combination of \ncognitive disturbance, behavioral or mood changes, poor coordination of \nvoluntary movements, and the presence of involuntary movements. \nIndividuals with Huntingon's Disease, even in the relatively early \nstages, have particular difficulty with decision-making, multi-tasking, \nand performing under time pressure or with the stress of interpersonal \ninteractions. The course of the disease varies among individuals and \nfamilies. The cognitive and behavioral problems may become debilitating \nbefore disorganization of motor functions. For other individuals, the \nmotor dysfunction may appear first.''.\n            (2) The Commissioner shall insert after 11.14 the \n        following:\n``11.15 Huntington's Disease. With:\n            ``A. disorganization of motor function as described in \n        11.04B; or\n            ``B. chronic brain syndrome. Evaluate under 12.02, 12.04, \n        and 12.06.''.\n            (3) The Commissioner shall remove the reference in 11.17 to \n        ``Huntington's Chorea''.\n\nSEC. 4. REVISION OF THE MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING DISABILITY \n              CAUSED BY JUVENILE HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE.\n\n    The Commissioner of Social Security shall revise further the \nregulations described in section 3 as follows:\n            (1) The Commissioner shall insert after 111.00E the \n        following:\n``F. Juvenile Huntington's Disease. While there is no symptom or group \nof symptoms that are absolutely required for the diagnosis of juvenile \nHuntington's Disease, most affected children offer several of the \nfollowing features at the time that the diagnosis is made: motor \ndysfunction, characterized by rigidity and dystonia, seizures, \ndeclining cognitive function, behavioral or psychiatric problems such \nas depression, aggressiveness and impulsiveness, irritability, mood \nswings, and obsessions. Huntington's Disease is a hereditary disorder \nand individuals with very early onset of Huntington's Disease are far \nmore likely to have an affected father than an affected mother.''.\n            (2) The Commissioner shall insert after 111.09 the \n        following:\n``111.10. Junvenile Huntington's Disease. With:\n            ``A. Motor dysfunction. Evaluate under 111.06; or\n            ``B. Behavioral or psychiatric problems. Evaluate under \n        112.02, 112.06, and 112.08.''.\n\nSEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF 24-MONTH MEDICARE DISABILITY WAITING PERIOD IN \n              CASES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABLING HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 226(h) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 426(h)) is amended, in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by \ninserting ``or Huntington's Disease'' after ``amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis (ALS)''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act with \nrespect to items and services furnished in months beginning after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act."
