FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin together with the Erie \n        Canal connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and \n        includes the approximately 13,400 square mile area encompassing \n        the following five large sub-basins:\n                    (A) The Upper Hudson River sub-basin.\n                    (B) The Mohawk River sub-basin.\n                    (C) The Lower Hudson River sub-basin.\n                    (D) The Passaic River sub-basin.\n                    (E) The Raritan River sub-basin.\n            (2) The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin includes the New York-New \n        Jersey metropolitan area, which is the largest metropolitan \n        area of the country. This metropolitan area, together with the \n        many communities in the Upper Hudson, Mohawk, and Lower Hudson \n        sub-basins, makes the area one of the most densely and heavily \n        populated river basins in the country, with over 15,000,000 \n        people.\n            (3) The water resources of the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin \n        are functionally interrelated and their uses are \n        interdependent. A dedicated program is essential to provide \n        effective communication, coordination, and cooperation among \n        Federal, State, and local governments, nongovernmental \n        organizations, and the private sector.\n            (4) The New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary is a complex \n        natural harbor at the junction of three major water bodies, the \n        New York Bight, the Hudson River, and the Long Island Sound. In \n        addition, it receives freshwater inputs from the Raritan and \n        Passaic Rivers. The health and productivity of the New York \n        Bight are affected directly by the quality of the freshwater \n        inputs to the estuary from the Hudson, Passaic, and Raritan \n        Rivers.\n            (5) The Mohawk River and its watershed drain directly into \n        the Hudson River, providing the largest freshwater input to the \n        brackish water mix that characterizes the Hudson River Estuary \n        and supports a biologically rich and productive ecosystem.\n            (6) The Mohawk River is integrated with the Erie Canal \n        along much of its channel, tying the operation of the canal \n        system to the health of the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers.\n            (7) Individuals in many communities throughout the Hudson-\n        Mohawk River Basin have experienced devastating flooding that \n        has led to tremendous costs for homeowners, businesses, and \n        State and local governments. A holistic approach to river and \n        stream monitoring, updated floodplain maps, and development of \n        floodplain management strategies based upon improved \n        understanding of the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin's hydrology \n        would make communities safer and more resilient to flood \n        events.\n            (8) Climate change is occurring and, as a result, sea level \n        rise along the United States eastern coastline will increase \n        the vulnerability of coastal communities to storm surge and \n        flooding in the New York-New Jersey harbors and along the major \n        rivers in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin.\n            (9) Each of the subwatersheds of the Hudson-Mohawk River \n        Basin receives the support of programs administered by Federal, \n        State, regional, and local organizations.\n            (10) New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, and \n        Connecticut have a long history of achievements working \n        together on resource management issues through their \n        memberships in the Delaware River Basin Commission, the \n        Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Appalachian Regional \n        Commission, the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control \n        Commission, and the Lake Champlain Basin Program.\n            (11) The impacts experienced as a result of recent \n        hurricanes and storms illustrate the need for integrated, \n        basin-wide planning to address water management challenges and \n        vulnerability to flooding.\n            (12) Protecting wetlands, expanding use of green \n        infrastructure, strengthening dams and levees, and upgrading \n        wastewater and water treatment infrastructure will be necessary \n        to reduce the impacts of extreme weather events and maintain \n        water quality and public health.\n\nSEC. 3.
