FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Head Start Act requires that 50 percent or more of \n        teachers nationwide in center-based Head Start programs must \n        have at least an associate degree in early childhood education, \n        or a field related to early childhood education, by 2003.\n            (2) A goal of the Head Start Act is to ensure that all Head \n        Start programs nationwide will provide accredited continuing \n        education for Head Start staff that provides college or \n        university credit for such staff. However, Indian Head Start \n        programs are generally located in areas isolated from \n        mainstream colleges or universities where such credit can be \n        earned.\n            (3) The vast majority of the Nation's 34 Tribal Colleges \n        and Universities have early childhood education programs and, \n        of these, 32 are accredited, or designated candidates for \n        accreditation, by national accrediting associations.\n            (4) Tribal Colleges and Universities were created by \n        Indians for Indians primarily on rural and remote Indian \n        reservations, which were virtually excluded from the Nation's \n        system of higher education.\n            (5) Tribal Colleges and Universities are engaged community \n        institutions, offering higher education and continuing \n        education opportunities to individuals who otherwise might find \n        attaining such education impossible due to family \n        responsibilities, and financial and geographic barriers.\n            (6) Tribal Colleges and Universities have been more \n        successful than any other institutions of higher education in \n        educating Indians and helping to retain Indians in high-need \n        fields such as nursing and teaching. According to a 2000 \n        survey, over 80 percent of Tribal College and University \n        graduates go on to further higher education or become employed \n        in the local community.\n            (7) Through partnerships developed between Tribal Colleges \n        and Universities and Head Start programs nationwide--\n                    (A) Indian Head Start agency personnel can gain \n                greater access to accredited college and university \n                programs in their career field;\n                    (B) the knowledge, skills, and aptitude of those \n                working at Indian Head Start agencies will be \n                increased, thus enabling them to provide high quality \n                and comprehensive services to Indian children and their \n                families; and\n                    (C) the health, early childhood development, and \n                school readiness of Indian children will be improved as \n                a result of increased staff knowledge, skills, and \n                aptitude.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) promote social competencies and school readiness in \n        Indian children; and\n            (2) provide high quality, accredited educational \n        opportunities to Indian Head Start agency staff so that they \n        can better deliver services that enhance the social and \n        cognitive development of low-income children through the \n        provision of health, educational, nutritional, social, and \n        other services to low-income children and their families.\n\nSEC. 3. TRIBAL COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY-HEAD START PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM.\n\n    The Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.) is amended by inserting \nafter section 648A the following:\n\n``SEC. 648B.
