    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone Act of \n1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the likelihood that a proposed business site will \n        comply with many government regulations is inversely related to \n        the length of time over which a site has been utilized for \n        commercial or industrial purposes, thus rendering older sites \n        in urban areas most unlikely to be chosen for new development \n        and forcing new development away from the areas most in need of \n        economic growth and job creation; and\n            (2) broad Federal regulations often have unintended \n        consequences in urban areas where such regulations--\n                    (A) offend basic notions of common sense, \n                particularly when applied to individual sites;\n                    (B) adversely impact economic stability;\n                    (C) result in the unnecessary loss of existing \n                businesses;\n                    (D) undermine new economic development, especially \n                in previously used sites;\n                    (E) create undue economic hardships while failing \n                significantly to protect human health, particularly in \n                areas where economic development is urgently needed to \n                improve the health and welfare of residents over a long \n                period of time; and\n                    (F) contribute to social deterioration to such a \n                degree that high unemployment, crime, and other \n                economic and social problems create the greatest risk \n                to the health and well-being of urban residents.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) enable qualifying cities to provide for the general \n        well-being, health, safety and security for their residents \n        living in distressed areas by empowering such cities to obtain \n        selective relief from Federal regulations that undermine \n        economic stability and development in distressed areas within \n        the city; and\n            (2) authorize Federal agencies to waive the application of \n        specific Federal regulations in distressed urban areas \n        designated as urban regulatory relief zones by an economic \n        development commission--\n                    (A) upon application through the Office of \n                Management and Budget by an economic development \n                commission established by a qualifying city under \n                section 5; and\n                    (B) upon a determination by the appropriate Federal \n                agency that granting such a waiver will not \n                substantially endanger health or safety.\n\nSEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY FOR WAIVERS.\n\n    (a) Eligible Cities.--The mayor or chief executive officer of a \ncity may establish an economic development commission to carry out the \npurposes of section 5 if the city population is greater than 200,000 \naccording to--\n            (1) the United States Census Bureau's 1992 estimate for \n        city populations; or\n            (2) beginning 6 months after the date of the enactment of \n        this Act, the United States Census Bureau's latest estimate for \n        city populations.\n    (b) Distressed Area.--Any census tract within a city shall qualify \nas a distressed area if--\n            (1) 33 percent or more of the resident population in the \n        census tract is below the poverty line;\n            (2) 45 percent or more of out-of-school males aged 16 and \n        over in the census tract worked less than 26 weeks in the \n        preceding year;\n            (3) 36 percent or more families with children under age 18 \n        in the census tract have an unmarried parent as head of the \n        household; or\n            (4) 17 percent or more of the resident families in the \n        census tract received public assistance income in the preceding \n        year.\n\nSEC. 5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The mayor or chief executive officer of a qualifying \ncity under section 4 may appoint an economic development commission for \nthe purpose of--\n            (1) designating urban regulatory relief zones in a city \n        composed of--\n                    (A) a distressed area;\n                    (B) a combination of distressed areas; or\n                    (C) one or more distressed areas with adjacent \n                industrial or commercial areas; and\n            (2) making application through the Office of Management and \n        Budget to waive the application of specific Federal regulations \n        within such urban regulatory relief zones.\n    (b) Composition.--To the greatest extent practicable, an economic \ndevelopment commission shall include--\n            (1) residents representing a demographic cross section of \n        the city population; and\n            (2) members of the business community, private civic \n        organizations, employers, employees, elected officials, and \n        State and local regulatory authorities.\n    (c) Limitation.--No more than one economic development commission \nshall be established or designated within a qualifying city.\nSEC. 6.
