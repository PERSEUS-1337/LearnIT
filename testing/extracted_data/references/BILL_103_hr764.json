CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1992, the property and casualty insurance industry \n        suffered more losses caused by natural disasters than in any \n        other year;\n            (2) a substantial portion of the losses were caused by \n        windstorms, such as hurricanes and tornadoes; and\n            (3) because of the windstorms in 1992 and recent years, in \n        certain regions of the United States and the territories of the \n        United States, including the Virgin Islands, property and \n        casualty insurers are withdrawing underwriting capacity from \n        the market by refusing to issue new policies or renew existing \n        policies, or by increasing premiums to unaffordable levels.\n\nSEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE PLAN.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than the expiration of the 90-day period \nbeginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency (in this Act referred to as the \n``Director'') shall develop a detailed written plan under this Act for \nestablishing and carrying out a national windstorm insurance program.\n    (b) Contents.--The plan required under subsection (a) shall be \ndesigned--\n            (1) to supplement Federal disaster relief and emergency \n        assistance provided pursuant to the Robert T.
