    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Huntington's Disease Parity Act of \n2015''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Huntington's Disease is a progressive degenerative \n        neurological disease that causes total physical and mental \n        deterioration. In the United States, approximately 30,000 \n        individuals are affected by Huntington's Disease, along with \n        another 200,000 individuals who are genetically ``at risk''. \n        There is no effective treatment in terms of halting or slowing \n        the progression of the disease.\n            (2) Clinical indicators of Huntington's Disease include--\n                    (A) loss of ability to control bodily movements;\n                    (B) loss of ability to think or act quickly, \n                inability to learn new material, and loss of memory; \n                and\n                    (C) behavioral or psychological problems, including \n                personality changes, irritability, mood swings, \n                anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, inability to \n                concentrate, decreased motivation, and severe \n                depression.\n            (3) Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically results in \n        the development of symptoms in individuals between 30 and 50 \n        years of age. Late-onset Huntington's Disease is characterized \n        by development of symptoms after 50 years of age and is usually \n        associated with a milder course of the disease. Juvenile \n        Huntington's Disease affects individuals who have yet to attain \n        19 years of age and progresses at a more rapid rate.\n            (4) Because of the incapacitating nature of Huntington's \n        Disease, individuals living with this illness, including those \n        in the early stages of the disease, are unable to retain \n        employment. As a result, many such individuals rely solely on \n        Social Security Disability Insurance.\n            (5) Despite significant advances in medicine and a greater \n        understanding of Huntington's Disease, the Social Security \n        Administration has not comprehensively revised its rules for \n        the medical evaluation of neurological disabilities since 1985. \n        The designation of this disease by the Social Security \n        Administration as ``Huntington's Chorea'' is both outdated and \n        medically inaccurate, as this term fails to recognize the \n        behavioral and cognitive impact of Huntington's Disease, while \n        also providing an incomplete characterization of the full \n        spectrum of Huntington's Disease for purposes of Social \n        Security Disability Insurance and the Medicare program.\n            (6) After qualifying for Social Security Disability \n        Insurance, individuals with Huntington's Disease must wait \n        another 24 months before receiving benefits under the Medicare \n        program, despite the fact that such individuals often become \n        incapacitated before reaching the age-eligibility requirement \n        under the Medicare program of 65 years of age.\n            (7) In 2000, the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services \n        waived the 24-month waiting period requirement for people \n        disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (``ALS''), a \n        degenerative neurological condition that is similar to \n        Huntington's Disease.\n            (8) In light of the outdated Social Security Disability \n        Insurance guidelines for Huntington's Disease and the \n        significant cognitive, behavioral, and physical incapacitation \n        faced by individuals with this disease, there is an urgent need \n        for a revision of the medical and evaluation criteria used by \n        the Social Security Administration in determining whether such \n        individuals are disabled, as well as removal of the 24-month \n        waiting period for coverage under the Medicare program for such \n        individuals, similar to the existing exemption for individuals \n        who have been diagnosed with ALS.\n\nSEC. 3. REVISION OF MEDICAL AND EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING \n              DISABILITY CAUSED BY ADULT-ONSET AND JUVENILE \n              HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE.\n\n    (a) In General.--For purposes of determinations of cognitive, \nbehavioral, and physical disability under titles II and XVI of the \nSocial Security Act, the Commissioner of Social Security, in \nconsultation with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and \nStroke, the National Institutes of Health, and other relevant \norganizations with medical expertise relating to Adult-Onset and \nJuvenile Huntington's Disease, shall, not later than 180 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act--\n            (1) amend section 11.00 of part A of the Listing of \n        Impairments (relating to neurological impairments of adults) \n        by--\n                    (A) providing medical and evaluation criteria for \n                Huntington's Disease; and\n                    (B) striking ``Huntington's Chorea'' each place it \n                appears;\n            (2) amend section 12.00 of part A of the Listing of \n        Impairments (relating to mental disorders of adults) by \n        providing medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's \n        Disease;\n            (3) amend section 111.00 of part B of the Listing of \n        Impairments (relating to neurological impairments of children) \n        by providing medical and evaluation criteria for Juvenile \n        Huntington's Disease; and\n            (4) amend section 112.00 of part B of the Listing of \n        Impairments (relating to mental disorders of children) by \n        providing medical and evaluation criteria for Juvenile \n        Huntington's Disease.\n    (b) Listing of Impairments.--For purposes of this section, the term \n``Listing of Impairments'' means appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 of \ntitle 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nSEC. 4. WAIVER OF 24-MONTH WAITING PERIOD FOR COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE \n              PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH HUNTINGTON'S \n              DISEASE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 226(h) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 426(h)) is amended, in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by \ninserting ``or Huntington's Disease (HD)'' after ``amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis (ALS)''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act with \nrespect to items and services furnished in months beginning after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act."
