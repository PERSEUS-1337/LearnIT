    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Self-Governance Act of \n1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the tribal right of self-governance flows from the \n        inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes and nations;\n            (2) the United States recognizes a special government-to-\n        government relationship with Indian tribes, including the right \n        of the tribes to self-governance, as reflected in the \n        Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the course of \n        dealings of the United States Government with Indian tribes;\n            (3) although progress has been made, the Federal \n        bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, has \n        eroded tribal self-governance and dominates tribal affairs;\n            (4) the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project was \n        designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government \n        relationship between Indian tribes and the United States, and \n        to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding and program \n        management; and\n            (5) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-\n        Governance Demonstration Project and finds that--\n                    (A) transferring control to tribal governments, \n                upon tribal request, over funding and decisionmaking \n                for Federal programs, services, functions, and \n                activities intended to benefit Indians, is an effective \n                way to implement the Federal policy of government-to-\n                government relations with Indian tribes; and\n                    (B) transferring control to tribal governments, \n                upon tribal request, over funding and decisionmaking \n                for Federal programs, services, functions, and \n                activities strengthens the Federal policy of Indian \n                self-determination.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of this Act to permanently establish and implement \nSelf-Governance--\n            (1) to enable the United States to maintain and improve its \n        unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, \n        Indian tribes;\n            (2) to permit each Indian tribe to choose the extent of the \n        participation of such tribe in Self-Governance;\n            (3) to co-exist with the provisions of the Indian Self-\n        Determination Act relating to provision of Indian services by \n        designated Federal agencies;\n            (4) to ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility \n        of the United States to Indian tribes and Indian individuals;\n            (5) to permit an orderly transition from Federal domination \n        of programs and services to provide Indian tribes with \n        meaningful authority to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer \n        programs, services, functions, and activities that meet the \n        needs of the individual tribal communities; and\n            (6) to provide for an orderly transition through a planned \n        and measurable parallel reduction in the Federal bureaucracy.\n\nSEC. 4. TRIBAL SELF-GOVERNANCE.\n\n    The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 \nU.S.C. 450 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new \ntitle:\n\n                   ``TITLE IV--TRIBAL SELF-GOVERNANCE\n\n``SEC. 401.
