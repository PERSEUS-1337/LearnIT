FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that a program to dispose of United States \ndonated nonlethal personal property to foreign countries--\n            (1) would benefit the conduct of foreign policy when \n        carried out in a manner consistent with the objectives of \n        United States policy, including the objectives set forth in \n        sections 101 and 102 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961;\n            (2) would fill some of the gap created by reduced official \n        United States foreign assistance, thereby serving United States \n        foreign policy objectives and benefiting recipient countries;\n            (3) would provide United States assistance to foreign \n        countries at much lower cost, thereby saving taxpayer money;\n            (4) would involve more people-to-people activity with less \n        bureaucracy and epitomize the virtue of volunteerism; and\n            (5) would benefit the United States private sector engaged \n        in foreign trade through--\n                    (A) public relations;\n                    (B) reduced costs for storage of disposable \n                equipment;\n                    (C) potential reductions in tax liability relating \n                to disposable equipment; and\n                    (D) penetration of new markets.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to supplement conventional official \nUnited States foreign assistance activities through a program for the \ntransfer of private sector and United States Government donated \nnonlethal personal property to eligible countries for humanitarian or \ntechnical assistance purposes consistent with the foreign policy \nobjectives of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
