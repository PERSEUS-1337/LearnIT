    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare and Medicaid Third Party \nLiability Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) illnesses and diseases that result from the use of \n        tobacco products cost Federal Government health care programs \n        billions of dollars, including at least $16,000,000,000 in the \n        medicare program and $3,000,000,000 in the medicaid program for \n        inpatient hospital services in fiscal year 1994;\n            (2) over the next 20 years, such illnesses and diseases \n        will cost the medicare trust funds at least $800,000,000,000;\n            (3) in April 1994, the trustees of the medicare trust funds \n        concluded that such funds may be insolvent in 7 years, with \n        $128,000,000,000 of expenditures due to such illnesses and \n        diseases;\n            (4) recent discoveries, including documents, patents and \n        patent applications, and testimony, have shown that--\n                    (A) the tobacco industry has known for years that \n                the nicotine in cigarettes is addictive,\n                    (B) the industry has attempted both to conceal this \n                information from the public and the Government and to \n                manipulate the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, and\n                    (C) it is possible to manufacture cigarettes which \n                are far less dangerous to consumers;\n            (5) more than 36 percent of medicare recipients are former \n        smokers and 20 percent are current smokers;\n            (6) approximately 43 percent of medicaid recipients smoke, \n        compared to 26 percent of the general public;\n            (7) the medicare population is much more at risk of \n        contacting illnesses and diseases that result from the use of \n        tobacco products than younger smokers, because such population \n        has smoked longer;\n            (8) legal scholars and courts are increasingly agreeing \n        that it is appropriate to use statistical evidence to prove \n        causation; and\n            (9) in view of the large number of Americans killed, \n        disabled, or otherwise injured each year as a result of smoking \n        cigarettes, the addictiveness of the nicotine in cigarettes, \n        and the absence of any significant benefits to society from \n        smoking, cigarettes are an unreasonably dangerous product and \n        cigarette manufacturers are engaged in abnormally dangerous \n        activities.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to allow the American \ntaxpayers to recoup billions of dollars in Federal Government health \ncare funds spent on tobacco related illnesses and diseases.\n\nSEC. 3. CLASS ACTION TO RECOVER COSTS TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE \n              PROGRAMS OF TOBACCO RELATED ILLNESSES AND DISEASES.\n\n    (a) In General.--(1) With respect to payments made under any \napplicable Federal Government health care program to or on behalf of \nmore than one recipient with a disease, illness, condition, or \ncomplication caused, in whole or in part, by the use of tobacco \nproducts, the Attorney General of the United States may seek recovery \nfor such payments from third parties (or any successors to such third \nparties) that manufacture tobacco products. The Attorney General (after \nconsultation with the appropriate Secretaries who administer such \nprograms) may bring an action in the name of the United States in \nUnited States district court to recover such payments made to or on \nbehalf of all such recipients in one proceeding.\n    (2) Any action to enforce the rights of the Attorney General under \nthis section with respect to any payment described in paragraph (1) \nshall be commenced within 5 years of such payment.\n    (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ``applicable Federal \nGovernment health care program'' includes--\n            (A) the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \n        Security Act;\n            (B) the medicaid program under title XIX of such Act;\n            (C) the veterans health care program under title 38, United \n        States Code; and\n            (D) any other similar Federal health care program.\n    (b) Notice Under the Class Action.--(1) In any action brought under \nthis section, no notice to recipients described in subsection (a)(1) is \nrequired, and such recipients shall have no right to become a party to \nsuch action. Such action is independent of any rights or causes of \naction of such recipients.\n    (2) In any such action in which the number of recipients described \nin subsection (a)(1) is so large as to cause it to be impracticable to \njoin or identify each claim, the Attorney General shall not be required \nto so identify the individual recipients for which payment has been \nmade, but rather can proceed to seek recovery based upon payments made \nto or on behalf of an entire class of recipients.\n    (c) Rules of Evidence.--In any action brought under this section, \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence shall be construed, regarding the \nintroduction and probative value of evidence on the issues of causation \nand damages, in order to effectuate the purposes of this Act to the \ngreatest extent possible. The issues of causation and damages in any \nsuch action may be proven by use of statistical analysis or \nepidemiological evidence, or both.\n    (d) Share of Liability.--In any action brought under this section \nin which a third party is liable due to its manufacture, sale, or \ndistribution of a tobacco product, the Attorney General shall be \nallowed to proceed under a market share theory, if the products \ninvolved are substantially interchangeable and substantially similar \nfactual or legal issues would be involved in seeking recovery against \neach liable third party individually. In the alternative, the Attorney \nGeneral shall be allowed to proceed under a theory of concerted action \nor enterprise liability, or both, if warranted by the facts presented \nto the court.\n    (e) Distribution of Recovery.--Amounts recovered under any action \nbrought under this section shall be paid to the United States and \ndisposed of as follows:\n            (1) In the case of amounts recovered arising out of a claim \n        under title XIX of the Social Security Act, there shall be paid \n        to each State agency an amount bearing the same proportion to \n        the total amount recovered as the State's share of the amount \n        paid by the State agency for such claim bears to the total \n        amount paid for such claim.\n            (2) Such portion of the amounts recovered as is determined \n        to have been paid out of the trust funds under sections 1817 \n        and 1841 of the Social Security Act shall be repaid to such \n        trust funds.\n            (3) The remainder of the amounts recovered shall be \n        deposited as miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury of the \n        United States."
