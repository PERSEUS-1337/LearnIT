GOLF COURSE PRESERVATION AND MODERNIZATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Langston Golf Course, Rock Creek Golf Course, and East \n        Potomac Golf Course are owned by the United States and are \n        under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park \n        Service, and each golf course has a long history of service to \n        the general public as an integral part of the Nation's capital, \n        including services to local and regional residents, visitors, \n        and tourists.\n            (2) Golf courses differ considerably from other lands \n        administered by the National Park Service because they require \n        a significant and continuing investment that cannot be required \n        of a concessionaire.\n            (3) East Potomac Golf Course opened in 1920 with three \n        courses to accommodate all levels of play, including an 18-hole \n        tournament-level course and two 9-hole practice courses, and \n        was initially segregated, with African-Americans allowed to \n        play on Mondays.\n            (4) Rock Creek Golf Course opened in 1923 as a 9-hole \n        course, and in 1925 the course was completed as an 18-hole \n        tournament-level course. This course was located in Rock Creek \n        Park, a major recreation and picnic facility for residents.\n            (5) Langston Golf Course opened in 1939 as a golf facility \n        for African-Americans and has been the home course of both the \n        Royal Golf Club and the Wake Robin Golf Club, the Nation's \n        first golf clubs for African-American men and women, \n        respectively. The golf course was named for John Mercer \n        Langston, the first African-American Congressman from Virginia, \n        elected in 1888.\n            (6) Each of the three courses contains valuable historic \n        components that must be maintained.\n            (7) Langston Golf Course is listed on the National Register \n        of Historic Places.\n            (8) Langston Golf Course is believed to be the first \n        regulation course built in the United States almost entirely on \n        a refuse landfill.\n            (9) The first American-born golf professional of African-\n        American ancestry was John Shippen, who was born in 1879 in the \n        Anacostia area of Washington, DC, placed fifth in the second \n        United States Open golf tournament in 1896 at 16 years of age, \n        and helped found the Capitol City Golf Club in 1925.\n            (10) The Capitol City Open golf tournament has made \n        Langston Golf Course its home for the past 40 years.\n            (11) The Capitol City Golf Club, renamed the Royal Golf \n        Club and Wake Robin Women's Club, has historically promoted a \n        safe golf facility for African-Americans in Washington, DC, \n        during an era of few available facilities, and these two clubs \n        remain the oldest African-American golf clubs in the United \n        States.\n            (12) The Langston facility provides important recreational \n        outlets, instructional forums, and a ``safe haven center'' for \n        the enhancement of the lives of inner city youth and other \n        residents in Washington, DC.\n            (13) The Langston, Rock Creek, and East Potomac golf \n        courses provide a home for the Nation's important minority \n        youth ``First Tee'' golf instruction and recreational program \n        in Washington, DC.\n            (14) The Langston, Rock Creek, and East Potomac golf \n        courses have traditionally provided additional quality of life \n        value to Washington, DC, and regional residents and visitors \n        and the golf courses will reach their considerable potential \n        once upgraded to meet their athletic and historical promise.\n    (b) Management of Golf Courses.--\n            (1) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the \n        following apply:\n                    (A) Rock creek.--The term ``Rock Creek'' means the \n                federally owned golf course and related facilities \n                located at 16th and Rittenhouse NW, Washington, DC \n                20011, within the boundaries of 16th Street NW to the \n                East; Military Road NW to the South; Beach Drive NW to \n                the West; and Sherrill Drive NW to the North.\n                    (B) Langston.--The term ``Langston'' means the \n                federally owned golf course and related facilities \n                located at 26th and Benning Road NE, Washington, DC \n                20002, within the boundaries of Anacostia River to the \n                East; Hickory Hill Road to the Northeast; Valley Road \n                NE to the Northeast; Azalea Road NE to the North; \n                Ellipse Road NE to the West; M Street NE to the North; \n                Maryland Avenue NE to the Northwest; 22nd Street NE to \n                the West; 26th Street to the West; and Benning Road NE \n                to the South.\n                    (C) East potomac.--The term ``East Potomac'' means \n                the federally owned golf course and related facilities \n                located at 972 Ohio Drive SW, Washington DC 20024, \n                within the boundaries of Ohio Drive to the East, South, \n                and West; and Buckeye Drive SW to the North.\n                    (D) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the \n                Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director \n                of the National Park Service.\n    (c) Lease Expiration Dates.--The Secretary shall ensure, that upon \nthe expiration of the lease currently in force for East Potomac, that \nany new lease for East Potomac shall be set to expire on the same date \nas the lease currently in force for Langston and Rock Creek and upon \nthe expiration of Langston, Rock Creek, and the new lease for East \nPotomac, the lease referred to in subsection (d) shall commence.\n    (d) Lease.--The lease referred to in subsection (e) is a lease for \nthe continued operation and maintenance of Rock Creek, Langston, and \nEast Potomac as golf courses.
