FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Numerous authoritative studies document that the \n        proficiency of students in the United States in science, \n        technology, engineering, and mathematics (``STEM'') will have a \n        major impact on the Nation's future economic competitiveness \n        and on the preeminence of the United States in scientific \n        inquiry and technological innovation.\n            (2) Results from the National Assessment of Educational \n        Progress, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science \n        Study, the Programme for International Science Assessment, and \n        other sources show that students in the United States are not \n        demonstrating sufficient achievement in the STEM subjects and \n        are not keeping pace with students in other countries.\n            (3) Research demonstrates the importance of afterschool \n        programs in engaging students in STEM fields and building STEM-\n        relevant skills and proficiencies, especially for girls, \n        students from populations traditionally underrepresented in \n        STEM fields, and students from low socioeconomic circumstances.\n            (4) A National Research Council consensus study confirmed \n        the importance of learning that occurs in out-of-school-time \n        settings such as afterschool programs and science centers, and \n        proposed a set of ``strands of science learning'' framework \n        that articulated capabilities fostered by informal learning \n        environments.\n            (5) According to a 2013 study entitled ``Defining Youth \n        Outcomes for STEM Learning in Afterschool'', the afterschool \n        field is confident in its ability to help young people develop \n        interest in STEM and STEM learning activities, develop \n        capacities to productively engage in such activities, and come \n        to value them. The afterschool field is also confident that it \n        can impact skills such as problem-solving abilities, \n        demonstrating STEM skills, career awareness, and 21st century \n        skills, such as teamwork, that are important to the workforce \n        and national economic goals.\n            (6) The Federal Government should use its resources as \n        effectively as possible to increase opportunities for students \n        to be exposed to STEM subjects outside of the school day and to \n        build a balanced kindergarten through grade 12 STEM education \n        portfolio that fosters learning in school as well as in out-of-\n        school-time programs.\n            (7) Afterschool programs have long partnered with other \n        youth-serving and community organizations to meet the needs of \n        students. Cross-sector collaborations between afterschool \n        programs, schools, science centers, institutions of higher \n        education, businesses, and other entities are yielding great \n        benefits for engaging young people in STEM fields.\n            (8) As interest and momentum grows around STEM programming \n        in afterschool, more and better partnerships across Federal \n        agencies become increasingly important to leverage resources \n        and offer high-quality, hands-on STEM experiences for youth.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to enhance America's economic competitiveness by \n        strengthening STEM education through fostering interest and \n        success in STEM subjects among certain student populations in \n        kindergarten through grade 12;\n            (2) to engage Federal agencies and foster interagency \n        collaboration in STEM education afterschool program \n        investments;\n            (3) to recognize the important role that afterschool \n        programs offered by nonprofit and community-based \n        organizations, science centers, museums, libraries, and other \n        such entities, play in STEM education and to support their \n        efforts;\n            (4) to involve institutions of higher education as partners \n        in such efforts and foster increased collaboration; and\n            (5) to inspire young people to study and work in STEM \n        subjects.\n\nSEC. 4.
