    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(1) To remain economically competitive, California will need to produce 11,900,000 degrees and credentials by 2025, but the state is only estimated to produce 9,500,000, which would create a degree and credential attainment gap of 2,400,000 by 2025.\n(2) California\u2019s community colleges have strong transfer preparation and career technical education missions and are well positioned to close this impending gap.\n(3) Overall, only 32 percent of students at California colleges complete credentials on time, and low-income students are much less likely than higher income students to enroll in or complete college.\n(4) A major factor in a student\u2019s enrollment and success in college is his or her ability to pay for fees and tuition, textbooks, transportation, housing, food, and other access costs.\n(5) California has made an important investment in need-based financial aid for California\u2019s college students through the Cal Grant Program and the BOG Fee Waiver Program of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges.\n(6) The Cal Grant Program awards more than two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) annually, and it is the largest state grant program in the nation in terms of dollars awarded to students. The BOG Fee Waiver Program is more extensive than any other \u201cfree community college\u201d plan in the nation, and it provides almost one-half of all students of the California Community Colleges, and more than 60 percent of full-time students of the California Community Colleges, with free tuition.\n(7) Despite California\u2019s strong commitment to financial aid, access grants for qualifying students are insufficient to cover nontuition college costs, and many low-income students are left out of the program entirely.\n(8) Students at California\u2019s community colleges are disproportionately more likely to be the first in their family to attend college, come from an immigrant background, or be financially needy.\n(9) After taking into account the total cost of attendance and all federal, state, and institutional financial aid available for students, on average it is more expensive for a needy student to go to a California community college than to attend the University of California or the California State University.\n(10) The affordability challenge faced by California\u2019s community college students stems from nontuition costs, and the solution to that challenge is to increase grant aid that covers nontuition costs.\n(11) The 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education in California guarantees an affordable, high-quality education to every Californian who can benefit.\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to renew California\u2019s commitment to college affordability by increasing the aid available to needy students, and, specifically, broadening access to financial aid to students enrolled in California community\ncollege career technical education programs leading to industry valued credentials, through expanding the Cal Grant Program.\ncolleges.\n(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that California community colleges provide outreach and education to students to inform them of the expanded availability of financial aid\nfor students enrolled in career technical education programs\nand to encourage\nthese\nstudents to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid by the September 2 deadline.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 69437 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n69437.\n(a) Commencing with the 2001\u201302 academic year, and each academic year thereafter, there shall be established the Competitive Cal Grant A and B award program for students who did not receive a Cal Grant A or B entitlement award pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 69434), Article 3 (commencing with Section 69435), or Article 4 (commencing with Section 69436). Awards made under this section are not entitlements. The submission of an application by a student under this section shall not entitle that student to an award. The selection of students under this article shall be determined pursuant to subdivision (c) and other relevant criteria established by the commission.\n(b)  Commencing with the 2016\u201317 academic year, a total of up to 34,000 Cal Grant A and B awards shall be granted annually under this article on a competitive basis for applicants who meet the general eligibility criteria established in Article 1 (commencing with Section 69430) and the priorities established by the commission pursuant to subdivision (c).\n(1) Fifteen thousand of the awards referenced in this subdivision are available to all students, including California community college students, who meet the financial need and academic requirements established pursuant to this article. A student enrolling at a qualifying baccalaureate degree granting institution shall apply by the March 2 deadline. A California community college student is eligible to apply at the March 2 or the September 2 deadline.\n(2) Nineteen thousand of the awards referenced in this subdivision are reserved for students who will be enrolled at a California community college. The commission shall establish a second application deadline of September 2 for community college students to apply for these awards.\nNotwithstanding paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 69435, effective with the fall term or semester of the 2017\u201318 academic year, students enrolled in occupational or technical training courses leading to industry valued credentials of no less than four months in length at a California community college shall be eligible for Cal Grant B awards issued under this paragraph.\n(3) If any awards are not distributed pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) upon initial allocation of the awards under this article, the commission shall make awards to as many eligible students as possible, beginning with the students with the lowest expected family contribution and highest academic merit, consistent with the criteria adopted by the commission pursuant to subdivision (c), as practicable without exceeding an annual cumulative total of 34,000 awards.\n(c) (1) On or before February 1, 2001, acting pursuant to a public hearing process that is consistent with the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), the commission shall establish selection criteria for Cal Grant A and B awards under the competitive program that give special consideration to disadvantaged students, taking into consideration those financial, educational, cultural, language, home, community, environmental, and other conditions that hamper a student\u2019s access to, and ability to persist in, postsecondary education programs.\n(2) Additional consideration shall be given to both of the following:\n(A) Students pursuing Cal Grant B awards who reestablish their grade point averages.\n(B) Students who did not receive awards pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 69434), Article 3 (commencing with Section 69435), or Article 4 (commencing with Section 69436).\n(d) All other students who meet the eligibility requirements pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 69430) are eligible to compete for an award pursuant to this article.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 69439 of the\nEducation Code\nis amended to read:\n69439.\n(a)For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n(1)\u201cCareer pathway\u201d has the same meaning as set forth in Section 88620.\n(2)\u201cEconomic security\u201d has the same meaning as set forth in Section 14005 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.\n(3)\u201cIndustry cluster\u201d has the same meaning as set forth in Section 88620.\n(4)\u201cLong-term unemployed\u201d means, with respect to an award applicant, a person who has been unemployed for more than 26 weeks at the time of submission to the commission of his or her application.\n(5)\u201cOccupational or technical training\u201d means that phase of education coming after the completion of a secondary school program and leading toward recognized occupational goals approved by the commission.\n(b)A Cal Grant C award shall be utilized only for occupational or technical training in a course of not less than four months. There shall be the same number of Cal Grant C awards each year as were paid in the 2015\u201316 fiscal year. The maximum award amount and the total amount of funding shall be determined each year in the annual Budget Act.\n(c)The commission may use criteria it deems appropriate in selecting students to receive grants for occupational or technical training and shall give special consideration to the social and economic situations of the students applying for these grants, giving additional weight to disadvantaged applicants, applicants who face economic hardship, and applicants who face particular barriers to employment. Criteria to be considered for these purposes shall include, but are not limited to, all of the following:\n(1)Family income and household size.\n(2)Student\u2019s or the students\u2019 parent\u2019s household status, including whether the student is a single parent or child of a single parent.\n(3)The employment status of the applicant and whether the applicant is unemployed, giving greater weight to the long-term unemployed.\n(d)The Cal Grant C award recipients shall be eligible for renewal of their grants until they have completed their occupational or technical training in conformance with terms prescribed by the commission. A determination by the commission for a subsequent award year that the program under which a Cal Grant C award was initially awarded is no longer deemed to receive priority shall not affect an award recipient\u2019s renewal. In no case shall the grants exceed two calendar years.\n(e)Cal Grant C awards may be used for institutional fees, charges, and other costs, including tuition, plus training-related costs, such as special clothing, local transportation, required tools, equipment, supplies, books, and living expenses. In determining the individual award amounts, the commission shall take into account the financial means available to the student to fund his or her course of study and costs of attendance as well as other state and federal programs available to the applicant.\n(f)(1)To ensure alignment with the state\u2019s dynamic economic needs, the commission, in consultation with appropriate state and federal agencies, including the Economic and Workforce Development Division of the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the California Workforce Investment Board, shall identify areas of occupational and technical training for which students may utilize Cal Grant C awards. The commission, to the extent feasible, shall also consult with representatives of the state\u2019s leading competitive and emerging industry clusters, workforce professionals, and career technical educators, to determine which occupational training programs and industry clusters should be prioritized.\n(2)(A)Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the areas of occupational and technical training developed pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be regularly reviewed and updated at least every five years, beginning in 2012.\n(B)By January 1, 2016, the commission shall update the priority areas of occupational and technical training.\n(3)(A)The commission shall give priority in granting Cal Grant C awards to students pursuing occupational or technical training in areas that meet two of the following criteria pertaining to job quality:\n(i)High employer need or demand for the specific skills offered in the program.\n(ii)High employment growth in the occupational field or industry cluster for which the student is being trained.\n(iii)High employment salary and wage projections for workers employed in the occupations for which they are being trained.\n(iv)The occupation or training program is part of a well-articulated career pathway to a job providing economic security.\n(B)To receive priority pursuant to subparagraph (A), at least one of the criteria met shall be specified in clause (iii) or (iv) of that subparagraph.\n(g)The commission shall determine areas of occupational or technical training that meet the criteria described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f) in consultation with the Employment Development Department, the Economic and Workforce Development Division of the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, and the California Workforce Investment Board using projections available through the Labor Market Information Data Library. The commission may supplement the analyses of the Employment Development Department\u2019s Labor Market Information Data Library with the labor market analyses developed by the Economic and Workforce Development Division of the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the California Workforce Investment Board, as well as the projections of occupational shortages and skills gap developed by industry leaders. The commission shall publish, and retain, on its Internet Web site a current list of the areas of occupational or technical training that meet the criteria described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f), and update this list as necessary.\n(h)Using the best available data, the commission shall examine the graduation rates and job placement data, or salary data, of eligible programs. Commencing with the 2014\u201315 academic year, the commission shall give priority to Cal Grant C award applicants seeking to enroll in programs that rate high in graduation rates and job placement data, or salary data.\n(i)(1)The commission shall consult with the Employment Development Department, the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, the California Workforce Investment Board, and the local workforce investment boards to develop a plan to publicize the existence of the grant award program to California\u2019s long-term unemployed to be used by those consulting agencies when they come in contact with members of the population who are likely to be experiencing long-term unemployment. The outreach plan shall use existing administrative and service delivery processes making use of existing points of contact with the long-term unemployed.
