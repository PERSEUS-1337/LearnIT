    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n(a) The Legislature finds and declares that having a healthy housing market that provides an adequate supply of homes affordable to Californians at all income levels is critical to the economic prosperity and quality of life in the state.\n(b) The Legislature further finds and declares all of the following:\n(1) Funding approved by the state\u2019s voters in 2002 and 2006, as of June 2014, has financed the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of over 14,000 shelter spaces and 149,000 affordable homes. These numbers include thousands of supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness. In addition, these funds have helped tens of thousands of families become or remain homeowners. Nearly all of the voter-approved funding for affordable housing was awarded by the beginning of 2016.\n(2) The requirement in the Community Redevelopment Law that redevelopment agencies set aside 20 percent of tax increment for affordable housing generated roughly $1 billion per year. With the elimination of redevelopment agencies, this funding stream has disappeared.\n(3) In 2014, the Legislature committed 10 percent of ongoing cap-and-trade funds for affordable housing that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and dedicated $100 million in one-time funding for affordable multifamily and permanent supportive housing. In addition, the people of California thoughtfully approved the repurposing of $600 million in already committed bond funds for the creation of affordable rental and permanent supportive housing for veterans through the passage of Proposition 41.\n(4) Despite these investments, the need in the State of California greatly exceeds the available resources, with recent data showing 36.2 percent of mortgaged homeowners and 47.7 percent of all renters are spending more than 35 percent of their household incomes on housing.\n(5) California has 12 percent of the United States population, but 20 percent of its homeless population. California has the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless in the nation, with 63 percent of homeless Californians not having shelter. California has 24 percent of the nation\u2019s homeless veteran\u2019s population and one-third of the nations\u2019 chronically homeless population. California also has the largest populations of unaccompanied homeless children and youth, with 30 percent of the national total.\n(6) Furthermore, four of the top 10 metropolitan areas in the country with the highest rate of homelessness are in the following metropolitan areas in California: San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana, Fresno, and Stockton.\n(7) California continues to have the second lowest homeownership rate in the nation, and the Los Angeles metropolitan area is now a majority renter area. In fact, five of the eight lowest homeownership rates are in metropolitan areas in California.\n(8) Los Angeles and Orange Counties have been identified as the epicenter of overcrowded housing, and numerous studies have shown that children in crowded homes have poorer health, worse scores on mathematics and reading tests, and higher rates of depression and behavioral problems\u2014even when poverty is taken into account.\n(9) Millions of Californians are affected by the state\u2019s chronic housing shortage, including seniors, veterans, people experiencing chronic homelessness, working families, people with mental, physical, or developmental disabilities, agricultural workers, people exiting jails, prisons, and other state institutions, survivors of domestic violence, and former foster and transition-aged youth.\n(10) Eight of the top 10 hardest hit cities by the foreclosure crisis in the nation were in California. They include the Cities of Stockton, Modesto, Vallejo, Riverside, San Bernardino, Merced, Bakersfield, and Sacramento.\n(11) California\u2019s workforce continues to experience longer commute times as persons in the workforce seek affordable housing outside the areas in which they work. If California is unable to support the construction of affordable housing in these areas, congestion problems will strain the state\u2019s transportation system and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions.\n(12) Many economists agree that the state\u2019s higher than average unemployment rate is due in large part to massive shrinkage in the construction industry from 2005 to 2009, inclusive, including losses of nearly 700,000 construction-related jobs, a 60-percent decline in construction spending, and an 83-percent reduction in residential permits. Restoration of a healthy construction sector will significantly reduce the state\u2019s unemployment rate.\n(13) The lack of sufficient housing impedes economic growth and development by making it difficult for California employers to attract and retain employees.\nSEC. 2.\nChapter 10 (commencing with Section 34191.10) is added to Part 1.85 of Division 24 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  10. Local Control Affordable Housing Act\n34191.10.\n(a) On or before ____, and on or before the same date each year thereafter, the Department of Finance shall determine the amount of General Fund savings for the fiscal year as a result of the dissolution of redevelopment agencies pursuant to this part.\n(b) (1) Upon appropriation, 50 percent of the savings computed pursuant to subdivision (a) or one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000), whichever is\ngreater,\nless,\nin each fiscal year shall be allocated to the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment to provide funding\nDevelopment.
