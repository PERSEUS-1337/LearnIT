FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Holocaust, an event in which millions of people \n        endured enormous suffering through torture and other violence, \n        including the murder of 6,000,000 Jews and millions of others, \n        the destruction of families and communities, and the theft of \n        their assets, was one of the most heinous crimes in human \n        history.\n            (2) Before and during World War II, millions of people \n        purchased insurance policies to safeguard family assets, plan \n        for retirement, provide for a dowry, or save for their \n        children's education.\n            (3) When Holocaust survivors and heirs and beneficiaries of \n        Holocaust victims presented claims to insurance companies after \n        World War II, many were rejected because they did not have \n        death certificates or physical possession of policy documents \n        that had been confiscated by the Nazis or lost in the \n        devastation of the Holocaust.\n            (4) In many instances, insurance company records and \n        records in government archives are the only proof of the \n        existence of insurance policies belonging to Holocaust victims.\n            (5) Holocaust survivors and heirs and beneficiaries of \n        Holocaust victims have been attempting for decades to persuade \n        insurance companies to settle unpaid insurance claims.\n            (6) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \n        Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as ``ICHEIC'') \n        was established by the National Association of Insurance \n        Commissioners in cooperation with several European insurance \n        companies, European regulators, the Government of Israel, and \n        nongovernmental organizations with the promise that it would \n        expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance policies \n        issued to Holocaust victims.\n            (7) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed \n        an executive agreement in support of the German Foundation \n        ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which \n        designated ICHEIC to resolve all Holocaust-era insurance \n        policies issued by German companies and their subsidiaries.\n            (8) On January 17, 2001, the United States and Austria \n        signed an executive agreement, which designated ICHEIC to \n        resolve all Holocaust-era insurance policies issued by Austrian \n        companies and their subsidiaries.\n            (9) The ICHEIC process ended in 2007 and companies holding \n        Holocaust-era insurance policies continue to withhold names of \n        owners and beneficiaries of thousands of insurance policies \n        sold to Jewish customers prior to World War II.\n            (10) Experts estimate that only a small fraction of the \n        policies estimated to have been sold to Jews living in Europe \n        at the beginning of World War II have been paid through ICHEIC.\n            (11) In American Insurance Association, Inc., v. Garamendi, \n        the United States Supreme Court held that under the supremacy \n        clause of the Constitution of the United States, executive \n        agreements and executive foreign policy calling for insurance \n        claims against German and Austrian companies to be handled \n        within ICHEIC preempted State laws authorizing State insurance \n        commissioners to subpoena company records and require \n        publication of the names of Holocaust era policy holders.\n            (12) In the Garamendi case, the Supreme Court stated that \n        Congress, which has the power to regulate international \n        commerce and prescribe Federal court jurisdiction, had not \n        addressed disclosure and restitution of insurance policies of \n        Holocaust victims.\n            (13) Subsequent court decisions have dismissed Holocaust-\n        era insurance claims brought against an Italian insurance \n        company, even though there is no executive agreement between \n        the United States and Italy.\n            (14) Congress supports the rights of Holocaust survivors \n        and the heirs and beneficiaries of Holocaust victims to obtain \n        information from insurers and to bring legal actions in courts, \n        wherever jurisdiction requirements are met, to recover unpaid \n        funds from entities that participated in the theft of family \n        insurance assets or the affiliates of such entities.\n            (15) Congress intends for this Act to establish a Federal \n        private right of action to allow Holocaust survivors and heirs \n        and beneficiaries of victims to recover under their covered \n        Holocaust-era insurance policies, and to allow for State causes \n        of action and disclosure requirement laws regarding Holocaust-\n        era insurance policies to be valid and not preempted.\n            (16) This Act expresses the intent of Congress to deem \n        valid State laws protecting the rights of Holocaust survivors \n        and the heirs and beneficiaries of Holocaust victims to obtain \n        information from insurers and to bring actions in courts of \n        proper jurisdiction to recover unpaid funds from entities that \n        participated in the theft of family insurance assets or the \n        affiliates of such entities.\n            (17) Insurance payments should be expedited to the victims \n        of the most heinous crime of the 20th century to ensure that \n        justice is served.\n            (18) This Act will enable Holocaust survivors and heirs and \n        beneficiaries of Holocaust victims to obtain compensation \n        commensurate with the real monetary value of their losses.\n            (19) Under the circumstances faced by Holocaust victims and \n        their families, courts should be open to Holocaust survivors \n        and heirs and beneficiaries of Holocaust victims for a \n        reasonable number of years after the enactment of this Act, \n        without regard to any other statutes of limitation.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.\n\n    (a) Civil Actions To Recover Under Covered Policies.--Any person \nwho purchased a covered policy, or a beneficiary or heir of such \nperson, may bring a civil action, in the appropriate United States \ndistrict court, against the insurer for the covered policy or a related \ncompany of the insurer, to recover proceeds due under the covered \npolicy or otherwise to enforce any rights under the covered policy.\n    (b) Nationwide Service of Process.--For a civil action brought \nunder subsection (a), process may be served in the judicial district \nwhere the case is brought or any other judicial district of the United \nStates where the defendant may be found, resides, has an agent, or \ntransacts business.\n    (c) Remedies.--A court shall award to a prevailing beneficiary in a \ncivil action brought under subsection (a)--\n            (1) the amount of the proceeds due under the covered \n        policy;\n            (2) prejudgment interest on the amount described in clause \n        (i) from the date the amount was due until the date of \n        judgment, calculated at a rate of 6 percent per year, \n        compounded annually; and\n            (3) any other appropriate relief necessary to enforce \n        rights under the covered policy.\n\nSEC. 4.
