LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD.\n\n    At the end of title II of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 841. LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n            ``(1) Fuel emission baseline.--The term `fuel emission \n        baseline' means the average lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions \n        per unit of energy, as determined by the Administrator, of all \n        transportation fuels sold or introduced into commerce in any of \n        the 50 States or the District of Columbia in calendar year \n        2005.\n            ``(2) Transportation fuel.--The term `transportation fuel' \n        means fuel for use in motor vehicles, motor vehicle engines, \n        nonroad vehicles, nonroad engines, and aircraft. The \n        Administrator may, at his discretion, include fuel for use in \n        ocean-going vessels and adjust the fuel emission baseline as \n        appropriate to reflect the inclusion of such fuel.\n            ``(3) Transportation fuel provider.--The term \n        `transportation fuel provider' includes any individual or \n        entity that produces, refines, blends, or imports any \n        transportation fuel.\n    ``(b) Regulations.--\n            ``(1) Standard.--Not later than 3 years after enactment of \n        this section, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations \n        under section 211(c) and this section that--\n                    ``(A) determine the lifecycle greenhouse gas \n                emissions of all transportation fuels;\n                    ``(B) determine the fuel emission baseline;\n                    ``(C) apply to refineries, blenders, and importers, \n                as appropriate, and to such other transportation fuel \n                providers as determined by the Administrator;\n                    ``(D) ensure that, for each year from 2014 through \n                2022, the annual average lifecycle greenhouse gas \n                emissions, per unit of energy as determined by the \n                Administrator, of transportation fuel, excluding \n                renewable fuel used to meet the obligations of section \n                211(o), sold or introduced into commerce by such \n                transportation fuel providers in any of the 50 States \n                or the District of Columbia, does not exceed the fuel \n                emission baseline;
