FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States economy is in the early stages of a \n        revolution in electronic commerce--the ability to buy, sell, \n        and even deliver goods and services through computer networks. \n        Estimates are that electronic commerce sales in 1998 were \n        around $100,000,000,000 and could rise to $1,300,000,000,000 by \n        2003.\n            (2) Electronic commerce promises to spur tremendously \n        United States productivity and economic growth--repeating a \n        historical pattern where the greatest impetus toward economic \n        growth lies not in the sale of new technologies but in their \n        widespread adoption and use.\n            (3) Electronic commerce presents an enormous opportunity \n        and challenge for small businesses. Such commerce will give \n        such businesses new markets and new ways of doing businesses. \n        However, many such business will have difficulty in adopting \n        appropriate electronic commerce technologies and practices. \n        Moreover, such businesses in more rural areas will find distant \n        businesses entering their markets and competing with them. \n        Thus, there is considerable risk many small businesses will be \n        left behind in the shift to electronic commerce.\n            (4) The United States has an interest in ensuring that \n        small businesses in all parts of the United States participate \n        fully in the electronic commerce revolution, both for the sake \n        of such businesses and in order to promote productivity and \n        economic growth throughout the entire United States economy.\n            (5) The Federal Government has a long history of \n        successfully helping small farmers with new agricultural \n        technologies through the Cooperative Extension System at the \n        Department of Agriculture, founded in 1914. More recently, the \n        National Institute of Standards and Technology has successfully \n        helped small manufacturers with manufacturing technologies \n        through its Manufacturing Extension Program, established in \n        1988.\n            (6) Similarly, now is the time to establish an electronic \n        commerce extension program to help small businesses throughout \n        the United States identify, adapt, and adopt electronic \n        commerce technologies and business practices, thereby ensuring \n        that such businesses fully participate in the electronic \n        commerce revolution.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish an electronic commerce \nextension program focused on small businesses at the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology.\n\nSEC. 4.
