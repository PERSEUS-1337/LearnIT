PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is--\n            (1) to maintain the access of veterans to high-quality \n        hospital care, medical services, and extended care if that care \n        is not available directly from the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs;\n            (2) to continue to allow the use by the Department of \n        agreements covered by the Federal Acquisition Regulation and \n        agreements that are not covered by such regulation, similar to \n        those agreements used under the original Medicare fee-for-\n        service program (Medicare Parts A and B), if it is not \n        practicable to contract for the care needed by veterans through \n        an agreement covered by such regulation;\n            (3) to address the fact that individual health care \n        providers, especially smaller providers in rural areas, may not \n        be willing to accept veterans as patients when doing so would \n        require the significant time and administrative requirements in \n        connection with entering into agreements with the Department \n        that are covered by such regulation;\n            (4) to address the deficiencies in current law regarding \n        agreements entered into by the Department that have raised \n        legal issues; and\n            (5) to ensure that agreements that are not covered by such \n        regulation include robust terms and conditions that address the \n        quality of health care for veterans, oversight of the provision \n        of such health care, and protections for taxpayers.\n\nSEC. 3.
