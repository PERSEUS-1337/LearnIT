FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Timely and reliable data on the situation of women in \n        the United States and around the world is critical to the \n        effective implementation of the Platform for Action agreed upon \n        at the International Conference on Population and Development \n        and in evaluating the cost effectiveness of United States \n        domestic and foreign assistance programs.\n            (2) Statistics on women exist in every country, including \n        the United States, but are not generally published or analyzed \n        in a form accessible to those, including laypersons, concerned \n        with gender issues.\n            (3) Many of the statistical indicators currently used fail \n        to provide a complete picture of women's health and their roles \n        within the family, the economy, and political and social \n        spheres.\n            (4) Many topics relevant to gender issues in society have \n        not been adequately measured, such as access to resources, \n        time-use, extent of family responsibilities, and the quality \n        and effectiveness of programs and policies designed to meet \n        women's needs. Efforts to develop appropriate approaches to \n        data collection and to refine old approaches to data collection \n        are required.\n            (5) Comparable measurements and standard methodologies for \n        collection and analysis of gender statistics must be integrated \n        into the ongoing programs of the United States Census Bureau's \n        national and international statistical services, and the \n        statistical services funded by United States Agency for \n        International Development, so that they can provide an unbiased \n        basis for the design, implementation and monitoring of \n        programs, policies, and legislation.\n\nSEC. 3. SURVEY OF STATUS OF WOMEN.\n\n    (a) Periodic Surveys Required.--Title 13, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following new chapter:\n\n ``CHAPTER 11--COLLECTION AND PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION ON THE STATUS \n                                OF WOMEN\n\n``Sec.\n``501.
