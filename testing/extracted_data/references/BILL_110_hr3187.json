Grants for dental care offender reentry projects.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) One of the unexpected results of the methamphetamine \n        epidemic has been prisoners' need for costly dental care. By \n        some accounts, more than 30 percent of prison inmates suffer \n        from meth mouth and about 40 percent of correctional dental \n        spending goes toward repairing or removing teeth ravaged by \n        methamphetamine use.\n            (2) Every year some 600,000 inmates are released from \n        Federal and State prisons and return to their communities and \n        families.\n            (3) Ex-offenders who are healthy have greater success in \n        reintegrating into the community and avoiding incarceration.\n            (4) There have been few published studies (and virtually no \n        routine data collections) that adequately characterize the oral \n        health of inmates and the provision of dental care in \n        correctional facilities. In fact, the absence of peer-reviewed \n        literature has resulted in the perpetual underfunding and \n        understaffing of correctional dental care programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) investigate and report on the oral health of inmates of \n        correctional facilities and on the provision of dental care in \n        such facilities;\n            (2) temporarily sustain dental programs in correctional \n        facilities that have been suddenly and disproportionately taxed \n        by the prevalence and severity of inmate meth mouth;\n            (3) ensure that oral health and dental care are accounted \n        for in the Department of Justice's prisoner reentry \n        initiatives; and\n    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Correctional facility; detention facility.--The terms \n        ``correctional facility'' and ``detention facility'' mean any \n        place for the confinement or rehabilitation of offenders or \n        individuals charged with or convicted of criminal offenses.\n            (2) Inmate.--The term ``inmate'' means any person who is \n        incarcerated or detained in any correctional facility and who \n        is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated \n        delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and \n        conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or a \n        diversionary program.\n            (3) Meth mouth.--The term ``meth mouth'' means a distinct \n        and often severe pattern of oral decay that is commonly \n        associated with methamphetamine use.\n            (4) Offender reentry.--The term ``offender reentry'' means \n        the process of returning individuals to society after a period \n        of incarceration in a prison, jail, or other detention \n        facility.\n\nSEC. 4.
