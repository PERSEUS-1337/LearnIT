FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) cell phones and other electronic devices are not only \n        instrumentalities and channels of interstate commerce, but \n        products of interstate commerce;\n            (2) for those reasons, regulation of the use of cellular \n        telephones or other electronic devices to send text messages is \n        covered by the power of Congress to regulate interstate \n        commerce as enumerated in article I, section 8 of the \n        Constitution;\n            (3) additionally, the Supreme Court held in South Dakota v. \n        Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (June 23, 1987), that Congress may condition \n        Federal highway funding on State compliance with certain \n        conditions;\n            (4) people in the United States are using cellular \n        telephones and other personal electronic devices to send text \n        messages or emails, more commonly known as ``texting'', with \n        increasing frequency;\n            (5) according to the New York Times, more than \n        110,000,000,000 text messages were sent in the United States \n        during the month of December 2008 alone, a tenfold increase in \n        just 3 years;\n            (6) texting and portable email are valuable to consumers, \n        businesses, and private individuals throughout the United \n        States, but those services also create an extreme risk when \n        used by individuals while operating motor vehicles;\n            (7) a 2008 study by Nationwide Insurance found that 20 \n        percent of drivers in the United States send text messages \n        while operating motor vehicles;\n            (8) according to a study by Car and Driver Magazine, \n        texting while driving is more dangerous than driving while \n        intoxicated;\n            (9) a recent study by the Virginia Tech Transportation \n        Institute found operators of motor vehicles who sent text \n        messages while driving had a collision risk that was 23 times \n        greater while texting as compared to the risk when the \n        operators were not texting;\n            (10) another study by the University of Utah found that \n        college students using a driving simulator were 8 times more \n        likely to have an accident while texting;\n            (11) after a serious accident occurred on the Boston public \n        trolley system in May 2009, the trolley operator was found to \n        have been texting at the time of the accident;\n            (12) the problem of texting while driving has been \n        recognized across the United States;\n            (13) as of the date of enactment of this Act, 14 States and \n        the District of Columbia ban all drivers from texting while \n        operating motor vehicles, and 11 other States have a modified \n        ban on texting while driving;\n            (14) the risks created by texting while driving are \n        increasing nationwide as the use of texting increases \n        nationwide;\n            (15) it is necessary for Congress to act to protect the \n        safety of all people in the United States on highways and roads \n        in the United States; and\n            (16) a Federal law to address the problem of texting while \n        driving is necessary to ensure minimum standards of protection \n        across the United States, in the same manner as the national \n        minimum drinking age provides a uniform standard of protection.\n\nSEC. 3.
