FINDINGS\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) U.S. university nuclear science and engineering \n        programs are in a state of serious decline. The supply of \n        bachelor degree nuclear science and engineering personnel in \n        the United States is at a 35-year low. The number of four year \n        degree nuclear engineering programs has declined 50 percent to \n        approximately 25 programs nationwide. Over two-thirds of the \n        faculty in these programs are 45 years or older.\n            (2) Universities cannot afford to support their research \n        and training reactors. Since 1980, the number of small training \n        reactors in the United States have declined by over 50 percent \n        to 28 reactors. Most of these reactors were built in the late \n        1950s and 1960s with 30- to 40-year operating licenses, and \n        will require re-licensing in the next several years.\n            (3) The neglect in human investment and training \n        infrastructure is affecting 50 years of national R&D \n        investment. The decline in a competent nuclear workforce, and \n        the lack of adequately trained nuclear scientists and \n        engineers, will affect the ability of the United States to \n        solve future waste storage issues, maintain basic nuclear \n        health physics programs, operate existing fission reactors in \n        the United States, respond to future nuclear events worldwide, \n        help stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and design and \n        operate naval nuclear reactors.\n            (4) Further neglect in the nation's investment in human \n        resources for the nuclear sciences will lead to a downward \n        spiral. As the number of nuclear science departments shrink, \n        faculties age, and training reactors close, the appeal of \n        nuclear science will be lost to future generations of students.\n          (5) The Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Science and \n        Technology is well suited to help maintain tomorrow's human \n        resource and training investment in the nuclear sciences. \n        Through its support of research and development pursuant to the \n        Department's statutory authorities, the Office of Nuclear \n        Science and Technology is the principal Federal agent for \n        civilian research in the nuclear sciences for the United \n        States. The Office maintains the Nuclear Engineering and \n        Education Research Program which funds basic nuclear science \n        and engineering. The Office funds the Nuclear Energy and \n        Research Initiative which funds applied collaborative research \n        among universities, industry and national laboratories in the \n        areas of proliferation resistant fuel cycles and future fission \n        power systems. The Office funds Universities to refuel training \n        reactors from highly enriched to low enriched proliferation \n        tolerant fuels, performs instrumentation upgrades and maintains \n        a program of student fellowships for nuclear science, \n        engineering and health physics.\n\nSEC. 3.
