FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 2004, National Security Presidential Directive 36 \n        (NSPD-36) transferred responsibility from the Department of \n        State to the Department of Defense for ``organizing, equipping, \n        and training all Iraqi security forces'' and stated that ``at \n        the appropriate time, the Secretary of State and the Secretary \n        of Defense shall jointly decide when these functions shall \n        transfer to a security assistance organization and other \n        appropriate organizations under the authority of the Secretary \n        of State and the Chief of Mission.''.\n            (2) On May 25, 2007, the Independent Commission on the \n        Security Forces of Iraq, also known as the Jones Commission, \n        was created to assess the readiness of Iraq's military and \n        police forces and report its findings to Congress.\n            (3) The Jones Commission cited progress by the Iraqi Army \n        and the Ministry of Defense but less improvement by the \n        Ministry of Interior, ``whose dysfunction has hampered the \n        police force''. The Jones Commission found the ``Iraqi Police \n        Service is incapable today of providing security at a level \n        sufficient to protect Iraqi neighborhoods from insurgents and \n        sectarian violence'' and stressed that the police are central \n        to the long-term establishment of security in Iraq.\n            (4) The Jones Commission report stated that although ``U.S. \n        military officers rather than senior civilian law enforcement \n        personnel lead the Coalition training effort for the Iraqi \n        Police Service; this arrangement has inadvertently marginalized \n        civilian police advisors and limited the overall effectiveness \n        of the training and advisory effort.''. The Jones Commission \n        recommended that leadership of the Coalition Police Assistance \n        Training Team (CPATT) and the Police Training Teams should be \n        transferred to senior civilian law enforcement professionals.\n            (5) The Jones Commission found the number of civilian \n        international police advisors to be insufficient for the task \n        of training the Iraqi Police Service.\n            (6) The Department of Defense's September 2007 Quarterly \n        Report to Congress on Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq \n        found that the Ministry of Interior and its forces required \n        ``continued advisory support, training and development, and \n        equipping to be able to progressively assume missions from \n        Coalition forces. The efforts of embedded advisors are focused \n        on addressing continued shortcomings in logistics, leadership \n        and budget execution that hamper improvement, and in certain \n        cases, cause regression.''. The advisors also assess and report \n        on the operational readiness of the units they mentor on a \n        monthly basis.\n            (7) The Department of Defense September 2007 Quarterly \n        Report also stated, ``Current funding levels for the IPA \n        [International Police Advisors] program and availability of \n        military assets do not allow for full coverage of the more than \n        1,100 provincial and local police headquarters and stations in \n        Iraq.''. In the Department of Defense March 2007 Quarterly \n        Report, the Department of Defense stated that ``cost and risk \n        preclude deploying enough PTTs [Police Transition Teams] to \n        cover all of Iraq's police stations; at any time, only 5 of \n        Iraq's 18 provinces have sufficient PTTs . . . Continued PTT \n        presence and participation at Iraqi Police Service stations are \n        needed to improve police readiness and to sustain progress in \n        reforming community policing.''. However, Transition Teams are \n        embedded in the Ministry of Defense, the Joint Headquarters, \n        and with most battalions and brigade and division headquarters.\n            (8) The Department of Defense September 2007 Quarterly \n        Report also stated that there were 238 Police Transition Teams \n        for the Iraqi Police Service, with each team composed of \n        approximately 12-15 members, two to four of whom are civilian \n        Department of State contractors, funded by the Department of \n        Defense's Iraq Security Forces Fund. The remaining members are \n        military personnel.\n            (9) In testimony given to the Subcommittee on Oversight and \n        Investigations of the Committee on Armed Services of the House \n        of Representatives, the Department of State stated that since \n        the Department of Defense assumed responsibility for training \n        the Iraqi Security Forces, the Department of Defense has \n        transferred $1,500,000,000 to the Bureau for International \n        Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) of the Department \n        of State to provide trainers and advisors, including 690 \n        International Police Liaison Officers, who are DynCorp \n        contractors, and who serve as advisors in the field to train \n        and mentor Iraqi Police.\n            (10) At hearings on the Iraqi Security Forces conducted by \n        the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the \n        Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, \n        several witnesses agreed that there were not enough civilian \n        police advisors for many units of the Iraqi Police Service and \n        that the military advisors lacked the appropriate policing \n        background to appropriately support the community-policing \n        conducted by the Iraqi Police Service.\n\nSEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLICE TRANSITION TEAMS \n              FOR THE IRAQI POLICE SERVICE.\n\n    (a) Transfer of Responsibility.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding National Security \n        Presidential Directive 36 (NSPD-36), not later than 180 days \n        after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n        State shall assume responsibility from the Department of \n        Defense over the Police Training Teams being used in Iraq to \n        provide advisory support, training and development, and \n        equipment for the Iraqi Police Service.\n            (2) Statement of understanding.--Not later than 120 days \n        after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n        State and the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a \n        statement of understanding on command structure, including on \n        the roles and responsibilities of members of the Police \n        Training Teams.\n    (b) Composition of Teams.--The Secretary of State shall ensure that \na majority of the members of each Police Training Team consists of \nqualified civilian advisors, including employees of the Department of \nState and employees of contractors secured by the Department of State. \nNot fewer than two members of each Police Training Team shall be police \nofficers or have retired from police service more than two years before \nbecoming members of a Police Training Team.
