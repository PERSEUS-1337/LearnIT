    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The International Space Station, the Space Launch \n        System, and the Orion crew capsule will enable the Nation to \n        continue operations in low-Earth orbit and to send its \n        astronauts to deep space. As a result of their unique \n        capabilities and their critical contribution to the future of \n        space exploration, these systems have been designated by \n        Congress and the Administration as priority investments.\n            (2) While the Space Launch System and the Orion programs, \n        currently under development, have made significant progress, \n        they have not been funded at levels authorized, and as a result \n        congressionally authorized milestones will be delayed by \n        several years.\n            (3) In addition, contractors are currently holding program \n        funding, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of \n        dollars, to cover the potential termination liability should \n        the Government choose to terminate a program for convenience. \n        As a result, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are \n        unavailable for meaningful work on these programs.\n            (4) According to the Government Accountability Office, the \n        Administration procures most of its goods and services through \n        contracts, and it terminates very few of them. In fiscal year \n        2010, the Administration terminated 28 of 16,343 active \n        contracts and orders--a termination rate of about 0.17 percent.\n            (5) Providing processes requiring congressional action on \n        termination of these high-priority programs would enable \n        contractors to apply taxpayer dollars to making maximum \n        progress in meeting the established technical goals and \n        schedule milestones of these programs.\n\nSEC. 2. NASA TERMINATION LIABILITY.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--Termination liability costs for a covered \nprogram shall be provided only pursuant to this section.\n    (b) Prohibition on Reserving Funds.--The Administrator may not \nreserve funds from amounts appropriated for a covered program, and \nshall direct prime contractors not to reserve funds, for potential \ntermination liability costs with respect to a covered program.\n    (c) Intent of Congress.--It is the intent of Congress that funds \nauthorized to be appropriated for covered programs be applied in \nmeeting established technical goals and schedule milestones.\n    (d) Void Contractual Provisions.--Any provision in a prime contract \nentered into before the date of enactment of this Act that provides for \nthe payment of termination liability costs through any means other than \nas provided in this section is hereby declared to be void and \nunenforceable.\n    (e) Congressional Action; Notice.--\n            (1) Termination for convenience.--The Administrator may not \n        initiate termination for the convenience of the Government of a \n        prime contract on a covered program unless such program \n        termination is authorized or required by a law enacted after \n        the date of enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Termination for cause.--The Administrator shall notify \n        the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of \n        Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n        Transportation of the Senate before initiating termination for \n        cause of a prime contract on a covered program.\n    (f) Supplemental Appropriation Request.--\n            (1) Request.--If the Administrator decides to terminate a \n        prime contract on a covered program, and sufficient unobligated \n        appropriations are not available to cover termination liability \n        costs in the appropriations account that is funding the prime \n        contract being terminated, the Administrator shall provide to \n        Congress a notification that an authorization of appropriations \n        is necessary not later than 120 days in advance of the proposed \n        contract settlement for the covered program.\n            (2) Intent of congress.--It is the intent of Congress to \n        provide additional authorization for appropriations as may be \n        necessary to pay termination liability costs on prime contracts \n        for covered programs if Congress deems it appropriate that the \n        Administration terminate such prime contracts.\n\nSEC. 3. REPORTING.\n\n    Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \nand every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the prime contracts \non covered programs, the Administrator shall transmit to the Committee \non Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a \nreport that provides--\n            (1) the estimated termination liability costs for each of \n        the prime contracts; and\n            (2) the basis for how such estimate was determined.\n\nSEC. 4.
