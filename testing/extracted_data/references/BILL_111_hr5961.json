FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Numerous studies and reports, including the annual \n        National Healthcare Disparities Report and Unequal Treatment, \n        the 2002 Institute of Medicine Report, document the \n        extensiveness to which vulnerable populations suffer from \n        health disparities across the country.\n            (2) These studies have found that, on average, racial and \n        ethnic minorities and low-income populations are \n        disproportionately afflicted with chronic and acute conditions \n        such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension and suffer \n        worse health outcomes, worse health status, and higher \n        mortality rates.\n            (3) Several recent studies also show that health and \n        healthcare quality are a function of not only access to \n        healthcare, but also the social determinants of health, \n        including the environment, the physical structure of \n        communities, socio-economic status, nutrition, educational \n        attainment, employment, race, ethnicity, geography, and \n        language preference, that directly and indirectly affect the \n        health, healthcare, and wellness of individuals and \n        communities.\n            (4) Formally integrating medical and legal professionals in \n        the health setting can more effectively address the health \n        needs of vulnerable populations and ultimately reduce health \n        disparities.\n            (5) All over the United States, healthcare providers who \n        take care of low-income individuals and families are partnering \n        with legal professionals to assist them in providing better \n        quality of healthcare.\n            (6) Medical-legal partnerships integrate lawyers in a \n        health setting to help patients navigate the complex \n        government, legal, and service systems in addressing social \n        determinants of health, such as income supports for food \n        insecure families and mold removal from the home of asthmatics.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) support and advance opportunity for medical-legal \n        partnerships to be more fully integrated in healthcare settings \n        nationwide;\n            (2) to improve the quality of care for vulnerable \n        populations by reducing health disparities among health \n        disparities populations and addressing the social determinants \n        of health; and\n            (3) identify and develop cost-effective strategies that \n        will improve patient outcomes and realize savings for \n        healthcare systems.\n\nSEC. 3.
