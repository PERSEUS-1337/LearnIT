FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) there are sufficient neuroscientific data to document \n        that many severe ``mental'' illnesses are actually physical \n        illnesses known as neurobiological disorders that are \n        characterized by significant neuroanatomical and neurochemical \n        abnormalities;\n            (2) American families should have adequate health insurance \n        protection for the costs of treating neurobiological disorders \n        that is commensurate with the protections provided for other \n        illnesses;\n            (3) currently, many public and private health insurance \n        programs discriminate against persons with neurobiological \n        disorders by providing more restrictive coverage for treatments \n        of those illnesses in comparison to coverage provided for \n        treatments of other medical problems;\n            (4) unequal health insurance coverage contributes to the \n        destructive and unfair stigmatization of persons with \n        neurobiological disorders that are as beyond the control of the \n        individuals as are cancer, diabetes, and other serious physical \n        health problems;\n            (5) about 95 percent of what is known about both normal and \n        abnormal structure and function of the brain has been learned \n        in the last 10 years, but millions of severely mentally ill \n        people have yet to benefit from these startling research \n        advances in clinical and basic neuroscience; and\n            (6) according to the National Institutes of Mental Health, \n        equitable insurance coverage for severe mental disorders will \n        yield $2.2 billion annually in net savings through decreased \n        use of general medical services and a substantial decrease in \n        social costs.\n\nSEC. 3. STANDARDS FOR NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT OF NEUROBIOLOGICAL \n              DISORDERS FOR EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The standards for the nondiscriminatory and \nequitable treatment by employer health benefit plans of individuals \nwith neurobiological disorders are requirements that such plans (and \ncarriers offering such plans) provide for coverage of services that are \nessential to the effective treatment of neurobiological disorders in a \nmanner that--\n            (1) is not more restrictive than coverage provided for \n        other major physical illnesses;\n            (2) provides adequate financial protection to the person \n        requiring the medical treatment for a neurobiological disorder; \n        and\n            (3) is consistent with effective and common methods of \n        controlling health care costs for other major physical \n        illnesses.\n    (b) Plan Deemed to Meet Standards.--An employer health benefit plan \nshall be deemed to meet the standards described in subsection (a) if \nthe plan provides for the following:\n            (1) Stop-loss protection for catastrophic expenses.\n            (2) Coverage of facility-based care.\n            (3) Coverage of outpatient medical management on a par with \n        other medical procedures to encourage the use of cost-effective \n        ambulatory treatment, including treatment in non-traditional \n        settings.\n            (4) Coverage of visits for psychological supportive, \n        therapeutic, and rehabilitative services, with coinsurance and \n        fees set to ensure effective cost control of high demand \n        services.\n            (5) Coverage of prescription drugs essential to the cost \n        effective treatment of neurobiological disorders.\n            (6) Coverage of medically necessary services for \n        comorbidity of other disorders.\n\nSEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT THROUGH EXCISE TAX.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n(relating to qualified pension, etc., plans) is amended by adding at \nthe end thereof the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 4980C.
