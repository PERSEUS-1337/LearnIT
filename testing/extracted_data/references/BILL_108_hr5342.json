FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the highest national security interests of the \n        United States to ensure secure access to reliable energy \n        sources.\n            (2) The United States relies heavily upon the foreign \n        supply of crude oil to meet its energy needs, currently \n        importing 58 percent of its total oil requirements, of which 45 \n        percent comes from member states of the Organization of \n        Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n            (3) Revenues from the sale of oil by some of these \n        countries directly or indirectly provide funding for terrorism \n        and propaganda hostile to the United States and Western values.\n            (4) In the past, these countries have manipulated the \n        dependence of the United States on their oil supplies to exert \n        undue influence upon United States policy, as during OPEC's \n        1973 embargo on the sale of oil to the United States, which \n        became a major factor in the ensuing recession.\n            (5) Research by the Energy Information Administration of \n        the Department of Energy has shown that the dependence of the \n        United States on foreign oil will increase by 33 percent over \n        the next 20 years.\n            (6) A rise in the price of imported oil sufficient to \n        increase gasoline prices by 10 cents per gallon at the pump \n        would result in an additional outflow of 18 billion dollars \n        from the United States to oil-exporting nations.\n            (7) For economic and national security reasons, the United \n        States should reduce, as soon as possible, its dependence on \n        nations that do not share its interests and values.\n            (8) The state of Israel has been a steadfast ally and a \n        close friend of the United States since its creation in 1948.\n            (9) Like the United States, Israel is a democracy which \n        holds civil rights and liberties in the highest regard and is a \n        proponent of the democratic values of peace, freedom, and \n        justice.\n            (10) Cooperation between the United Sates and Israel on \n        such projects as the development of the Arrow Missile has \n        resulted in mutual benefits to United States and Israeli \n        security.\n            (11) The special relationship between Israel and the United \n        States has been and continues to be manifested in a variety of \n        jointly-funded cooperative programs in the field of scientific \n        research and development, such as the United States-Israel \n        Binational Science Foundations (BSF), the United States-Israel \n        Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD), \n        and the United States-Israel Binational Industrial Research and \n        Development (BIRD) Foundation.\n            (12) These programs, supported by the matching \n        contributions from the Government of Israel and the Government \n        of the United States and directed by key scientists and \n        academics from both countries, have made possible many \n        scientific breakthroughs in the fields of life sciences, \n        medicine, bioengineering, agriculture, biotechnology, \n        communications, and others.\n            (13) Israeli scientists and researchers have long been at \n        the forefront of research and development in the field of \n        alternative renewable energy sources.\n            (14) Many of the world's top corporations have recognized \n        Israel's technological and scientific expertise by locating \n        important research and development facilities in Israel.\n            (15) Among the technological breakthroughs made by Israeli \n        scientists and researchers in the field of alternative, \n        renewable energy sources are the development of a cathode that \n        uses hexavalent iron salts which accept 3 electrons per ion and \n        enable rechargeable batteries to provide 3 times as much \n        electricity as they currently do, the development of a \n        technique that vastly increases the efficiency of utilizing \n        solar energy to generate hydrogen for use in energy cells, and \n        the development of a novel membrane utilized in new and \n        powerful direct-oxidant fuel cells which is capable of \n        competing favorably with hydrogen fuel cells and traditional \n        internal combustion engines.\n            (16) Cooperation between the United States and Israel in \n        the field of research and development of alternative renewable \n        energy sources would be in the interests of both countries, and \n        both countries stand to gain much from such cooperation.\n\nSEC. 3.
