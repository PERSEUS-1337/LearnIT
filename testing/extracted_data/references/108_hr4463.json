    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Depleted Uranium Screeing and \nTesting Act of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEPLETED URANIUM RISK NOTIFICATION FOR DEPLOYING FORCES.\n\n    (a) Notification.-- The Secretary of Defense shall establish \nprocedures to require that, as part of the procedures for preparing \nmembers of the Armed Forces for deployment to a theater of operations, \nthat such members be notified of--\n            (1) any known or likely use of depleted uranium in that \n        theater of operations (whether by forces of the United States \n        and its allies or by any opposing forces); and\n            (2) any health risks associated with exposure to depleted \n        uranium.\n    (b) Training.--The Secretary shall provide for training deploying \nforces on how to handle depleted uranium before deploying them to a \ntheater in which depleted uranium is used.\n\nSEC. 3. DEPLETED URANIUM SCREENING AND TESTING.\n\n    (a) Identification and Testing Required.--The Secretary of Defense \nshall carry out a program to identify individuals who during active \nservice in the Armed Forces are or have been exposed to depleted \nuranium and to provide those individuals with bioassay testing and \nnotification of the results of such testing.\n    (b) Du-Exposed Personnel Identification Methods.--(1) The Secretary \nof each military department shall establish procedures to identify \nmembers of the Armed Forces under the Secretary's jurisdiction who are, \nor may have been, exposed to depleted uranium. For such purpose, the \nSecretary shall identify units and members under paragraph (2) and \nshall accept self-identification reports by members under paragraph \n(3).\n    (2) The Secretary of each military department shall identify units, \nand personnel assigned to units, that have been, or could have been, \nexposed to depleted uranium, based upon information about known \nexposure events (as determined under subsection (c)).\n    (3) The Secretary of each military department shall accept a report \nby an individual that the individual, while a member of the Armed \nForces under the Secretary's jurisdiction, was, or may have been, \nexposed to depleted uranium based upon service on active duty (or \ntraining duty or funeral honors duty) in a theater of operations where \ndepleted uranium was used, including travel through such an area. The \nSecretary shall prescribe procedures for receiving such reports.\n    (4) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary of each military \ndepartment shall ensure that individuals no longer on active duty \n(including members of the reserve components who have been released \nfrom active duty, members who have been retired, and members who have \nbeen separated from service) are treated, for identification purposes, \nin the same manner as individuals remaining on active duty.\n    (c) Exposure Events.--The Secretary of Defense shall identify \ndepleted uranium exposure events for purposes of this section. The \nexposure events identified shall include the following:\n            (1) An event in which an individual--\n                    (A) is struck by depleted uranium munitions or \n                depleted uranium armor fragments;\n                    (B) is within 50 meters of a vehicle or structure \n                containing or equipped with depleted uranium cargo or \n                components (such as aircraft counterweights and \n                helicopter rotor tips) at a time that the vehicle or \n                structure was struck, exploded, burned, or crashed; or\n                    (C) while acting as a first responder to an event \n                described in subparagraph (B), enters within 50 meters \n                of the vehicle or structure to render aid.\n            (2) An event in which an individual--\n                    (A) enters a vehicle or structure with possible \n                depleted uranium residues in order to perform \n                maintenance, recovery, intelligence, or battle damage \n                assessment; or\n                    (B) breathes smoke from fires involving depleted \n                uranium materials.\n            (3) An event in which an individual may inhale depleted \n        uranium particulates as a result of the handling of depleted \n        uranium contaminated equipment or wreckage or exposure to \n        particulate residues as part of maintenance duties (including \n        duties as a welder or ammunition handler or duties involving \n        cleanup or processing of depleted uranium contaminated \n        equipment).\n            (4) Other incidental exposures identified by the Secretary, \n        including the performance of activities in the area of depleted \n        uranium damaged vehicles or structures or the traveling through \n        or residing in any such area.\nIn addition to exposure events described in paragraphs (1) through (4) \noccurring on or after the the date of the enactment of this Act, such \nevents during the period between January 1, 2003, and the date of the \nenactment of this Act may be considered for purposes of this section, \nbut only if reported during the 60-day period beginning on the date of \nthe enactment of this Act.\n    (d) Health-Care Services Required.--(1) Any individual identified \nunder subsection (b) shall be provided a health screening test by the \nSecretary of Defense.
