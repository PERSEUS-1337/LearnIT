FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Horses have played a significant role in the history \n        and culture of the United States.\n            (2) Horses in the United States are not raised for food or \n        fiber.\n            (3) As a non-food and recreational animal, horses should be \n        protected from slaughter.\n            (4) The foreign-owned horse slaughter industry has \n        slaughtered and exported for human consumption over 3 million \n        American horses in the last 2 decades.\n            (5) Approximately 55,000 American horses are slaughtered \n        for human consumption annually in the United States by foreign-\n        owned slaughterhouses. Tens of thousands of live horses are \n        exported from the United States annually for slaughter.\n            (6) Horses slaughtered in these foreign-owned plants in the \n        United States have often been hauled several thousand miles \n        over several days, contrary to acceptable non-slaughter \n        standards for water, food, and rest.\n            (7) Many horses shipped to slaughter are young, healthy \n        animals. Others are old, sick, blind, crippled and in otherwise \n        poor condition and are unfit to withstand the rigors of long \n        travel. Horses sent to be slaughtered are often shipped on \n        crowded double deck trucks designed for shorter necked species \n        such as pigs, cattle and sheep, and are forced to travel in a \n        bent position which can result in suffering, injury and death.\n            (8) Killing of horses by foreign-owned slaughterhouses in \n        the United States contrasts with the preferable method of \n        killing by chemical euthanasia.\n            (9) Horses endure repeated blows to the head with stunning \n        equipment that often does not render the animals unconscious. \n        Some horses proceed still conscious through the remaining \n        stages of slaughter being bled out and dismembered.\n            (10) Because horses in America are not food animals, \n        veterinarians commonly prescribe and treat horses with potent \n        drugs that may reside in the horseflesh and be dangerous when \n        consumed by humans.\n            (11) Because of the lack of disclosure on the part of the \n        agents and dealers for the slaughter plants people's horses are \n        many times acquired and slaughtered through fraud and \n        misrepresentation. Slaughter also provides a quick and \n        evidence-free outlet for stolen horses.\n            (12) The imposition of a ban on the sale of horseflesh for \n        human consumption, regardless of its source, is consistent with \n        the international obligations of the United States because it \n        applies equally to domestic and foreign producers and avoids \n        any discrimination among foreign sources of competing products. \n        Such a ban is also consistent with provisions of international \n        agreements to which the United States is a party that expressly \n        allow for measures designed to protect the health and welfare \n        of animals and to enjoin the use of deceptive trade practices \n        in international or domestic commerce.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n     The purpose of this Act is --\n            (1) to prohibit the slaughter of horses for human \n        consumption;\n            (2) to prohibit the sale, possession, and trade of \n        horseflesh for human consumption;\n            (3) to prohibit the sale, possession, and trade of live \n        horses for slaughter for human consumption.\n\nSEC. 4.
