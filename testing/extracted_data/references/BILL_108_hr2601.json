FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The copyright clause, as set forth in article I, \n        section 8 of the United States Constitution, grants Congress \n        the power to ``promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, \n        by securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive \n        Right to their respective Writings . . .''.\n            (2) The copyright clause serves two purposes. First, it \n        gives authors an economic incentive to create new works. ``By \n        establishing a marketable right to the use of one's expression, \n        copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and \n        disseminate ideas.'' Harper & Row Publications, Inc. v. Nation \n        Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 558 (1985). Second, it promotes \n        society's interest in the ``free flow of ideas, information and \n        commerce.'' Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 \n        U.S. 417, 429 (1984). ``The copyright term is limited so that \n        the public will not be permanently deprived of the fruits of an \n        artist's labors.'' Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 228 (1990).\n            (3) Both commercial and noncommercial creators depend on a \n        healthy public domain. For example, book publishers print \n        titles from the public domain and make them available to the \n        public at reduced prices. See Edward Rappaport, CRS Report for \n        Congress, Copyright Term Extension: Estimating the Economic \n        Values, 3 (May 11, 1998). Others depend on the public domain as \n        a source of raw material for new productions, such as a movie \n        based on an old book or a theme song based on old musical \n        arrangements. Id. Schools, museums, and libraries use works in \n        the public domain to create pictorial and textual materials for \n        educational and cultural purposes. Id. at 4. In addition, media \n        sources like the World Wide Web benefit from the freedom of \n        public domain content, such as historical materials placed on \n        the Web by the Library of Congress. Id.\n            (4) Current law continues to grant copyright protection to \n        works published as early as 1923. See 17 U.S.C. 304. Yet the \n        vast majority of older works are no longer commercially \n        available. One study indicates that only 2 percent of works \n        between 55 and 75 years old continue to retain commercial \n        value. Eldred v. Ashcroft, 123 S. Ct. 769, 804 (2003) (Breyer, \n        J., dissenting). Nevertheless, under current law, these \n        abandoned works will not enter the public domain for many \n        years. This prevents commercial and noncommercial entities from \n        building upon, cultivating, and preserving abandoned works. \n        Indeed, while older works are less likely to retain commercial \n        value, they are more likely to ``prove useful to the historian, \n        artist, or teacher.'' Eldred v. Ashcroft, 123 S. Ct. 769, 805 \n        (2003) (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n            (5) Thus, the existing copyright system functions contrary \n        to the intent of the Framers of the Constitution in adopting \n        the copyright clause and the intent of Congress in enacting the \n        Copyright Act. Neither is intended to deprive the public of \n        works when there is no commercial or copyright purpose behind \n        their continued protection. It is, therefore, necessary to \n        establish a mechanism by which abandoned American copyrights \n        can enter the public domain.\n\nSEC. 3.
