The verification shall include the name, address, date of hire, and employment occupation classification of each eligible grocery worker.\n2506.\n(a) A successor grocery employer shall retain each eligible grocery worker hired pursuant to this part for at least 90 days after the eligible grocery worker\u2019s employment commencement date. During this 90-day transition employment period, eligible grocery workers shall be employed under the terms and conditions established by the successor grocery employer and pursuant to the terms of a relevant collective bargaining agreement, if any.\n(b) If, within the period established in subdivision (b) of Section 2504, the successor grocery employer determines that it requires fewer eligible grocery workers than were required by the incumbent grocery employer, the successor grocery employer shall retain eligible grocery workers by seniority within each job classification to the extent that comparable job classifications exist or pursuant to the terms of a relevant collective bargaining agreement, if any. Nonclassified eligible grocery workers shall be retained by seniority and according to experience or pursuant to the terms of a relevant collective bargaining agreement, if any.\n(c) During the 90-day transition employment period, the successor grocery employer shall not discharge without cause an eligible grocery worker retained pursuant to this part.\n(d) At the end of the 90-day transition employment period, the successor grocery employer shall make a written performance evaluation for each eligible grocery worker retained pursuant to this part.

If any provision of this part or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application."
