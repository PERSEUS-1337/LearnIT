PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to restore the role of Federal Pell \nGrants as the foundational Federal investment in higher education, in \norder to strengthen the economy of the United States by improving \nopportunities for low-income students to complete higher education and \njoin the middle class.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal Pell Grants provided under section 401 of the \n        Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) (referred to in \n        this Act as ``Federal Pell Grants'') have historically been the \n        fundamental Federal investment in helping low-income students \n        pay for college and enter the middle class. In the 1979-1980 \n        academic year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant paid for 77 \n        percent of the average cost of attendance at an in-State, 4-\n        year institution of higher education. However, in the 2012-2013 \n        academic year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant covered only \n        about 30 percent of that average cost of attendance.\n            (2) The program providing Federal Pell Grants already acts \n        as a quasi-entitlement, in which both mandatory funding and \n        discretionary funding combine to maintain a maximum Federal \n        Pell Grant amount.\n            (3) The Congressional Budget Office reports on any overall \n        financial surplus or shortfall in the funding provided for the \n        Federal Pell Grant program. However, in recent years, in order \n        to meet the maximum Federal Pell Grant level with the provided \n        level of funding, Congress has made cuts to the program through \n        imposing additional eligibility requirements for Federal Pell \n        Grants and limiting the availability of year-round Federal Pell \n        Grants, causing significant uncertainty and reducing access to \n        higher education for millions of hardworking college students.\n            (4) Removing the Federal Pell Grant program from the \n        uncertainty of the congressional discretionary appropriations \n        process will improve student access to, and the affordability \n        of, higher education.\n            (5) The ``traditional student'' who attends college for 4 \n        years immediately after high school is now a minority of \n        college students today. Ambitious students now need more \n        flexibility to attend school year-round while juggling work \n        schedules.\n            (6) Section 1860 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year \n        Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10, 125 \n        Stat. 169) eliminated the provision of the Federal Pell Grant \n        program of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a et \n        seq.) that allowed 2 Federal Pell Grant awards per year, \n        creating significant hardship for many students trying to take \n        courses over the summer or outside the traditional school \n        calendar. Allowing students to continue to receive Federal Pell \n        Grants in successive semesters, without a gap, would reduce the \n        time needed to complete their degrees.\n\nSEC. 4.
