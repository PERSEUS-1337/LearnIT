SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``PAC Elimination \nAct''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress now faces a crisis of public confidence about \n        its ability to conduct the people's business.\n            (2) Members of Congress, their relatives, lobbyists, \n        insider-controlled nonprofit organizations, and interest groups \n        have been accused of acting surreptitiously and in concert to \n        enrich themselves at the expense of the public.\n            (3) A government of the people, by the people, and for the \n        people cannot be a government where influence is purchasable.\n            (4) Political action committees in particular represent a \n        narrow fraction of the public viewpoint and generally have few \n        ties, if any, to the State or district from which the member of \n        Congress is elected.\n            (5) The primary recipients of PAC contributions are \n        incumbents, particularly the most powerful members of Congress.\n            (6) The public objects to the establishment of a new \n        political class, a privileged group with perks, amenities, and \n        job security unavailable to average Americans. The public also \n        objects to tilting the electoral landscape to the advantage of \n        a few.\n            (7) If Congress fails to respond appropriately to limit the \n        costs of elections and the perks of power, it will become a \n        legislative body in which the small businessman, the farmer, \n        the day laborer, and the stay-at-home parent are only \n        secondarily represented.\n            (8) Campaign finance reform is the unfinished business of a \n        Congress in disrepute.\n\nSEC. 2. BAN ON ACTIVITIES OF POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES IN FEDERAL \n              ELECTIONS.\n\n    (a) Ban on PACs.--\n            (1) In general.--Title III of the Federal Election Campaign \n        Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) is amended by adding at the \n        end the following new section:\n\n           ``ban on activities of political action committees\n\n    ``Sec. 325.
