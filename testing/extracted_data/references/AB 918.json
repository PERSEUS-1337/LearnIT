    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The President\u2019s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) reported that the use of behavioral restraint and seclusion poses significant risks for adults and children, including serious injury or death, retraumatizing people with a

residential and other long-term care facilities and acute psychiatric hospitals serving individuals with developmental disabilities is not publicly reported.\n(c) One of the best methods to achieve the goal of a reduction in the use of restraint is to ensure consistent data collection and analysis and public access to this data.\n(d) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to ensure that data regarding the use of restraint in community residential and other long-term care facilities and acute psychiatric hospitals is publicly available as a means of ensuring quality services to individuals with developmental disabilities and a reduction in the use of restraint.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 4436.5 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:\n4436.5.\n(a) For the
