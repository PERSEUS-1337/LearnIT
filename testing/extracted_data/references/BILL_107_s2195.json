FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to a 1996 study conducted by the American \n        School & University, $10,420,000,000 was spent to address the \n        Nation's education infrastructure needs in 1995, with the \n        average total cost of a new high school at $15,400,000.\n            (2) According to the National Center for Education \n        Statistics, an estimated $127,000,000,000 in repairs, \n        renovations, and modernizations is needed to put schools in the \n        United States into good overall condition.\n            (3) Approximately 14,000,000 American students attend \n        schools that report the need for extensive repair or \n        replacement of 1 or more buildings.\n            (4) Academic research has proven that there is a direct \n        correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n        student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n        found that students assigned to schools in poor conditions can \n        be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points behind those in \n        buildings in excellent condition. Similar studies have \n        demonstrated improvement of up to 20 percent in test scores \n        when students were moved from a poor facility to a new \n        facility.\n            (5) The Director of Education and Employment Issues at the \n        Government Accounting Office testified that nearly 52 percent \n        of schools, affecting 21,300,000 students, reported \n        insufficient technology elements for 6 or more areas.\n            (6) Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n        difficulties securing financing for school facility \n        improvement.\n            (7) The challenges facing our Nation's public elementary \n        schools and secondary schools and libraries require the \n        concerted efforts of all levels of government and all sectors \n        of the community.\n            (8) The United States competitive position within the world \n        economy is vulnerable if America's future workforce continues \n        to be educated in schools and libraries not equipped for the \n        21st century.\n            (9) The deplorable state of collections in America's public \n        school libraries has increased the demands on public libraries. \n        In many instances, public libraries substitute for school \n        libraries, creating a higher demand for material and physical \n        space to house literature and educational computer equipment.\n            (10) Research shows that 50 percent of a child's \n        intellectual development takes place before age 4. The Nation's \n        public and school libraries play a critical role in a child's \n        early development because the libraries provide a wealth of \n        books and other resources that can give every child a head \n        start on life and learning.\n\nSEC. 3. STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--\n            (1) Cooperative agreements.--The Secretary of Education \n        (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary''), in \n        consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, may enter into \n        cooperative agreements with States under which--\n                    (A) States establish State infrastructure banks and \n                multistate infrastructure banks for the purpose of \n                providing the loans described in subparagraph (B);

and\n                            (ii) to public libraries to enable the \n                        libraries to build or repair library \n                        facilities.\n            (2) Interstate compacts.--\n                    (A) Consent.--Congress grants consent to any 2 or \n                more States, entering into a cooperative agreement \n                under paragraph (1) with the Secretary for the \n                establishment of a multistate infrastructure bank, to \n                enter into an interstate  compact establishing a \nmultistate infrastructure bank in accordance with this section.\n                    (B) Reservation of rights.--Congress expressly \n                reserves the right to alter, amend, or repeal this \n                section and any interstate compact entered into \n                pursuant to this section.\n    (b) Repayments.--Each infrastructure bank established under \nsubsection (a) shall apply repayments of principal and interest on \nloans funded by the grant received under subsection (a) to the making \nof additional loans.\n    (c) Infrastructure Bank Requirements.--A State establishing an \ninfrastructure bank under this section shall--\n            (1) contribute in each account of the bank from non-Federal \n        sources an amount equal to not less than 25 percent of the \n        amount of each capitalization grant made to the bank under \n        subsection (a);\n            (2) identify an operating entity of the State as recipient \n        of the grant if the entity has the capacity to manage loan \n        funds and issue debt instruments of the State for purposes of \n        leveraging the funds;\n            (3) allow such funds to be used as reserve for debt issued \n        by the State, so long as proceeds are deposited in the fund for \n        loan purposes;\n            (4) ensure that investment income generated by funds \n        contributed to an account of the bank will be--\n                    (A) credited to the account;\n                    (B) available for use in providing loans to \n                projects eligible for assistance from the account;
