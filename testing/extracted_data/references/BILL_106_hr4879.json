FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Army Corps of Engineers is the primary Federal \n        agency responsible for developing and managing the Nation's \n        harbors, waterways, shorelines, and water resources.\n            (2) Scarce Federal resources require more efficient use of \n        Corps of Engineers funding and greater oversight of Corps of \n        Engineers analyses.\n            (3) Demand for recreation, clean water, and healthy \n        wildlife habitat must be reflected in the Corps of Engineers \n        project planning process.\n            (4) The social and environmental impacts of dams, levees, \n        shoreline stabilization structures, and other projects must be \n        adequately mitigated.\n            (5) Affected interests must play a larger role in Corps of \n        Engineers project development.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To ensure that the Nation's water resources investments \n        are economically justified and enhance the environment.\n            (2) To provide independent review of Corps of Engineers \n        feasibility studies.\n            (3) To ensure that mitigation for Corps of Engineers \n        projects is successful and cost-effective.\n            (4) To enhance the involvement of affected interests in \n        Corps of Engineers feasibility studies.\n            (5) To revise Corps of Engineers planning principles to \n        meet the economic and environmental needs of riverside and \n        coastal communities.\n\nSEC. 3.
