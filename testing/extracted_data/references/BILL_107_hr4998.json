FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Prescription drug costs continue to rise, affecting all \n        people in the United States.\n            (2) Generic drugs are approved by the Food and Drug \n        Administration and offer a safe alternative to brand-name \n        drugs.\n            (3) Access to generic drugs upon expiration of valid \n        pharmaceutical patents can result in a cost-effective \n        alternative to brand-name drugs.\n            (4) The generic version of a drug often enters the market \n        at a cost that is 25 to 35 percent less than the cost of the \n        brand-name version of the drug, and after a few years typically \n        sells for about 50 percent of the cost of the brand-name \n        version.\n            (5) Enhancing competition between generic and brand-name \n        drug manufacturers can reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nSEC. 3. 180-DAY GENERIC DRUG EXCLUSIVITY FOR CERTAIN SUBSEQUENT \n              APPLICANTS.\n\n    Section 505(j)(5)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(21 U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(B)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (iv)--\n                    (A) by striking ``If the application'' and \n                inserting ``Subject to clause (v), if the \n                application''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``continuing'' and inserting \n                ``containing''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(v) If the application contains a certification described \n        in subclause (IV) of paragraph (2)(A)(vii) for a drug, the \n        Secretary shall treat the application as the first such \n        application submitted under this subsection for that drug if \n        every person that previously submitted an application \n        containing such a certification for that drug--\n                    ``(I) fails to market the drug within 60 days after \n                the Secretary approves the previously submitted \n                application;\n                    ``(II) withdraws the previously submitted \n                application;\n                    ``(III) changes, for any reason, the certification \n                in the previously submitted application to a \n                certification described in subclause (III) of paragraph \n                (2)(A)(vii);\n                    ``(IV) in a case in which, after the date on which \n                the previous application was submitted, new patent \n                information is submitted for the drug under subsection \n                (c)(2) for a patent for which certification is required \n                under subclause (IV) of paragraph (2)(A)(vii), fails to \n                challenge the patent that is the subject of the \n                information within 60 days after the date on which the \n                patent information is submitted; or\n                    ``(V) has engaged in conduct in violation of the \n                antitrust laws (as the term `antitrust laws' is defined \n                in subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton \n                Act (15 U.S.C. 12(a)), except that such term includes \n                section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \n                U.S.C. 45) to the extent such section 5 applies to \n                unfair methods of competition).''.\n\nSEC. 4.
