FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In exchange for a lump-sum payment from a lender, some \n        veterans are surrendering their rights to full future \n        compensation benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        by assigning those benefits to lenders.\n            (2) Despite language in section 5301 of title 38, United \n        States Code, that states that payments of veterans' benefits \n        from the Department of Veterans Affairs shall not be assignable \n        and shall be exempt from the claim of creditors, lenders are \n        entering into contracts with veterans that require the veteran \n        to either give access to their benefit monies to the lender or \n        pay the lender a percentage of their benefit payment each \n        month.\n            (3) The contracts for these credit transactions do not \n        disclose information that is required to be disclosed under the \n        Truth in Lending Act, including the amount financed, the \n        finance charge, and the annual percentage rate (APR). \n        Therefore, when signing the contract, the veteran cannot \n        accurately determine the cost of credit obtained by the \n        veteran.\n            (4) As a result, those transaction agreements are \n        detrimental to veterans as they are required to pay interest \n        rates ranging from 39 percent to 106 percent.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to clarify the definition \nof a veterans benefit assignment under section 5301 of title 38, United \nStates Code, in order to make illegal the credit transactions between \nveterans and lenders in which the veteran gives the lender access to \nbenefits payments either through an account or by the guaranteeing of \nmonthly payments.\n\nSEC. 3. APPLICABILITY OF PROHIBITION ON ASSIGNMENT OF VETERANS BENEFITS \n              TO AGREEMENTS ON FUTURE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN BENEFITS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 5301(a) of title 38, United States Code, \nis amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)'';\n            (2) by designating the last sentence as paragraph (2); and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(3)(A) For the purposes of this subsection, an agreement \ndescribed in subparagraph (D) shall be deemed to be an assignment and \nis prohibited.\n    ``(B) An agreement or arrangement for collateral for security for \nan agreement that is prohibited under subparagraph (A) is also \nprohibited.\n    ``(C)(i) A person who enters into an agreement that is prohibited \nunder subparagraph (A), or into an agreement or arrangement that is \nprohibited under subparagraph (B), shall be fined under title 18, \nimprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n    ``(ii) This subparagraph does not apply to a beneficiary with \nrespect to compensation, pension, or disability and indemnity \ncompensation to which the beneficiary is entitled under a law \nadministered by the Secretary.\n    ``(D) An agreement described in this subparagraph is an agreement \nbetween a person who is a beneficiary entitled to compensation, \npension, or dependency and indemnity compensation and another person \nunder which such other person acquires for consideration the right to \nreceive payment of such compensation, pension, or dependency and \nindemnity compensation, as the case may be, whether by payment from the \nbeneficiary to such other person, deposit into an account from which \nsuch other person may make withdrawals, or otherwise.''.\n    (b) Effective Dates.--(1) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph \n(3) of section 5301(a) of title 38, United States Code (as added by \nsubsection (a) of this section), shall apply with respect to any \nagreement or arrangement described in those subparagraphs, whether \nentered into before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, and any such agreement or arrangement entered into before the date \nof the enactment of this Act is void and unenforceable as of such date.\n    (2) Subparagraph (C) of such paragraph shall apply with respect to \nany agreement or arrangement covered by such subparagraph that is \nentered into on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Outreach.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, during the \nfive-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, \ncarry out a program of outreach to inform veterans and other recipients \nor potential recipients of compensation, pension, or disability and \nindemnity compensation benefits under the laws administered by the \nSecretary of the prohibition on the assignability of such benefits \nunder law. The program shall include information on various schemes to \nevade the prohibition, and means of avoiding such schemes.\n    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is hereby authorized to \nbe appropriated for the Department of Veterans Affairs for each of \nfiscal years 2004 through 2008 the amount of $3,000,000 for purposes of \ncarrying out the program of outreach required by subsection (c)."
