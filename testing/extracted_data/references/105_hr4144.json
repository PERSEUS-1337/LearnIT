CUMBERLAND ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE AND CUMBERLAND ISLAND \n              WILDERNESS, GEORGIA.\n\n    (a) Boundary Adjustments for Land Exchange.--\n            (1) Exclusion of conveyed lands.--If the proposed land \n        exchange described in subsection (b) is agreed to by the \n        Secretary of the Interior, any lands to be conveyed by the \n        United States as part of the land exchange shall be excluded \n        from the boundaries of the Cumberland Island Wilderness or \n        potential wilderness area designated by section 2 of Public Law \n        97-250 (96 Stat. 709; 16 U.S.C. 1132 note).\n            (2) Inclusion of acquired lands.--All lands acquired by the \n        United States as part of the land exchange described in \n        subsection (b) shall be included in, and managed as part of, \n        the Cumberland Island Wilderness designated by section 2 of \n        Public Law 97-250 (96 Stat. 709; 16 U.S.C. 1132 note). Upon \n        acquisition of the lands, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n        adjust the boundaries of the Cumberland Island Wilderness to \n        include the acquired lands.\n    (b) Description of Land Exchange.--The land exchange referred to in \nsubsection (a) is a land exchange with regard to Cumberland Island \nNational Seashore, which is established under Public Law 92-536 (16 \nU.S.C. 459i et seq.), and Cumberland Island Wilderness that is being \nnegotiated by the Secretary of the Interior with the Nature Conservancy \nand High Point, Inc., for the purpose of acquiring privately owned \nlands on Cumberland Island, which have substantial wilderness \ncharacteristics, in exchange for Federal lands located at the north end \nof the island.\n    (c) Treatment of Main Road.--\n            (1) Findings.--The main road at Cumberland Island National \n        Seashore is included on the register of national historic \n        places.

The Secretary may also accept donations of money and \n        in-kind contributions for the purpose of restoring the mansion.\n            (2) Subsequent maintenance.--The Secretary of the Interior \n        shall endeavor to enter into an agreement with public and \n        private persons to provide for the maintenance of Plum Orchard \n        mansion following its restoration.\n            (3) Restoration plan.--Not later than 180 days after the \n        date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the \n        Interior shall submit to Congress a comprehensive plan for the \n        repair, stabilization, and restoration of Plum Orchard mansion \n        to the condition the mansion was in when acquired by the United \n        States.\n            (4) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n        to be appropriated such sums as are necessary for the \n        restoration of Plum Orchard mansion under paragraph (1).\n    (e) Archaeological and Historic Sites.--The Secretary of the \nInterior shall identify, document, and protect archaeological sites \nlocated on Federal land within Cumberland Island National Seashore.
