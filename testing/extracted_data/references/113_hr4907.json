FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The dignity, freedom, and equality of all human beings \n        are fundamental to a thriving global community.\n            (2) The rights to life, liberty, and security of the \n        person, the right to privacy, and the right to freedom of \n        expression and association are fundamental rights.\n            (3) An alarming trend of violence directed at LGBT \n        individuals around the world continues.\n            (4) More than one-third of all countries have laws \n        criminalizing consensual same-sex relations, and countries such \n        as Nigeria, Russia, Uganda, and Ukraine have recently \n        considered or passed legislation that would further target LGBT \n        individuals.\n            (5) Every year thousands of individuals around the world \n        are targeted for harassment, attack, arrest, and murder on the \n        basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n            (6) Those who commit crimes against LGBT individuals often \n        do so with impunity, and are not held accountable for their \n        crimes.\n            (7) Homophobic and transphobic statements by government \n        officials in many countries in every region of the world \n        promote negative public attitudes and can lead to violence \n        toward LGBT individuals.\n            (8) There are too many instances in which police, prison, \n        military, and civilian government authorities have been \n        directly complicit in abuses aimed at LGBT citizens, including \n        arbitrary arrest, torture, and sexual abuse.\n            (9) Celebrations of LGBT individuals and communities, such \n        as film festivals, Pride events, and demonstrations are often \n        forced underground due to inaction on the part of, or \n        harassment by, local law enforcement and government officials, \n        in violation of freedoms of assembly and expression.\n            (10) Laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations \n        severely hinder access to HIV/AIDS treatment, information, and \n        preventive measures for LGBT individuals and families.\n            (11) Many countries are making positive developments in the \n        protection of the basic human rights of LGBT individuals.\n\nSEC. 3.
