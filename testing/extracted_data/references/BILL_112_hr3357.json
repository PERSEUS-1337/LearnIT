FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Child marriage, also known as ``forced marriage'' or \n        ``early marriage'', is a harmful traditional practice that \n        deprives girls of their basic human rights.\n            (2) Child marriage as a traditional practice, as well as \n        through coercion or force, is a violation of article 16 of the \n        Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, ``Marriage \n        shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of \n        intending spouses.''.\n            (3) According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n        (UNICEF), an estimated 60,000,000 girls in developing countries \n        now ages 20 to 24 were married under the age of 18, and if \n        present trends continue, more than 100,000,000 more girls in \n        developing countries will be married as children over the next \n        decade, according to the Population Council.\n            (4) The rape, violent abuse, and physical exploitation of \n        young girls, at times as young as ten years old, are frequent \n        consequences of children forced into marriages in countries \n        such as Bangladesh where 57 percent of girls are married by age \n        15.\n            (5) Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, a \n        lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls, \n        parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within marriage, \n        the dowry system, and the perceived lack of value of girls.\n            (6) Child marriage has negative effects on girls' health, \n        including significantly increased risk of maternal death and \n        morbidity, obstetric fistula, sexually transmitted diseases, \n        including HIV/AIDS, and infant mortality and morbidity.\n            (7) Girls' schooling, creating safe community spaces for \n        girls, and programs for skills building for out-of-school girls \n        are all effective and evidence-based strategies for preventing \n        child marriage and creating a pathway to the empowerment of \n        girls by addressing conditions of poverty, low status, and \n        norms that contribute to child marriage.\n            (8) Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has stated \n        that, ``Stopping child marriage is not just a must for moral or \n        human rights reasons--it lays the foundation for so many other \n        things we hope to achieve. Primary education. Improved child \n        and maternal health. Sustainable economic development that \n        includes girls.''.\n\nSEC. 3. CHILD MARRIAGE DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``child marriage'' means the marriage of a \ngirl or boy, not yet the minimum age for marriage stipulated in law in \nthe country in which the girl or boy is a resident or, where there is \nno such law, under the age of 18.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) child marriage is a violation of human rights and the \n        prevention and elimination of child marriage should be a \n        foreign policy goal of the United States;\n            (2) the practice of child marriage undermines United States \n        investments in foreign assistance to promote education and \n        skills building for girls, reduce maternal and child mortality, \n        reduce maternal illness, halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS, \n        prevent gender-based violence, and reduce poverty; and\n            (3) educational opportunities for girls, economic \n        opportunities for women, and reducing maternal and child \n        mortality are critical to achieving the global health and \n        development objectives of the United States, including efforts \n        to prevent HIV/AIDS.\n\nSEC. 5.
