In the event that a court or agency of competent jurisdiction holds that federal law, rule, or regulation invalidates any clause, sentence, paragraph, or section of this code or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, it is the intent of the state that the court or agency sever that clause, sentence, paragraph, or section so that the remainder of this section shall remain in effect.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 10295.35 of the Public Contract Code shall not be construed to create any new enforcement authority or responsibility in the Department of General Services or any other contracting agency.\nSEC. 3.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
