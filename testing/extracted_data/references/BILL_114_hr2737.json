FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The First Philippine Republic was founded as a result \n        of the Spanish-American War in which Filipino revolutionaries \n        and the United States Armed Forces fought to overthrow Spanish \n        colonial rule. On June 12, 1898, Filipinos declared the \n        Philippines to be an independent and sovereign nation. The \n        Treaty of Paris negotiated between the United States and Spain \n        ignored this declaration of independence, and the United States \n        paid Spain $20,000,000 to cede control of the Philippines to \n        the United States. Filipino nationalists who sought \n        independence rather than a change in colonial rulers clashed \n        with forces of the United States in the Islands. The \n        Philippine-American War, which officially lasted for 3 years \n        from 1899 to 1902, led to the establishment of the United \n        States civil government in the Philippines.\n            (2) In 1901, units of Filipino soldiers who fought for the \n        United States against the nationalist insurrection were \n        formally incorporated into the United States Army as the \n        Philippine Scouts.\n            (3) In 1934, the Philippine Independence Act (Public Law \n        73-127; 48 Stat. 456) established a timetable for ending \n        colonial rule of the United States. Between 1934 and Philippine \n        independence in 1946, the United States retained sovereignty \n        over Philippine foreign policy and reserved the right to call \n        Filipinos into the service of the United States Armed Forces.\n            (4) On December 21 1935, President of the Philippine \n        Commonwealth, Manuel Quezon, signed the National Defense Act, \n        passed by the Philippine Assembly. General Douglas MacArthur \n        set upon the task of creating an independent army in the \n        Philippines, consisting of a small regular force, the \n        Philippine Constabulary, a police force created during the \n        colonial period of the United States, and reservists. By July \n        1941, the Philippine army had 130,000 reservists and 6,000 \n        officers.\n            (5) On July 26, 1941, as tensions with Japan rose in the \n        Pacific, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used his authority \n        vested in the Constitution of the United States and the \n        Philippine Independence Act to ``call into service of the \n        United States . . . all of the organized military forces of the \n        Government of the Philippines.'' On July 27th, 1941, in \n        accordance with a War Department directive received a day \n        earlier, the United States Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) was \n        established, and Manila was designated as the command \n        headquarters. Commander of the USAFFE, General Douglas \n        MacArthur, planned to absorb the entire Philippine army into \n        the USAFFE in phases. The first phase, which began on September \n        1, 1941, included 25,000 men and 4,000 officers.\n            (6) Filipinos who served in the USAFFE included--\n                    (A) the Philippine Scouts, who comprised half of \n                the 22,532 soldiers in the Philippine Department, or \n                United States Army garrison stationed in the Islands at \n                the start of the war;\n                    (B) the Philippine Commonwealth Army;\n                    (C) the new Philippine Scouts, or Filipinos who \n                volunteered to serve with the United States Army when \n                the United States Armed Forces returned to the island;\n                    (D) Filipino civilians who volunteered to serve in \n                the United States Armed Forces in 1945 and 1946, and \n                who became ``attached'' to various units of the United \n                States Army; and\n                    (E) the ``Guerrilla Services'' who had fought \n                behind enemy lines throughout the war.\n            (7) Even after hostilities ceased, wartime service of the \n        new Philippine Scouts continued as a matter of law until the \n        end of 1946, and the force gradually disbanded until it was \n        disestablished in 1950.\n            (8) On December 8th, 1941, not even 24 hours after the \n        bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese Imperial forces attacked \n        bases of the United States Army in the Philippines.\n            (9) In the spring of 1942, the Japanese 14th Army overran \n        the Bataan Peninsula, and, after a heroic but futile defense, \n        more than 78,000 members of the United States Armed Forces were \n        captured, specifically 66,000 Filipinos and 12,000 service \n        members from the United States. The Japanese transferred the \n        captured soldiers from Bataan to Camp O'Donnell, in what is now \n        known as the infamous Bataan Death March. Forced to march the \n        70-mile distance in 1 week, without adequate food, water, or \n        medicine, nearly 700 members of the United States Armed Forces \n        and an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 Filipinos perished during the \n        journey.\n            (10) After the fall of the Bataan Peninsula, the Japanese \n        Army turned its sights on Corregidor. The estimated forces in \n        defense of Corregidor totaled 13,000, and were comprised of \n        members of the United States Armed Forces and Filipino troops. \n        Of this number, 800 were killed, 1,000 were wounded, and 11,000 \n        were captured and forced to march through the city of Manila, \n        after which the captured troops were distributed to various POW \n        camps. The rest of the captured troops escaped to organize or \n        join an underground guerrilla army.\n            (11) Even before the fall of Corregidor, Philippine \n        resistance, in the form of guerrilla armies, began to wage \n        warfare on the Japanese invaders. Guerrilla armies, from \n        Northern Luzon to Mindanao--\n                    (A) raided Japanese camps, stealing weapons and \n                supplies;\n                    (B) sabotaged and ambushed Japanese troops on the \n                move; and\n                    (C) with little weaponry, and severely outmatched \n                in numbers, began to extract victories.\n            (12) Japanese intelligence reports reveal that from the \n        time the Japanese invaded until the return of the United States \n        Armed Forces in the summer of 1944, an estimated 300,000 \n        Filipinos continued to fight against Japanese forces. Filipino \n        resistance against the Japanese was so strong that, in 1942, \n        the Imperial Army formed the Morista Butai, a unit designated \n        to suppress guerrillas.\n            (13) Because Philippine guerrillas worked to restore \n        communication with United States forces in the Pacific, General \n        MacArthur was able to use the guerrillas in advance of a \n        conventional operation and provided the headquarters of General \n        MacArthur with valuable information. Guerrillas captured and \n        transmitted to the headquarters of General MacArthur Japanese \n        naval plans for the Central Pacific, including defense plans \n        for the Mariana Islands. Intelligence derived from guerrillas \n        relating to aircraft, ship, and troop movements allowed for \n        Allied forces to attack Japanese supply lines and guerrillas \n        and even directed United States submarines where to land agents \n        and cargo on the Philippine coast.\n            (14) On December 20, 1941, President Roosevelt signed the \n        Selective Training and Service Amendments Act (Public Law 77-\n        360; 55 Stat. 844) which, among other things, allowed Filipinos \n        in the United States to enlist in the United States Armed \n        Forces. In February 1942, President Roosevelt issued the Second \n        War Powers Act (Public Law 77-507; 56 Stat. 176), promising a \n        simplified naturalization process for Filipinos who served in \n        the United States Armed Forces. Subsequently, 16,000 Filipinos \n        in California alone decided to enlist.\n            (15) The mobilization of forces included the activation and \n        assumption of command of the First Filipino Infantry Battalion \n        on April 1, 1942, at Camp San Luis Obispo, California. Orders \n        were issued to activate the First Filipino Infantry Regiment \n        and Band at Salinas, California, effective July 13, 1942. The \n        activation of the Second Filipino Infantry Regiment occurred at \n        Fort Ord, California, on November 21, 1942. Nearly 9,000 \n        Filipinos and Filipino Americans fought in the United States \n        Army 1st and 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiments.\n            (16) Soldiers of the 1st and 2nd Infantry Regiments \n        participated in the bloody combat and mop-up operations at New \n        Guinea, Leyte, Samar, Luzon, and the Southern Philippines. In \n        1943, 800 men were selected from the 1st and 2nd Regiments and \n        shipped to Australia to receive training in intelligence \n        gathering, sabotage, and demolition. Reorganized as part of the \n        1st Reconnaissance Battalion, this group was sent to the \n        Philippines to coordinate with major guerrilla armies in the \n        Islands. Members of the 1st Regiment were also attached to the \n        United States 6th Army ``Alamo Scouts'', a reconnaissance group \n        that traveled 30 miles behind enemy lines to free Allied \n        prisoners from the Cabanatuan death camp on January 30, 1945. \n        In addition, in 1945, according to the 441st Counter \n        Intelligence Unit of the United States Armed Forces, Philippine \n        guerrillas provided ``very important information and sketches \n        of enemy positions and installations'' for the liberation of \n        the Santo Tomas prisoner of war camp, an event that made front \n        page news across the United States.\n            (17) In March 1944, members of the 2nd Filipino Infantry \n        Regiment were selected for special assignments, including \n        intelligence missions, and reorganized as the 2nd Filipino \n        Infantry Battalion (Separate). The 2nd Filipino Infantry \n        Battalion contributed to mop-up operations as a civil affairs \n        unit.\n            (18) Filipinos participated in the war out of national \n        pride, as well as out of a commitment to the Allied forces \n        struggle against fascism. 57,000 Filipinos in uniform died in \n        the war effort. Estimates of civilian deaths range from 700,000 \n        to upwards of 1,000,000, or between 4.38 to 6.25 percent of the \n        prewar population of 16,000,000.\n            (19) Because Filipinos who served in the Commonwealth Army \n        of the Philippines were originally considered a part of the \n        Allied struggle, the military order issued by President \n        Roosevelt on July 26, 1941, stated that Filipinos who served in \n        the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines were entitled to full \n        veterans benefits. The guarantee to pay back the service of \n        Filipinos through veterans benefits was reversed by the \n        Rescission Acts of 1946 (Public Laws 79-301 and 79-391; 60 \n        Stat. 6 and 60 Stat. 221), which deemed that the wartime \n        service of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines and the new \n        Philippine Scouts was not considered active and, therefore, did \n        not qualify for benefits.\n            (20) The loyal and valiant Filipino Veterans of World War \n        II fought, suffered, and, in many instances, died in the same \n        manner and under the same commander as other members of the \n        United States Armed Forces during World War II.\n            (21) The Filipino Veterans of World War II who have fought \n        alongside, and as an integral part of, the United States Armed \n        Forces. The Philippines remained a territory of the United \n        States for the duration of the war and, accordingly, the United \n        States maintained sovereignty over Philippine foreign \n        relations, including Philippine laws enacted by the Philippine \n        Government. Filipinos who fought in the Philippines were not \n        only defending or fighting for the Philippines, but also \n        defending and ultimately liberating sovereign territory held by \n        the United States Government.\n            (22) The United States remains forever indebted to the \n        bravery, valor, and dedication that the Filipino Veterans of \n        World War II displayed. Their commitment and sacrifice \n        demonstrates a highly uncommon and commendable sense of \n        patriotism and honor.\n\nSEC. 3.
