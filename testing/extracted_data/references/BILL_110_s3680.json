FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States and foreign countries will require \n        massive and increasing quantities of energy during the 20-year \n        period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act to \n        support economic growth;\n            (2) nuclear power provides energy without generating \n        unacceptable quantities of greenhouse gasses;\n            (3) the generation of nuclear power in the United States \n        and many foreign countries has been discouraged by concerns \n        regarding--\n                    (A) the proliferation of weapons-useable material; \n                and\n                    (B) the proper disposal of spent nuclear fuel;\n            (4) nuclear power plants operating on an advanced thorium \n        fuel cycle to generate nuclear energy--\n                    (A) could potentially produce fewer weapons-useable \n                materials than uranium-fueled plants; and\n                    (B) would produce less long-term waste as compared \n                to other nuclear power plants;\n            (5)(A) thorium is more abundant than uranium; and\n            (B) the United States possesses significant domestic \n        quantities of thorium to ensure energy independence;\n            (6)(A) thorium fuel cycle technology was originally \n        developed in the United States; and\n            (B) cutting-edge research relating to thorium fuel cycle \n        technology continues to be carried out by entities in the \n        United States; and\n            (7) it is in the national security and foreign policy \n        interest of the United States that foreign countries seeking to \n        establish or expand generation and use of nuclear power should \n        be provided--\n                    (A) access to advanced thorium fuel cycle \n                technology; and\n                    (B) incentives to reduce the risk of nuclear \n                proliferation.\n\nSEC. 3. THORIUM FUEL CYCLE NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION.\n\n    Chapter 19 of title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n2015 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 244 the following:\n\n``SEC. 251. THORIUM FUEL CYCLE NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Chairman.--The term `Chairman' means the Chairman of \n        the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n            ``(2) Office.--The term `Office' means an office \n        established under subsection (b)(1).\n            ``(3) Secretary.--The term `Secretary' means the Secretary \n        of Energy.\n    ``(b) Offices for Regulation of Thorium Fuel Cycle Nuclear Power \nGeneration.--\n            ``(1) Establishment.--The Secretary, in consultation with \n        the Chairman, shall establish, and provide funds to, an office \n        for the regulation of thorium fuel cycle nuclear power \n        generation in each of--\n                    ``(A) the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and \n                Technology of the Department of Energy; and\n                    ``(B) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n            ``(2) Regulations.--Not later than December 31, 2012, the \n        Chairman, in cooperation with the heads of the Offices, shall \n        promulgate regulations for facilities and materials used in \n        thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation.\n            ``(3) Demonstration projects.--The heads of the Offices, in \n        cooperation with the head of the Idaho National Engineering \n        Laboratory, shall carry out demonstration projects for thorium \n        fuel cycle nuclear power generation at the Idaho National \n        Engineering Laboratory.\n            ``(4) International partnerships and incentives.--The heads \n        of the Offices shall provide recommendations to the Secretary \n        with respect to methods of--\n                    ``(A) strengthening international partnerships to \n                advance nuclear nonproliferation through the design and \n                deployment of thorium fuel cycle nuclear power \n                generation; and\n                    ``(B) providing incentives to nuclear reactor \n                operators in the United States and foreign countries to \n                use proliferation-resistant, low-waste thorium fuels in \n                lieu of other fuels.\n    ``(c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthe Thorium Energy Independence and Security Act of 2008, and annually \nthereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing, \nwith respect to the preceding calendar year--\n            ``(1) progress made in implementing this section; and\n            ``(2) activities carried out by the Offices pursuant to \n        this section.\n    ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section $250,000,000 \nfor the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2013.''."
