FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to studies by the National Academy of \n        Engineering, there is a widespread interest in improving \n        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) \n        education in elementary and secondary schools.\n            (2) STEM education is important in part because it can \n        develop student interest and aptitude in subjects directly \n        relevant to the Nation's capacity for research and innovation. \n        This capacity is largely credited with supporting United States \n        economic health, national security, and quality of life.\n            (3) STEM education contributes to scientific and \n        technological literacy, important attributes for all citizens.\n            (4) Science is the intellectual and practical activity \n        encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior \n        of the physical and natural world through observation and \n        experiment.\n            (5) Engineering is the application of scientific and \n        mathematical principles to innovate, analyze, design, evaluate, \n        and manufacture machines, processes, and systems.\n            (6) The share of engineering education in the Federal STEM \n        education portfolio, according to a survey by the National \n        Science and Technology Council, is only 0.4 percent of the \n        nearly $3,500,000,000 annual expenditures.\n            (7) Available evidence suggests that pre-college \n        engineering education can stimulate interest and improve \n        learning in mathematics and science as well as improve \n        understanding of engineering and technology.\n            (8) Engineering education is a vital component in attaining \n        licensure as a professional engineer that requires rigorous \n        education, training, experience, and continuing education.\n            (9) According to the National Academy of Engineering there \n        is relatively limited experience with engineering education in \n        elementary and secondary schools.\n            (10) Some States have included engineering in their science \n        or technology and vocational standards, and many school \n        districts provide informal or after-school engineering \n        education.\n            (11) The Next Generation Science Standards developed by a \n        consortium of States, the National Science Teachers \n        Association, the American Association for the Advancement of \n        Science, the National Research Council, and Achieve has \n        identified content and science and engineering practices that \n        all students should learn from kindergarten to high school \n        graduation. States and local districts will have the \n        responsibility for providing more detailed guidance to \n        classroom teachers to help students learn the key ideas in the \n        standards.\n            (12) According to the National Academy of Engineering there \n        is not at present a critical mass of teachers qualified to \n        deliver engineering instruction.\n            (13) It is imperative that teachers have relevant \n        professional training that coordinates concepts in engineering \n        with the diverse learning styles of students.\n\nSEC. 3.
