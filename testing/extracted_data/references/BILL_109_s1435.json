FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An estimated 2,000,000 new teachers will be needed in \n        the United States over the next decade.\n            (2) Under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law \n        107-110), States shall ensure that all teachers teaching in \n        core academic subjects within the State are highly qualified \n        not later than the end of the 2005-2006 school year, yet \n        schools in rural areas and low-income schools have trouble \n        attracting and retaining such teachers.\n            (3) A 2000 study by the Education Trust reports that low-\n        income schools are twice as likely not to have teachers \n        certified in the fields in which they teach as schools that are \n        not low-income schools, which highlights that low-income \n        schools will need special help to meet the goals of the No \n        Child Left Behind Act of 2001.\n            (4) If the Nation is to improve student achievement and \n        success in school, the United States must encourage and support \n        the training and development of our Nation's teachers, who are \n        the single most important in-school influence on student \n        learning.\n            (5) Highly qualified teachers are more effective in \n        impacting student academic achievement because such teachers \n        have high verbal abilities, high content knowledge, and an \n        enhanced ability to know how to teach the content using \n        appropriate pedagogical strategies.\n            (6) The difference in annual student achievement growth \n        between having an effective and ineffective teacher can be more \n        than 1 grade level of achievement in academic performance.\n            (7) A study conducted by the New Teacher Project shows that \n        strategic recruitment may recruit qualified applicants but many \n        applicants withdraw from the process because of the late hiring \n        timelines found in urban schools.\n            (8) Every school day approximately 3,000 adolescents drop \n        out of secondary school.\n            (9) The national graduation rate is 68 percent with \n        approximately 540,000 students failing to graduate each year.\n            (10) As few as 53 percent of students from low-income \n        families graduate each year.\n            (11) American schools spend more than $2,600,000,000 \n        annually replacing teachers who have dropped out of the \n        teaching profession.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide grants to \nencourage secondary school students in low-income schools to graduate \nand pursue higher education and teaching.\n\nSEC. 3.
