FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) competition in telecommunications and cable services \n        will encourage infrastructure development, have beneficial \n        effects on the price, universal availability, variety and \n        quality of telecommunications services, and improve our \n        economy, our culture, and our political system;\n            (2) all telecommunications and information services markets \n        should be open to competition and all providers of \n        telecommunications services should be able to provide such \n        services and be subject to equivalent regulation when offering \n        such services;\n            (3) all providers of telecommunications and information \n        services should be subject to equivalent regulation;\n            (4) if all providers of telecommunications services do not \n        have the opportunity to provide all telecommunications and \n        information services, it would not be in the public interest to \n        remove barriers to entry to intrastate telecommunications \n        services such as telephone exchange service, intrastate \n        intraLATA telecommunications services, and telephone exchange \n        access services;\n            (5) when barriers to entry to intrastate telecommunications \n        services such as telephone exchange service, intrastate \n        intraLATA toll telecommunications services, and exchange access \n        services are removed, all restrictions on the lines of business \n        in which they may engage should be eliminated for existing \n        providers of these services;\n            (6) the elimination of the restraints on the lines of \n        business will result in the creation of a substantial number of \n        new jobs;\n            (7) if the removal of the restrictions on the lines of \n        business are delayed, the job creation resulting from the \n        removal of these constraints will also be delayed;\n            (8) advanced telecommunications services can enhance the \n        quality of life and promote economic development, job creation, \n        and international competitiveness;\n            (9) advancements in the nation's telecommunications \n        infrastructure will enhance the public welfare by helping to \n        speed the delivery of services such as telemedicine, distance \n        learning, remote medical services, and distribution of health \n        information;\n            (10) services such as telemedicine will promote the \n        provision of health care to all Americans and reduce the cost \n        of providing health care;\n            (11) improvements in the telecommunications infrastructure \n        will be greatly enhanced if all providers of telecommunications \n        services are permitted to offer these services on the same \n        basis and subject to equivalent regulatory requirements;\n            (12) rural and sparsely populated areas will not receive \n        the benefits of advanced telecommunications services unless all \n        providers of telecommunications services have eliminated the \n        restrictions on the lines of business in which they may engage;\n            (13) existing regulatory devices no longer work, and the \n        regulatory asymmetries that exist today are inconsistent with \n        competitive marketplaces; and\n            (14) oversight of the telecommunications industry should be \n        conducted from the perspective of the Antitrust Laws by the \n        Department of Justice and from the regulatory perspective by \n        the Commission for interstate telecommunications services and \n        the States for intrastate telecommunications services.\n\nSEC. 3.
