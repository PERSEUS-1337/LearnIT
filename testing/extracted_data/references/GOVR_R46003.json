    "content": "A majority of the population of the United States has private health insurance coverage (i.e., coverage not available through a public program, such as Medicare or Medicaid). In 2017, about 55% of the U.S. population had private group coverage (e.g., a health plan offered by an employer) and 13.5% had private individual coverage (e.g., a health plan offered through a health insurance exchange). In general, health plans sold in the private health insurance market must comply with state and federal health insurance requirements. The federal requirements relate to how coverage is offered and issued, the benefits it must cover, and how it is priced, among other issues. An example of a federal health insurance requirement is the prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions.  Although federal health insurance requirements generally apply to health plans sold in the private health insurance market, not all private health coverage arrangements comply with such requirements. This includes exempted health coverage arrangements and nonco mpliant health coverage arrangements , as termed for purposes of this report. This report identifies and describes arrangements within these two categories. The report is intended to help congressional policymakers better understand the scope of these health coverage arrangements that are available to individuals in the United States private health insurance markets and to provide information about the limitations of the application of federal health insurance requirements. The private health insurance market has different segments. Understanding these different segments is relevant to the application of state and federal health insurance requirements.  The individual health insurance market segment is where individuals and families buying insurance on their own (i.e., not through a plan sponsor) may purchase health plans. In the group health insurance market, a plan sponsor, typically an employer, offers coverage to a group (e.g., the employer's employees). The group market is divided into small- and large-group market segments. It is also categorized according to how the plan is insured. Group plans that are purchased by employers and other plan sponsors from state-licensed health insurance issuers and are offered to employees or other groups are referred to as fully insured plans. Employers or other plan sponsors that offer self - insur e d plans set aside funds to pay for health benefits directly, and they bear the risk of covering medical expenses generated by the individuals covered under the self-insured plan.  States are the primary regulators of the business of health insurance, as codified by the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act, and each state requires health insurance issuers to be licensed to sell plans in the state. Each state has a unique set of requirements that apply to state-licensed issuers and the plans they offer; these requirements are broad in scope and address a variety of issues, and often the requirements apply differently to the various market segments. In general, state oversight of health plans applies only to plans offered by state-licensed issuers. Because self-insured plans are financed directly by a plan sponsor, as opposed to a state-licensed insurer, such plans generally are not subject to state law.  The federal government also regulates state-licensed issuers and the plans they offer, as well as self-insured plans and their sponsors . Federal requirements can, but do not necessarily, apply uniformly to health plans offered in the aforementioned market segments\u00e2\u0080\u0094individual, small-group, and large-group markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to self-insured plans. For example, the requirement that plans cover preexisting health conditions applies uniformly; health plans offered in the individual, small-group, and large-group markets and self-insured plans must comply with the prohibition on excluding benefits based on health conditions for any individual. The requirement to cover a core package of 10 \"essential health benefits\" does not apply uniformly; it applies only to health plans offered in the individual and small-group markets. Federal health insurance requirements are codified in three statutes\u00e2\u0080\u0094Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), Part 7 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and Chapter 100 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). In general, federal standards establish a minimum level of requirements ( federal floor ) and states may impose additional requirements on issuers and the health plans they offer, provided the state requirements neither conflict with federal law nor prevent the implementation of federal health insurance requirements. Enforcement of the federal health insurance requirements generally involves both the federal and the state governments. States are the primary enforcers of private health insurance requirements, but the federal government assumes this responsibility if it is determined that a state has failed to \"substantially enforce\" the federal provisions, including if a state indicates that it lacks authority to enforce or is otherwise not taking enforcement actions. Some health coverage arrangements that consumers may purchase to help them pay for health care services do not comply with some or all of the federal health insurance requirements codified in Title XXVII of the PHSA, Part 7 of ERISA, and Chapter 100 of the IRC. This report focuses on such arrangements ( Table 1 ). The health coverage arrangements listed in Table 1 can be divided into two categories: 1. Exempted Health Coverage A rrangements : Those that meet a federal definition of health insurance but that are exempt from compliance with some or all applicable federal health insurance requirements. 2. Noncompliant Health Coverage A rrangements : Those that the federal government has not explicitly exempted from compliance with federal health insurance requirements and that do not necessarily comply with those requirements. The arrangements listed in Table 1 are summarized in the remainder of this report. Each summary includes a brief description of the arrangement, its status with respect to complying with federal health insurance requirements, and the history of its status. The summaries also include information about whether and how the arrangements are subject to state regulatory authority. Where available, estimates of enrollment in an arrangement are provided. The arrangements discussed in this section have the following in common: they meet a federal definition of health insurance (i.e., they meet the federal definition of health insurance coverage or group health plan), but they are exempt from compliance with some or all applicable federal health insurance requirements. For most of the arrangements discussed in this section, the exemption is explicit in federal statute, regulations, or guidance (see Table 1 ).  Both fully insured and self-insured group health plans covering fewer than two current employees are exempt from all federal health insurance requirements. This includes retiree-only plans , provided they cover fewer than two current employees. If retiree benefits are offered through the same plan offered to current employees (and there are two or more current employees enrolled in such plan), then the retiree benefits are not exempt from federal health insurance requirements.  The exemption was established in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; P.L. 104-191 ). HIPAA set forth parallel exemptions from federal health insurance requirements for group plans covering fewer than two current employees in Title XXVII of the PHSA, Part 7 of ERISA, and Chapter 100 of the IRC. After the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended) amended, reorganized, and renumbered Title XXVII of the PHSA, the exemption that had been in the PHSA ceased to exist. However, in the preamble to an interim final rule implementing ACA provisions related to grandfathered plans (see \" Grandfathered Plans \" in this report), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that it would not enforce HIPAA or ACA requirements with respect to group health plans covering fewer than two current employees, including retiree-only plans. HHS encouraged states not to enforce the requirements, either, and said the federal government would not cite states for failing to enforce in this situation. Given an Administration's authority to promulgate regulations and issue administrative guidance relating to federal health insurance standards, it is possible that an Administration may reconsider its position on enforcement, but no Administration has done so to date.  States may impose their own requirements on group health plans covering fewer than two current employees (including retiree-only plans), provided the plans are fully insured. States do not have the authority to regulate self-insured plans.  CRS did not find estimates of enrollment in group health plans covering fewer than two current employees.  In general, health plans in their provision of excepted benefits are exempt from all federal health insurance requirements. A diverse collection of insurance benefits can be considered excepted benefits, including auto liability insurance, limited-scope dental and vision benefits, benefits for long-term care, specific disease coverage, and supplemental Medicare plans (i.e., Medigap plans). Per federal statute, there are four categories of excepted benefits. One category is exempt from complying with all federal health insurance requirements in all circumstances; the other three categories are exempt from complying with all of the requirements only when specified conditions are met. (See Table 2 for details.) The exemption for excepted benefits and the conditions for exemption were established under HIPAA. HIPAA set forth parallel exemptions and conditions in Title XXVII of the PHSA, Part 7 of ERISA, and Chapter 100 of the IRC. Enactment of the ACA modified the PHSA exemption in such a way that some federal requirements would apply to excepted benefits under the PHSA. However, given that the ERISA and IRC exemptions for excepted benefits remained unchanged, HHS stated it would not enforce HIPAA or ACA requirements on excepted benefits and encouraged states not to enforce the requirements, either.  States may impose requirements on excepted benefits, provided the benefits are not self-insured.  CRS did not find estimates of enrollment in the various types of excepted benefit plans. Short-term, limited-duration insurance (STLDI) is defined as health insurance coverage provided pursuant to a contract with a health insurance issuer that meets the following standards: the contract for the coverage must have a specified expiration date that is less than 12 months after the original effective date of the contract and cannot last longer than 36 months, taking into account renewals or extensions, and the contract and application materials must display a notice as specified in federal regulations indicating that the coverage does not have to comply with federal requirements. Additionally, the 36-month maximum duration is severable from the rest of the definition, meaning the definition would be operative even if the 36-month maximum duration were challenged in court and found invalid or unenforceable. The federal definition of STLDI has changed twice since it was established. STLDI was first defined in regulations issued in 1997. The term was redefined in regulations issued in 2016, and again in regulations issued in 2018. (See Table 3 for details.) Although the definition of STLDI has changed, the applicability of federal health insurance requirements to STLDI has remained the same. STLDI historically has not and currently does not have to comply with federal health insurance requirements. Although STLDI is health insurance coverage generally sold in the individual market, it is excluded from the federal definition of individual health insurance coverage. Per the preamble to the final rule on STLDI, this exclusion from the definition of individual health insurance coverage provides the basis of STLDI's exemption from federal health insurance requirements. State regulation of STLDI varies. Some states impose restrictions on STLDI that are more prohibitive than what is allowed under the federal definition. For example, 22 states (including the District of Columbia [DC]) impose expiration dates shorter than the 12 months allowed under federal law. States may opt to place additional restrictions on STLDI that are not addressed under federal law. For example, 34 states (including DC) require that individuals enrolled in STLDI have access to external appeals processes and 3 states restrict how issuers can vary rates for STLDI (e.g., Minnesota prohibits gender rating for STLDI policies). States also may ban the sale of STLDI in the state, as four states have done. The most recent change to the definition of STLDI has been in effect for less than a year, and enrollment data for the new policies are not yet available. For a discussion of projected estimates of enrollment in STLDI under the latest definition, see the final rule on STLDI. Student health insurance coverage is a type of individual health insurance coverage that may be provided only to students enrolled in an institution of higher education and their dependents. The coverage has to meet the following conditions:  it cannot be available to anyone other than a student in an institution of higher education and a student's dependent(s), it cannot condition eligibility for the coverage on any health status-related factor of a student or a student's dependent(s), and it must meet requirements imposed under state law. As a type of individual health insurance coverage, fully insured student health insurance coverage would be required to comply with federal health insurance requirements that apply to individual coverage. However, regulations provide that it is exempt from complying with specified requirements that otherwise apply to individual health insurance coverage. (See Table 4 for details.) Student health insurance coverage was defined and its exemption status was established through the rulemaking process in response to ACA Section 1560(c), which states, \"Nothing in this title (or an amendment made by this title) shall be construed to prohibit an institution of higher education (as such term is defined for purposes of the Higher Education Act of 1965) from offering a student health insurance plan, to the extent that such requirement is otherwise permitted under applicable Federal, State, or local law.\" In the preamble to the proposed rule on student health insurance coverage, HHS noted that it proposed to exempt student health insurance coverage from guaranteed issue and renewal, minimum actuarial value requirements, and the single risk pool requirement because it believed that having to comply with the requirements \"would effectively prohibit institutions of higher education from being able to offer these [student health insurance coverage] plans\" and doing so would not be in keeping with ACA Section 1560(c). These regulatory exemptions went into effect for student health insurance coverage beginning on or after July 1, 2012. The exemption from rate review requirements was established later and went into effect for student health insurance plans beginning on or after July 1, 2018.  HHS acknowledges that it does not have the authority to regulate self-insured student health plans, which means the federal health insurance requirements and the exemptions listed in Table 4 apply only to fully insured student plans. States, however, can regulate fully insured and self-insured student health plans.  According to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, in 2017, there were about 1.1 million student health insurance policies written and nearly 1.3 million covered lives.  A nonfederal governmental plan is a governmental group health plan that is not sponsored by the federal government. Examples of entities that may sponsor nonfederal governmental plans are states, counties, school districts, and municipalities. Like private employers, sponsors of nonfederal governmental plans can choose to offer self-insured or fully insured plans. If a sponsor of a nonfederal governmental plan offers a self-insured plan, the sponsor may elect to exempt the plan from the specified federal requirements listed in Table 5 . The sponsor may choose to exempt the plan from some or all of the listed requirements. For example, a sponsor may elect to exempt its plan only from complying with the mental health parity requirement.  The exemption for self-insured, nonfederal governmental plans was established in the PHSA under HIPAA as an exemption from seven federal requirements. Because of how the ACA amended and reorganized the PHSA, the exemption was modified and, as of September 2010, self-insured, nonfederal governmental plans may opt out of only the four requirements listed in Table 5 . Because these plans are self-insured group health plans, states do not have the authority to regulate these plans.  According to an analysis of data published by the Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight, as of June 21, 2019, at least 174 nonfederal governmental entities across 35 states have elected to exempt at least one self-insured plan they offer from one or more of the four requirements. Nearly all of the 174 entities offer at least one plan that is exempt from the mental health parity requirement; significantly fewer entities offer plans that are exempt from each of the other three requirements. About 11% of the 174 entities offer at least one plan that is exempt from all four requirements.  CRS did not find estimates of enrollment in self-insured, nonfederal governmental plans. The ACA provided that group health plans and health insurance coverage in which at least one individual was enrolled as of enactment of the ACA (March 23, 2010) could be grandfathered . For as long as a plan maintains its grandfathered status, the plan is exempt from specified federal health insurance requirements established under the ACA. Since grandfathered plans existed as of March 23, 2010, they must comply with applicable federal health insurance requirements that were established prior to enactment of the ACA, as long as the prior requirements do not conflict with the ACA's grandfathered rules. For example, both grandfathered and non-grandfathered plans offered in the individual market must comply with federal health insurance requirements that applied to the individual market prior to enactment of the ACA. However, a grandfathered plan is required to comply with only some ACA requirements that apply to the individual market, whereas a non-grandfathered plan must comply with all such requirements. Table A-1 in the Appendix identifies which federal health insurance requirements apply to grandfathered plans. A plan can lose its grandfathered status. To maintain grandfathered status, a plan must continue to meet specified conditions and avoid making specified changes regarding employer contributions (where applicable), access to coverage, benefits, and cost sharing (e.g., changes in coinsurance requirements). A health plan offered in any market segment\u00e2\u0080\u0094individual, small group, large group, or self-insured\u00e2\u0080\u0094could be grandfathered. There is no time limitation on grandfathered status; as long as a plan avoids making the specified changes, it can remain a grandfathered plan. Once a plan has lost its grandfathered status, it cannot regain that status. Grandfathered plans generally are not available to new enrollees. Only individuals who have been continually covered and any new dependents can be covered under grandfathered plans in the individual market, and only individuals who have been continually covered, new dependents, and new employees can be covered under self-insured grandfathered plans and grandfathered plans offered in the group market. As of the date of this report, no repository for enrollment data for grandfathered plans was found, but the federal government has commented on enrollment. In October 2018, the Departments of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury commented that \"only a small number of individuals are currently enrolled in grandfathered individual health insurance coverage\" and \"the number of individuals with grandfathered individual health insurance coverage has declined each year since ... [the ACA] was enacted, and the already small number of individuals who have retained grandfathered coverage will continue to decline each year.\" In February 2019, the Departments issued a request for information on grandfathered group health plans and grandfathered group health insurance coverage. In the request, they noted the following: \"It is the Departments' understanding that the number of group health plans and group health insurance policies that are considered to be grandfathered has declined each year since the enactment of ... [the ACA], but many employers continue to maintain group health plans and coverage that have retained grandfathered status.\" Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual surveys on employer-sponsored health benefits underscore the decline among grandfathered group plans. According to the surveys, the percentage of employers that offer at least one grandfathered plan declined from 72% in 2011 to 22% in 2019. The percentage of covered workers covered under a grandfathered plan declined from 56% in 2011 to 13% in 2019.  States may regulate grandfathered plans in the same way they regulate non-grandfathered plans\u00e2\u0080\u0094they may impose requirements on issuers of grandfathered plans and the plans themselves, provided the state requirements neither conflict with federal law nor prevent the implementation of federal health insurance requirements. States do not have the authority to regulate self-insured grandfathered plans. The ACA included many new federal requirements that applied to health insurance coverage and the entities that offer such coverage. Some of the requirements were effective shortly after the ACA was enacted, but most became effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Many of the 2014 requirements applied to plans offered in the individual and small-group markets.  In the fall of 2013, issuers offering non-grandfathered individual and small-group plans began notifying their enrollees that their coverage would soon be canceled because the plans did not comply with the 2014 ACA requirements. If the individuals and employers enrolled wanted to continue to be covered in the individual or small-group market, they would have to find plans (offered by their current issuer or a different issuer) that complied with the 2014 ACA requirements. In response to the announced plan terminations, CMS issued guidance in November 2013 that established what are often referred to as transitional plans (or grandmothered plans). In the guidance, CMS stated it would not find individual and small-group market plans out of compliance with specified 2014 ACA requirements if the plans did not satisfy such requirements, provided the plans were renewed for plan years starting between January 1, 2014, and October 1, 2014. Pursuant to the guidance, state insurance commissioners could choose whether to enforce compliance with the specified 2014 ACA requirements in their individual and small-group markets. If state insurance commissioners chose not to enforce compliance in one or both of the markets, then issuers selling plans in the market(s) could choose to (but would not be required to) renew coverage for enrollees who otherwise would receive cancellation notices.  Table A-1 in the Appendix identifies the ACA requirements with which transitional plans do and do not have to comply. Transitional plans must comply with federal health insurance requirements that went into effect prior to enactment of the ACA and all ACA requirements that went into effect prior to 2014.  Initially, the transitional plan guidance applied to plans that were renewed for plan years starting between January 1, 2014, and October 1, 2014. The transitional plan guidance has been extended multiple times (most recently on March 25, 2019); currently, states may allow issuers that have continually renewed transitional plans since 2014 to continue to cover individuals under transitional plans through 2020.  In states that allow transitional plans, issuers can choose to continue their transitional plans or not. Discontinued transitional plans cannot be revived. Transitional plans generally are not available to new enrollees. Only individuals who have been continually covered and any new dependents can be covered under transitional plans in the individual market, and only individuals who have been continually covered, new dependents, and new employees can be covered under transitional plans in the small-group market. Most states opted to allow transitional plans in both their individual and small-group markets when the policy was first established. Some states have changed their policies since then. In 2019, transitional plans are available in both the individual and small-group markets in 32 states; most of these states have indicated they will allow transitional plans to continue in their markets through 2020 under the recent federal extension. In four states, transitional plans are allowed in both markets, but issuers have stopped offering transitional plans in each state's individual market. Fifteen states (including DC) either never allowed or no longer allow transitional plans in the state. As of the date of this report, no repository of enrollment data for transitional plans could be found. Given that transitional plans, for the most part, may only be renewed by those currently involved and may not be sold to new consumers, enrollment in transitional plans likely has declined since the plans were established.  The two health coverage arrangements discussed in this section have the following in common: the federal government has not explicitly exempted them from compliance with federal health insurance requirements, and they do not necessarily comply with those requirements.  The arrangements summarized in this section are just two examples that share the aforementioned characteristics. There may be other health coverage arrangements that share the same characteristics, but it is difficult to make a comprehensive list of such arrangements, given that one of their defining characteristics is that the federal government does not appear to have discussed their status with respect to the application of the federal health insurance requirements. A health care sharing ministry (HCSM) is a faith-based organization that shares resources for medical needs among its members. The idea of pooling financial resources for medical needs among a religious community has a long history in the United States. The idea originated with the Amish and Mennonites over a century ago, and other religious groups began offering HCSMs in the 1990s. In general, members of an HCSM are expected to follow a set of religious or ethical beliefs and regularly contribute a payment (e.g., monthly) to cover the medical expenses of other members. The contributions are distributed, either through the HCSM or via a member-to-member match, to members who need funds for health care costs. Members are often responsible for a portion of their health care costs prior to receiving funds from the HCSM, and most HCSMs exclude coverage of specified illnesses, care, or treatments.  HCSMs maintain that they are not providing insurance and do not guarantee payment for members' health care costs. However, the federal government does not appear to have defined HCSMs for regulatory or exemption purposes. HCSMs do not necessarily currently comply, and have not historically complied, with federal health insurance requirements.  States may choose whether and how to regulate HCSMs operating in their state. As of August 2018, 30 states had opted to explicitly exempt HCSMs from state insurance law (i.e., the HCSM does not have to comply with the state's body of insurance laws), provided the HCSM meets specified requirements. State HCSM requirements vary; examples of requirements include providing to consumers written disclaimers stating the HCSM is not an insurance company and having an annual audit. In the remaining 21 states (including DC), HCSMs have not been explicitly exempted from state insurance law; however, the lack of an explicit exemption does not necessarily mean that such states regulate HCSMs.  Regardless of whether a state has exempted an HCSM from its body of insurance laws, a state's role in regulating HCSMs is complex and varied. In states that exempt HCSMs from their insurance laws, state regulators are responsible for ensuring that HCSMs meet the requirements necessary to maintain their exemption and for taking action if they do not. In states that do not exempt HCSMs from their insurance laws, state regulators \"can investigate and, if sufficient evidence exists, regulate these plans as unauthorized insurers.\" In all states, regulators may have roles to play in \"investigating fraud, referring cases to the Attorney General's office, and assisting consumers who may have been harmed [by an HCSM].\" The Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries reports that there are 104 HCSMs in 29 states, and 7 of the 104 are open to new members. As of the date of this report, the alliance estimates enrollment in HCSMs at just under 970,000.  The American Farm Bureau Federation is a national organization established in 1919 to advocate for the financial and political interests of farmers, ranchers, and others associated with agriculture. There are local farm bureau offices in all 50 states and in Puerto Rico (but not in DC). Membership in a local farm bureau is open to anyone who pays the membership fee, but typically membership is tiered, with members associated with agriculture having a status different from other members (e.g., agriculture-associated members may have voting rights in the organization, whereas other members may not).  Each state farm bureau provides member benefits. The benefits include discounts on a variety of products and services, such as hotel stays, farm equipment, and membership in air ambulance networks. Additionally, many state farm bureaus assist their members with obtaining insurance, including health insurance. The assistance with health insurance takes different forms. Many state farm bureaus have agents available to assist their members with finding and enrolling in a health plan; some state farm bureaus sponsor coverage that is available to their members; and at least one state farm bureau is divided in two parts, with one part being an insurance company that serves the farm bureau's members. As of the date of this report, three states\u00e2\u0080\u0094Iowa, Kansas, and Tennessee\u00e2\u0080\u0094have enacted laws that allow the farm bureaus in each state to offer a different type of health coverage arrangement. Each state allows the state's farm bureau to sponsor health benefits coverage that is not defined by the state as insurance and is not subject to the state's insurance laws, provided the coverage and the farm bureau comply with specified requirements. (See Table 6 for details.) Iowa and Kansas passed their laws recently\u00e2\u0080\u0094in 2018 and 2019, respectively\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Tennessee passed its law in 1993. The farm bureaus in Iowa and Tennessee currently offer such coverage; the Kansas Farm Bureau's coverage became available for purchase beginning October 1, 2019, with coverage starting as early as January 1, 2020. As explained above, the arrangements sponsored by farm bureaus in Iowa, Kansas, and Tennessee are not considered insurance in their respective states and do not have to comply with state requirements that apply to insurance. Additionally, farm bureau coverage in these three states does not necessarily comply with any federal health insurance requirements. However, the federal government does not appear to have defined such coverage for regulatory or exemption purposes. In 2017, about 23,000 individuals had Tennessee Farm Bureau coverage. Estimates for the Iowa Farm Bureau were not found. Kansas Farm Bureau estimates that 11,000-42,000 residents of Kansas will be covered by its health benefits coverage.  Table A-1 shows the applicability of selected federal health insurance requirements to grandfathered and transitional plans. Both types of plans are described in detail in this report; as a reminder, any type of plan could be grandfathered, but only fully insured small-group plans and individual-market plans could become transitional plans.  The check marks in the table indicate that the grandfathered or transitional plan must comply with the requirement. The term N.A. indicates that the requirement does not apply to the specified market segment, regardless of whether the plan is a grandfathered or transitional plan. The use of Exempt in the table indicates that the grandfathered or transitional plan is exempt from complying with the requirement. For example, the ACA's rate review requirement applies only to fully insured small-group plans and individual market plans. Grandfathered plans do not have to comply with the requirement, which is why the table indicates that grandfathered fully insured small-group plans and grandfathered individual plans are \"Exempt\" from the requirement. Transitional plans do have to comply with the requirement, which is why the table has check marks for these plans. The rate review requirement does not apply to fully insured large-group plans or self-insured plans; as such, the table indicates that the requirement is not applicable (N.A.) to grandfathered versions of these plans."
