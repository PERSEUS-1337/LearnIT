    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The Isla Vista community encompasses a population of approximately 15,000 residents situated within approximately a half square mile of land in Santa Barbara County. It is adjacent to the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and its student population, of which approximately 8,000 students reside in university owned housing. Including university property, the area totals about 1,200 acres. Isla Vista represents one of the largest urban communities in California not governed as a city.\n(b) Isla Vista faces various challenges in local governance. As a university community, Isla Vista must accommodate the service needs associated with its transient student population and a predominantly renter-oriented community while balancing the needs of local homeowners and long-term residents. Isla Vista\u2019s situation is complicated by its unincorporated status, which limits its local participation in managing public services and providing needed public improvements.\n(c) As an unincorporated area, various county agencies provide services to the residents and businesses of Isla Vista. Since these agencies must provide services throughout the whole county, Isla Vista must compete for attention and funding for the services they need. Isla Vista is represented at the county level by one of five supervisors and is situated in the largest and most diverse geographic supervisorial district in the county.\n(d) The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District is the only local district providing limited services exclusively to Isla Vista. Due to its stewardship of protected wetlands and the coastline, as well as the dwindling amount of available open space, the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District should remain an independent district.\n(e) There have been multiple attempts at achieving cityhood for Isla Vista; however, cityhood has been denied for a variety of reasons, including financial and political feasibility. In 2003, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury found that establishing a community services district would be the best governance option to expand and improve services to Isla Vista; however, no action was taken by the community at that time.\n(f) Over the last year, the Isla Vista community has been faced with many challenges due to tragic events, including multiple injuries from students falling off cliffs, multiple violent sexual assaults, riots, a mass murder, and homicides that have brought focus to the unique needs of Isla Vista that can only be addressed by direct, local governance. Following these events, a local coalition was formed to determine the best direction for Isla Vista self-governance and the community services district has garnered much local support.\n(g) Additionally, following these events, many trustees on the UC Santa Barbara Foundation Board expressed a strong desire to support the chancellor and the university in efforts to create change in Isla Vista, to ensure a safer and more enhanced community for students. The UC Santa Barbara Foundation Trustees\u2019 Advisory Committee on Isla Vista Strategies was formed to analyze the conditions and dynamics of Isla Vista and develop mid- and long-term recommendations to establish a viable, safe, and supportive environment. Among their recommendations is that the State of California create a Community Services District/Municipal Improvement District in Isla Vista with potential powers of infrastructure, utilities, garbage, police services, parks, recreation, cultural facilities, fire, security, and roads.\nSEC. 2.\nPart 4 (commencing with Section 61250) is added to Division 3 of Title 6 of the Government Code, to read:\nPART 4. Isla Vista Community Services District\n61250.\n(a) Notwithstanding Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 61010) of Part 1, the Isla Vista Community Services District may be established in accordance with this part.

The board of supervisors shall pay any fees associated with the resolution of application.\n(2) The Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission shall complete the review no later than 150 days following receipt of the completed resolution of application.
