    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of \n2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Currently, it is possible to test for at least 30 \n        disorders through newborn screening.\n            (2) There is a lack of uniform newborn screening throughout \n        the United States. While a newborn with a debilitating \n        condition may receive screening, early detection, and treatment \n        in one location, in another location the condition may go \n        undetected and result in catastrophic consequences.\n            (3) Each year more than 4,000,000 babies are screened to \n        detect conditions that may threaten their long-term health.\n            (4) There are more than 2,000 babies born every year in the \n        United States with detectable and treatable disorders that go \n        unscreened through newborn screening.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Part Q of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280h et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399AA.
