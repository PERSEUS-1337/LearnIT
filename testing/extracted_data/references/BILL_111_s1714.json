FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and \n        sharing of open content, including open educational resources.\n            (2) The President has proposed a new, significant Federal \n        investment in the creation of online open-source courses for \n        community colleges that will make learning more accessible, \n        adaptable, and affordable for students.\n            (3) The President has challenged the United States with a \n        goal of having the highest college graduation rate in the world \n        by 2020.\n            (4) More than 80 percent of the 23,000,000 jobs that will \n        be created in the next 10 years will require postsecondary \n        education, but only 36 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds are \n        currently enrolled in postsecondary education.\n            (5) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a \n        barrier for many students in achieving higher education, and \n        according to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial \n        Assistance, 200,000 qualified students fail to enroll in \n        college each year due to cost.\n            (6) The College Board reported that for the 2007-2008 \n        academic year an average student spent an estimated $805 to \n        $1,229 on college books and supplies.\n            (7) Making high quality open textbooks freely available to \n        the general public could significantly lower college textbook \n        costs and increase accessibility to such education materials.\n            (8) Open textbooks can improve learning and teaching by \n        creating course materials that are more flexible, adaptable, \n        and accessible through the use of technology.\n\nSEC. 3.
