    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 7021 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:\n7021.\nThe board may enter into an interagency agreement with any other state or local agency the board deems to be in possession of any information relevant to its priority to protect the public described in Section 7000.6.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 7071.18 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:\n7071.18.\n(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a licensee shall report to the registrar in writing the occurrence of any of the following within 90 days after the licensee obtains knowledge of the event:\n(1) The conviction of the licensee for any felony.\n(2) The conviction of the licensee for any other crime that is substantially related to the qualifications, functions, and duties of a licensed contractor.\n(b) (1) The board shall consult with licensees, consumers, and other interested stakeholders in order to prepare a study of judgments, arbitration awards, and settlements that were the result of claims for construction defects for rental residential units and, by January 1, 2018, shall report to the Legislature the results of this study to determine if the board\u2019s ability to protect the public as described in Section 7000.6 would be enhanced by regulations requiring licensees to report judgments, arbitration awards, or settlement payments of those claims. Participation by licensees and consumers shall be voluntary. The study shall include, but not be limited to, criteria used by insurers or others to differentiate between settlements that are for nuisance value and those that are not, whether settlement information or other information can help identify licensees who may be subject to an enforcement action, if there is a way to separate subcontractors from general contractors when identifying licensees who may be subject to an enforcement action, whether reporting should be limited to settlements resulting from construction defects that resulted in death or injury, the practice of other boards within the department, and any other criteria considered reasonable by the board. The board shall submit the report to the Legislature in accordance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\n(2) Records or documents obtained by the board during the course of implementing this subdivision that are exempt from public disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code) shall remain exempt from disclosure pursuant to that act.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 18924.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\n18924.5.\n(a) By January 1, 2018, the working group formed by the California Building Standards Commission to study recent exterior elevated element failures in California shall submit a report to the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature containing any findings and possible recommendations for statutory changes or changes to the California Building Standards Code.\n(b) The working group shall review related documents and reports, including, but not limited to, any available forensic reports related to exterior elevated element failures in California, reports and studies used in the development of national and state building codes, and any other material deemed relevant to make recommendations to the appropriate state agency or agencies for the development of proposed building standards for exterior elevated elements.\n(c) The working group shall solicit technical expertise as appropriate from, but not limited to, representatives from the Department of Housing and Community Development, the Division of the State Architect\u2014Structural Safety, the Office of the State Fire Marshal, local building officials and plan checkers, e Contractors\u2019 State License Law (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code).\nSEC. 5.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Section 7071.18 to the Business and Professions Code, imposes a limitation on the public\u2019s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nBy allowing records and documents exempt from disclosure to be shared with the Contractors\u2019 State License Board and remain nonpublic under the Public Records Act, the act adding this section would encourage private individuals and entities to provide the board with information that is vital to the success of its study and report to determine whether additional regulations are appropriate. Therefore, this act properly balances the public\u2019s right to access to public records in the possession of the board with the need for the state to obtain otherwise private information."
