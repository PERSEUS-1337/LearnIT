FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On September 9, 1993, Palestinian Liberation \n        Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat made the following \n        commitments in an exchange of letters with Prime Minister of \n        Israel Yitzhak Rabin:\n                    (A) ``The PLO recognizes the right of the State of \n                Israel to exist in peace and security.''.\n                    (B) ``The PLO accepts United Nations Security \n                Council Resolutions 242 and 338'' pertaining to the \n                cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a \n                just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n                    (C) ``The PLO commits itself to the Middle East \n                peace process, and to a peaceful resolution of the \n                conflict between the two sides and declares that all \n                outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be \n                resolved through negotiations.''.\n                    (D) ``The PLO considers that the signing of the \n                Declaration of Principles constitutes a historic event, \n                inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful coexistence, free \n                from violence and all other acts which endanger peace \n                and stability. Accordingly, the PLO renounces the use \n                of terrorism and other acts of violence and will assume \n                responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in \n                order to assure their compliance, prevent violence and \n                discipline violators.''.\n                    (E) ``In view of the promise of a new era and the \n                signing of the Declaration of Principles and based on \n                Palestinian acceptance of Security Council Resolutions \n                242 and 338, the PLO affirms that those articles of the \n                Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to \n                exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are \n                inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are \n                now inoperative and no longer valid.''.\n            (2) The Palestinian Authority, the governing body of \n        autonomous Palestinian territories, was created as a result of \n        the agreements between the PLO and the State of Israel that are \n        a direct outgrowth of the September 9, 1993, commitments.\n            (3) The United States Congress has provided authorities to \n        the President to suspend certain statutory restrictions \n        relating to the PLO, subject to Presidential certification that \n        the PLO has continued to abide by commitments made.\n\nSEC. 3.
