Prior to the expiration of this \n        grant authority, the Administrator shall submit a report to \n        Congress concerning the experience with and effects of such \n        grants. The report may include any recommendations the \n        Administrator may have for amendments to this section and \n        related provisions of law in light of the termination of the \n        authority to make grants for the hiring and rehiring of \n        additional career firefighters.\n    ``(c) Applications.--\n            ``(1) No grant may be made under this section unless an \n        application has been submitted to, and approved by, the \n        Administrator.\n            ``(2) An application for a grant under this section shall \n        be submitted in such form, and contain such information, as the \n        Administrator may prescribe by regulation or guidelines.\n            ``(3) In accordance with the regulations or guidelines \n        established by the Administrator, each application for a grant \n        under this section shall--\n                    ``(A) include a long-term strategy and detailed \n                implementation plan that reflects consultation with \n                community groups and appropriate private and public \n                agencies and reflects consideration of the statewide \n                strategy;\n                    ``(B) explain the applicant's inability to address \n                the need without Federal assistance;\n                    ``(C) outline the initial and ongoing level of \n                community support for implementing the proposal \n                including financial and in-kind contributions or other \n                tangible commitments;\n                    ``(D) specify plans for obtaining necessary support \n                and continuing the proposed program, project, or \n                activity following the conclusion of Federal support; \n                and\n                    ``(E) provide assurances that the applicant will, \n                to the extent practicable, seek, recruit, and hire \n                members of racial and ethnic minority groups and women \n                in order to increase their ranks within firefighting.\n            ``(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n        in relation to applications under this section of units of \n        local government or fire districts having jurisdiction over \n        areas with populations of less than 50,000, the Administrator \n        may waive 1 or more of the requirements of paragraph (3) and \n        may otherwise make special provisions to facilitate the \n        expedited submission, processing, and approval of such \n        applications.\n    ``(d) Limitation on Use of Funds.--\n            ``(1) Funds made available under this section to States or \n        units of local government for salaries and benefits to hire \n        new, additional career firefighters shall not be used to \n        supplant State or local funds, or, in the case of Indian tribal \n        governments, funds supplied by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \n        but shall be used to increase the amount of funds that would, \n        in the absence of Federal funds received under this section, be \n        made available from State or local sources, or in the case of \n        Indian tribal governments, from funds supplied by the Bureau of \n        Indian Affairs.\n            ``(2)(A) States and units of local government may use \n        assets received through the Assets Forfeiture equitable sharing \n        program to provide the non-Federal share of the cost of \n        programs, projects, and activities funded under this section.\n            ``(B) Funds appropriated by the Congress for the activities \n        of any agency of an Indian tribal government or the Bureau of \n        Indian Affairs performing firefighting functions on any Indian \n        lands may be used to provide the non-Federal share of the cost \n        of programs or projects funded under this section.\n            ``(3)(A) Funding provided for hiring a career firefighter \n        may not exceed $90,000, unless the Administrator grants a \n        waiver from this limitation.\n            ``(B) $90,000 cap shall be adjusted for inflation beginning \n        in fiscal year 2003.\n    ``(e) Performance Evaluation.--\n            ``(1) Each program, project, or activity funded under this \n        section shall contain a monitoring component, developed \n        pursuant to guidelines established by the Administrator.
