FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air \n        Act Amendments of 1990'') (104 Stat. 2399) established a number \n        of measures and programs that address ozone and particulate \n        matter pollution and the precursors to ozone and particulate \n        matter pollution;\n            (2) most of the measures and programs are continuing or \n        have yet to be implemented;\n            (3) the United States has made significant progress on \n        reducing atmospheric levels of ozone and particulate matter \n        since passage of Public Law 101-549 and will continue to make \n        significant progress in reducing atmospheric levels of ozone \n        and particulate matter through continued implementation of that \n        Act for the next 5 years;\n            (4) changing the current national ambient air quality \n        standard for ozone, which is explicitly incorporated into part \n        D of title I of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.), \n        could nullify many of the ozone provisions in Public Law 101-\n        549 and lead to disruptions and delays in the reduction of \n        ozone and the precursors to ozone;\n            (5) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee have \n        recommended that additional research be conducted to determine \n        any adverse health effects of fine particles (including \n        research on the biological mechanism for adverse health \n        effects, toxicity and dose response levels, and specification \n        of the size and type of particle that might have adverse health \n        effects); and\n            (6) currently available atmospheric data regarding fine \n        particle levels in the United States are inadequate to provide \n        an understanding of any adverse health effects of fine \n        particles or a basis for designating areas under title I of the \n        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3.
