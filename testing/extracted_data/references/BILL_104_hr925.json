The amount \nof the compensation shall equal the diminution in value that resulted \nfrom the agency action. If the diminution in value of a portion of that \nproperty is greater than 50 percent, at the option of the owner, the \nFederal Government shall buy that portion of the property for its fair \nmarket value.\n    (b) Duration of Limitation on Use.--Property with respect to which \ncompensation has been paid under this Act shall not thereafter be used \ncontrary to the limitation imposed by the agency action, even if that \naction is later rescinded or otherwise vitiated.

No such request may be made \nlater than 180 days after the owner receives actual notice of that \nagency action.\n    (b) Negotiations.--The agency may bargain with that owner to \nestablish the amount of the compensation. If the agency and the owner \nagree to such an amount, the agency shall promptly pay the owner the \namount agreed upon.\n    (c) Choice of Remedies.--If, not later than 180 days after the \nwritten request is made, the parties do not come to an agreement as to \nthe right to and amount of compensation, the owner may choose to take \nthe matter to binding arbitration or seek compensation in a civil \naction.\n    (d) Arbitration.--The procedures that govern the arbitration shall, \nas nearly as practicable, be those established under title 9, United \nStates Code, for arbitration proceedings to which that title applies. \nAn award made in such arbitration shall include a reasonable attorney's \nfee and other arbitration costs (including appraisal fees).

If the agency action resulted from a requirement \nimposed by another agency, then the agency making the payment or \nsatisfying the judgment may seek partial or complete reimbursement from \nthe appropriated funds of the other agency. For this purpose the head \nof the agency concerned may transfer or reprogram any appropriated \nfunds available to the agency. If insufficient funds exist for the \npayment or to satisfy the judgment, it shall be the duty of the head of \nthe agency to seek the appropriation of such funds for the next fiscal \nyear.\n\nSEC. 7.
