FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) According to the Institute of Medicine of the National \n        Academy of Sciences, the Department of Health and Human \n        Services and the Department of Homeland Security should analyze \n        terrorism preparedness to ensure that the public health \n        infrastructure is prepared to respond to the psychological \n        consequences of terrorism, and Federal, State, and local \n        disaster planners should address these psychological \n        consequences in their planning and preparedness for terrorist \n        attacks.\n            (2) Research concerning the psychological impact of ongoing \n        terrorism in Israel published in the Journal of the American \n        Medical Association and ongoing research undertaken by the \n        National Institutes of Health demonstrate that there are \n        effective ways to enhance resilience and minimize the damaging \n        psychological impact of terrorism.\n            (3) According to the New England Journal of Medicine, after \n        September 11, 2001, Americans across the country, including \n        children, had substantial symptoms of stress. Even clinicians \n        who practice in regions that are far from the sites of the \n        attacks should be prepared to assist people with trauma-related \n        symptoms of stress.\n            (4) According to Military Medicine, experiences from the \n        1995 chemical weapons attack by terrorists in the Tokyo subway \n        system suggest that psychological casualties from a chemical \n        attack will outnumber physical casualties by approximately 4 to \n        1.\n            (5) According to the Journal of the American Medical \n        Association, the lessons learned from the 2001 anthrax attacks \n        should motivate local health departments, health care \n        organizations, and clinicians to engage in collaborative \n        programs to enhance their communications and local preparedness \n        and response capabilities.\n            (6) According to the National Advisory Committee on \n        Children and Terrorism, it is important to recognize that the \n        means through which the effects of terrorism are propagated are \n        largely psychological and that it will generally be the terror \n        generated by a major event, not the event itself, that will \n        have the greatest long-term negative impact on children and \n        families throughout the Nation. There is a great need for \n        increased attention to the promotion of family and community \n        resilience in terror and disaster planning.\n            (7) According to ``Schools and Terrorism: A Supplement to \n        the National Advisory Committee on Children and Terrorism \nRecommendations to the Secretary'', schools may or may not be the \ntargets of terrorism, but they are certain to be affected by terrorism, \nbecause on any given weekday more than one-fifth of the United States \npopulation can be found in schools. Although the United States \nDepartment of Education strongly encourages every school to have an \nemergency management plan, few plans address how the school fits in \nwith the larger public health and emergency management response to a \ncommunity-wide event, such as a terrorist attack.\n            (8) According to a national study by leading health care \n        foundations, in this time of growing threats of terrorism, many \n        doctors and other primary care providers are increasingly being \n        confronted with patients who complain of aches and pains, or \n        more serious symptoms, which mask serious anxiety or \n        depression.\n            (9) Substantial effort and funding are still needed to \n        adequately understand and prepare for the psychological \n        consequences associated with bioterrorism.\n            (10) The integration of mental health into public health \n        efforts, including integration and cooperation across Federal \n        agencies and State public health and mental health authorities, \n        is critical in addressing the psychological needs of the Nation \n        with regard to terrorism.\n\nSEC. 3. GOALS.\n\n    The goals of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To identify effective strategies to respond to the \n        behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impacts of terrorism and \n        their implications for disaster management and to integrate \n        these strategies into the United States' plans to mitigate, \n        plan for, respond to, and recover from potential and actual \n        terrorist attacks.\n            (2) To coordinate the efforts of different government \n        agencies in researching, developing, and implementing programs \n        and protocols designed to increase the psychological resilience \n        and mitigate distress reactions and maladaptive behaviors of \n        the American public as they relate to terrorism.\n            (3) To facilitate the work of the Department of Homeland \n        Security and other departments and agencies by incorporating \n        programs and protocols designed to increase the psychological \n        resilience of the American public and respond to the \n        behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impacts of terrorism and \n        their implications for disaster management, into those \n        Departments' and agencies' efforts in reducing the \n        vulnerability of the United States to terrorism.\n            (4) To enable the States and localities to effectively \n        respond to the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impacts of \n        terrorism and their implications for disaster management and to \n        integrate appropriate strategies into their terrorism planning, \n        preparedness, and response efforts.\n            (5) To integrate mental health and public health emergency \n        preparedness and response efforts in the United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
