FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (in this Act \n        referred to as the ``Trust Fund'') was created in 1978 as part \n        of the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977, with the goal \n        of shifting, from the Federal Government to the coal mining \n        industry, the cost of compensating victims of occupational \n        black lung disease.\n            (2) The Trust Fund draws its principal revenue from excise \n        taxes on coal. The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 \n        authorized repayable advances from the Treasury to the Trust \n        Fund, in such sums as may be necessary to make benefit payments \n        and other authorized expenditures. Any such advances are \n        required to be repaid, with interest at the rate prescribed in \n        section 9501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to the \n        general fund of the Treasury when the Secretary of the Treasury \n        determines that monies are available in the Trust Fund for such \n        purposes.\n            (3) In each year prior to 1990, the Trust Fund revenues \n        were insufficient to satisfy all benefit payments and other \n        authorized expenditures, resulting in the need for repayable \n        advances from the Treasury to the Trust Fund.\n            (4) Since 1990, the Trust Fund revenues from excise taxes \n        on coal have generally been sufficient to cover current benefit \n        payments and administrative costs, but have not been sufficient \n        to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that the \n        Trust Fund owes to the Treasury. Instead, that indebtedness has \n        grown each year as additional advances were taken to pay the \n        portion of the interest charges not covered by the Trust Fund's \n        revenues.\n            (5) Beginning in 1998, the annual interest charges on the \n        debt alone have exceeded benefit payments made by the Trust \n        Fund.\n            (6) The annual interest charges to the Trust Fund now \n        exceed its total annual excise tax revenues.\n            (7) Without action, the Trust Fund's indebtedness to the \n        Treasury, which totals approximately $8,200,000,000, will \n        continue to grow and the Trust Fund will never become solvent, \n        even when benefit outlays have declined to a level approaching \n        zero.\n            (8) It is in the public interest to refinance the Trust \n        Fund debt and to restore long-term fiscal solvency to the Trust \n        Fund.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Repayable advance.--The term ``repayable advance'' \n        means an amount that has been appropriated to the Trust Fund in \n        order to make benefit payments and other expenditures that are \n        authorized under section 9501 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n        1986 and are required to be repaid when the Secretary of the \n        Treasury determines that monies are available in the Trust Fund \n        for this purpose.\n            (2) Market value of the outstanding repayable advances, \n        plus accrued interest.--The term ``market value of the \n        outstanding repayable advances, plus accrued interest'' means \n        the present value (determined by the Secretary of the Treasury \n        as of the refinancing date and using the Treasury rate as the \n        discount rate) of the stream of principal and interest payments \n        derived assuming that each repayable advance that is \n        outstanding on the refinancing date is due on the thirtieth \n        anniversary of the end of the fiscal year in which the advance \n        was made to the Trust Fund, and that all such principal and \n        interest payments are made on September 30 of the applicable \n        fiscal year.\n            (3) Refinancing date.--The term ``refinancing date'' means \n        the date occurring 2 days after the date of the enactment of \n        this Act.\n            (4) Treasury 1-year rate.--The term ``Treasury 1-year \n        rate'' means a rate determined by the Secretary of the \n        Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on \n        outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with \n        remaining periods to maturity of approximately 1 year, to have \n        been in effect as of the close of business 1 business day \n        before the date on which the Trust Fund issues obligations to \n        the Secretary of the Treasury under section 4(b).\n            (5) Treasury rate.--The term ``Treasury rate'' means a rate \n        determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into \n        consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable \n        obligations of the United States of comparable maturities.\n\nSEC. 4.
