SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``World Trade \nOrganization Dispute Settlement Review Commission Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States joined the World Trade Organization \n        (in this Act referred to as the ``WTO'') as an original member \n        with the goal of creating an improved global trading system and \n        providing expanded economic opportunities for United States \n        firms and workers, while preserving United States sovereignty.\n            (2) The American people must receive assurances that United \n        States sovereignty will be protected, and United States \n        interests will be advanced, within the global trading system \n        which the WTO will oversee.\n            (3) The WTO's dispute settlement rules are meant to enhance \n        the likelihood that governments will observe their WTO \n        obligations. These dispute settlement rules will help ensure \n        that the United States will reap the full benefits of its \n        participation in the WTO.\n            (4) United States support for the WTO depends on obtaining \n        mutual trade benefits through the openness of foreign markets \n        and the maintenance of effective United States and WTO remedies \n        against unfair and otherwise harmful trade practices.\n            (5) Congress passed the Uruguay Round Agreements Act based \n        on its understanding that effective trade remedies would not be \n        eroded. These remedies are essential to continue the process of \n        opening foreign markets to imports of goods and services and to \n        prevent harm to American industry and agriculture.\n            (6) In particular, WTO dispute panels and the Appellate \n        Body should--\n                    (A) operate with fairness and in an impartial \n                manner;\n                    (B) not add to the obligations, or diminish the \n                rights, of WTO members under the Uruguay Round \n                Agreements; and\n                    (C) observe the terms of reference and any \n                applicable WTO standard of review.\n    (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide for the \nestablishment of the WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission to \nachieve the objectives described in subsection (b)(6).\n\n SEC. 2.
