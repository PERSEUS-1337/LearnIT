SUMMER AND YEAR-ROUND YOUTH JOBS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) a $1,500,000,000 investment in summer and year-round \n        employment for youth, through the program supported under this \n        section, can create up to 450,000 temporary jobs and meaningful \n        work experiences for economically disadvantaged youth and \n        stimulate local economies;\n            (2) there is a serious and growing need for employment \n        opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth (including \n        young adults), as demonstrated by statistics from the Bureau of \n        Labor Statistics stating that, in November 2009--\n                    (A) the unemployment rate increased to 10 percent, \n                as compared to 6.8 percent in November 2008;\n                    (B) the unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds \n                rose to 26.7 percent, as compared to 20.4 percent in \n                November 2008; and\n                    (C) the unemployment rate for African-American 16- \n                to 19-year-olds increased to 49.4 percent, as compared \n                to 32.2 percent in November 2008;\n            (3) research from Northwestern University has shown that \n        every $1 a youth earns has an accelerator effect of $3 on the \n        local economy;\n            (4) summer and year-round jobs for youth help supplement \n        the income of families living in poverty;\n            (5) summer and year-round jobs for youth provide valuable \n        work experience for economically disadvantaged youth;\n            (6) often, a summer or year-round job provided under the \n        Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is an economically \n        disadvantaged youth's introduction to the world of work;\n            (7) according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at \n        Northeastern University, early work experience is a very \n        powerful predictor of success and earnings in the labor market, \n        and early work experience raises earnings over a lifetime by 10 \n        to 20 percent;\n            (8) participation in a youth jobs program can contribute to \n        a reduction in criminal and high-risk behavior for youth; and\n            (9)(A) youth jobs programs benefit both youth and \n        communities when designed around principles that promote \n        mutually beneficial programs;\n            (B) youth benefit from jobs that provide them with work \n        readiness skills and that help them make the connection between \n        responsibility on the job and success in adulthood; and\n            (C) communities benefit when youth are engaged \n        productively, providing much-needed services that meet real \n        community needs.\n    (b) References.--\n            (1) Certificate; credential.--In subsection (d), references \n        to the terms ``certificate'' and ``credential'' have the \n        meanings prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.\n            (2) Youth-related references.--In this Act, and in the \n        provisions referred to in subsections (c) and (d) for purposes \n        of this Act--\n                    (A) a reference to a youth refers to an individual \n                who is not younger than age 14 and not older than age \n                24, and meets any other requirements for that type of \n                youth;
