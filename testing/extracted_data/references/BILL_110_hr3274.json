FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The December 2004 National Intelligence Council report \n        entitled ``Mapping the Global Future in 2020'' states that the \n        single most important factor affecting the demand for energy \n        will be global economic growth, especially that of China and \n        India.\n            (2) The United States and China are both rich in coal and \n        look to it for a majority of their electricity needs.\n            (3) China is building its power generation base for the \n        first time and the United States is preparing to replace a \n        generation of aging electric power facilities.\n            (4) Carbon capture and sequestration is a viable technology \n        that still needs significant amounts of research and \n        development before it can be widely commercialized.\n            (5) A recent study by MIT (2007) on ``The Future of Coal'' \n        outlines the need for several integrated projects to \n        demonstrate the feasibility of carbon capture and sequestration \n        in a variety of countries and geological settings.\n            (6) The United States and China are already working \n        together on the FutureGen project in the United States. \n        FutureGen is an initiative to build the world's first \n        integrated sequestration and hydrogen production research power \n        plant. The project is intended to create the world's first \n        zero-emissions fossil fuel plant.\n            (7) Joint American-Chinese research and development on \n        carbon capture technology would improve the energy security of \n        both nations.\n            (8) Further, both the United States and China are actively \n        seeking to promote industrial efficiency and conservation. \n        United States industry consumes more than one third of all \n        energy used in the United States. The United States Department \n        of Energy's Industrial Technologies program aims to invest in \n        research and development to reduce industrial energy use while \n        stimulating productivity and growth.\n            (9) The industrial sector represents 68 percent of all \n        primary energy consumption in China. In 2006, China's National \n        Development and Reform Commission launched a major program to \n        improve energy efficiency in China's 1,000 largest enterprises, \n        which together consume one third of China's primary energy. \n        Additionally, the Chinese Government plans to retire many \n        inefficient power plants and close many inefficient industrial \n        plants.\n            (10) There is a need to build capacity among scholars in \n        both China and the United States in the area of analytic energy \n        and climate change policy.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Application.--In order to receive a grant under this Act, an \neligible entity shall submit an application to the Secretary containing \nsuch information and assurances as the Secretary may require.\n    (b) Selection.--The Secretary shall review any application \nsubmitted by any eligible entity and select eligible entities meeting \ncriteria established by the Secretary to receive a grant under this \nsection. The amount of each grant awarded for a fiscal year under this \nsection shall be determined by the Secretary.\n    (c) Recoupment.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish procedures \n        and criteria for recoupment in connection with any eligible \n        project carried out by an eligible entity that receives a grant \n        under this section, which has led to the development of a \n        product or process which is marketed or used.\n            (2) Amount required.--\n                    (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), such \n                recoupment shall be required as a condition for award \n                and be proportional to the Federal share of the costs \n                of such project, and shall be derived from the proceeds \n                of royalties or licensing fees received in connection \n                with such product or process.\n                    (B) In the case where a product or process is used \n                by the recipient of a grant under this section for the \n                production and sale of its own products or processes, \n                the recoupment shall consist of a payment equivalent to \n                the payment which would be made under subparagraph (A).\n            (3) Waiver.--The Secretary may at any time waive or defer \n        all or some of the recoupment requirements of this subsection \n        as necessary, depending on--\n                    (A) the commercial competitiveness of the entity or \n                entities developing or using the product or process;\n                    (B) the profitability of the project; and\n                    (C) the commercial viability of the product or \n                process utilized.\n            (4) Exception.--The requirement under this subsection shall \n        not apply to purely academic endeavors that have no commercial \n        value.\n    (d) Use of Existing Programs.--The Secretary shall carry out this \nsection through existing programs at the Department of Energy.\n    (e) Report.--Not later than 180 days after receiving a grant under \nthis section, each recipient shall submit a report to the Secretary--\n            (1) documenting how the recipient used the grant funds; and\n            (2) evaluating the level of success of each project funded \n        by the grant.\n\nSEC. 4.
