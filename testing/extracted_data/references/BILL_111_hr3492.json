FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the construction industry, specialty subcontractors \n        now perform the majority of construction work, in certain cases \n        100 percent of the work, under the management of a prime \n        contractor, making the subcontractors' price and performance \n        the key determinant in the overall cost of construction \n        projects, including those performed for the Federal Government.\n            (2) Detrimental practices known as ``bid shopping'' and \n        ``bid peddling'' exist in the construction industry, including \n        construction projects for the Federal Government.\n            (3) ``Bid shopping'' occurs when a contractor, after award \n        of a contract, contracts with subcontractors at a price less \n        than the quoted price of the subcontractor upon which the \n        contractor's fixed bid price was based, in order to increase \n        the contractor's profit on the project without any benefit to \n        the entity for which the contract is being performed.\n            (4) ``Bid peddling'' occurs when a subcontractor that is \n        not selected for inclusion in a contractor's team seeks to \n        induce the contractor, after award of the contract, to \n        substitute the subcontractor for another subcontractor whose \n        bid price was reflected in the successful bid of the contractor \n        by offering to reduce its price for performance of the \n        specified work, suggesting that the previous offer of the \n        subcontractor was padded or incorrect.\n            (5) Bid shopping and bid peddling--\n                    (A) threaten the integrity of the competitive bid \n                system for construction that benefits the Federal \n                Government, the construction industry, and the economy \n                of the United States as a whole;\n                    (B) compromise national security by promoting \n                uncertainty about which contractors actually perform \n                work on critical infrastructure projects;\n                    (C) deprive taxpayers of the benefits of full and \n                open competition among prospective contractors and \n                subcontractors for the performance of Federal \n                construction projects;\n                    (D) expose Federal construction projects to the \n                dangers of substandard performance, substitution of \n                lower quality materials, and other detrimental cost-\n                cutting practices by an unscrupulous substituted \n                subcontractor; and\n                    (E) can be effectively deterred in Federal \n                construction by modifying the Federal Acquisition \n                Regulation to require bid listing, which is the \n                practice of requiring each offeror for a Federal \n                construction contract to list the subcontractors whose \n                performance is reflected in the bid price, procedures \n                for the substitution of listed subcontractors for good \n                cause, and other deterrents to abuse.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means any contract \n        with the Federal Government, exceeding $1,000,000 in amount, \n        for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public \n        building or public work of the United States.\n            (2) Contractor.--The term ``contractor'' means an \n        individual or entity that has been awarded or is seeking to be \n        awarded a construction contract by the Federal Government.\n            (3) Subcontractor.--The term ``subcontractor'' means an \n        individual or entity that subcontracts with a contractor in an \n        amount in excess of $100,000 for work on a contract.\n\nSEC. 4.

A \n        subcontractor who has been so notified shall have five working \n        days within which to submit written objections to the \n        substitution to the contracting officer. Failure to file such \n        written objections shall constitute the consent of the listed \n        subcontractor to the substitution.\n    (c) Limitation on Assignment, Transfer, or Substitution.--\n            (1) Limitation on assignment or transfer.--No contractor \n        shall permit any subcontract to be voluntarily assigned or \n        transferred or to be performed by any entity other than the \n        subcontractor listed in the bid or proposal without the consent \n        of the contracting officer. Consent of the contracting officer \n        to a contractor for a substitution shall--\n                    (A) be promptly made in writing; and\n                    (B) be included in the contract file.\n            (2) Limitation on substitution.--No contractor that listed \n        itself for a portion of the work under the contract shall \n        subcontract any portion of the work for which it listed itself, \n        unless authorized by the contracting officer to substitute one \n        or more subcontractors to perform such work.\n\nSEC. 5. PENALTIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) A contractor shall be subject to penalties if, without \n        obtaining the approval of the contracting officer, the \n        contractor--\n                    (A) replaces a listed subcontractor for a contract \n                with an executive agency; or\n                    (B) awards a subcontract to a subcontractor to \n                perform work which the contractor had identified as \n                work to be performed directly by the contractor.\n            (2) A subcontractor shall also be subject to penalties if \n        the subcontractor is determined to have knowingly participated \n        in the failure of the contractor to comply with the regulatory \n        provisions relating to the substitution of a listed \n        subcontractor.\n    (b) Amount of Penalties To Be Imposed.--The amount of penalties \nimposed under this section shall be equal to the greater of--\n            (1) 10 percent of the amount of the bid by the listed \n        subcontractor;\n            (2) the difference between the amount of the bid by the \n        listed subcontractor and the amount of the bid by the \n        substituted subcontractor; or\n            (3) the difference between the amount of the bid by a \n        substituted subcontractor and the dollar value specified by the \n        contractor for the work which the contractor had listed for its \n        own performance.\n    (c) Source of Funds for Penalties.--Penalties assessed pursuant to \nthis section shall be deducted from the remaining unpaid contract \nbalance and deposited into the fund from which the contract was \nawarded.\n\nSEC. 6. GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT.\n\n    The imposition of penalties on a contractor or subcontractor for \nfailure to comply with the procedures for the substitution of \nsubcontractors on 2 contracts within a 3-year period shall be deemed to \nbe adequate evidence of the commission of an offense indicating a lack \nof business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly \naffects the present responsibility of a Government contractor within \nthe meaning of part 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation \n(Debarment, Suspension, and Eligibility) (48 CFR 9.4).\n\nSEC. 7. IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION.\n\n    (a) Proposed Revisions.--Proposed revisions to the Government-wide \nFederal Acquisition Regulation to implement the provisions in this Act \nshall be published not later than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act and provide not less than 60 days for public \ncomment.\n    (b) Final Regulations.--Final regulations shall be published not \nless than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and \nshall be effective on the date that is 30 days after the date of \npublication."
