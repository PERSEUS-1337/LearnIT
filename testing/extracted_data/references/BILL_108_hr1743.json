FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) When the reimbursement system under the Medicare \n        program, which evolved into the Prospective Payment System, was \n        created in 1965, Iowa had pioneered in cost containment \n        techniques and therefore received lower initial reimbursement \n        rates. As inflation adjustments occurred over the years, the \n        differential between reimbursement rates in the various states \n        widened even though many medical costs are themselves similar.\n            (2) Despite the fact that Iowa ranks first among all states \n        in percent of citizens over 85, and fourth in citizens over 65, \n        Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa access the health care system \n        less frequently and experience shorter hospitalizations than \n        residents of many other States.\n            (3) The inflation in general health care costs for which \n        Iowa has been relatively undercompensated coupled with the \n        unique problems of serving a disproportionately aging \n        population in a decentralized rural setting has created a \n        crisis for Iowa's health care providers and the Medicare \n        beneficiaries they serve.\n            (4) The inequity inherent in the Medicare reimbursement \n        differential is symbolized by the fact that Medicare \n        reimbursements per beneficiary for Iowa is $3414, the lowest in \n        the nation, while the figure for Louisiana, the highest, is \n        $8033, or about two and one half times as great.\n            (5) The average cost of living in the two states taken as a \n        percent of that in the entire United States, by contrast, is \n        almost the same, 92.5 for Iowa and 97.4 for Louisiana.\n            (6) If the inequity in Medicare reimbursements did not \n        exist, the modest cost of living differential which exists \n        between Iowa and states such as Louisiana would be even closer \n        than indicated by the statistics described in paragraph (5) \n        because health care spending represents approximately 12 \n        percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and when an \n        entitlement program of Federal government, such as the Medicare \n        program, provides disproportionately more resources to \n        individuals in one State over another State, generalized \n        economic, and specific health care cost, differentials occur.\n            (7) Because of low Medicare rates, Iowa counties, \n        particularly but not exclusively the smaller ones, are \n        experiencing shortages of doctors and other health care \n        providers, which in the near future could cause a significant \n        access to health care crisis for many Iowa citizens.\n            (8) All citizens pay into Social Security under a uniform \n        set of national standards.\n            (9) Simple fairness and equity in the delivery of \n        government services dictate that the differences in Medicare \n        reimbursement received by each of the several States should not \n        fall far below the differences in the cost of living therein.\n            (10) Low payment rates and a shortage of providers \n        discourage Medicare+Choice organizations from offering plans in \n        rural areas, and this unavailability of a Medicare+Choice \n        option in such areas is unfair to Medicare residents who would \n        like to take advantage of the additional services and other \n        benefits offered through Medicare+Choice plans.\n            (11) In order to encourage the establishment of \n        Medicare+Choice plans in rural States, the Medicare program \n        needs to provide incentives to States, insurers, and other \n        entities interested in sponsoring Medicare+Choice plans in such \n        States. Given Iowa's low Medicare reimbursement rate, it is \n        unlikely that any new health care delivery model can attract \n        sufficient providers unless current Medicare fee-for-service \n        payment rates for those providers are exceeded.\n            (12) Preferred provider organizations are uniquely \n        positioned to provide improved care management and clinical \n        outcomes in part due to the wide-ranging involvement of health \n        care professionals at each stage of a patient-oriented care \n        process.\n            (13) State governments should be encouraged to support and, \n        where appropriate, oversee the establishment of organizations \n        which make available health care services to individuals \n        residing in underserved areas in the State.\n    (b) Purpose.--In order to insure that Iowa's health care facilities \nand providers have access to the most innovative reimbursement options \navailable under the Medicare program, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices may approve a demonstration project to test ways in which \ncooperative efforts among insurers, institutional providers of \nservices, and health care professionals may provide better access to \nhealth care services for Medicare beneficiaries. The demonstration \nproject would be designed to improve access to health care services \nthrough the Medicare+Choice program.\n\nSEC. 3. CONSIDERATION OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE PREFERRED PROVIDER \n              ORGANIZATION (PPO) DEMONSTRATION PROJECT UNDER THE \n              MEDICARE+CHOICE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nallow the receipt and approval of applications described in subsection \n(b) for a demonstration project conducted under section 402 of the \nSocial Security Amendments of 1967 for participation of preferred \nprovider organizations (PPOs) under the Medicare+Choice program under \npart C of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, with the \nunderstanding that the demonstration program could cause Medicare \nreimbursement in Iowa to rise to a level more in line with the average \nnational Medicare reimbursement rate.\n    (b) Application Described.--\n            (1) In general.--An application described in this \n        subsection is an application by an appropriate insurer \n        domiciled and licensed to sell health

\n                ensure that the health care needs of the Medicare \n                beneficiaries to be served by the network are met.\n                    (B) Appropriate adjustments are made to the payment \n                rates to hospitals for indirect medical education costs \n                and for being a disproportionate share hospital in \n                manner similar to which such payment adjustments are \n                made under subparagraphs (B) and (F), respectively, of \n                section 1886(d)(5) of the Social Security Act.\n                    (C) As a preferred provider, a provider of \n                services, physician, and health care practitioner shall \n                be reimbursed for services furnished to Medicare \n                beneficiaries at a rate no less than 110 percent of the \n                payment rate that would otherwise apply for the service \n                under part A or B, as the case may be.\n

benefits in addition to those required under parts A \n                and B of such title (such as coverage of the costs of \n                some or all outpatient prescription drugs, hearing \n                aids, or eye glasses or reduced cost-sharing), after \n                taking into account costs of administration.\n            (3) Additional payment for start up costs.--In addition to \n        payments made to the insurer under paragraph (2), the Secretary \n        may provide for a payment during the initial phase of the \n        project to reflect additional costs associated with the \n        establishment of preferred provider organizations under the \n        plan.\n    (c) Period of Demonstration Project.--A demonstration project \ncarried out under this section shall operate for a period of 5 years.\n    (d) Advisory Board.--\n            (1) Establishment.--As a part of the demonstration project \n        conducted under this section, the insurer shall provide
