SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``America's Fund for Future \nOpportunities and Outcomes in the United States Act of 2013'' or \n``America's FOCUS Act of 2013''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States faces increasing competition from \n        countries with populations of a billion or more inhabitants, \n        who contribute to the human capital of these countries and \n        improve their performance in the global economy.\n            (2) To ensure that the United States retains its leadership \n        position in the global economy, the United States should \n        maximize the opportunities and outcomes of its citizenry.\n            (3) The United States can achieve this goal by investing in \n        STEM education and character development for youth, justice \n        reinvestment efforts, and innovations in medical research and \n        development.\n            (4) To fund these investments in the public interest, the \n        United States should use revenue generated by acts perpetrated \n        against the public interest.\n            (5) As corporate and financial wrongdoing touches the lives \n        of all Americans, revenue generated by such acts should serve \n        as the basis for these investments.\n            (6) This revenue should be used to assist programs and \n        organizations seeking to better the Nation through their work \n        in the youth mentoring, justice reinvestment, and medical \n        research fields.\n            (7) In 1998, Congress issued Federal charters to the Boys \n        and Girls Clubs of America and Big Brothers Big Sisters of \n        America in recognition of their work helping children reach \n        their full potential and succeed in American public life. Youth \n        mentoring organizations still carry out this work and are \n        putting children on the path to self-sufficiency. These \n        organizations include--\n                    (A) the Boys and Girls Clubs of America;\n                    (B) Big Brothers Big Sisters of America;\n                    (C) National CARES Mentoring Movement;\n                    (D) the First Tee;\n                    (E) Amachi;\n                    (F) FIRST Robotics;\n                    (G) the U.S. DREAM Academy;\n                    (H) GEAR UP;\n                    (I) the YMCA;\n                    (J) Civil Air Patrol;\n                    (K) the National Council of Youth Sports;\n                    (L) Girls Inc.; and\n                    (M) National Urban League.\n            (8) Innovations in medical research and development \n        significantly benefit the American people. For example, through \n        innovations in the diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening \n        diseases, Americans are now living longer and more productive \n        lives, contributing to the economic growth of the United \n        States. Additional investments in medical research and \n        development will contribute to overall public health and \n        productivity in America.\n            (9) Through participation in the Justice Reinvestment \n        Initiative, State governments have implemented evidence-based \n        criminal justice reforms. These reforms are cost effective, \n        redirecting revenue to better serve the public safety needs of \n        local communities. In addition, these reforms have decreased \n        risks of recidivism and instituted alternatives to \n        incarceration for non-violent offenders. According to a July \n        2013 report from the Urban Institute, States participating in \n        the Justice Reinvestment Initiative may achieve $3.3 billion in \n        savings over the next 10 years. Additional funding to the \n        Initiative would better enable State and local governments to \n        carry out this work and achieve these savings.\n\nSEC. 3.
