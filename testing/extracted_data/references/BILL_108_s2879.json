FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Winnemem Wintu Indian Tribe was entitled to have \n        been included in the 1979 acknowledgement process that created \n        a list of federally recognized California tribes;\n            (2) in addition to its continuous historic relationship \n        with the Federal Government, the trust status of the Tribe was \n        reaffirmed by the provisions of the Act of July 30, 1941 (55 \n        Stat. 612, chapter 334), which granted to the United States all \n        tribal and allotted Indian land within the area embraced by the \n        Central Valley Project;\n            (3) under that Act, the Secretary, acting through the \n        Commissioner of Reclamation, on January 5, 1942, created the \n        Shasta Reservoir Indian Cemetery, which contains Winnemem Wintu \n        remains, markers, and other appurtenances held in trust by the \n        United States;\n            (4) Winnemem Wintu remains were removed to that cemetery \n        from the traditional cemetery of the Tribe in the McCloud River \n        valley that was flooded by the Shasta Reservoir;\n            (5) the Bureau of Reclamation informed the Area Director of \n        the Indian Service in writing on December 22, 1942, of the new \n        cemetery and its status as Federal trust land;\n            (6) the Secretary, through an administrative oversight or \n        inaction of the Indian Service, overlooked the trust status of \n        the Tribe, which was reaffirmed by the making of partial \n        restitution by the Secretary for the taking of tribal land and \n        the 1941 relocation of the remains of tribal members, which \n        remain interred in the Shasta Reservoir Indian Cemetery;\n            (7) the ongoing trust relationship of the Tribe with the \n        Federal Government should have been recognized by the \n        Secretary, and the Tribe should have been included in the 1979 \n        listing of federally recognized California tribes; and\n            (8) the Tribe, as a matter of sovereign choice, has \n        determined that the conduct of gaming by the Tribe would be \n        detrimental to the maintenance of its traditional tribal \n        culture.\n\nSEC. 3.
