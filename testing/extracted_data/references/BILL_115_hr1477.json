FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The construction of a wall along the southern border is \n        estimated to cost tens of billions of taxpayer dollars.\n            (2) On June 16, 2015, in New York, NY, while announcing his \n        candidacy for President of the United States, Mr. Donald Trump \n        stated ``I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls \n        better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very \n        inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern \n        border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my \n        words.''.\n            (3) On July 31, 2015 in Turnberry, Scotland, during an \n        interview on CNN, Mr. Donald Trump stated ``I will build the \n        wall and Mexico's going to pay for it and they will be happy to \n        pay for it. Because Mexico is making so much money from the \n        United States that that's going to be peanuts and all these \n        other characters say, `Oh, they won't pay, they won't pay.' \n        They don't know the first thing about how to negotiate. Trust \n        me, Mexico will pay for it.''.\n            (4) On February 25, 2016, in Houston, TX, during a \n        Republican Presidential Debate, Mr. Donald Trump stated, ``We \n        have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion dollars a year, \n        and that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across \n        and destroying our country. We're going to make them pay for \n        that wall.''.\n            (5) On August 23, 2015, during an interview on Justice with \n        Judge Jeanine, Mr. Donald Trump stated, ``We're going to build \n        a wall. It's going to be a great wall. Mexico is going to pay \n        for it.''.\n            (6) On August 31, 2016, in Phoenix, AZ, during a rally, Mr. \n        Donald Trump stated, ``We will build a great wall along the \n        southern border and Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred \n        percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for \n        the wall.''.\n            (7) On January 10, 2017, General John Kelly, President-\n        elect Trump's nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, \n        stated during his Senate confirmation hearing, ``A physical \n        barrier in and of itself--certainly as a military person that \n        understands defense and defenses--a physical barrier in and of \n        itself will not do the job, it has to be really a layered \n        defense.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
