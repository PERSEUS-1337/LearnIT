FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) School districts will need to hire more than 2,000,000 \n        teachers in the next decade. The need for teachers in the areas \n        of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special education, \n        and bilingual education, and for those able to teach in high-\n        poverty school districts will be particularly high. To meet \n        this need, talented Americans of all ages should be recruited \n        to become successful, qualified teachers.\n            (2) Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have \n        neither an undergraduate major nor minor in their main \n        assignment fields. This problem is more acute in high-poverty \n        schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.\n            (3) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) \n        ranked United States high school seniors last among 16 \n        countries in physics and next to last in mathematics. It is \n        also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on \n        academic scores, a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on the \n        academic preparation of our children in mathematics and \n        science.\n            (4) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very \n        difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly half \n        of public school teachers have students in their classrooms for \n        whom English is a second language.\n            (5) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-\n        area skills are interested in a teaching career, but need \n        assistance in getting the appropriate pedagogical training and \n        classroom experience.\n            (6) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful \n        in linking high-quality teachers to teach in high-poverty \n        districts.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to address the need of high-poverty \nschool districts for highly qualified teachers in particular subject \nareas, such as mathematics, science, foreign languages, bilingual \neducation, and special education, needed by those school districts, \nby--\n            (1) continuing and enhancing the Troops to Teachers model \n        for recruiting and supporting the placement of such teachers; \n        and\n            (2) recruiting, preparing, placing, and supporting career-\n        changing professionals who have knowledge and experience that \n        will help them become such teachers.\n\nSEC. 4.
