FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The crisis of displaced Iraqis represents a profound \n        threat to the regional stability of the Middle East and \n        confronting the humanitarian crisis in Iraq is a national \n        security interest, as well as a profound moral responsibility.\n            (2) Congress recognizes that violence in Iraq has \n        contributed to an enormous and urgent humanitarian crisis.\n            (3) At the end of 2007, the total number of displaced \n        Iraqis is estimated to be approximately 4,500,000 people: \n        2,400,000 internally displaced and with nearly as many Iraqi \n        refugees having fled the country.\n            (4) In 2006 the Iraq Study Group Report recommended that \n        ``If the [refugee and internally displaced persons] situation \n        is not addressed, Iraq and the region could be further \n        destabilized, and the humanitarian suffering could be severe'', \n        and that ``The United States should take the lead in funding \n        assistance requests from the United Nations High Commissioner \n        for Refugees, and other humanitarian agencies.''.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nGovernment, as a party to the 1967 Protocol to the 1951 United Nations \nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees, to support the rights of \ndisplaced persons and scrupulously observe the principle of non-\nrefoulement, irrespective of whether or not such persons have been \nformally recognized as refugees.\n\nSEC. 3.
