FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There are approximately 145,000 Federal employees with \n        disabilities and these employees comprise 7.5 percent of the \n        Federal workforce.\n            (2)(A) Although section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n        1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to comply with \n        Federal guidelines to ensure that electronic and information \n        technology used by such agencies is accessible to individuals \n        with disabilities, there is no enforcement mechanism in such \n        Act to provide for compliance.\n            (B) As a result, Federal agencies have an uneven record of \n        offering accessible technologies to their employees with \n        disabilities.\n            (3)(A) States or other recipients of assistance under \n        section 102 of the Technology-Related Assistance for \n        Individuals With Disabilities Act of 1988 (29 U.S.C. 2212) \n        currently are required to comply with the guidelines \n        established under section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n        1973.\n            (B) The authority for section 102 of the Technology-Related \n        Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act of 1988 is \n        expected to expire in 1998, eliminating the link between the \n        States and the guidelines established under section 508 of the \n        Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to strengthen compliance by Federal agencies with the \n        guidelines established under section 508 of the Rehabilitation \n        Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d); and\n            (2) to require States to continue to comply with such \n        guidelines.\n\nSEC. 3.
