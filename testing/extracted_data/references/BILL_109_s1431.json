FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Across the United States, family, juvenile, and \n        domestic relations courts experience shortages of qualified \n        attorneys to represent the interests of men, women, and \n        children involved in the court system.\n            (2) The Constitution of the United States provides that \n        everyone charged with a crime is entitled to adequate counsel.\n            (3) In 1967, the Supreme Court held, for the first time, \n        that children were persons under the provisions of the 14th \n        amendment to the Constitution relating to due process and \n        entitled to certain constitutional rights.\n            (4) In the case of In re Gault (387 U.S. 1) (1967), the \n        Supreme Court held that juveniles are entitled to notice of the \n        charges against them, legal counsel, questioning of witnesses, \n        and protection against self-incrimination in a hearing that \n        could result in commitment to an institution.\n            (5) Studies have indicated that many juveniles do not \n        receive the due process protections to which they are entitled. \n        More importantly, they frequently do not receive effective \n        assistance of legal counsel.\n            (6) Lawyers who represent juveniles often labor under \n        enormous caseloads with little training or support staff.\n            (7) Public defenders who represent juveniles have, on \n        average, more than 500 cases per year, with more than 300 of \n        those cases being juvenile cases.\n            (8) Public defenders often lack specialized training in \n        representing juveniles. Approximately one-half of public \n        defender offices do not even have a section devoted to juvenile \n        delinquency practice in their office training manuals.\n            (9) Due to relatively low wages, there is a nationwide \n        shortage of family law attorneys willing to represent \n        juveniles.\n            (10) The shortage of family law attorneys results in a \n        severe, disproportionate, and negative impact upon children, \n        impoverished parents, and victims of domestic violence.\n            (11) Children involved in family court cases are assigned \n        attorneys to protect their interests. Adults are entitled to \n        representation by attorneys. The lack of available \n        representation by family law attorneys causes children to spend \n        more time in foster care because cases are adjourned or \n        postponed due to lack of appropriate representation. Victims of \n        domestic violence seeking protection from their abusers often \n        will remain in the abusive situation, choose to represent \n        themselves, or wait until an attorney becomes available, all of \n        which risk their personal safety.\n            (12) In 1995, 3,100,000 children were reported to child \n        protection agencies as being abused or neglected, which is \n        about double the number reported in 1984. Of these, 996,000 \n        children were confirmed after investigation to be abused or \n        neglected. A 1996 study by the Department of Health and Human \n        Services found that the number of children seriously injured \n        nearly quadrupled between 1986 and 1993 from 141,700 to \n        565,000.\n            (13) As of 1995, year-end, about 494,000 children were in \n        foster care, a considerable rise from the estimated 280,000 \n        children in foster care at the end of 1986. Most of these \n        children were in foster care because of abuse, neglect, or \n        abandonment by their parents. Many are also placed in foster \n        care due to a court order during a child protection case.\n            (14) Some estimates suggest that in 70 percent of homes \n        where there is domestic violence, there is also child abuse.\n            (15) Children who witness domestic violence can also \n        develop posttraumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, \n        anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and destructive behavior \n        that can last through adulthood, limiting an individual's \n        ability to achieve academically, socially, and on the job. \n        However, early intervention and education can help prevent \n        further danger to children.\n            (16) Continued adjournment forces victims to repeatedly \n        confront their abusers in court. This not only increases the \n        risk of retribution, but also the chance that the victim will \n        abandon the process because of the burden.\n            (17) Between 1984 and 1994 there was a 65 percent increase \n        in domestic relations cases and a 59 percent increase in the \n        number of juvenile cases.\n            (18) The caseload for child abuse in New York State alone \n        has increased by more than 300 percent between 1984 and 1988.\n            (19) Judges in Chicago hear on average 1,700 delinquency \n        cases per month, and in Los Angeles judges for juvenile cases \n        have about 10 minutes to devote to each case.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to encourage attorneys to enter the field of family \n        law, juvenile law, or domestic relations law;\n            (2) to increase the number of attorneys who will represent \n        low-income families and individuals, and who are trained and \n        educated in such field; and\n            (3) to keep more highly trained family law, juvenile law, \n        and domestic relations attorneys in those fields of law for \n        longer periods of time.\n\nSEC. 3. LOAN FORGIVENESS.\n\n    Part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n1071 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 428K (20 U.S.C. \n1078-11) the following:\n\n``SEC. 428L.
