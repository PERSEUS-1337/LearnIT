    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Government has had continuous \n        dealings with the Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation from 1771 until at \n        least 1961. The Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation is the descendant of, \n        and political successor to, the signatories of the June 10, \n        1851, Fort Tejon Treaty.\n            (2) The Gabrieleno/Tongva Nation traditionally occupied the \n        entire Los Angeles Basin and the islands of Santa Catalina, San \n        Nicholas, and San Clemente, from Topanga Canyon to Laguna \n        Beach, from the San Gabriel Mountains to the sea, in most of \n        what is now Los Angeles and Orange Counties.\n            (3) Several Federal officials have in the past recognized \n        the Nation. In 1851 and 1852, the United States Government sent \n        Commissioner Barbour to treat with the Indians of Los Angeles, \n        but he was called away. Also in 1852, Superintendent of Indian \n        Affairs E.F. Beale noted a numerous Indian population within \n        Los Angeles County. In 1855, Superintendent of Indian Affairs \n        Henley noted that the Indians in and around Los Angeles should \n        be moved to a reservation. Records show that a small number of \n        the Nation lived at the Sebastian Reserve at the Tejon Pass, \n        part of Los Angeles County. In the 1870s former Mission Indian \n        Agent J.Q. Stanley noted the grievances of the Indians living \n        at Mission San Gabriel.\n            (4) Scholars and academics have also noted the existence of \n        the Nation. Helen Hunt Jackson, in the mid-1880s noted that the \n        Gabrieleno/Tongva were continuing to live in the San Gabriel \n        area where many worked as day laborers. At the turn of the \n        century, C. Hart Merriam and J.P. Harrington indicated that \n        there were some groups of the Nation living at the Tejon \n        Reservation, and further noted that one of the tribes \n        represented at the reservation was the ``Tongva of San \n        Gabriel''.\n            (5) In the early 1900s, the Federal Government allowed \n        Nation members, most of whom were of one-half Indian blood, to \n        register at the Sherman Indian School in Riverside, California.\n            (6) The United States purchased land for the Nation in 1913 \n        according to the Kelsey Map of Indians of California, which \n        indicates a symbol corresponding to ``lands recently \n        purchased'' at the site of San Gabriel.\n            (7) By 1928, many Nation members were still living in their \n        traditional area of San Gabriel and identifying themselves as \n        tribal members, as evidenced by the California Indians' \n        Jurisdictional Act. This Act authorized the Secretary to create \n        a roll of California Indians for payment purposes. There are at \n        least 150 Gabrieleno/Tongvas on this roll, approximately fifty \n        with one-half degree Indian blood or more, and 128 of at least \n        one-quarter Indian blood.\n            (8) The Nation's membership has historically included and \n        presently includes a verifiable half-blood community, which is \n        eligible for organization under section 19 of the Act of June \n        18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 479, commonly referred to as the Indian \n        Reorganization Act), but the Bureau of Indian Affairs ignored \n        the half-blood community and led the Nation to believe that it \n        could not organize as a half-blood community.\n            (9) The Nation has been politically active at the national \n        level via the Mission Indian Federation, which lobbied the \n        Congress for various Indian causes from the 1920s to the 1950s. \n        The Nation was also a plaintiff in an Indian Claims Commission \n        case in 1949. Forty-six bands filed suit, including the Tongva. \n        The Bureau of Indian Affairs approved contracts for each band \n        and included the Nation in all negotiations. After twelve \n        years, all 46 bands were required to vote on a settlement, and \n        the registers of voters indicated that the Nation members who \n        voted at these meetings were, or are, relatives of presentday \n        tribal members.\n            (10) The State of California recognized the Gabrieleno/\n        Tongva in 1994, stating, ``The State of California...takes \n        pride in recognizing the Indian inhabitants of the Los Angeles \n        Basin and the continued existence of the Indian community \n        within our State''. (``Certificate of Recognition'', signed by \n        California Assembly member Diane Martinez, 1994). Furthermore, \n        the city of San Gabriel recognizes the Gabrieleno/Tongva \n        Nation.\n            (11) The Nation has maintained its distinct community on \n        its ancestral lands in San Gabriel and has maintained its \n        unique culture and identity and maintains governance through a \n        viable tribal government and a constitution and bylaws.\n\nSEC. 3.
