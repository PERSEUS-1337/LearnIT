FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internet has become an important channel of \n        commerce in the United States, accounting for billions of \n        dollars in retail sales every year. Over half of all American \n        adults have now either made an online purchase or an online \n        travel reservation.\n            (2) Consumer confidence is essential to the growth of \n        online commerce. To continue its development as a marketplace, \n        the Internet must provide consumers with clear, accurate \n        information and give sellers an opportunity to fairly compete \n        with one another for consumers' business.\n            (3) An investigation by the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n        Science, and Transportation found abundant evidence that the \n        aggressive sales tactics many companies use against their \n        online customers have undermined consumer confidence in the \n        Internet and thereby harmed the American economy.\n            (4) The Committee showed that, in exchange for ``bounties'' \n        and other payments, hundreds of reputable online retailers and \n        Web sites shared their customers' billing information, \n        including credit card and debit card numbers, with third party \n        sellers through a process known as ``data pass''. These third \n        party sellers in turn used aggressive, misleading sales tactics \n        to charge millions of American consumers for membership clubs \n        the consumers did not want.\n            (5) Third party sellers offered membership clubs to \n        consumers as they were in the process of completing their \n        initial transactions on hundreds of Web sites. These third \n        party ``post-transaction'' offers were designed to make \n        consumers think the offers were part of the initial purchase, \n        rather than a new transaction with a new seller.\n            (6) Third party sellers charged millions of consumers for \n        membership clubs without ever obtaining consumers' billing \n        information, including their credit or debit card information, \n        directly from the consumers. Because third party sellers \n        acquired consumers' billing information from the initial \n        merchant through ``data pass'', millions of consumers were \n        unaware they had been enrolled in membership clubs.\n            (7) The use of a ``data pass'' process defied consumers' \n        expectations that they could only be charged for a good or a \n        service if they submitted their billing information, including \n        their complete credit or debit card numbers.\n            (8) Third party sellers used a free trial period to enroll \n        members, after which they periodically charged consumers until \n        consumers affirmatively canceled the memberships. This use of \n        ``free-to-pay conversion'' and ``negative option'' sales took \n        advantage of consumers' expectations that they would have an \n        opportunity to accept or reject the membership club offer at \n        the end of the trial period.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS AGAINST CERTAIN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE INTERNET \n              SALES PRACTICES.\n\n    (a) Requirements for Certain Internet-Based Sales.--It shall be \nunlawful for any post-transaction third party seller to charge or \nattempt to charge any consumer's credit card, debit card, bank account, \nor other financial account for any good or service sold in a \ntransaction effected on the Internet, unless--\n            (1) before obtaining the consumer's billing information, \n        the post-transaction third party seller has clearly and \n        conspicuously disclosed to the consumer all material terms of \n        the transaction, including--\n                    (A) a description of the goods or services being \n                offered;\n                    (B) the fact that the post-transaction third party \n                seller is not affiliated with the initial merchant, \n                which may include disclosure of the name of the post-\n                transaction third party in a manner that clearly \n                differentiates the post-transaction third party seller \n                from the initial merchant; and\n                    (C) the cost of such goods or services; and\n            (2) the post-transaction third party seller has received \n        the express informed consent for the charge from the consumer \n        whose credit card, debit card, bank account, or other financial \n        account will be charged by--\n                    (A) obtaining from the consumer--\n                            (i) the full account number of the account \n                        to be charged; and\n                            (ii) the consumer's name and address and a \n                        means to contact the consumer; and\n                    (B) requiring the consumer to perform an additional \n                affirmative action, such as clicking on a confirmation \n                button or checking a box that indicates the consumer's \n                consent to be charged the amount disclosed.\n    (b) Prohibition on Data-Pass Used To Facilitate Certain Deceptive \nInternet Sales Transactions.--It shall be unlawful for an initial \nmerchant to disclose a credit card, debit card, bank account, or other \nfinancial account number, or to disclose other billing information that \nis used to charge a customer of the initial merchant, to any post-\ntransaction third party seller for use in an Internet-based sale of any \ngoods or services from that post-transaction third party seller.\n    (c) Limitations on Use of Negative Option Feature in Internet-Based \nSales Transactions.--It shall be unlawful for any person to charge or \nattempt to charge any consumer for any goods or services sold in a \ntransaction effected on the Internet through a negative option feature, \nunless--\n            (1) before obtaining the consumer's initial agreement to \n        participate, the seller has clearly and conspicuously disclosed \n        all material terms of the transaction, including--\n                    (A) the name of the entity offering the goods or \n                services;\n                    (B) a description of the goods or services being \n                offered;\n                    (C) the cost of such goods or services;\n                    (D) notice of when billing will begin and at what \n                intervals the charges will occur;\n                    (E) the length of any trial period;\n                    (F) a statement that the consumer's account will be \n                charged unless the consumer takes affirmative action \n                and the steps the consumer must take to the avoid the \n                charge; and\n                    (G) instructions for stopping the recurring charges \n                in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (3);\n            (2) the seller has obtained the express informed consent \n        described in subsection (a)(2) from the consumer before \n        charging or attempting to charge the consumer's credit card, \n        debit card, bank account, or other financial account on a \n        recurring basis; and\n            (3) the seller enables the consumer to stop recurring \n        charges from being made to the consumer's credit card, debit \n        card, bank account, or other financial account through a simple \n        process that is available via the Internet and email.\n    (d) Application With Other Law.--Nothing in this Act shall be \nconstrued to supersede, modify, or otherwise affect the requirements of \nthe Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq.) or any \nregulation promulgated thereunder.\n    (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Initial merchant.--The term ``initial merchant'' means \n        a person that has obtained a consumer's billing information \n        directly from the consumer through an Internet transaction \n        initiated by the consumer.\n            (2) Negative option feature.--The term ``negative option \n        feature'' has the meaning given that term in section 310.2(t) \n        of the Federal Trade Commission's Telemarketing Sales Rule \n        regulations (16 C.F.R. 310.2(t)).\n            (3) Post-transaction third party seller.--The term ``post-\n        transaction third party seller'' means a person that--\n                    (A) sells, or offers for sale, any good or service \n                on the Internet;\n                    (B) solicits the purchase of such goods or services \n                on the Internet through an initial merchant after the \n                consumer has initiated a transaction with the initial \n                merchant;
