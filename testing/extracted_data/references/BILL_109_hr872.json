FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since 1988, Congress has authorized certified nurse-\n        midwives (in this section referred to as ``CNMs'') to provide \n        maternity-related services to Medicare-eligible women who are \n        of childbearing age. Approximately 3,000,000 disabled women are \n        Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. In 1993, Congress authorized \n        CNMs to also provide additional services outside the maternity \n        cycle. Medicare reimburses CNMs for primary care services if \n        those services are part of the practitioner's State-regulated \n        scope of practice.\n            (2) In its June 2002 report to Congress, the Medicare \n        Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) unanimously recommended \n        that the percentage of part B reimbursement for certified \n        nurse-midwife services to be increased.\n            (3) In this same report, MedPAC also stated that research \n        shows the quality of care and outcomes for services provided by \n        CNMs are at least comparable to obstetricians and \n        gynecologists.\n            (4) A 1998 study from the National Center for Health \n        Statistics published Journal of Epidemiology and Community \n        Health found the risk of experiencing an infant death was 19 \n        percent lower for births attended by CNMs than for births \n        attended by physicians. The risk of neonatal mortality (an \n        infant death occurring in the first 28 days of life) was 33 \n        percent lower, and the risk of delivering a low birth weight \n        infant was 31 percent lower. Mean birth weight was 37 grams \n        heavier for the CNM-attended than for the physician-attended \n        births. Low birth weight is a major predictor of infant \n        mortality, subsequent disease, or developmental disabilities.\n            (5) The study also found that CNMs attended a greater \n        proportion of women who are at higher risk for poor birth \n        outcome: African Americans, American Indians, teenagers, \n        unmarried women, and those with less than a high school \n        education. Physicians attended a slightly higher proportion of \n        births with medical complications. However, birth outcomes for \n        CNMs were better even after socio-demographic and medical risk \n        factors were controlled for in statistical analyses.\n            (6) Medicare covers 3,000,000 women with disabilities that \n        are of childbearing age. These women give birth to \n        approximately 50,000 infants annually within the program.\n            (7) CNMs and certified midwives (in this section referred \n        to as ``CMs'') are highly educated health professionals. \n        Completion of a post-baccalaureate educational program, \n        licensure, and passage of a national certification examination \n        are required to become CNMs and CMs.\n            (8) Inequitable reimbursement for obstetrical and \n        gynecological services provided by CNMs or CMs jeopardizes \n        access for women (particularly those covered by Medicare) to \n        the health care provider of their choice.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR CERTIFIED NURSE-MIDWIFE AND MIDWIFE \n              SERVICES.\n\n    (a) Certified Midwife, Certified Midwife Services Defined.--(1) \nSection 1861(gg) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(gg)) is \namended by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n    ``(3) The term `certified midwife services' means such services \nfurnished by a certified midwife (as defined in paragraph (4)) and such \nservices and supplies furnished as an incident to the certified \nmidwife's service which the certified midwife is legally authorized to \nperform under State law (or the State regulatory mechanism provided by \nState law) as would otherwise be payable under this title if furnished \nby a physician or as an incident to a physician's service.\n    ``(4) The term `certified midwife' means an individual who has \nsuccessfully completed a bachelor's degree from an accredited \neducational institution and a program of study and clinical experience \nmeeting guidelines prescribed by the Secretary, or has been certified \nby an organization recognized by the Secretary.''.\n    (2) The heading in section 1861(gg) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1395x(gg)) is amended to read as follows:\n\n   ``Certified Nurse-Midwife Services;
