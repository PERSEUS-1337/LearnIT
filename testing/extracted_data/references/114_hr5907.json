FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Responsible community mortgage lenders engaged in \n        traditional mortgage lending were not responsible for the \n        recent mortgage crisis.\n            (2) Responsible community mortgage lenders provide a \n        valuable and critical service to consumers by, among other \n        things, fulfilling the housing finance needs of the communities \n        they serve and providing locally based alternative sources for \n        mortgage financing.\n            (3) The activities and business practices of responsible \n        community mortgage lenders do not pose a substantial risk to \n        consumers, and did not pose a substantial risk to consumers \n        when the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \n        Act was enacted.\n            (4) Responsible community mortgage lenders are subject to \n        the oversight and control of various governmental authorities \n        and nongovernmental actors, including the Bureau of Consumer \n        Financial Protection, the Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development, the Federal Trade Commission, State supervisory \n        regulators, local government supervisory regulators, mortgage \n        loan investors, warehouse lenders, and various other \n        authorities or entities. As a result of this oversight and \n        control, the business practices and activities of responsible \n        community mortgage lenders are safe, transparent to the public \n        and the government, and do not pose a threat to consumers, the \n        public at large, the United States financial markets, or the \n        United States economy in general.\n            (5) Responsible community mortgage lenders are unreasonably \n        burdened by increasing regulation geared to problems that they \n        did not create and activities that they did not and do not \n        engage in, and therefore responsible community mortgage lenders \n        are entitled to relief from certain provisions of the Dodd-\n        Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its \n        attendant regulations, including the regulations of the Bureau \n        of Consumer Financial Protection.\n            (6) Without relief many responsible community mortgage \n        lenders will be driven from the market thus limiting the \n        consumer's ability to choose a local lender for mortgage \n        financing and dangerously consolidating the mortgage lending \n        market into a smaller number of lenders.\n            (7) The preservation of responsible community mortgage \n        lenders is critical to preserving competition and preventing \n        increasing concentration in mortgage lending.\n            (8) The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection should \n        prioritize its resources and ability to carry out examinations \n        by creating reasonable exclusions for smaller, responsible \n        mortgage lenders.\n\nSEC. 3.
