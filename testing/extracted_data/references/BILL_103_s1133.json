FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) there has been substantial work done to identify \n        infants and children--\n                    (A) who are born to young single mothers, substance \n                abusing women, homeless women, women who are \n                economically and educationally disadvantaged, and women \n                in unstable domestic situations; and\n                    (B) born, in many instances, to women who are \n                involved, or at risk of becoming involved, with the \n                foster care or child justice system;\n            (2) numerous nonresidential programs have been established \n        to improve infant and child outcomes for children born to poor, \n        young, and generally single mothers, and many of these programs \n        have been successful; and\n            (3) residential programs have been demonstrated to be very \n        effective for, and are critically important to, special \n        populations of high-risk and disadvantaged pregnant women, \n        including--\n                    (A) those who are addicted or at-risk for substance \n                abuse;\n                    (B) those who are homeless;\n                    (C) those in unstable domestic situations; and\n                    (D) women with other high-risk characteristics, \n                such as previous or current involvement with the foster \n                care or child justice system.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish \nresidential programs for special populations of high-risk and \ndisadvantaged pregnant women and their children that will provide \ncomprehensive support services to protect and enhance the first year of \nlife of the children of such women and provide the mothers of such \nchildren with an opportunity for a proper maternal beginning. Such \nprograms will target the women described in subsection (a)(3) and \nprovide a more intensive array of the many services that are part of \nnonresidential programs, together with vocational, home management, and \ntransitional housing assistance.\n\nSEC. 2.
