FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) several rivers flow between, or are common to, 2 or \n        more State boundaries;\n            (2) in many cases, there is not a single entity which has \n        complete jurisdictional responsibility for the fisheries \n        resources in these rivers;\n            (3) a strong partnership between Federal and State \n        governmental authorities is vital in coordinating and \n        facilitating cooperative research and in resolving problems \n        associated with large river ecosystems because, among other \n        reasons, many fishery management problems are caused by \n        federally regulated activities (including activities resulting \n        in point and nonpoint pollution) and federally constructed \n        projects (including dams and navigation facilities);\n            (4) in some rivers, the once rich assemblages of fish fauna \n        and diverse habitats have been lost and formerly abundant \n        native fish now exist only as endangered or depleted \n        populations;\n            (5) without positive management actions, native species in \n        some rivers will continue to decline, fostering even greater \n        conflicts among water users;\n            (6) construction of waterway developments (including \n        navigation, flood control, water level fluctuation, power \n        generation, irrigation, and general water depletion projects) \n        is accelerating and increasingly degrading large river \n        ecosystems nationwide;\n            (7) the United States public will face reduced \n        opportunities for recreational, commercial, subsistence, and \n        aesthetic uses of river systems without demonstrable change in \n        management strategies in the near future;\n            (8) several programs have been proposed or are underway to \n        resolve conflicts in these management strategies;\n            (9) in one of these programs, Federal, State, and local \n        fisheries managers in the Mississippi River drainage basin have \n        entered into the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource \n        Agreement under which the managers will share resources, \n        facilities, and funding for preparation and development of \n        long-range strategic plans for management of the drainage \n        basin's interjurisdictional fisheries;\n            (10) the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource \n        Agreement merits detailed evaluation as a model for the \n        development of long-range strategic plans for the management of \n        interjurisdictional rivers fisheries resources; and\n            (11) to ensure that these programs are appropriately \n        coordinated and to conserve the fisheries resources in \n        interjurisdictional rivers, there is a need for strategies to \n        improve coordination, cooperation, research, and information \n        sharing.\n\nSEC. 3. COUNCIL ON INTERJURISDICTIONAL RIVERS FISHERIES.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established a council to be known as \nthe ``Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries'' (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Council'').\n    (b) Duties.--\n            (1) In general.--The Council shall develop recommendations \n        for cooperative action strategies on the management of \n        interjurisdictional rivers fisheries.\n            (2) Contents of strategies.--The recommended strategies to \n        be developed by the Council under this subsection shall at a \n        minimum contain the following:\n                    (A) A listing of the 10 highest priority \n                interjurisdictional rivers in need of cooperative \n                fisheries management.\n                    (B) Comprehensive fishery strategic plans for the 5 \n                highest priority interjurisdictional rivers identified \n                pursuant to subparagraph (A), including goals, \n                objectives, implementation schedules, and estimates of \n                costs necessary to fully develop and implement the \n                strategic plans.\n            (3) Considerations.--In developing a listing of the highest \n        priority interjurisdictional rivers in developing and \n        comprehensive fishery strategic plans, the Council shall \n        consider the following:\n                    (A) The nature and severity of problems of the \n                interjurisdictional rivers creating the need for \n                enhanced cooperation.\n                    (B) The adequacy of existing management programs \n                for the interjurisdictional rivers to address these \n                problems.\n                    (C) The status and trends of fisheries resources in \n                the interjurisdictional rivers.\n                    (D) The biological, physical, geologic, and \n                hydrographic characteristics of the interjurisdictional \n                rivers and the economic demands (including water uses) \n                on these rivers.\n            (4) Review and approval of strategic plans by states.--The \n        Council may not issue a cooperative action strategy under this \n        section in final form unless--\n                    (A) the Council has submitted each comprehensive \n                fishery strategic plan contained in the strategy to \n                each State having jurisdiction over an \n                interjurisdictional river that is covered by the plan; \n                and\n                    (B) the director of each State fish and wildlife \n                agency has been offered the opportunity to choose \n                whether the strategy will be applicable to his State.\n    (c) Membership.--\n            (1) Number and appointment.--The Council shall be composed \n        of 13 members as follows:\n                    (A) The Secretary (or the Secretary's designee) who \n                shall serve as chairperson of the Council.\n                    (B) 7 individuals appointed by the Secretary who \n                are qualified to serve on the Council by virtue of \n                being the director of a State fish and wildlife agency \n                which represents 1 of the following major \n                interjurisdictional drainage systems of the United \n                States: the upper Mississippi, lower Mississippi, \n                Colorado, Missouri, Ohio, Pacific Coastal, and Atlantic \n                Coastal Systems.\n                    (C) The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of \n                the National Marine Fisheries Service of the Department \n                of Commerce (or the Assistant Administrator's \n                designee).\n                    (D) The Secretary of the Department of Energy (or \n                the Secretary's designee).\n                    (E) The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil \n                Works (or the Assistant Secretary's designee).\n                    (F) The Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority \n                (or the Chairman's designee).\n                    (G) One member of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n                Commission to be appointed by the Secretary (or the \n                member's designee).\n            (2) Terms.--Members shall be appointed for a term of 3 \n        years.\n            (3) Vacancies.--A vacancy on the Council shall be filled in \n        the manner in which the original appointment was made.
