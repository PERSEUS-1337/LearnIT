SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians of the \nSpokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable Compensation Settlement \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) from 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the \n        Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its \n        tributaries to determine sites at which power could be produced \n        at low cost;\n            (2) the Corps of Engineers--\n                    (A) identified a number of sites, including the \n                site at which the Grand Coulee Dam is located; and\n                    (B) recommended that power development at those \n                sites be performed by local governmental authorities or \n                private utilities under the Federal Power Act (16 \n                U.S.C. 791a et seq.);\n            (3) under section 10(e) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e)), a \n        licensee is required to compensate an Indian tribe for the use \n        of land under the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe;\n            (4) in August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an \n        agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary \n        permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power \n        development at the Grand Coulee site;\n            (5) in the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is not \n        subject to the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.)--\n                    (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project; and\n                    (B) began construction of the Grand Coulee Dam;\n            (6) at the time at which the Grand Coulee Dam project was \n        federalized, the Federal Government recognized that the Spokane \n        Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation \n        had compensable interests in the Grand Coulee Dam project, \n        including compensation for--\n                    (A) the development of hydropower;\n                    (B) the extinguishment of a salmon fishery on which \n                the Spokane Tribe was almost completely financially \n                dependent; and\n                    (C) the inundation of land with loss of potential \n                power sites previously identified by the Spokane Tribe;\n            (7) in the Act of June 29, 1940, Congress--\n                    (A) in the first section (16 U.S.C. 835d) granted \n                to the United States--\n                            (i) all rights of Indian tribes in land of \n                        the Spokane Tribe and Colville Indian \n                        Reservations that were required for the Grand \n                        Coulee Dam project; and\n                            (ii) various rights-of-way over other land \n                        under the jurisdiction of Indian tribes that \n                        were required in connection with the project; \n                        and\n                    (B) in section 2 (16 U.S.C. 835e) provided that \n                compensation for the land and rights-of-way was to be \n                determined by the Secretary of the Interior in such \n                amounts as the Secretary determined to be just and \n                equitable;\n            (8) in furtherance of that Act, the Secretary of the \n        Interior paid--\n                    (A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700; and\n                    (B) to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n                Reservation, $63,000;\n            (9) in 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the \n        Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal \n        Claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \n        Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the \n        Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the United \n        States that provided for damages and annual payments of \n        $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually, based on revenues \n        from the sale of electric power from the Grand Coulee Dam \n        project and transmission of that power by the Bonneville Power \n        Administration;\n            (10) in legal opinions issued by the Office of the \n        Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, a Task Force Study \n        conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Committee on \n        Appropriations of the Senate, and hearings before Congress at \n        the time at which the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n        Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act (Public Law 103-\n        436; 108 Stat. 4577) was enacted, it has repeatedly been \n        recognized that--\n                    (A) the Spokane Tribe suffered damages similar to \n                those suffered by, and had a case legally comparable to \n                that of, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \n                Reservation; but\n                    (B) the 5-year statute of limitations under the Act \n                of August 13, 1946 (25 U.S.C. 70 et seq.) precluded the \n                Spokane Tribe from bringing a civil action for damages \n                under that Act;\n            (11) the inability of the Spokane Tribe to bring a civil \n        action before the Indian Claims Commission can be attributed to \n        a combination of factors, including--\n                    (A) the failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to \n                carry out its advisory responsibilities in accordance \n                with that Act; and\n                    (B) an attempt by the Commissioner of Indian \n                Affairs to impose improper requirements on claims \n                attorneys retained by Indian tribes, which caused \n                delays in retention of counsel and full investigation \n                of the potential claims of the Spokane Tribe;\n            (12) as a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee \n        Dam project, the Spokane Tribe--\n                    (A) has suffered the loss of--\n                            (i) the salmon fishery on which the Spokane \n                        Tribe was dependent;\n                            (ii) identified hydropower sites that the \n                        Spokane Tribe could have developed; and\n                            (iii) hydropower revenues that the Spokane \n                        Tribe would have received under the Federal \n                        Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.) had the \n                        project not been federalized; and\n                    (B) continues to lose hydropower revenues that the \n                Federal Government recognized were owed to the Spokane \n                Tribe at the time at which the project was constructed; \n                and\n            (13) more than 39 percent of the land owned by Indian \n        tribes or members of Indian tribes that was used for the Grand \n        Coulee Dam project was land of the Spokane Tribe.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable \ncompensation to the Spokane Tribe, using the same proportional basis as \nwas used in providing compensation to the Confederated Tribes of the \nColville Reservation, for the losses suffered as a result of the \nconstruction and operation of the Grand Coulee Dam project.\n\nSEC. 4.
