FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Committee on Armed Services of the Senate noted in \n        the report accompanying S. 1356 (S. Rept. 114-49; 114th \n        Congress) that since 1960, the Department of Defense has \n        invested more than $6,000,000,000 in directed energy science \n        and technology initiatives, and that the Committee is concerned \n        that, despite this significant investment, the Department's \n        directed energy initiatives are not resourced at levels \n        necessary to transition them to full-scale acquisition \n        programs.\n            (2) The Defense Science Board Task Force on Directed Energy \n        Weapon Systems and Technology Applications (the ``Task Force'') \n        found that ``directed energy offers promise as a \n        transformational `game changer' in military operations, able to \n        augment and improve operational capabilities in many areas''.\n            (3) Despite this potential, years of investment have not \n        resulted in any operational systems with high energy laser \n        capability.\n            (4) The Task Force believes that the range of potential \n        application is sufficient to warrant significantly increased \n        attention to the scope and direction of efforts to assess, \n        develop, and field appropriate laser, microwave, and millimeter \n        wave weapons.\n\nSEC. 3. INCLUSION OF DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPON SYSTEM PROGRAMS IN THE \n              RAPID ACQUISITION AUTHORITY PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 806(c)(1) of the Bob Stump National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-314; 10 \nU.S.C. 2302 note) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsubparagraph:\n            ``(D)(i) In the case of any supplies and associated support \n        services that, as determined in writing by the Secretary of \n        Defense without delegation, are urgently needed to eliminate a \n        deficiency in directed energy weapon systems, the Secretary may \n        use the procedures developed under this section in order to \n        accomplish the rapid acquisition and deployment of needed \n        offensive or defensive directed energy weapon systems \n        capabilities, supplies, and associated support services.\n            ``(ii) For the purposes of directed energy weapon systems \n        acquisition, the Secretary of Defense shall consider use of the \n        following procedures:\n                    ``(I) The rapid acquisition authority provided \n                under this section.\n                    ``(II) Use of other transactions authority provided \n                under section 2371 of title 10, United States Code.\n                    ``(III) The acquisition of commercial items using \n                simplified acquisition procedures.\n                    ``(IV) The authority for procurement for \n                experimental purposes provided under section 2373 of \n                title 10, United States Code.\n            ``(iii) In this subparagraph, the term `directed energy \n        weapon system' means military action involving the use of \n        directed energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy \n        equipment, facilities, or personnel.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 2373 of title 10, United States \nCode, is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``and aeronautical \n        supplies'' and inserting ``, aeronautical supplies, and \n        directed energy weapon systems''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end of the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) Directed Energy Weapon System Defined.--In this section, the \nterm `directed energy weapon system' means military action involving \nthe use of directed energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy \nequipment, facilities, or personnel.''.\n\nSEC. 4. JOINT DIRECTED ENERGY PROGRAM OFFICE.\n\n    (a) Redesignation.--The High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office \nof the Department of Defense is hereby redesignated as the ``Joint \nDirected Energy Program Office'' (in this section referred to as the \n``Office'').\n    (b) Strategic Plan for Development and Transition of Directed \nEnergy Weapons Capabilities Toward Fielding.--In addition to the \nfunctions and duties of the Office in effect on the day before the date \nof the enactment of this Act, the Office shall develop a strategic plan \nfor development and transition of directed energy weapons capabilities \ntoward fielding for the Department, in which the Office may define \nrequirements for directed energy capabilities that address the highest \npriority warfighting capability gaps of the Department.\n    (c) Acceleration of Development and Transition of Directed Energy \nWeapons Capabilities Toward Fielding.--\n            (1) In general.--To the degree practicable, the Office \n        shall use the policies of the Department that are revised \n        pursuant to this Act and new acquisition and management \n        practices established pursuant to this Act to accelerate the \n        development and transition of directed energy capabilities \n        toward fielding.\n            (2) Engagement.--The Secretary shall ensure that use of \n        policies and practices described in paragraph (1) include \n        engagement with defense and private industries, research \n        universities, and unaffiliated, nonprofit research \n        institutions."
