PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study, and \nreport to the Congress recommendations on, how the States might improve \nand expand their systems for alternative certification of teachers. The \nCommission is also to make recommendations on the appropriate steps the \nFederal Government might take in fostering improvement and expansion of \nStates' alternative certification programs for teachers.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Interest among the States in providing alternate routes \n        for certifying teachers is escalating.\n            (2) In 1998 and 1999 alone, States developed 10 new \n        alternate route programs. In the past 2 years, 14 States have \n        passed, introduced, or plan to introduce, new legislation to \n        establish alternative programs for the preparation and \n        certification of individuals who have a bachelor's degree and \n        want to become teachers.\n            (3) More than 125,000 individuals have been certified \n        through alternative routes. In 1998 and 1999, more than 24,000 \n        teachers were certified through alternative routes in just the \n        28 States that collected these data.\n            (4) 40 States have some type of alternative to going back \n        to college and majoring in education in order to become a \n        teacher. The States currently report 115 such programs.\n            (5) People from all walks of life are stepping forward to \n        meet the projected demand for teachers. Many of these \n        individuals already have at least a bachelor's degree, and for \n        these individuals, the old model of training teachers in \n        undergraduate education programs is not practical. States are \n        aggressively meeting the challenge by creating new training and \n        licensing avenues for people to enter the teaching profession.\n            (6) These alternative teacher certification routes provide \n        opportunities for people from various educational backgrounds \n        and walks of life to become teachers. They have opened doors to \n        teaching for persons switching careers, leaving the military, \n        and graduating from liberal arts colleges. They have also \n        provided opportunities for former teachers who want to upgrade \n        their credentials and get back into teaching and for people who \n        trained to teach years ago but never did.\n            (7) In 1999, 36 States reported that they had programs \n        targeted specifically to bring into the teaching profession \n        individuals from careers other than education, the individuals \n        formerly in the military, retirees, liberal arts graduates, and \n        others.\n            (8) Compared with recent college graduates who come into \n        teaching directly from a traditional teacher preparation \n        program, those entering teaching through alternate routes--\n                    (A) have degrees with majors in subjects other than \n                education;\n                    (B) are more likely to have work experience in \n                occupations other than education;\n                    (C) tend to be older;\n                    (D) are more likely to be people of color; and\n                    (E) are more likely to be men.\n            (9) Those entering teaching through alternate routes are \n        more likely to teach where job demand is greatest, such as in \n        inner cities and outlying rural areas, and in high-demand \n        subject areas.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMISSION ON ALTERNATIVE \n              ROUTES TO TEACHER CERTIFICATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--There is established within the executive branch a \nNational Advisory Commission on Alternative Routes to Teacher \nCertification (in this Act referred to as the ``Commission''), \ncomprised of 10 members to be appointed by the Secretary of Education. \nThe membership of the Commission shall be as follows:\n            (1) 2 members who currently serve as college professors in \n        schools of education.\n            (2) 2 members who currently serve as State teacher \n        licensure officials.\n            (3) 2 members who currently serve as classroom teachers.\n            (4) 2 members who serve as superintendents or comparable \n        local educational agency officials.\n            (5) 2 members who have special expertise in the alternative \n        certification of teachers, including individuals currently \n        involved in providing alternative routes to teaching and \n        certification.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nSecretary of Education should draw from a number of important areas of \nexpertise in appointing the Commission, including various experts \nfamiliar with the issue of teacher licensure and, in particular, \nalternative teacher certification.\n    (c) Appointments.--Appointments to the Commission shall be made not \nlater than 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
