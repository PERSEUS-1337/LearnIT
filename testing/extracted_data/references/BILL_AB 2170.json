In determining the projects eligible for funding, the commission shall consult the Transportation Agency\u2019s state freight plan as described in Section 13978.8 of the Government Code and the California Sustainable Freight Action Plan released in July 2016 pursuant to Executive Order B-32-15. The commission shall also consult trade infrastructure and goods movement plans adopted by regional transportation planning agencies, adopted regional transportation plans required by state and federal law, and the applicable port master plan when determining eligible projects for funding. Eligible projects for the funding described in subdivision (a) shall further the state\u2019s economic, environmental, and public health objectives and goals for freight policy, as articulated in the plans to be consulted pursuant to this subdivision, and may include, but are not limited to, all of the following:\n(1) Highway capacity improvements, rail landside access improvements, landside freight access improvements to airports, and operational improvements to more efficiently accommodate the movement of freight, particularly for ingress and egress to and from the state\u2019s land ports of entry, rail terminals, and seaports, including navigable inland waterways used to transport freight between seaports, land ports of entry, and airports, and to relieve traffic congestion along major trade or goods movement corridors.\n(2) Freight rail system improvements to enhance the ability to move goods from seaports, land ports of entry, and airports to warehousing and distribution centers throughout California, including projects that separate rail lines from highway or local road traffic, improve freight rail mobility through mountainous regions, relocate rail switching yards, and other projects that improve the efficiency and capacity of the rail freight system.\n(3) Projects to enhance the capacity and efficiency of ports.\n(4) Truck corridor and capital and operational improvements, including dedicated truck facilities or truck toll facilities.\n(5) Border capital and operational improvements that enhance goods movement between California and Mexico and that maximize the state\u2019s ability to access funds made available to the state by federal law.\n(6) Surface transportation and connector road improvements to effectively facilitate the movement of goods, particularly for ingress and egress to and from the state\u2019s land ports of entry, airports, and seaports, to relieve traffic congestion along major trade or goods movement corridors.\n(d) (1) In selecting projects for inclusion in the program of projects to be funded with funds described in subdivision (a), the commission shall evaluate the total potential costs and total potential economic and noneconomic benefits of the program to California\u2019s economy, environment, and public health. The commission shall consult with the State Air Resources Board in order to utilize the appropriate models, techniques, and methods to develop the parameters for evaluation of projects. The commission shall allocate the funding described in subdivision (a) for trade infrastructure improvements consistent with Section 8879.52 of the Government Code and the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund (TCIF) Guidelines adopted by the commission on November 27, 2007, or as amended by the commission, and in a manner that (A) addresses the state\u2019s most urgent needs, (B) balances the demands of various land ports of entry, seaports, and airports, (C) provides reasonable geographic balance between the state\u2019s regions, (D) places emphasis on projects that improve trade corridor mobility and safety while reducing emissions of diesel particulates, greenhouse gases, and other pollutants, and reducing other negative community impacts, and (E) makes a significant contribution to the state\u2019s economy. The commission shall adopt any amendments to the 2007 guidelines on or before April 1, 2017.\n(2) In adopting amended guidelines, and developing and adopting the program of projects, the commission shall do all of the following:\n(A) Accept nominations for projects to be included in the program of projects from regional and local transportation agencies and the Department of Transportation.\n(B) Recognize the key role of the state in project identification and support integrating statewide goods movement priorities into the corridor approach.\n(C) Make a finding that adoption and delivery of the program of projects is in the public interest.\n(3) In addition, the commission shall also consider the following factors when allocating these funds:\n(A) \u201cVelocity,\u201d which means the speed by which large cargo would travel from the land port of entry or seaport through the distribution system.\n(B) \u201cThroughput,\u201d which means the volume of cargo that would move from the land port of entry or seaport through the distribution system.\n(C) \u201cReliability,\u201d which means a reasonably consistent and predictable amount of time for cargo to travel from one point to another on any given day or at any given time in California.\n(D) \u201cCongestion reduction,\u201d which means the reduction in recurrent daily hours of delay to be achieved.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 2192.2 of the Streets and Highways Code is amended to read:\n2192.2.\nThe commission shall allocate funds made available by this chapter to projects that have identified and committed supplemental funding from appropriate local, federal, or private sources. The commission shall determine the appropriate amount of supplemental funding each project should have to be eligible for moneys based on a project-by-project review and an assessment of the project\u2019s benefit to the state and the program. Funded improvements shall have supplemental funding that is at least equal to the amount of the contribution under this chapter. The commission may give priority for funding to projects with higher levels of committed supplemental funding."
