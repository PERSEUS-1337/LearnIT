    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 1000 percent more to fill \n        their prescriptions than consumers in other countries.\n            (2) The United States is the world's largest market for \n        pharmaceuticals yet consumers still pay the world's highest \n        prices.\n            (3) An unaffordable drug is neither safe nor effective. \n        Allowing and structuring the importation of prescription drugs \n        ensures access to affordable drugs, thus providing a level of \n        safety to American consumers they do not currently enjoy.\n            (4) According to the Congressional Budget Office, American \n        seniors alone will spend $1.8 trillion dollars on \n        pharmaceuticals over the next ten years.\n            (5) Allowing open pharmaceutical markets could save \n        American consumers at least $635 billion of their own money \n        each year.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To give all Americans immediate relief from the \n        outrageously high cost of pharmaceuticals.\n            (2) To reverse the perverse economics of the American \n        pharmaceutical markets.\n            (3) To allow the importation of drugs only if the drugs and \n        the facilities where they are manufactured are approved by the \n        Food and Drug Administration, and to exclude pharmaceutical \n        narcotics.\n            (4) To require that imported prescription drugs be packaged \n        and shipped using counterfeit-resistant technologies approved \n        by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (technologies similar \n        to those used to secure United States currency).\n\nSEC. 4. IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n    Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n384) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting \n                ``Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n                enactment of the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of \n                2003, the Secretary''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``pharmacists and wholesalers'' and \n                inserting ``pharmacists, wholesalers, and qualifying \n                individuals'';\n            (2) in subsection (b)--\n                    (A) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n            ``(1) require that each covered product imported pursuant \n        to such subsection complies with sections 501, 502, and 505, \n        and other applicable requirements of this Act; and'';\n                    (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``, including \n                subsection (d); and'' and inserting a period; and\n                    (C) by striking paragraph (3);\n            (3) in subsection (c), by inserting ``by pharmacists and \n        wholesalers (but not qualifying individuals)'' after \n        ``importation of covered products'';\n            (4) in subsection (d)--\n                    (A) by striking paragraphs (3) and (10);\n                    (B) in paragraph (5), by striking ``, including the \n                professional license number of the importer, if any'';\n                    (C) in paragraph (6)--\n                            (i) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``(if \n                        required under subsection (e))'' before the \n                        period;\n                            (ii) in subparagraph (D), by inserting \n                        ``(if required under subsection (e))'' before \n                        the period; and\n                            (iii) in subparagraph (E), by striking \n                        ``labeling'';\n                    (D) in paragraph (7)--\n                            (i) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``(if \n                        required under subsection (e))'' before the \n                        period; and\n                            (ii) by amending subparagraph (B) to read \n                        as follows:\n                    ``(B) Certification from the importer or \n                manufacturer of such product that the product meets all \n                requirements of this Act.''; and\n                    (E) by redesignating paragraphs (4) through (9) as \n                paragraphs (3) through (8), respectively;\n            (5) by amending subsection (e) to read as follows:\n    ``(e) Testing.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), regulations \n        under subsection (a) shall require that testing referred to in \n        paragraphs (5) through (7) of subsection (d) be conducted by \n        the importer of the covered product, unless the covered product \n        is a prescription drug subject to the requirements of section \n        505B for counterfeit-resistant technologies.\n            ``(2) Exception.--The testing requirements of paragraphs \n        (5) through (7) of subsection (d) shall not apply to an \n        importer unless the importer is a wholesaler.'';\n            (6) in subsection (f), by striking ``or designated by the \n        Secretary, subject to such limitations as the Secretary \n        determines to be appropriate to protect the public health'';\n            (7) in subsection (g)--\n                    (A) by striking ``counterfeit or''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``and the Secretary determines that \n                the public is adequately protected from counterfeit and \n                violative covered products being imported pursuant to \n                subsection (a)'';\n            (8) in subsection (i)(1)--\n                    (A) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as \n                follows:\n                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall conduct, or \n                contract with an entity to conduct, a study on the \n                imports permitted pursuant to subsection (a), including \n                consideration of the information received under \n                subsection (d).
