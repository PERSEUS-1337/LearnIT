 (1) In general.--If a transfer described in subsection (a) \n        is made to a Roth IRA (as defined in section 408A of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986), then--\n                    (A) 50 percent of the portion of any eligible \n                rollover amount so transferred shall be includible in \n                gross income in the first taxable year following the \n                taxable year in which the eligible rollover amount was \n                paid, and\n                    (B) 50 percent of such portion shall be includible \n                in gross income in the second taxable year following \n                the taxable year in which the eligible rollover amount \n                was paid.\n            (2) Election to include in income in year of

fail to be treated as a payment of \n        wages by the commercial passenger airline carrier to the \n        qualified airline employee in the taxable year of payment \n        because such amount is not includible in gross income by reason \n        of subsection (a) or is includible in income in a subsequent \n        taxable year by reason of subsection (b).\n            (2) Treatment of
