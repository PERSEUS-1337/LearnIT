FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal budget has moved from surplus to deficit, \n        causing social security trust funds financed by payroll taxes \n        to be used to fund the deficit;\n            (2) as a result of the return to deficit, the Treasury may \n        have to borrow nearly $2 trillion from the social security \n        trust funds to use for other Government expenditures over the \n        next 10 years;\n            (3) statements by the Secretary of the Treasury that the \n        trust funds have ``no assets'' and the social security program \n        is a ``pyramid game'' and by congressional leaders that the \n        trust funds are ``empty'', a ``total fraud'', and consist of \n        ``worthless IOUs'' cast doubt on whether social security \n        beneficiaries can rely upon the Treasury to pay its debts to \n        the social security trust funds; and\n            (4) the Treasury's failure to pay its debts to the social \n        security trust funds would result in cuts in social security \n        benefits payments to American families as early as 2017.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are:\n            (1) to repudiate statements made by Government leaders that \n        the social security program has ``no assets'';\n            (2) to require an annual Congressional vote affirming the \n        Government's commitment to honoring its debts to the social \n        security trust funds;\n            (3) to require the President to explain how the Treasury \n        will repay loans from the social security trust funds and how \n        legislation signed by the President affects repayment;\n            (4) to require an annual affirmation by the Secretary of \n        the Treasury of the Government's commitment to honoring its \n        debts to the social security trust funds; and\n            (5) to provide Americans who have paid social security \n        taxes with the right to bring an action in court to force the \n        Secretary of the Treasury to honor the Government's debts to \n        the social security trust funds.\n\nSEC. 3. REPUDIATION.\n\n    To dispel any public confusion, the Congress hereby repudiates--\n            (1) the statements of the Secretary of the Treasury, Paul \n        O'Neill, that the social security program is a ``pyramid game'' \n        and that the social security trust funds have ``no assets''; \n        and\n            (2) the statements of congressional leaders that the social \n        security trust funds are ``empty'', a ``total fraud'', ``a mere \n        accounting device'', and consist of ``worthless IOUs''.\n\nSEC. 4. ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL AFFIRMATION.\n\n    No amounts borrowed from the social security trust funds may be \nused by the Treasury to pay for other Government expenditures in a \nfiscal year, unless, during the 9-month period immediately preceding \nthe start of that fiscal year, the Congress has enacted legislation \nexplicitly affirming that the Treasury will repay these funds.\n\nSEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of the amendment made by subsection (b) \nis to require the President to report annually to Congress on plans for \nrepaying the funds the Treasury has borrowed from the social security \ntrust funds.\n    (b) Amendment.--Section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(35) the total amount the Treasury has borrowed from the \n        social security trust funds, an explanation of the plans for \n        repaying the amount borrowed from the social security trust \n        funds, and an explanation of the impact any legislation the \n        President signed into law in the preceding year will have on \n        the plans for repaying the social security trust funds.''.\n\nSEC. 6. COMMITMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO HONOR THE \n              GOVERNMENT'S DEBT TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n    Whenever the Board of Trustees of the social security trust funds \nsubmits its annual report to Congress pursuant to section 201(c) of the \nSocial Security Act on the status of such trust funds during the \npreceding fiscal year and the expected operation and status during the \nensuing 5 fiscal years, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a \nstatement to Congress containing an affirmation that the Treasury will \nhonor the securities in such trust funds.\n\nSEC. 7. REQUIREMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT REPAY THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST \n              FUNDS.\n\n    Section 201(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401(d)) is \namended by inserting after the sixth sentence the following new \nsentence: ``Any individual who is credited with wages or self-\nemployment income under this title may bring an action in an \nappropriate Federal district court to enjoin any act or practice by the \nSecretary of the Treasury by which the Secretary contests an obligation \nissued for purchase by either Trust Fund under this subsection or which \nconstitutes a failure to provide for redemption of the obligation in \naccordance with the terms of such obligation or to otherwise honor the \nfull faith and credit of the United States supporting such \nobligation.''.\n\nSEC. 8.

Such term does not include amounts expended to \n        pay down the Government debt.\n    (b) Interpretation.--For purposes of this Act, amounts borrowed \nfrom the social security trust funds shall be considered to be used for \nother Government expenditures if there is a deficit in the non-Social \nSecurity budget."
