FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Food and Drug Administration, because \n        electronic cigarettes have not been fully studied, consumers \n        currently do not know--\n                    (A) the potential risks of electronic cigarettes \n                when used as intended;\n                    (B) how much nicotine or other potentially harmful \n                chemicals are being inhaled during use; or\n                    (C) if there are any benefits associated with using \n                these products.\n            (2) Most electronic cigarettes contain widely varying \n        levels of nicotine, which is a highly addictive drug that \n        impacts the cardiovascular system and can be lethal when \n        delivered in high doses.\n            (3) According to the Surgeon General, adolescents are \n        particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of nicotine and \n        adolescent exposure to nicotine may have lasting adverse \n        consequences for brain development.\n            (4) Use of electronic cigarettes has risen in youth \n        according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention that was released in November 2014, which found that \n        in two years, from 2011 to 2013, the percentage of middle and \n        high school students who had ever used electronic cigarettes \n        tripled.\n            (5) Electronic cigarette use may lead children to become \n        addicted to nicotine and could be a gateway to various tobacco \n        products.\n            (6) Marketing of electronic cigarettes to youth is \n        occurring in the form of advertising using cartoons and \n        sponsorships of events popular with youth such as concerts and \n        sporting events.\n            (7) According to a study published in June 2014 in the \n        journal Pediatrics, youth exposure to television advertisements \n        for electronic cigarettes increased by 256 percent during the \n        2011 to 2013 period, exposing 24,000,000 children to such \n        advertisements.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nFederal Trade Commission should prohibit the advertising, promoting, \nand marketing in commerce of electronic cigarettes to children as an \nunfair or deceptive act or practice, in order to protect the health of \nthe youth of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.

or\n                    (B) the Federal Trade Commission determines, \n                regardless of when or where the advertising, promotion, \n                or marketing occurs, affects or appeals to children \n                described in subparagraph (A).\n            (2) Covered states.--A State described in this paragraph is \n        a State in which the sale of an electronic cigarette to a child \n        who is younger than 18 years of age is prohibited by a \n        provision of Federal or State law.\n    (c) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--\n            (1) Unfair or deceptive act or practice.--A violation of \n        subsection (b)(1) shall be treated as a violation of a rule \n        defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice described under \n        section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \n        U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).\n            (2) Powers of commission.--\n                    (A) In general.--The Federal Trade Commission shall \n                enforce this section in the same manner, by the same \n                means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and \n                duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of \n                the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) \n                were incorporated into and made a part of this section.\n                    (B) Privileges and immunities.--Any person who \n                violates this section shall be subject to the penalties \n                and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided \n                in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et \n                seq.).\n                    (C) Rulemaking.--The Federal Trade Commission shall \n                promulgate standards and rules to carry out this \n                section in accordance with section 553 of title 5, \n                United States Code.\n    (d) Enforcement by States.--\n            (1) In general.--In any case in which the attorney general \n        of a State has reason to believe that an interest of the \n        residents of the State has been or is threatened or adversely \n        affected by the engagement of any person subject to subsection \n        (b)(1) in a practice that violates such subsection, the \n        attorney general of the State may, as parens patriae, bring a \n        civil action on behalf of the residents of the State in an \n        appropriate district court of the United States--\n                    (A) to enjoin further violation of such subsection \n                by such person;\n                    (B) to compel compliance with such subsection;\n                    (C) to obtain damages, restitution, or other \n                compensation on behalf of such residents;\n                    (D) to obtain such other relief as the court \n                considers appropriate;
