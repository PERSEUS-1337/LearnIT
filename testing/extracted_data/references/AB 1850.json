    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 13000 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n13000.\n(a) This part shall be known and may be cited as the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act. The purpose of the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act is to sponsor public educational activities and development of educational materials to ensure that the events surrounding the exclusion, forced removal, and internment of citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry will be remembered, and so that the causes and circumstances of this and similar events may be illuminated and understood.\n(b) The Legislature finds and declares that the federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was established by Congress in 1980 to \u201creview the facts and circumstances surrounding Executive Order 9066, issued in February 19, 1942, and the impact of such Executive Order on American citizens and permanent residents... and to recommend appropriate remedies.\u201d The CWRIC issued a report of its findings in 1983 with the reports \u201cPersonal Justice Denied\u201d and \u201cPersonal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations.\u201d The reports were based on information gathered \u201cthrough 20 days of hearings in cities across the country, particularly the West Coast, hearing testimony from more than 750 witnesses: evacuees, former government officials, public figures, interested citizens, and historians and other professionals who have studied the subjects of Commission inquiry.\u201d\n(c) The lessons to be learned from the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II are embodied in \u201cPersonal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations.\u201d The CWRIC concluded as follows: \u201cIn sum, Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity, and the decisions that followed from it-exclusion, detention, the ending of detention and the ending of exclusion-were not founded upon military considerations. The broad historical causes that shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. Widespread ignorance about Americans of Japanese descent contributed to a policy conceived in haste and executed in an atmosphere of fear and anger at Japan. A grave personal injustice was done to the American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry who, without individual review or any probative evidence against them were excluded, removed and detained by the United States during World War II.\u201d\n(d) The Legislature further finds and declares that President Ronald Reagan signed into law the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988 and declared during the signing ceremony that \u201cThis is a great day for America.\u201d In that act the Congress declared as follows:\n\u201cThe Congress recognizes that, as described in the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, a grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry by the evacuation, relocation, and internment of civilians during World War II. As the Commission documents, these actions were carried out without adequate security reasons and without any acts of espionage or sabotage documented by the Commission, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. The excluded individuals of Japanese ancestry suffered enormous damages, both material and intangible, and there were incalculable loses in education and job training, all of which resulted in significant human suffering for which appropriate compensation has not been made. For these fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights of these individuals of Japanese ancestry, the Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation.\u201d\nSEC. 2.\nSection 32400 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n32400.\n(a) The Legislature finds that as many as one million seven hundred thousand aliens could be granted amnesty and would seek permanent residency in California under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-603). Under the act, eligible aliens would be required to demonstrate an understanding of ordinary English and a knowledge and understanding of the history and government of the United States.\n(b) Further, it is the intent of the Legislature to establish a state test for use by eligible aliens that would attest to their understanding of English and understanding of the history and government of the United States to meet the requirements of Section 312 of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. Sec. 1423) and the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-603).\nSEC. 3.\nSection 32400 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n32400.\n(a) The Legislature finds that as many as one million seven hundred thousand undocumented foreign nationals could be granted amnesty and would seek permanent residency in California under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-603). Under the act, eligible undocumented foreign nationals would be required to demonstrate an understanding of ordinary English and a knowledge and understanding of the history and government of the United States.\n(b) Further, it is the intent of the Legislature to establish a state test for use by eligible foreign nationals that would attest to their understanding of English and understanding of the history and government of the United States to meet the requirements of Section 312 of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.

Sec. 1423).\n(b) The Governor, the Superintendent, the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, the President pro Tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker of the Assembly shall petition the Director of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service and the United States Attorney General for approval to use the test referred to in subdivision (a) as one means by which an eligible foreign national may satisfy the requirements under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-603).\n(c) The Superintendent shall distribute the test referred to in subdivision (a) to school districts, county offices of education, and community colleges, upon their request for purposes of administration, to eligible foreign nationals granted legal status pursuant to Section 245A of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-603). Any school district, county office of education, or any other eligible agency that receives federal legalization impact-assistance funds to provide educational services may administer the test for purposes of determining the need of an eligible foreign national applying for legal status for appropriate educational services, and of allowing an eligible foreign national to demonstrate an understanding of ordinary English and a knowledge and understanding of the history and government of the United States. Test results shall be confidential, and shall not be released without the written consent of the eligible foreign national for any purpose that is not directly related to the provision of educational services. Upon request by an eligible foreign national applying for legal status, test results may be transmitted to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. School districts, county offices of education, community colleges, and any other eligible agencies that receive federal funds for this purpose shall administer the test using appropriate test monitor and control procedures and provide for necessary test security measures.\nSEC. 5.\nSection 52613 of the Education Code is amended to read:\n52613.\n(a) Notwithstanding any section to the contrary, each governing board of a school district maintaining classes for adults that issues a Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status - For Academic and Language Students, Form I-20AB, or completes Form I-20AB for a nonimmigrant foreign national, as defined in subparagraph (F)(i) of paragraph (15) of subsection (a) of Section 1101 of Title 8 of the United States Code, for the purposes of enrolling the nonimmigrant foreign national in a class in English and citizenship for foreigners or a class in an elementary subject, shall charge the nonimmigrant foreign national a fee to cover the full costs of instruction, but in no case shall the fee exceed the actual cost of the instruction.
