FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Risks to the health and well-being of America's men are \n        on the rise due to a lack of education, awareness, and pursuit \n        of preventative screening and care.\n            (2) While this health crisis is of particular concern to \n        men, it is also a concern for women regarding their fathers, \n        husbands, sons, and brothers.\n            (3) Men's health is a concern for employers who pay the \n        costs of medical care, and lose productive employees.\n            (4) Men's health is a concern to Federal and State \n        governments which absorb the enormous costs of premature death \n        and disability, including the costs of caring for dependents \n        left behind.\n            (5) The life expectancy gap between men and women has \n        increased from one year in 1920 to almost six years in 2002.\n            (6) Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer \n        in the United States among men, accounting for 33 percent of \n        all cancer cases.\n            (7) An estimated 230,000 men will be newly diagnosed with \n        prostate cancer this year alone, and approximately 30,000 will \n        die.\n            (8) Prostate cancer rates increase sharply with age, and \n        more than 75 percent of such cases are diagnosed in men age 65 \n        and older.\n            (9) The incidence of prostate cancer and the resulting \n        mortality rate in African American men is twice that in white \n        men.\n            (10) It is estimated that in 2007, 115,000 men will be \n        diagnosed with lung cancer, and another 90,000 of America's men \n        will die from lung cancer.\n            (11) Over 8,000 men, ages 15 to 40, will be diagnosed this \n        year with testicular cancer, and 390 of these men will die of \n        this disease in 2007. A common reason for delay in treatment of \n        this disease is a delay in seeking medical attention after \n        discovering a testicular mass.\n            (12) Studies show that women are 100 percent more likely \n        than men to visit a doctor, have regular physician check-ups, \n        and obtain preventive screening tests for serious diseases.\n            (13) Appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific \n        antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure, blood sugar, and \n        cholesterol screens, in conjunction with clinical exams and \n        self-testing, can result in the early detection of many \n        problems and in increased survival rates.\n            (14) According to the Census Bureau, by the time men and \n        women reach age 65, the ratio of men to women reduces to 85 to \n        100. The growing disparity in this statistic suggests that \n        among other factors, the declining health of men increases the \n        risk of women entering retirement age as widows.\n            (15) Educating men, their families, and health care \n        providers about the importance of early detection of male \n        health problems can result in reducing rates of mortality for \n        male-specific diseases, as well as improve the health of \n        America's men and its overall economic well-being.\n            (16) Recent scientific studies have shown that regular \n        medical exams, preventive screenings, regular exercise, and \n        healthy eating habits can help save lives.\n            (17) Establishing an Office of Men's Health is needed to \n        investigate these findings and take such further actions as may \n        be needed to promote men's health.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE OF MEN'S HEALTH.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title XVII of the Public Health Service Act (42 \nU.S.C. 300u et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 1711. OFFICE OF MEN'S HEALTH.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services an office to be known as the \nOffice of Men's Health, which shall be headed by a director appointed \nby the Secretary. The Secretary, acting through the Director of the \nOffice, shall coordinate and promote the status of men's health in the \nUnited States.\n    ``(b) Activities.--The Secretary, acting through the Director of \nthe Office, shall--\n            ``(1) conduct or support programs and activities to improve \n        the state of men's health in the United States; and\n            ``(2) provide for consultation among offices and agencies \n        of the Department of Health and Human Services for the purpose \n        of coordinating programs and activities relating to men's \n        health.''.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than two years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nacting through the Director of the Office of Men's Health, shall submit \nto the Congress a report describing the activities of such Office, \nincluding findings that the Director has made regarding men's health."
