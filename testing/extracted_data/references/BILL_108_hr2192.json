FOSTERING RAIL TO RAIL COMPETITION.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Rate.--Section 11101(a) of title 49, United \nStates Code, is amended by inserting after the first sentence the \nfollowing: ``Upon the request of a shipper, a rail carrier shall \nestablish a rate for transportation and provide service requested by \nthe shipper between any two points on the system of that carrier where \ntraffic originates, terminates, or may reasonably be interchanged. A \ncarrier shall establish a rate and provide service upon such request \nwithout regard to--\n            ``(1) whether the rate established is for only part of a \n        movement between an origin and a destination;\n            ``(2) whether the shipper has made arrangements for \n        transportation for any other part of that movement; or\n            ``(3) whether the shipper currently has a contract with any \n        rail carrier for part or all of its transportation needs over \n        the route of movement.\nIf such a contract exists, the rate established by the carrier shall \nnot apply to transportation covered by the contract.''.\n    (b) Review of Reasonableness of Rates.--Section 10701(d) of title \n49, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n    ``(3) A shipper may challenge the reasonableness of any rate \nestablished by a rail carrier in accordance with section 11101(a) or \nwith subsection (c) of this section. The Board shall determine the \nreasonableness of the rate so challenged without regard to--\n            ``(A) whether the rate established is for only part of a \n        movement between an origin and a destination;\n            ``(B) whether the shipper has made arrangements for \n        transportation for any other part of that movement; or\n            ``(C) whether the shipper currently has a contract with a \n        rail carrier for any part of the rail traffic at issue, \n        provided that the rate prescribed by the Board shall not apply \n        to transportation covered by such a contract.''.\n\nSEC. 103. SIMPLIFIED RELIEF PROCESS FOR SMALL CAPTIVE GRAIN SHIPPERS.\n\n    (a) Limitation on Fees.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw, the Surface Transportation Board shall not impose fees in excess \nof $1,000 for services collected from an eligible facility in \nconnection with rail maximum rate complaints under part 1002 of title \n49, Code of Federal Regulations.\n    (b) Simplified Rate and Service Relief.--Section 10701 of title 49, \nUnited States Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the \nfollowing:\n    ``(e) Simplified Rates and Services.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n        law, a rail carrier may not charge a rate for shipments from or \n        to an eligible facility which results in a revenue-to-variable \n        cost percentage, using system average costs, for the \n        transportation service to which the rate applies that is \n        greater than 180 percent.\n            ``(2) Acceptance of requests.--Notwithstanding any other \n        provision of law, a rail carrier shall accept all requests for \n        grain service from an eligible facility up to a maximum of 110 \n        percent of the grain carloads shipped from or to the facility \n        in the immediately preceding calendar year. If, in a majority \n        of instances, a rail carrier does not in any 45-day period, \n        supply the number of grain cars so ordered by an eligible \n        facility or does not initiate service within 30 days of the \n        reasonably specified loading date, the eligible facility may \n        request that an alternative rail carrier provide the service \n        using the tracks of the original carrier. If the alternative \n        rail carrier agrees to provide such service, and such service \n        can be provided without substantially impairing the ability of \n        the carrier whose tracks reach the facility to use such tracks \n        to handle its own business, the Board shall order the \n        alternative carrier to commence service and to compensate the \n        other carrier for the use of its tracks. The alternative \n        carrier shall provide reasonable compensation to the original \n        carrier for the use of the original carrier's tracks.\n            ``(3) Cancellation penalties.--A carrier may accept car \n        orders under paragraph (2) subject to reasonable penalties for \n        service requests that are canceled by the requester. If the \n        carrier fills such orders more than 15 days after the \n        reasonably specified loading date, the carrier may not assess a \n        penalty for canceled car orders.\n            ``(4) Damages.--A rail carrier that fails to provide \n        service under the requirements of paragraph (2) is liable for \n        damages to an eligible facility that does not have access to an \n        alternative carrier, including lost profits, attorney's fees, \n        and any other consequences attributable to the carrier's \n        failure to provide the ordered service. A claim for such damage \n        may be brought in an appropriate United States District Court \n        or before the Board.\n            ``(5) Timetable for board proceeding.--The Board shall \n        conclude any proceeding brought under this subsection no later \n        than 180 days from the date a complaint is filed.\n            ``(6) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n                    ``(A) Eligible facility.--The term `eligible \n                facility' means a shipper facility that--\n                            ``(i) is the origin or destination for not \n                        more than 4,000 carloads annually of grain as \n                        defined in section 3(g) of the United States \n                        Grain Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 75(g));\n                            ``(ii) is served by a single rail carrier \n                        at its origin;\n                            ``(iii) has more than 60 percent of the \n                        facility's inbound or outbound grain and grain \n                        product shipments (excluding the delivery of \n                        grain to the facility by producers), measured \n                        by weight or bushels moved via a rail carrier \n                        in the immediately preceding calendar year; and\n                            ``(iv) the rate charged by the rail carrier \n                        for the majority of shipments of grain and \n                        grain products from or to the facility, \n                        excluding premium for special service programs, \n                        results in a revenue-to-variable cost \n                        percentage, using system average costs, for the \n                        transportation to which the rate applies that \n                        is equal to or greater than 180 percent.\n                    ``(B) Reasonable compensation.--The term \n                `reasonable compensation' shall mean an amount no \n                greater than the total shared costs of the original \n                carrier and the alternative carrier incurred, on a \n                usage basis, for the provision of service to an \n                eligible facility. If the carriers are unable to agree \n                on compensation terms within 15 days after the facility \nrequests service from the alternative carrier, the alternative carrier \nor the eligible facility may request the Board to establish the \ncompensation and the Board shall establish the compensation within 45 \ndays after such request is made.\n                    ``(C) Original carrier.--The term `original \n                carrier' means a rail carrier which provides the only \n                rail service to an eligible facility using its own \n                tracks or provides such service over an exclusive lease \n                of the tracks serving the eligible facility.\n                    ``(D) Alternative carrier.--The term `alternative \n                carrier' means a rail carrier that is not an original \n                carrier to an eligible facility.''.\n\nSEC. 104.
