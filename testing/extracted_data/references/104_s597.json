FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) illnesses and diseases that result from the use of \n        tobacco products cost Federal Government health care programs \n        billions of dollars, including $10,200,000,000 in the medicare \n        program, $5,100,000,000 in the medicaid program, and \n        $4,700,000,000 in other Federal health programs in fiscal year \n        1993;\n            (2) in April 1994, the trustees of the medicare trust funds \n        concluded that such funds may be insolvent in 2001;\n            (3) such insolvency would severely affect the ability of \n        the medicare trust funds to continue to protect the health of \n        America's senior citizens; and\n            (4) the medicare population has a significantly higher risk \n        of contracting illnesses and diseases that result from the use \n        of tobacco products than younger age groups.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to insure the long-term \nviability of the medicare, medicaid, and other federal health programs \nby establishing a dedicated trust fund to reimburse the government for \nthe health care costs of individuals with diseases attributable to the \nuse of tobacco products.\n\nSEC. 3.
