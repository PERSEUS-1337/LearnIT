    "content": "Although the House passed and the Senate Appropriations Committee reported a separate legislative branch appropriations bill ( H.R. 2551 ), no further action was taken before the beginning of FY2012. From October 1, 2011, until December 23, 2011, the legislative branch operated on a series of continuing appropriations resolutions ( P.L. 112-33 , through October 4; P.L. 112-36 , through November 18; P.L. 112-55 , through December 16; P.L. 112-67 , through December 17; and P.L. 112-68 , through December 23).  Division G of the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( H.R. 2055 , P.L. 112-74 ), which was enacted on December 23, 2011, provided $4.307 billion in discretionary funding for the legislative branch. This level is $236.9 million (5.2%) below the FY2011 enacted level and $549.6 million (11.3%) below the request. The legislative branch represents approximately 0.4% of the total discretionary appropriations provided in this act. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ) provided $4.54 billion for legislative branch activities for FY2011. This act continued funding and language contained in the FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-68 ), unless otherwise specified, and included an across-the-board rescission of 0.2%. The FY2011 level represented a decrease of nearly 3% from the $4.66 billion provided for FY2010. From October 1, 2010, until the enactment of this legislation on April 11, 2011, the legislative branch operated on continuing resolutions. These continuing resolutions included P.L. 111-242 (through December 3, 2010), P.L. 111-290 (through December 18, 2010), P.L. 111-317 (through December 21, 2010), P.L. 111-322 (through March 4, 2011), P.L. 112-4 (through March 18, 2011) and P.L. 112-6 (through April 8, 2011). Additionally, both the House and Senate adopted language in the 112 th Congress affecting spending within each chamber. H.Res. 22 , adopted by the House on January 6, 2011, reduces the authorized amounts for the Members' Representational Allowances, House leadership offices, and all committees except the Committee on Appropriations by 5%, with a 9% reduction for the Committee on Appropriations. An amendment ( S.Amdt. 182 ) offered by Senator Nelson (NE) to S. 493 , the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer Reauthorization Act of 2011, stated, \"It is the sense of the Senate, that it should lead by example and reduce the budget of the Senate by at least 5 percent.\" The amendment was adopted on March 16, 2011. No further action on this bill occurred as of the date of this report. Section 1902 of P.L. 112-10 also contained language reducing allowances for Senators' offices by 5%. Previously, the FY2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-68 ) provided $4.66 billion for FY2010 legislative branch operations, and the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $4.40 billion. In FY2009, an additional $25 million was provided for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. P.L. 111-32 , the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act, also contained funding for the police radio system ($71.6 million) and Congressional Budget Office ($2 million). The FY2012 U.S. Budget submitted on February 14, 2011, contained a request for $4.857 billion in new budget authority for legislative branch activities, an increase of approximately 7% from the FY2011 enacted level. This request, however, preceded the enactment of the FY2011 appropriations law on April 11, 2011, which reduced FY2011 funding by nearly 3% from the FY2010 level.  By law, the legislative branch request is submitted to the President and included in the budget without change.  A substantial portion of the increase requested by legislative branch entities was to meet (1) mandatory expenses, such as increased government contributions, and (2) expenses related to increases in the costs of goods and services due to inflation.  Table 3 lists the dates of hearings of the Legislative Branch Subcommittees in 2011.  The House Appropriations Committee released a subcommittee allocation containing $4.314 billion in new budget authority for the legislative branch for FY2012. This level is $227 million less than the FY2011 enacted level.  The House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch held a markup on July 7, 2011, and reported the bill to the full committee with no amendments by voice vote.  The full committee held its markup on July 13, 2011. Two amendments were adopted by voice vote, including a manager's amendment with report language related to Open World and workforce diversity, and an amendment offered by Ranking Member Honda directing the House Chief Administrative Office to review and improve contracting controls. Three amendments were rejected, including (1) an amendment offered by Representative Flake prohibiting the use of the Members' Representational Allowance for online advertising (voice vote); (2) an amendment offered by Representative Moran prohibiting the use of funds for the purchase of polystyrene products for food service facilities in the House of Representatives (Roll no. 1, 18-26); and (3)\u00a0an amendment offered by Representative Flake to prohibit the use of the Members' Representational Allowance for certain mailings not on a Member's stationery (voice vote). The full committee ordered reported a $3.3 billion bill with a roll call vote of 28-19 ( H.R. 2551 , H.Rept. 112-148 ). The total funding level represents a $227 million, or 6.4%, reduction from the FY2011 level (not including Senate items). The House Rules Committee met on July 20, 2011, to discuss a special rule for the legislative branch appropriations bill. A total of 33 amendments were submitted, and 16 were made in order under the rule for consideration of the bill ( H.Res. 359 , H.Rept. 112-173 ). The House agreed to this rule on July 21, 2011 (Roll no. 613, 239-172).  Consideration of the bill began on July 21, 2011, and continued the next day. The following 16 amendments\u2014the most offered on the legislative branch appropriations bill since at least FY1984\u2014 were considered, and 7 were adopted: 1.

The House passed the bill, as amended, on July 22 (Roll no. 629, 252-159). On September 8, 2011, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported a subcommittee allocation of $4.307 billion ( S.Rept. 112-76 ). The committee reported its version of H.R. 2551 , as amended, on September 15, 2011, by a recorded vote of 28\u20132 ( S.Rept. 112-80 ).  The following sections discuss the various legislative branch accounts as well as issues discussed during the hearings on the budget requests. Although a comparison of the FY2012 requests to the FY2011 enacted levels is provided, the budget requests were submitted prior to the enactment of the FY2011 appropriations act and the funding levels for FY2011 were unknown. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ) provides $868.59 million for Senate operations, a decrease of $45.56 million (-5.0%) from the $914.15 million provided in FY2011 and $102.95 million (-10.6%) less than the requested level of $971.55 million.  Previously, the FY2011 level represented a reduction of $12.01 million (-1.3%) from the FY2010 level of $926.16 million.  FY2012 requests and FY2011 funding levels for headings within the Senate account are presented in Table 5 . Appropriations for Senate committees are contained in two accounts: The inquiries and investigations account contains funds for all Senate committees except Appropriations. The Senate had requested $161.3 million for inquiries and investigations, an increase of $21.1 million from the $140.2 million provided in FY2011 and FY2010. The Senate-reported bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $131.3 million, a decrease of $8.9 million. The Committee on Appropriations account contains funds for the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate has requested $15.8 million, which is equal to the FY2010 and FY2011 (not including a 0.2% rescission) funding level. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $14.9 million, a decrease of $948,000. This level was continued in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account provides each Senator with funds to administer an office. It consists of an administrative and clerical assistance allowance, a legislative assistance allowance, and an official office expense allowance. The funds may be used for any category of expenses, subject to limitations on official mail.  The Senate-reported bill would have provided $396.2 million, a level continued in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. This level represents a decrease of $13.0 million (-3.2%) from the FY2011 level of $409.2 million. Nearly $447.0 million was requested for FY2012, an increase of $37.8 million. The proposed FY2012 decrease follows a decrease in FY2011 of $12.8 million (-3.0%) from the FY2010 level of $422.0 million.  At a hearing on May 12, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed the transfer of the administration of subscription services from the office of the Sergeant at Arms to the Secretary of the Senate; the Senate payroll system; the cost of administering state offices; and attempts to balance security and personnel costs. The House-passed version of H.R. 2551 would have provided $1.226 billion for FY2012, a level continued in the Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ). This level represents a decrease of $85.7 million (-6.5%) from the FY2011 level of $1.311 billion. The House had requested $1.334 billion, an increase of $22.3 million (1.7%) over the FY2011 level.  FY2012 requests and FY2011 funding levels for headings in the House of Representatives account are presented in Table 6 . The proposed FY2012 decrease follows a decrease in FY2011 of $57.6 million (-4.2%) from the FY2010 level of $1.369 billion.  Additionally, as stated above, on January 6, 2011, the House agreed to H.Res. 22 , which reduces the authorized amounts for the Members' Representational Allowances, House leadership offices, and all committees except the Committee on Appropriations by 5%, with a 9% reduction for the Committee on Appropriations. Funding for House committees is contained in the appropriation heading \"committee employees,\" which comprises two subheadings. The first subheading contains funds for personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of House committees, except the Appropriations Committee, as authorized by the House in a committee expense resolution. The House-passed bill would have provided nearly $126.0 million, a decrease of $8.6 million from the $134.5 million requested for FY2012 and provided for FY2011. The FY2011 level was a decrease of $5.3 million from the $139.9 million provided in FY2010.  The second subheading contains funds for the personnel and nonpersonnel expenses of the Committee on Appropriations. The House-passed bill would have provided $26.7 million. The House had requested $28.5 million, which is equivalent to the FY2011 level and a decrease of $2.8 million from the FY2010 level of $31.3 million.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 112-74 ) provided funding at the levels contained in the House-passed version of H.R. 2551 . The Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) is available to support Members in their official and representational duties. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $573.9 million, the same level as the House-passed version of H.R. 2551 . This level is $59.9 million less than the $633.8 million requested for FY2012 and $39.1 million less than the $613.1 million provided in FY2011. The FY2011 level was a decrease of nearly $47 million from the $660.0 million provided in FY2010.  At a hearing on May 12, 2011, the House subcommittee discussed Member and district office security, including costs; expenses for legal services related to the Defense of Marriage Act following Attorney General Eric Holder's February 23, 2011, letter to Speaker John Boehner regarding the President's determination that Section 3 of this act is unconstitutional and the Speaker's March 9, 2011, announcement that the House General Counsel was directed to initiate a legal defense of this law; greening efforts, including functions of the Architect of the Capitol and the use of Styrofoam in the House cafeteria; and the House wounded warrior program and the experiences and long-term employment prospects of its alumni. The U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are responsible for the security of the Capitol Complex including the U.S. Capitol, the House and Senate office buildings, the U.S. Botanic Garden, and the Library of Congress buildings and adjacent grounds.  The USCP had requested $387.6 million for FY2012, an increase of $47.5 million (14.0%). The House-reported bill would have provided $340.1 million, the same as provided in FY2011. H.Amdt. 697 increased this amount by $1 million, transferred from transition activities, for district office security. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $331.4 million, a decrease of $8.7 million (-2.6%) from the FY2011 enacted level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $340.1 million, the same level as FY2011.  The USCP FY2012 request and FY2011 funding level are also presented in Table 7 . Previously, the FY2010 appropriations act provided $328.3 million and P.L. 111-212 provided an additional $12.96 million in supplemental appropriations. The USCP had requested $15.956 million in FY2010 supplemental appropriations.  Appropriations for the police are contained in two accounts\u2014a salaries account and a general expenses account. The salaries account contains funds for the salaries of employees; overtime pay; hazardous duty pay differential; and government contributions for employee health, retirement, Social Security, professional liability insurance, and other benefit programs. The general expenses account contains funds for expenses of vehicles; communications equipment; security equipment and its installation; dignitary protection; intelligence analysis; hazardous material response; uniforms; weapons; training programs; medical, forensic, and communications services; travel; relocation of instructors for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; and other administrative and technical support, among other expenses. The Capitol Police requested $299.3 million for salaries (an increase of $22.2 million, or 8%) and $88.3 million (an increase of $25.3 million, or 40.1%). The House-reported bill would have continued funding at the FY2011 level, and the district office security amendment increased this amount by $1 million. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $276.9 million, a decrease of $203,000 (-0.1%), for salaries and $54.5 million, a decrease of $8.5 million (-13.5%), for general expenses. The Consolidated Appropriations Act continues funding at the same level as FY2011 for both salaries and general expenses. Another appropriation relating to the Capitol Police appears within the Architect of the Capitol account for Capitol Police buildings and grounds. The Capitol Police had requested $32.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million (19.9%), over the FY2011 enacted level of nearly $27.0 million. The House-passed bill would have provided $21.5 million, a decrease of $5.5 million (-20.2%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $18.2 million, a decrease of $8.7 million (-32.4%). The Consolidated Appropriations Act continues funding at the same level as FY2011. The conference agreement also contained administrative provisions related to the waiver of erroneous payments as well as the transfer of funds between the \"salaries\" and \"general expenses\" headings. The conferees also recommended no more than 634,667 hours of overtime and added reporting requirements.  At a hearing on May 12, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed the basis of the Capitol Police request for the 2012 presidential nominating conventions; the size of the Inspector General office and the request for three additional full-time equivalents (FTEs); the status of the radio modernization project; and potential cost savings, including savings from minimizing entry doors. On June 2, 2011, the House subcommittee discussed the activities and budget request of the Capitol Police, including determinants of the Capitol Police mission; how the Capitol Police could adjust to a funding reduction; efforts to establish safe evacuation procedures, particularly for the disabled; the role of the Capitol Police Board; the status of racial and gender discrimination complaints and the hiring of a new diversity officer; and district office security assessments. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the United States Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol and its grounds, House and Senate office buildings, Library of Congress buildings and grounds, Capitol Power Plant, Botanic Garden, Capitol Visitor Center, and Capitol Police buildings and grounds. The Architect is responsible for the Supreme Court buildings and grounds, but appropriations for their expenses are not contained in the legislative branch appropriations bill. Operations of the Architect are funded in the following 10 accounts: general administration, Capitol building, Capitol grounds, Senate office buildings, House office buildings, Capitol power plant, Library buildings and grounds, Capitol Police buildings and grounds, Capitol Visitor Center, and Botanic Garden.  The Architect had requested $706.1 million, an increase of $120.3 million (20.5%) from the FY2011 level.  The House-reported bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $489.6 million, not including funding for Senate office buildings. H.Amdt. 701 reduced funding for the Botanic Garden account by $632,780.  The Senate-reported version of H.R. 2551 would have provided $506.6 million, a decrease of $93.8 million (-15.6%). The Senate-reported bill also included a rescission of nearly $17.5 million from prior year unobligated balances.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $567.5 million, a decrease of 5.5% from the FY2011 enacted level of $600.4 million (not including rescissions). Previously, the FY2011 level ($585.8 million, including a $14.6 million rescission for the Capitol Visitor Center), represented a decrease of $15.8 million (2.6%) from the $601.6 million provided in FY2010. The Architect had requested $754.8 million, an increase of $153.2 million (25.5%). In FY2010, a 21.7% increase (or $644.6 million) was requested and a 13.6% increase was provided ($601.6 million). In FY2009, a 55.4% increase ($642.7 million) was requested and a 28% increase ($529.6 million) was provided. The FY2008 budget authority represented a decrease of 8.1% from the $449.9 million (including supplemental appropriations) provided in FY2007. The FY2012 request and FY2011 funding level for each of the AOC accounts is presented in Table 8 . At a hearing on March 3, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed the timing of repairs to the Capitol dome; the completion of the tunnel project, scheduled for 2012; the completion of the radio project; potential savings from a unified legislative branch financial management system; Capitol Power Plant east chiller relocation project; and how the agency would operate under various potential funding cuts. At a hearing on March 15, 2011, the House subcommittee discussed the project prioritization process, the Capitol dome project, the Cannon revitalization project, energy consumption and savings, and repairs to the House garages.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act contains an administrative provision directing the Architect of the Capitol to transfer amounts made available for construction projects to the Capitol Police to reimburse them for overtime expenses related to these projects. The act also contains language transferring a parcel of land from the National Park Service to the Architect of the Capitol. CBO is a nonpartisan congressional agency created to provide objective economic and budgetary analysis to Congress. CBO cost estimates are required for any measure reported by a regular or conference committee that may vary revenues or expenditures. CBO requested $46.9 million for FY2012, less than $100,000 more than the $46.8 million provided for FY2011 in P.L. 112-10 . The House-passed version of H.R. 2551 would have provided $43.8 million (a decrease of nearly $3.0 million, or -6.4%). The Senate-reported version would have provided $44.4 million (a decrease of $2.4 million, or -5.1%). The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $43.8 million, a decrease of 6.4%. Previously, $45.2 million was provided for FY2010, $44.1 million was provided in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, and $2.0 million, to remain available through FY2010, was provided in the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 111-32 ).  CBO requested two administrative provisions for FY2012, neither of which were included in the House-passed or Senate-reported versions of H.R. 2551 or the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The requested provisions would have 1. allowed unobligated balances of expired Congressional Budget Office appropriations for FY2012 and each fiscal year to remain available until expended for information technology security projects, and 2. allowed appropriations available to the Congressional Budget Office to be used to pay the compensation of certain employees with non-immigrant visas. At the House hearing on May 11, 2011, the subcommittee discussed CBO's workload, impetus for reports, protocols for determining priorities, process for making long-term projections, and potential consequences of budget cuts on CBO operations. At a hearing on March 17, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed the prioritization of cost estimates; CBO's information technology request; its use of outside specialists; and plans for a tighter budget environment. The Library of Congress serves simultaneously as Congress's parliamentary library and the de facto national library of the United States. Its broader services to the nation include the acquisition, maintenance, and preservation of a collection of more than 147 million items in a wide range of traditional and new media; service to the general public and scholarly and library communities; administration of U.S. copyright laws by its Copyright Office; and administration of a national program to provide reading material to the blind and physically handicapped. Its direct services to Congress include the provision of legal research and law-related services by the Law Library of Congress, and a broad range of activities by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), including in-depth and non-partisan public policy research, analysis, and legislative assistance for Members and committees and their staff; congressional staff training; information and statistics retrieval; and continuing legal education for Members of both chambers and congressional staff. The Library requested $666.7 million, an increase of $38.1 million (6.1%) from the FY2011 level of $628.7 million. The House-passed version of H.R. 2551 would have provided $575.3 million, a decrease of $53.4 million (-8.5%). The Senate-reported version would have provided $579.2 million, a decrease of $49.5 million (-7.9%). The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $587.3 million, a decrease of $41.3 million (-6.6%). Previously, the FY2011 level represented a decrease of $14.7 million (-2.3%) from the $643.3 million provided in FY2010. The FY2010 level represented an increase of 6.0% over the FY2009 level of $607.1 million, and the FY2009 level represented an increase of approximately 7.8% over the $563.0 million provided in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. These figures do not include additional authority to spend receipts.

The Architect's budget also contains funds for the Library buildings and grounds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $46.9 million, an increase of $1.2 million (2.6%) from the $45.7 million provided for FY2011. The House-passed bill would have provided $38.5 million, a decrease of $7.2 million (-15.8%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $38.5 million, a decrease of $17.9 million (-39.3%). A total of $67.9 million was requested, an increase of $22.2 million (48.5%). The FY2011 level represented a 0.2% reduction from the $45.8 million provided for Library buildings and grounds in FY2010.  The Library requested two recurring administrative provisions\u2014related to authority to obligate funds for reimbursable and revolving fund activities and\u00a0providing transfer authority\u2014as well as two provisions also requested in FY2011, which would  1. make available balances of expired Library of Congress appropriations available for the purposes of making payments for employees of the Library of Congress under Section 8147 of Title 5, United States Code (relating to workers compensation payments); and 2. authorize the Librarian of Congress to dispose of surplus or obsolete personal property of the Library of Congress, with amounts received credited to funds available for the operations of the Library of Congress and available for the costs of acquiring similar property. The House-passed bill contains the workers compensation provision but not the surplus property provision. The Senate-reported version of the bill contains both of these provisions as well as a provision amending the Library of Congress Fiscal Operations Improvement Act of 2000 related to the use of revolving funds.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act included the four provisions requested by the Library.  At a hearing on March 11, 2011, the House subcommittee examined Library operations at various potential funding levels; the use of overseas offices; the search for a chief of the Asia Division; the relationship between fees for copyright registrants and costs to process registrations; the requested information technology security funding; and telework.  At a hearing on March 31, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed the impact of funding cuts; the deferral of projects; and requests for additional staff and information technology security funding. GAO works for Congress by responding to requests for studies of federal government programs and expenditures. GAO may also initiate its own work. Formerly the General Accounting Office, the agency was renamed the Government Accountability Office effective July 7, 2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $511.3 million (not including $22.3 million in offsetting collections), a decrease of $34.96 million (-6.4%) from the $546.3 million provided for FY2011. The House-passed bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $511.3 million (not including $18.3 million in offsetting collections), a decrease of nearly $35.0 million (-6.4%). The Senate-reported version of H.R. 2551 would have provided $504.5 million (not including $18.3 million in offsetting collections), a decrease of $41.7 million (-7.6%). The act also contained one administrative provision, also included in the House-passed version of H.R. 2551 , related to voluntary separation incentive payments.  GAO had requested $556.8 million (not including $18.3 million in offsetting collections), an increase of $10.6 million (1.9%) from FY2011 and equal to the $556.9 million (not including $15.22 million in offsetting collections) provided in FY2010. GAO received $531.0 million, not including offsetting collections, in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act and an additional $25 million in P.L. 111-5 to cover responsibilities under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  At a hearing on March 11, 2011, the House subcommittee discussed GAO's use of field offices; tenant use of excess space in GAO's headquarters; studies related to Member security; and funding for mandates, including work required under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At a hearing on March 17, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed the methodology used for GAO reports, and how the agency is responding to the budget environment. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $126.2 million, a decrease of $8.9 million (-6.6%) from the $135.1 million provided for FY2011 in P.L. 112-10 . The House-reported bill ( H.R. 2551 ) would have provided $113.0 million, a decrease of $22.1 million (-16.3%). H.Amdt. 704 , offered by Mr. Stutzman and agreed to by recorded vote (218-194), further reduced this funding by $4,946,140.80. The Senate-reported version of H.R. 2551 would have provided $116.8 million, a decrease of $18.3 million (-13.5%). GPO had requested $148.5 million, an increase of $13.4 million (9.9%).  The FY2011 level represented a decrease of $12.4 million (-8.4%) from the $147.5 million for FY2010. The FY2010 level represented an increase of 4.9% over the $140.6 million provided in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The FY2009 level represented an increase of 12.7% over the $124.7 million provided in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act.  GPO's budget authority is contained in three accounts: (1) congressional printing and binding, (2) Office of Superintendent of Documents (salaries and expenses), and (3) the revolving fund. FY2009 levels for these accounts are as follows: Congressional printing and binding\u2014The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $90.7 million, a decrease of $2.9 million (-3.1%). The House-reported bill would have provided $78.0 million. H.Amdt. 704 further reduced this level by $3,414,150.29 (-20.3%, total). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $81.3 million, a decrease of $12.3 million (-13.1%).

The House-reported bill also would have provided $35.0 million, although H.Amdt. 704 reduced this level on the floor by $1,531,990.51 (for a total decrease of 16.0%). The Senate-reported bill would have provided $35.0 million, a decrease of $4.8 million (-12.1%). GPO had requested $42.2 million, an increase of $2.3 million (5.9%) over the $39.8 million provided for FY2011. The FY2010 appropriations act had provided $40.9 million. Revolving fund\u2014The revolving fund supports the operation and maintenance of the Government Printing Office. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $500,000 for the revolving fund. The House-passed bill did not provide funding for the revolving fund. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $500,000, a decrease of $1.16 million (-69.8%) from the nearly $1.66 million provided in FY2011. GPO had requested $6.3 million, an increase of $4.6 million. Previously, the FY2010 act provided $12.8 million for the revolving fund.  The congressional printing and binding account pays for expenses of printing and binding required for congressional use, and for statutorily authorized printing, binding, and distribution of government publications for specified recipients at no charge. Included within these publications are the Congressional Record ; Congressional Directory ; Senate and House Journals; memorial addresses of Members; nominations; U.S. Code and supplements; serial sets; publications printed without a document or report number, for example, laws and treaties; envelopes provided to Members of Congress for the mailing of documents; House and Senate business and committee calendars; bills, resolutions, and amendments; committee reports and prints; committee hearings; and other documents. The Office of Superintendent of Documents account funds the mailing of government documents for Members of Congress and federal agencies, as statutorily authorized; the compilation of catalogs and indexes of government publications; and the cataloging, indexing, and distribution of government publications to the Federal Depository and International Exchange libraries, and to other individuals and entities, as authorized by law. At a hearing in the House on May 11, 2011, the subcommittee discussed the cost of producing and delivering the Congressional Record ; GPO's overhead, including the cost of maintaining unused space; security concerns; staffing issues, including the management structure and efforts to reduce discrimination complains; the future of paper in digital age and the operation of FDsys (the Federal Digital System , which will replace GPO Access ); and the timing of requested funding for the 2013 presidential inauguration. At a hearing on March 17, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed the changing role of the GPO in the digital age; why GPO included in its request funding for the 2013 Presidential inauguration; use of GPO's revolving fund for capital improvements and possible alternatives; and plans for responding to the tight budget environment. The Office of Compliance is an independent and nonpartisan agency within the legislative branch. It was established to administer and enforce the Congressional Accountability Act, which was enacted in 1995. The act applies various employment and workplace safety laws to Congress and certain legislative branch entities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $3.82 million, the same level as contained in the House-passed version of H.R. 2551 . This level represents a decrease of $260,000 (-6.4%) from the $4.08 million provided in P.L. 112-10 for FY2011. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $3.87 million, a decrease of $207,000 (-5.1%). The office requested $4.78 million, an increase of $705,000 (17.3%).  The FY2011 level represented a decrease of $300,000 (-6.9%) from the $4.4 million provided in FY2010. The FY2010 level represented an increase of 7.5% from the $4.1 million provided in the FY2009 Omnibus, which was an increase of 21.8% over the FY2008 level of $3.3 million. At a hearing on March 3, 2011, the Senate subcommittee discussed actions to minimize costs; how the agency would operate under various potential funding cuts; and discussions with the Library of Congress regarding information technology concerns. The Open World Leadership Center administers a program that supports democratic changes in other countries by inviting their leaders to observe democracy and free enterprise in the United States. The first program was authorized by Congress in 1999 to support the relationship between Russia and the United States. The program encouraged young federal and local Russian leaders to visit the United States and observe its government and society. Established at the Library of Congress as the Center for Russian Leadership Development in 2000, the center was renamed the Open World Leadership Center in 2003, when the program was expanded to include specified additional countries. In 2004, Congress further extended the program's eligibility to other countries designated by the center's board of trustees, subject to congressional consideration. The center is housed in the Library and receives services from the Library through an inter-agency agreement. Open World requested $12.6 million for FY2012, an increase of $1.2 million (10.7%) from the $11.38 million provided in P.L. 112-10 . The House-passed bill would have provided $1.0 million, a decrease of 91.2%. The House report states, \"The program has some strong champions on the Committee, but with reductions being made to most every program within the Federal budget the Committee has elected to shut down the program and recommends $1,000,000 for shutdown expenses.\" The Senate-reported bill, in contrast, would have provided $10.0 million (-12.1%). The Senate report states that \"despite the fiscal constraints of the budget this program is necessary for the promotion of democratic principles in countries with historically oppressive rule.\" The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides the Senate-reported level of $10.0 million. The FY2011 level represented a decrease of $623,000 (5.2%) from the $12.0 million provided for FY2010, and the FY2010 level represented a decrease of 13.7% from the $13.90 million provided in the FY2009 Omnibus. In FY2008, Open World received $8.98 million in budget authority, a decrease of 35% from the $13.86 million provided in FY2007 and FY2006.  The location of Open World at the Library of Congress, as well as its inclusion in the legislative branch budget, has been a topic of discussion at appropriations hearings in recent fiscal years.  The FY2010 House Appropriations Committee report states that \"the Legislative Branch Subcommittee has been clear that it expects the Open World program to become financially independent of funding in this bill as soon as possible.\" This sentiment was also expressed in the conference report, which stated the following:  The conferees are fully supportive of expanded efforts of the Open World Center to raise private funding and expect this effort to reduce the requirements for funding from the Legislative Branch appropriations bill in future years. The Committees look forward to a report of progress being made by the Center's fundraising program prior to hearings on its fiscal year 2011 budget request. Previously, during a hearing on the FY2009 budget, Ambassador John O'Keefe, the executive director of Open World, testified that the program may attract different participants if associated with the executive branch rather than the Library of Congress. The FY2009 explanatory statement directed the Open World Leadership Center Board of Trustees to work with the State Department and the judiciary to establish a shared funding mechanism.  The subcommittee also had discussed this issue during the FY2008 appropriations cycle, and language was included in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act requiring Open World to prepare a report by March 31, 2008, on \"potential options for transfer of the Open World Leadership Center to a department or agency in the executive branch, establishment of the Center as an independent agency in the executive branch, or other appropriate options.\"  The center was created by Congress in 1988 to encourage public service by congressional staff through training and development programs. The House-passed bill did not provide funding for FY2012. The Senate-reported bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act include $430,000, the same as requested.  Previously, P.L. 112-10 provided $429,140 for FY2011 (including the 0.2% rescission), and $430,000 was provided in FY2010 and FY2009.
