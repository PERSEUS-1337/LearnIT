    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 11401.5 is added to the Insurance Code, to read:\n11401.5.\n(a) (1) Each association that holds a certificate of authority pursuant to this chapter and that issues long-term disability or long-term care policies or contracts shall submit to the commissioner the opinion of a qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items that support the policies or contracts issued pursuant to this chapter, including policies and contracts issued by entities established by these associations that provide benefits described in this chapter, are expected to be adequate to satisfy contractual provisions, are based on reasonable assumptions, and are based on actuarial standards of practice published by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Actuarial Standards Board. An association that holds a certificate of authority pursuant to this chapter shall file its opinion no later than July 1, 2016. The opinion shall have been completed no earlier than December 31, 2013.\n(2) An association is considered to have issued a long-term care or disability policy or contract if it self-funds all or part of the resulting obligation. An association that markets long-term policies or contracts issued by an insurer that is admitted by the department to offer insurance products in the state is exempt from this reporting requirement.\n(3) An association seeking a certificate of authority pursuant to this chapter shall file an opinion, to the extent feasible, that establishes that it would have adequate resources to provide benefits described in this chapter as required to satisfy its proposed contractual obligations.\n(b) The opinion required by subdivision (a) shall include supporting memoranda from the same qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items held in support of the policies and contracts, when considered in light of the assets held by the association with respect to the reserves and related actuarial items, including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on the assets and the considerations anticipated to be received and retained under the policies and contracts, and shall make adequate provision for the association\u2019s obligations under the policies and contracts, including, but not limited to, the benefits and any administrative and operating expenses associated with the policies and contracts.\n(c) The opinion required by subdivision (a) shall be governed by the following provisions:\n(1) It shall include supporting memoranda consistent with actuarial standards of practice published by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Actuarial Standards Board.\n(2) If the association fails to provide an opinion and supporting memoranda to the commissioner that meets the requirements of this section, the commissioner shall notify the association of the deficiencies in the filing, and shall make a specific request that identifies the issues that should be addressed in an amended filing. The requests shall be consistent with actuarial standards of practice published by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Actuarial Standards Board.\n(d) If the commissioner determines, after a review of the filings from the associations, that the laws governing these associations are inadequate to protect the interests of the members of the associations, he or she shall, on or before July 1, 2017, develop and deliver recommendations to the Assembly Committee on Insurance and the Senate Committee on Insurance regarding changes in the law necessary to protect the interests of members of the associations.\n(e) Documents, materials, or other information, including the opinion with supporting memoranda, submitted pursuant to this section that are in the possession or control of the Department of Insurance and that are obtained by, created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person pursuant to this section, are recognized by this state as being proprietary and to contain trade secrets. Those documents, materials, or other information shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be subject to disclosure by the commissioner pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code), and shall not be subject to subpoena or discovery from the commissioner or admissible into evidence, in a private civil action if obtained from the commissioner. The commissioner shall not otherwise make those documents, materials, or other information public without the prior written consent of the association.\n(f) This section shall remain in effect only until December 31, 2018, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before December 31, 2018, deletes or extends that date.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 11401.6 is added to the Insurance Code, to read:\n11401.6.\n(a) An association that self-funds all or part of the benefits provided under this chapter shall include the following language, or other language approved by the commissioner, in all contracts that are not regulated by the department, and in certificates evidencing coverage under those contracts, in capital letters and in a minimum of 12-point type:\n\n\n\u201cALL OR A PORTION OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THIS CONTRACT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, AND THE CONTRACT IS NOT GUARANTEED BY THE CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION.\u201d\n\n\n(b) This section shall remain in effect only until December 31, 2018, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before December 31, 2018, deletes or extends that date.\nSEC. 3.\nThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which adds Section 11401.5 of the Insurance Code, imposes a limitation on the public\u2019s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\nIn order to protect proprietary information, it is necessary to enact legislation that limits the public\u2019s right of access to insurance holding company information that is provided pursuant to Section 11401.5 of the Insurance Code."
