It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective, (2) each bill amends Section 4735 of the Civil Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 349, in which case Section 2 of this bill shall not become operative.\nSEC. 4.\nThis act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:\nCalifornia is in a state of emergency because of the continued drought. In response, Governor Brown issued Executive Order B-29-15, ordering a 25 percent statewide reduction in urban water consumption. Because residential landscaping accounts for 35 percent or more of the average urban water usage statewide, many homeowners have voluntarily ceased watering landscaping in order to assist with the drought emergency. However, some homeowners associations have interpreted existing law to allow them to fine homeowners who voluntarily cease using potable water on their landscaping if the homeowners association itself is using a de minimis amount of recycled water on common areas. This is directly contrary to the state\u2019s need to conserve the precious and dwindling water supplied for urban, agricultural, and environmental needs."
