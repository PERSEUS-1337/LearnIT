    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Improvement Volunteer Act \nof 1994''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the ethic of civic responsibility, the spirit of \n        community and the belief in volunteerism have all been \n        fundamental principles guiding this country's evolution;\n            (2) Americans persist in their desire to affirm their sense \n        of humanity, community, civic responsibility and shared values;\n            (3) volunteerism plays a vital role in helping the American \n        people meet these mores;\n            (4) throughout the United States, there are pressing unmet \n        public needs that will benefit and serve the local community or \n        disadvantaged groups within the community (such as food banks, \n        homeless shelters, parks, day care centers, youth centers, drug \n        and alcohol abuse rehabilitation centers, libraries, and \n        similar entities);\n            (5) expanding opportunities for volunteerism can assist a \n        community in meeting many of these unmet public needs resulting \n        in tangible benefits to society at little or no cost to the \n        public;\n            (6) many Federal laws that authorize financial assistance \n        for the construction of public buildings and public works \n        require the application of the prevailing wage-setting \n        provisions of the Act of March 3, 1931 (commonly known as the \n        ``Davis-Bacon Act'') (40 U.S.C. 276a et seq.) which sets \n        minimum wages and fringe benefits which must be paid to various \n        classes of laborers and mechanics who are employed on such \n        projects;\n            (7) these prevailing wage-setting provisions of the Davis-\n        Bacon Act protect the labor standards of working men and women \n        in the locality where the federally-assisted project is to be \n        constructed, significantly contribute to the achievement of a \n        decent standard of living for local area working families, and \n        contribute to safeguarding and providing employment \n        opportunities for women and minorities in the construction \n        industry;\n            (8) the prevailing wage-setting provisions of the Davis-\n        Bacon Act create incentives for contractors and subcontractors \n        seeking federally-assisted and insured contracts and \n        subcontracts to establish and support apprenticeship programs \n        which provide opportunities for women and minorities to receive \n        training that enables them to become fully qualified laborers \n        and mechanics in the construction industry; and\n            (9) in order to achieve these objectives, the prevailing \n        wage-setting provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act have been \n        uniformly applied to all laborers and mechanics who performed \n        work on federally-assisted public building and public works \n        projects regardless of their status as volunteers, unless an \n        express exception is specifically provided for in a particular \n        Federal law under which the Federal funding is authorized.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to promote and provide more \nopportunities for people who wish to volunteer their services in the \nconstruction, repair or alteration, including painting and decorating, \nof public buildings and public works funded, in whole or in part, with \nFederal financial assistance authorized under certain Federal programs \nthat might not otherwise be possible without the use of volunteers, by \nwaiving the application of the otherwise applicable prevailing wage-\nsetting provisions of the Act of March 3, 1931 (commonly known as the \n``Davis-Bacon Act'') (40 U.S.C. 276a et seq.) to such volunteers.\n\nSEC. 4. WAIVER.\n\n    (a) In General.--The requirement that certain laborers and \nmechanics be paid in accordance with the wage-setting provisions of the \nAct of March 3, 1931 (commonly known as the ``Davis-Bacon Act'') (40 \nU.S.C. 276a et seq.) as set forth in any of the Acts or provisions \ndescribed in subsection (d), and the provisions relating to wages, in \nany federally assisted or insured contract or subcontract for \nconstruction, shall not apply to any individual--\n            (1) who volunteers--\n                    (A) to perform a service for a public or private \n                entity for civic, charitable, or humanitarian reasons, \n                without promise, expectation or receipt of compensation \n                for services rendered other than expenses, reasonable \n                benefits, or a nominal fee (as defined in subsection \n                (b)), but solely for the personal purpose or pleasure \n                of the individual; and\n                    (B) to provide such services freely and without \n                pressure or coercion, direct or implied, from an \n                employer;\n            (2) whose contribution of service is not for the benefit of \n        any contractor otherwise performing or seeking to perform work \n        on the same project; and\n            (3) who is not otherwise employed at any time under the \n        federally assisted or insured contract or subcontract involved \n        for construction with respect to the project for which the \n        individual is volunteering.\n    (b) Expenses.--Payments of expenses, reasonable benefits, or a \nnominal fee may be provided to volunteers described in subsection (a) \nif the Secretary of Labor determines, after an examination of the total \namount of payments made (expenses, benefits, fees) in the context of \nthe economic realities of the specific federally assisted or insured \nproject, that such payments are appropriate. Subject to such a \ndetermination--\n            (1) a payment for an expense may be received by a volunteer \n        for items such as uniform allowances, protective gear and \n        clothing, reimbursement for approximate out-of-pocket expenses, \n        or for the cost or expense of meals and transportation;\n            (2) a reasonable benefit may include the inclusion of a \n        volunteer in a group insurance plan (such as a liability, \n        health, life, disability, or worker's compensation plan) or \n        pension plan or the awarding of a length of service award; and\n            (3) a nominal fee may not be used as a substitute for \n        compensation and must not be tied to productivity.\nThe decision as to what constitutes a nominal fee for purposes of \nparagraph (3) shall be made on a case-by-case basis and in the context \nof the economic realities of the situation involved.\n    (c) Economic Reality.--For purposes of subsection (b), in \ndetermining whether an expense, benefit or fee described in such \nsubsection may be paid to volunteers in the context of the economic \nrealities of the particular situation, the Secretary of Labor shall not \napprove any such expense, benefit or fee which has the effect of \nundermining labor standards by creating downward pressure on prevailing \nwages in the local construction industry.\n    (d) Contracts Exempted.--For purposes of subsection (a), the Acts \nor provisions described in this subsection are the following:\n            (1) The Library Services and Construction Act.\n            (2) The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance \n        Act.\n            (3) Section 329 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n        254b).\n            (4) Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n        254c).\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT.\n\n    Not later than December 31, 1997, the Secretary of Labor shall \nprepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report \nthat--\n            (1) identifies and assesses, to the maximum extent \n        practicable--\n                    (A) the projects for which volunteers were \n                permitted to work under this Act; and\n                    (B) the number of volunteers permitted to work \n                because of the compliance of entities with the \n                provisions of this Act; and\n            (2) contains recommendations with respect to other Davis-\n        Bacon-related Acts that could be addressed to permit volunteer \n        work."
