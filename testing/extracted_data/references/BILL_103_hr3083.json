FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Old-growth forests are unique ecosystems that serve as \n        critical wildlife habitat for hundreds of vertebrate and \n        invertebrate animals, plants, and fungi.\n            (2) Old-growth forests provide clean and plentiful water \n        and support streams and rivers where wild runs of anadromous \n        and resident cold water fish are wholly dependent on high \n        quantity and quality water for migration, spawning, rearing, \n        and cover that can only be maintained by protecting the \n        watersheds of these steams and rivers.\n            (3) Old-growth forests provide unique and outstanding \n        opportunities for educational study, scientific research, and \n        recreation.\n            (4) The establishment of a forest preserve to protect areas \n        of old-growth forests can contribute significantly to the \n        quality of life for the residents of the State of Oregon \n        through recreation, education, and a protected water supply.\n            (5) The area containing what is known as the Opal Creek \n        forest is one of the largest remaining intact low-elevation \n        old-growth forest ecosystems in the Western Oregon Cascades \n        with trees up to 1,000 years of age.\n            (6) The Opal Creek forest area contains outstanding \n        geological and botanical features and is significant to the \n        aboriginal and early mining history of Oregon.\n            (7) The Opal Creek forest area provides recreational \n        opportunities for over 12,000 visitors annually and such \n        recreational use is increasing at a rate of over 50 percent a \n        year.\n            (8) The Opal Creek forest area, which includes 4 lakes, 45 \n        miles of free-flowing streams, and over 50 waterfalls, \n        continues to be threatened by additional logging, an activity \n        which will cause irreparable harm to the outstanding \n        ecological, scientific, educational, and recreational values of \n        the area.\n            (9) Preservation of the Opal Creek forest area provides \n        outstanding opportunities for scientists to conduct \n        nondestructive old-growth forest research and for educators to \n        provide scientifically credible information to the public.\n\nSEC. 3. OPAL CREEK FOREST PRESERVE.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Preserve.--There is hereby established the \nOpal Creek Forest Preserve (in this Act referred to as the \n``Preserve'') for the purpose developing and maintaining the research, \neducational, and recreational values of the Preserve.\n    (b) Description of Preserve.--The Preserve shall consist of those \nFederal lands located in the Detroit Ranger District of the Willamette \nNational Forest in the State of Oregon that are generally depicted on \nthe map dated June 18, 1992, and entitled the ``Opal Creek Preserve \nArea''.
