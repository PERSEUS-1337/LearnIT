FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has \n        long targeted Israel with systematic, politically motivated, \n        assaults on its legitimacy designed to stigmatize and isolate \n        Israel internationally.\n            (2) The UNHRC maintains a permanent agenda item known as \n        ``Item 7'' to ensure that Israel will be criticized at every \n        gathering of the UNHRC.\n            (3) At its 31st session on March 24, 2016, the UNHRC \n        targeted Israel with a commercial boycott, calling for the \n        establishment of a database, such as a ``blacklist'', of \n        companies that operate, or have business relations with \n        entities that operate, beyond Israel's 1949 Armistice lines, \n        including East Jerusalem.\n            (4) For a half century, Congress has combatted anti-Israel \n        boycotts and other discriminatory activity under the Export \n        Administration Act of 1979 (as continued in effect under the \n        International Emergency Economic Powers Act), under the \n        Ribicoff Amendment to the Tax Reform Act, in free trade \n        agreements with Bahrain and Oman, and in Saudi Arabia's \n        accession negotiations to the World Trade Organization.\n            (5) The recent action of the UNHRC is reminiscent of the \n        Arab League Boycott which also called for the establishment of \n        a ``blacklist'' and promoted a primary, as well as a secondary \n        and tertiary, boycott against Israel, targeting United States \n        and other companies that trade or invest with or in Israel, \n        designed to harm Israel, any business operating in, or doing \n        business, with Israel, or companies that do business with \n        companies operating in Israel.\n            (6) Congress recently passed anti-boycott, divestment, and \n        sanctions measures in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade \n        Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (title I of Public \n        Law 114-26; 19 U.S.C. 4201 et seq.) and the Trade Facilitation \n        and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-125), which \n        establish, among other things--\n                    (A) the United States opposition to boycott, \n                divestment, and sanctions activity targeting Israel;\n                    (B) requirements that the United States utilize \n                trade negotiations to combat state-led or international \n                governmental organization-led boycott, divestment, and \n                sanctions activity targeting Israel; and\n                    (C) reporting requirements regarding the actions of \n                foreign countries or international organizations that \n                establish barriers to trade or investment for United \n                States companies in or with Israel.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Congress opposes the United Nations Human Right Council resolution \nof March 24, 2016, which urges countries to pressure their own \ncompanies to divest from, or break contracts with, Israel, and calls \nfor the creation of a ``blacklist'' of companies that either operate, \nor have business relations with entities that operate, beyond Israel's \n1949 Armistice lines, including East Jerusalem, and views such policies \nas a boycott of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel.\n\nSEC. 4.
