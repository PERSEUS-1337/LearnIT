FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) States differ substantially in demographics, in school \n        governance, and in school finance and funding. The \n        administrative and funding mechanisms that help schools in 1 \n        State improve may not prove successful in other States.\n            (2) Although the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n        1965 and other Federal education statutes afford flexibility to \n        State and local educational agencies in implementing Federal \n        programs, certain requirements of Federal education statutes or \n        regulations may impede local efforts to reform and improve \n        education.\n            (3) By granting waivers of certain statutory and regulatory \n        requirements, the Federal Government can remove impediments for \n        local educational agencies in implementing educational reforms \n        and raising the achievement levels of all children.\n            (4) State educational agencies are closer to local school \n        systems, implement statewide educational reforms with both \n        Federal and State funds, and are responsible for maintaining \n        accountability for local activities consistent with State \n        standards and assessment systems. Therefore, State educational \n        agencies are often in the best position to align waivers of \n        Federal and State requirements with State and local \n        initiatives.\n            (5) The Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act \n        allows State educational agencies the flexibility to waive \n        certain Federal requirements, along with related State \n        requirements, but allows only 12 States to qualify for such \n        waivers.\n            (6) Expansion of the waiver authority under such Act will \n        allow for the waiver of statutory and regulatory requirements \n        that impede implementation of State and local educational \n        improvement plans, or that unnecessarily burden program \n        administration, while maintaining the intent and purposes of \n        affected programs, and maintaining such fundamental \n        requirements as those relating to civil rights, educational \n        equity, and accountability.\n            (7) To achieve the State goals for the education of \n        children in the State, the focus must be on results in raising \n        the achievement of all students, not process.\n\nSEC. 3.
