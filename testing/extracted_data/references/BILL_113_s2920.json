FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States of America serves as a beacon of \n        refuge to thousands of victims fleeing religious, ethnic, \n        racial, and other forms of persecution around the world and has \n        become the home to thousands of survivors of the Nazi \n        Holocaust.\n            (2) In order to safeguard the integrity of the refugee and \n        asylum system that has provided safety to those who fled the \n        Holocaust, and in order to ensure that those survivors do not \n        have to share their adopted homeland with their former \n        persecutors, the policy of the United States has been that this \n        country should not provide safe haven for those who \n        participated in acts of Nazi persecution.\n            (3) Congress enacted laws specifically to exclude or to \n        remove participants of Nazi persecution from the United States \n        and never intended that those individuals should be entitled to \n        the benefits of citizenship or residency.\n\nSEC. 3.
