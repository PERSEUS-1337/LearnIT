FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n     (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys \n        (1976-1980 and 2003-2006) conducted for the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention show that obesity prevalence increased \n        from 5.0 percent to 12.4 percent in children aged 2 to 5 years, \n        from 6.5 percent to 17.0 percent in those aged 6-11 years and \n        from 5.0 percent to 17.6 percent in those aged 12 to 19 years.\n            (2) A 2007 Department of Agriculture School Nutrition \n        Dietary study found that an estimated 70 percent of schools \n        serve meals that exceed recommended levels of saturated fat, \n        which is linked to heart disease and other obesity-related \n        chronic diseases, such as diabetes and some cancers.\n            (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts \n        one in three children born in the year 2000 will develop \n        diabetes in his or her life.\n            (4) A Yale University study of overweight and obese \n        children found higher than normal blood sugar. Twenty-five \n        percent of children age 4 to 10 had impaired glucose tolerance, \n        suggesting diabetes may soon occur.\n            (5) Healthy school meals are essential for protecting \n        children from weight problems and other diet-related \n        conditions; meals too high in fat and calories are found to \n        contribute to weight and health problems.\n            (6) The Department of Agriculture's National Nutrient \n        Database lists vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes as \n        being extremely low in saturated fat and containing no \n        cholesterol.\n            (7) The American Medical Association and the American \n        Public Health Association have passed resolutions calling for \n        plant-based foods including vegetables, fruits, legumes, \n        grains, and healthful dairy alternative beverages to be \n        included in school meals.\n            (8) A rapidly increasing number of families in the United \n        States opt for plant-based meals for health, ethical, or \n        religious reasons.\n            (9) The July 2009 Journal of the American Dietetic \n        Association published an official position paper of the \n        American Dietetic Association which concluded that plant-based \n        diets are nutritionally adequate for everyone, including \n        children, and provide health benefits when compared to other \n        eating patterns.\n            (10) Studies have shown that the bioavailability of calcium \n        from soymilk fortified with calcium carbonate is equivalent to \n        cow's milk.\n            (11) The Department of Agriculture includes fruits, \n        vegetables, whole grains, and legumes in its commodities \n        program, but these essential ingredients to healthy meals are \n        often underutilized or unavailable to many schools.\n            (12) Access to healthful plant-based school lunch options \n        is essential to improving the health of America's children.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the health of \nAmerica's schoolchildren by raising the nutritional quality of food \nthrough the promotion of plant-based meals and healthful dairy \nalternative beverages in schools.\n\nSEC. 3.
