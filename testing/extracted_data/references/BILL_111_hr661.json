FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) After significant work educating the people of the \n        United States about the February 17, 2009, digital television \n        transition, efforts to delay the transition will confuse \n        people, leaving them less, rather than more, prepared. Delay \n        will--\n                    (A) not move a single consumer off of the waiting \n                list for analog-to-digital converter box coupons;\n                    (B) require an additional appropriation of $650 \n                million in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \n                of 2009;\n                    (C) jeopardize the availability of the spectrum \n                that the transition clears for police, firefighters, \n                and emergency personnel (spectrum that public safety \n                officials stated 5 years to the day before September \n                11, 2001, they needed), and jeopardize that spectrum \n                despite the support in the 2004 report of the 9/11 \n                Commission for legislation setting an even earlier firm \n                date; and\n                    (D) jeopardize the availability of the spectrum \n                that the transition clears for advanced wireless \n                services, perhaps our Nation's best and quickest way to \n                improve broadband deployment, stimulating the economy \n                and creating job growth.\n            (2) The program sending households up to 2 coupons, each \n        worth $40, to use for the purchase of analog-to-digital \n        converter boxes is not out of funds. Only approximately half of \n        the $1.5 billion in the coupon program has been spent on \n        redeemed coupons; the other half remains in circulation, which \n        is why there is a waiting list. Under current law, the coupons \n        expire 90 days after issuance if not redeemed. Approximately \n        300,000 coupons expire every week, and the recouped funding is \n        used to send more coupons.\n            (3) In a January 14, 2009, letter, the Commerce Department \n        said that the National Telecommunications and Information \n        Administration could immediately resume sending coupons even \n        before existing ones expire if Congress authorized another $250 \n        million for the program. The Treasury of the United States \n        might even recoup those funds because of unredeemed coupons \n        that expire at the end of the program.\n            (4) Industry has spent more than $1 billion successfully \n        educating consumers about the transition and the February 17, \n        2009, transition date. According to Nielsen, as of the end of \n        November 2008, approximately 93 percent of television \n        households already had one or more televisions ready for the \n        transition because the televisions had a digital tuner, were \n        connected to cable or satellite service, or were connected to a \n        converter box. Approximately 83 percent of television \n        households had all their televisions ready.\n            (5) Only households that rely exclusively on over-the-air \n        antennas to receive television service and that do not have a \n        digital television or a converter box are at risk of losing all \n        television service. According to Nielsen, there are \n        approximately 14.3 million exclusively over-the-air households. \n        The National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n        reports that it has already sent coupons to approximately 13.5 \n        million households that identify themselves as relying \n        exclusively on over-the-air antennas. Thus, only 800,000 \n        exclusively over-the-air households have not yet received a \n        coupon. Approximately 600,000 of those households are on the \n        waiting list to receive a coupon. Authorizing an additional \n        $250 million for the coupon program should help those \n        households receive coupons before the transition date.\n            (6) Based on these figures, only 200,000 households could \n        lose all service if such households do not take action. Such \n        households represent less than 2 percent of exclusively over-\n        the-air households, and less than two-tenths of one percent of \n        all television households. Such a small number of households \n        with the potential to lose service is not reason enough to \n        delay the transition. Government and industry can help \n        households get coupons and converter boxes if such households \n        want them, but a small group will always be unprepared no \n        matter what the government and industry do. In addition, \n        households can always get a converter box without a coupon, \n        either before or after the transition. The converter boxes only \n        cost $40 to $80. Such households have additional options, as \n        well, by which they can receive television service.\n\nSEC. 2. ADDITIONAL COUPONS.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Section 3005 of the Digital Television Transition \nand Public Safety Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-171; 120 Stat. 23) is \namended--\n            (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``$1,500,000,000'' and \n        inserting ``$1,750,000,000''; and\n            (2) in subsection (c)(3)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (A)(i), by striking ``by \n                substituting `$160,000,000''' and inserting ``by \n                substituting `$170,000,000'''; and\n                    (B) by striking ``by substituting \n                `$1,500,000,000''' each place it appears in \n                subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B) and inserting ``by \n                substituting `$1,750,000,000'''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 309(j)(8)(E)(iii) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(8)(E)(iii)) is amended by \nstriking ``$7,363,000,000'' and inserting ``$7,113,000,000''.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPEDITING DELIVERY.\n\n    Not later than 7 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nAssistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the \nDepartment of Commerce shall expedite the distribution of coupons \nissued under section 3005 of the Digital Television Transition and \nPublic Safety Act of 2005 by directing that such coupons shall be \ndelivered via pre-sorted first class mail service until February 17, \n2009. The Assistant Secretary shall continue to direct that such \ncoupons be delivered by such service subsequent to such date if the \nAssistant Secretary determines that doing so will significantly improve \ncoupon redemption rates without jeopardizing the availability of \nadministrative funds.\n\nSEC. 4. EXTENSION OF AUCTION AUTHORITY.\n\n    Section 309(j)(11) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n309(j)(11)) is amended by striking ``2011'' and inserting ``2012''."
