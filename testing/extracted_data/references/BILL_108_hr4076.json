FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Chemicals known as brominated flame retardants are \n        widely used throughout the United States. To meet stringent \n        fire standards, manufacturers add brominated flame retardants \n        to a multitude of products, including plastics used in \n        televisions, and foam and textiles used in furniture.\n            (2) While flame retardants make a valuable contribution to \n        fire safety, it is imperative to understand the potential \n        effects on human health and the environment that their use \n        brings.\n            (3) Initial studies indicate that pentabrominated diphenyl \n        ethers and octabrominated diphenyl ethers, which are \n        subcategories of brominated flame retardants, disrupt thyroid \n        hormone balance and contribute to a variety of developmental \n        deficits, including low intelligence and learning disabilities \n        in laboratory animals.\n            (4) In particular, it is recognized that there is a high \n        level of public concern over scientific findings of certain \n        polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the environment and in human \n        breast milk. Certain polybrominated diphenyl ethers have \n        increased 40-fold in human breast milk since the 1970s. \n        Chemicals found in breast milk are somewhat reflective of the \n        chemicals found throughout the body of those tested, including \n        in a fetus.\n            (5) The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends \n        breastfeeding despite potential exposure to toxic chemicals, as \n        breast milk helps protect infants against certain diseases and \n        infections. In addition, several studies point to the \n        improvement of cognitive development in children who \n        breastfeed.\n            (6) The State of California and several countries have \n        phased out products containing pentabrominated diphenyl ethers \n        and octabrominated diphenyl ethers in order to protect human \n        health and the environment.\n            (7) To improve the end-of-life management of articles made \n        with polybrominated diphenyl ethers, a tracking and labeling \n        system should be incorporated in the manufacturing, processing, \n        and distribution of products containing pentabrominated \n        diphenyl ethers, octabrominated diphenyl ethers, or \n        decabrominated diphenyl ethers.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Section 15 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 \nU.S.C. 2614) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``or'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n        inserting ``; or''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(5) manufacture, process, or distribute in commerce a \n        product, or a flame-retarded part of a product, containing more \n        than 1 percent of pentabrominated diphenyl ethers or \n        octabrominated diphenyl ethers by mass.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \ntake effect 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. REGULATION.\n\n    Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2605) is \namended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(f) Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers.--\n            ``(1) Determination and identification of precursors.--The \n        Administrator shall determine whether pentabrominated diphenyl \n        ethers or octabrominated diphenyl ethers are formed in the \n        environment as a result of chemical degradation of any other \n        material, and shall identify any such precursors that are found \n        to exist.\n            ``(2) Phase out.--If the Administrator identifies any \n        precursor under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall take \n        appropriate actions under this section or section 5 to ensure \n        that products and processes that introduce such precursor into \n        the environment are phased out within 3 years after the date of \n        enactment of this subsection, unless the Administrator finds \n        that to do so would endanger human health and the environment.\n            ``(3) Labeling requirement.--Not later than 1 year after \n        the date of enactment of this subsection, the Administrator \n        shall issue regulations requiring any product containing \n        pentabrominated diphenyl ethers, octabrominated diphenyl \n        ethers, or decabrominated diphenyl ethers, that is manufactured \n        18 months or more after the date of enactment of this \n        subsection to bear a label that meets--\n                    ``(A) the requirements of standard ISO 11469, \n                subsection 1043-4, established by the International \n                Organization for Standardization, as in effect on the \n                date of enactment of this subsection, including \n                subsequent revisions thereto that have been certified \n                by the Administrator; or\n                    ``(B) alternative requirements that the \n                Administrator certifies convey the same information as \n                is required under subparagraph (A).''."
