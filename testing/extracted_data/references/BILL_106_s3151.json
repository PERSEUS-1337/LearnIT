The report shall include recommendations \nfor mitigation to combat rail noise, standards for determining when \nnoise mitigation is required, needed changes in Federal law to give \nFederal, State, and local governments flexibility in combating railroad \nnoise, and possible funding mechanisms for financing mitigation \nprojects.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall transmit \nto Congress the report of the National Academy of Sciences on the \nresults of the study under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 3.
