FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Chimney Rock in Southwestern Colorado contains \n        nationally significant archeological, geologic, biological, \n        cultural, educational, recreational, visual, and scenic value.\n            (2) The unique, thousand-year-old Ancestral Puebloan \n        community located beneath the prominent Chimney Rock Pinnacles, \n        with its dramatic 360 degree view of the surrounding landscape, \n        provides an outstanding opportunity to enhance understanding \n        and appreciation of the prehistory of North America and the \n        accomplishments of Native American cultures during that period.\n            (3) The Chimney Rock Ancestral Puebloan community is one of \n        the largest Pueblo II period (900-1150 AD) communities in \n        southwestern Colorado and one of the finest examples of a \n        Chacoan system ``Outlier''. The Chacoan system was a complex \n        system of interdependent communities bound by economic, social, \n        political, and religious relationships. Chimney Rock contains \n        many outstanding hallmarks of the Chacoan system and \n        significant archeological resources of other periods.\n            (4) The design of the Chimney Rock Ancestral Puebloan \n        community incorporates Ancestral Puebloan knowledge of \n        astronomy. The twin Chimney Rock Pinnacles, for example, appear \n        to have served as a frame for viewing astronomical alignments.\n            (5) Ancestral Puebloan culture is part of the heritage of \n        many Southwestern Indian cultures, and has influenced the \n        culture, art and architecture of the Western United States.\n            (6) The Chimney Rock Ancestral Puebloan community has \n        special value for the Puebloan and Tribal people of today.\n            (7) Chimney Rock provides a dramatic record of geological \n        and astronomical time.\n            (8) Chimney Rock is a natural laboratory that provides \n        exceptional opportunities for scientific study in the fields of \n        geology, ecology, prehistoric archeology, and the ways in which \n        they interrelate.\n            (9) Chimney Rock provides abundant opportunities to enhance \n        the understanding and appreciation by the public of the \n        achievements and ways of life of the Ancestral Puebloans, in a \n        rugged and spectacular landscape.\n            (10) Chimney Rock has long been maintained through \n        community care and management. Volunteers and volunteer \n        organizations have provided outstanding educational and \n        interpretive programs and site stewardship, and have encouraged \n        academic scientific investigation.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n        Agriculture; and\n            (2) the term ``National Monument'' means the Chimney Rock \n        National Monument.\n\nSEC. 4.
