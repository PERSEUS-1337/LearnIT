FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The demand for higher education in Africa has been \n        increasing at very high rates and is rapidly overtaking the \n        capacity of current infrastructure and staffing capability.\n            (2) Africa's challenges in higher education are substantial \n        and have important social, economic, and stability dimensions.\n            (3) Despite increasing enrollments, sub-Saharan Africa's \n        gross enrollment ration is just 5 percent as compared to 11 \n        percent in India, 20 percent in China, and 70 percent in high \n        income countries.\n            (4) On average, institutions of higher education in Africa \n        have only about 70 percent of the staff required by their \n        programs; staff development, nurturing and retention are \n        important elements of higher education programming.\n            (5) In 2005, only 28 percent of African University \n        graduates completed their degrees in science and technology \n        (STEM) fields--agriculture, engineering, health sciences, \n        general sciences.\n            (6) African higher education institutions have addressed \n        many critical development challenges in collaboration with \n        regional and international counterparts, such as the United \n        Nations, the International Agricultural Research Centres, and \n        bilateral and regional assistance agencies.\n            (7) Higher education has expanded to provide more \n        opportunities for advanced education to graduates of the \n        secondary school systems and it has sought new ways to achieve \n        university collaboration across national and regional \n        boundaries.\n            (8) Africa has made important strides as public \n        universities have doubled from roughly 100 to 200 from 1990 to \n        2007 and private tertiary institutions have increased from \n        around 24 to an estimated 468 during this same period.\n            (9) Historically, sub-Saharan Africa was marked by several \n        centers of excellence in higher education. Linked to former \n        European sponsors, institutions such as Makerere University in \n        Uganda, Kenyatta University in Kenya, Cheik Anta Diop \n        University, Senegal, and the University of Ibadan in Nigeria \n        graduated scholars and professionals that were highly prized \n        around the globe and that served the interests of their \n        respective nations well.\n            (10) These universities serve as ``centres of excellence'' \n        that also have major positive impacts on other universities in \n        their respective regions, and are currently making substantial \n        progress in regaining their national and international \n        prominence.\n            (11) Increasing rates of higher education in developing \n        countries is a critical component to long-term economic growth \n        and stability and poverty reduction.\n            (12) Estimates indicate that a 1-year increase in tertiary \n        education stock would raise steady-state levels of African \n        Gross Domestic Product per capita by 12.2 percent due to factor \n        inputs, potentially boosting incomes by 3 percent after 5 \n        years.\n            (13) Studies of 17 countries found that individuals with \n        higher education levels were more likely to engage in \n        entrepreneurial activity, and more educated entrepreneurs \n        created larger numbers of jobs than less educated \n        entrepreneurs.\n            (14) Research has found a positive and statistically \n        significant correlation between higher education enrollment \n        rates and governance indicators, including absence of \n        corruption, higher stands of rule of law, absence of ethnic \n        tensions, increased bureaucratic quality, low risk of \n        repudiation of contracts by governments, and low risk of \n        appropriation abuse.\n            (15) A cadre of skilled, educated Africans is a necessary \n        component to addressing every sector of development, whether it \n        be poverty alleviation and economic growth, combating disease, \n        improving governance, or rule of law and human rights, but such \n        a cadre does not currently exist in large enough numbers to \n        truly effect a sea-change in these areas in most of the \n        countries in the region.\n            (16) Exchange programs which bring Africans to developed \n        countries for training, while an essential component of \n        building intellectual capacity in Africa, will not by \n        themselves reach enough students and scholars to have a \n        transformational effect on African institutions of higher \n        education.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) support for primary and secondary education is vitally \n        important to development in sub-Saharan Africa and such support \n        should be increased;\n            (2) the United States and other donors must respond to the \n        increased need for qualified teachers and demand for access to \n        higher education created by expanded access to primary and \n        secondary education on the continent by providing commensurate \n        assistance to colleges and universities in sub-Saharan Africa;\n            (3) partnerships between United States colleges and \n        universities and colleges and universities in sub-Saharan \n        Africa represent an important means through which access to \n        quality tertiary education;\n            (4) members of the African Diaspora have a crucial role to \n        play in improving the capacity of African colleges and \n        universities;\n            (5) the international donor community must help build \n        indigenous intellectual capacity in sub-Saharan Africa in order \n        to expand and enhance the ability of Africans to achieve \n        economic growth, improve social and political stability, and to \n        address such challenges as the HIV/AIDS pandemic, climate \n        change, conflict and governance; and\n            (6) the United States must commit to providing long-term \n        assistance to build the capacity of higher education \n        institutions in sub-Saharan Africa aimed at improving \n        administrative capacity, physical infrastructure and curriculum \n        to provide high quality education in fields such as the social, \n        natural, biological, agricultural, life, computer and health \n        sciences; technology; business; engineering; mathematics; \n        economics; and education; and improve the ability of \n        institutions in sub-Saharan Africa to support and produce \n        effective research, as well as higher numbers of better trained \n        undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students and \n        professionals to respond to the many challenges facing the \n        region.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n     It is the policy of the United States to provide long-term \nassistance to expand, improve, support, and promote higher education in \nAfrica by building the capacity of African colleges and universities, \nthrough partnerships with colleges and universities in the United \nStates to expand opportunities for students to obtain high quality \nundergraduate- and graduate-level degrees, as well as post-graduate \ntraining, at African colleges and universities.\n\nSEC. 5. ASSISTANCE TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE HIGHER EDUCATION IN SUB-\n              SAHARAN AFRICA.\n\n    Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \nU.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 105 the \nfollowing new section:\n\n``SEC. 105A.
