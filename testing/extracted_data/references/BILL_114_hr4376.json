FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The lack of a Federal requirement to provide employees \n        with pay stubs indicating how their pay is calculated or to \n        allow employee inspections of employers' payroll records \n        significantly impedes efforts to identify and challenge wage \n        and hour violations.\n            (2) In a survey of 4,387 low-wage workers in New York, Los \n        Angeles, and Chicago, more than a quarter of workers were paid \n        less than the minimum wage and among those who worked more than \n        40 hours per week, more than three-quarters were not paid \n        overtime. Fifty-seven percent of these workers reported that \n        they did not receive a pay stub in the previous week.\n            (3) Some employers are increasingly engaging in practices \n        that make it extremely difficult for workers to calculate their \n        pay, including paying workers in cash or by personal checks.\n            (4) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the \n        regulations of the Department of Labor require employers to \n        keep records of employees' pay, the lack of remedies diminishes \n        the effectiveness of this requirement.\n            (5) The Supreme Court held in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens \n        Pottery Co. (328 U.S. 680 (1946)) that where an employer fails \n        to keep records that are required under the Fair Labor \n        Standards Act of 1938, when an employee presents sufficient \n        evidence of the ``amount and extent of that work'', for which \n        the employee was ``improperly compensated'' the burden shifts \n        to the employer to disprove the employee's testimony and \n        evidence of the hours the employee worked and how much he or \n        she was paid.\n            (6) Far too many courts have failed to shift the burden to \n        the employer, where the employer has failed to keep records or \n        has kept inadequate records, instead giving the employer's \n        testimony equal weight to credible evidence produced by the \n        employee.\n\nSEC. 3. PAY STUB REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Disclosure Requirements.--Section 11 of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 211) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n    ``(e) Information To Be Disclosed to Certain Employees.--\n            ``(1) Initial Disclosure.--Each employer shall provide an \n        initial disclosure to each employee who is not subject to the \n        exemptions set forth in section 13 within 15 days of the date \n        such employee is hired or any of the information in \n        subparagraphs (A) through (C) changes with respect to that \n        employee.
