FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) American society is increasingly dependent on the \n        Internet for communications, entertainment, commerce, and \n        banking.\n            (2) For the Internet to reach its full potential in these \n        and other respects, it must continue to be a trustworthy \n        medium. This means, for example, that Internet users should be \n        able to trust the stated origin of Internet communications and \n        the stated destination of Internet hyperlinks.\n            (3) Internet users are increasingly subjected to scams \n        based on misleading or false communications that trick the user \n        into sending money, or trick the user into revealing enough \n        information to enable various forms of identify theft that \n        result in financial loss.\n            (4) One class of such scams, called ``phishing'', uses \n        false e-mail return addresses, stolen graphics, stylistic \n        imitation, misleading or disguised hyperlinks, so-called \n        ``social engineering'', and other artifices to trick users into \n        revealing personally identifiable information. After obtaining \n        this information, the ``phisher'' then uses the information to \n        create unlawful identification documents and/or to unlawfully \n        obtain money or property.\n            (5) These crimes victimize not only the individuals whose \n        information is stolen, but the entire online community, \n        including millions of people who rely on the integrity of the \n        Internet's system of addresses and hyperlinks.\n\nSEC. 3. CRIMINAL OFFENSE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 63 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 1351.
