FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        regulates the possession, use, and transfer of select agents \n        and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to \n        public health and safety.\n            (2) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \n        regulates the possession, use, and transfer of select agents \n        and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to \n        animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products.\n            (3) As of April 2008, there are 72 select agents and \n        toxins, 13 of which are found naturally in the United States.\n            (4) As of April 2008, there are 325 entities registered \n        with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work \n        with select agents and toxins and 75 entities registered with \n        the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. There are 9,918 \n        individuals approved to work with select agents and toxins \n        through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and \n        4,336 through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n            (5) Biocontainment laboratories are used by scientists to \n        study infectious materials safely and effectively. Laboratory \n        biological research is categorized by the safety level at which \n        it is performed. There are 4 safety levels, termed Biosafety \n        Level (BSL) 1 through 4.\n\n             TITLE I--SELECT AGENT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION\n\nSEC. 101.
