SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``America Realizing the Informational \nSkills and Initiative of New Graduates Act of 2017'' or ``America \nRISING Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2012 \n        the national unemployment rate for individuals ages 25 years \n        and older with a bachelor's degree was 4.5 percent and 6.2 \n        percent for individuals with an associate's degree. For college \n        graduates ages 18 to 25 the national unemployment rate in 2012 \n        was higher at 7.7 percent. Because the typical college \n        graduates leaves college owing an average of $29,400 in student \n        loan debt, a rate that has increased 6 percent every year since \n        2008, the current job market offers exceedingly few \n        opportunities for such graduates to obtain employment at a \n        salary adequate to service their college loan debt.\n            (2) There are more than 26 million small businesses in the \n        United States. In the current economic climate, these small \n        businesses are experiencing difficulty in finding the resources \n        needed to increase sales, modernize operations, and hire new \n        employees.\n            (3) Recent college graduates need the experience that can \n        be obtained only in the workplace to refine their skills and \n        develop the entrepreneurial qualities that can lead to the \n        creation of new businesses and jobs.\n            (4) Existing small businesses and companies will benefit \n        from the information and technology skills possessed by many of \n        the Nation's recent college graduates.\n            (5) Enabling recent college graduates to obtain employment \n        with small businesses benefits the national economy by \n        providing such businesses the human capital and technical \n        expertise needed to compete and win in the global economy of \n        the 21st century.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF AMERICA RISING PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of \nEducation shall, jointly, establish a program under which--\n            (1) grants are paid to eligible employers to defray the \n        cost of compensation paid by such employers to recent college \n        graduates; and\n            (2) grants are paid to recent college graduates to enable \n        such graduates to defray the cost of undertaking further \n        postsecondary courses at an institution of higher education for \n        up to 24 months in subjects relating to mathematics, science, \n        engineering, or technology.\n    (b) Terms and Conditions.--\n            (1) In general.--A grant under this section may be made on \n        such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine.\n            (2) Deferral of federal student loan obligations.--Each \n        recent college graduate participating in the program under this \n        section (by benefitting from a grant awarded under paragraph \n        (1), or receiving a grant under paragraph (2), of subsection \n        (a)) may defer payment on Federal student loans made to the \n        graduate under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n        U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) for the period of the graduate's \n        participation in the program.\n            (3) Grants to eligible employers.--With respect to a grant \n        awarded under subsection (a)(1)--\n                    (A) an eligible employer--\n                            (i) may use the grant to defray the cost of \n                        compensation for not more than 2 recent college \n                        graduates; and\n                            (ii) shall provide a compensation amount to \n                        each recent college graduate participating in \n                        the program that is equal to or greater than \n                        the grant amount received by the employer for \n                        the graduate;
