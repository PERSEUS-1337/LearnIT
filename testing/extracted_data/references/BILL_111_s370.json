FINDINGS.\n\n    The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since the United States began its Global War on \n        Terrorism, terrorists have been captured by the United States \n        and their allies and detained in facilities at Guantanamo Bay \n        Detention Facility (GTMO), Cuba.\n            (2) The detainee complex at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is the \n        only complex in the world that can safely and humanely hold \n        individuals that pose a high-security risk to the United \n        States. It is a secure location away from population centers, \n        provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides \n        multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on \n        compliance of the detainee, and provides medical care not \n        available to a majority of the population of the world.\n            (3) GTMO is the single greatest repository of human \n        intelligence in the war on terror. This intelligence has \n        prevented terrorist attacks and saved lives in the past and \n        continues to do so today.\n            (4) New intelligence being collected from detainees at GTMO \n        is being used to fight terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n        around the globe.\n            (5) Intelligence information obtained from questioning \n        detainees includes--\n                    (A) the organizational structure of al-Qaida and \n                other terrorist groups;\n                    (B) the extent of terrorist presence in Europe, the \n                United States, and the Middle East;\n                    (C) al-Qaida's pursuit of weapons of mass \n                destruction;\n                    (D) methods of recruitment and locations of \n                recruitment centers;\n                    (E) terrorist skill sets, including general and \n                specialized operative training; and\n                    (F) how legitimate financial activities are used to \n                hide terrorist operations.\n            (6) The Expeditionary Legal Complex (ELC) located at GTMO \n        is the only one of its kind in the world. It provides a secure \n        location to secure and try detainees charged by the United \n        States Government, full access to sensitive and classified \n        information, full access to defense lawyers and prosecution, \n        and full media access by the press.\n            (7) There are on average two lawyers for every detainee \n        that has been charged or had charges preferred against them at \n        GTMO.\n            (8) There are 127 doctors, nurses, and medical technicians \n        dedicated to caring for and maintaining the health of each \n        detainee--a ratio of 1:2 (one health care professional for \n        every two detainees).\n            (9) GTMO is operated by the Department of Defense and only \n        interrogation techniques approved by the Secretary of Defense \n        have been used.\n            (10) Detainees are being treated humanely.\n            (11) There are no solitary confinement facilities at \n        Guantanamo.\n            (12) Water boarding has never occurred at GTMO.\n            (13) Current treatment and oversight exceed any maximum-\n        security prison in the world.\n            (14) Since 2002, more than 520 detainees have departed \n        Guantanamo for other countries, including Albania, Afghanistan, \n        Australia, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, \n        France, Great Britain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, \n        Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, \n        Spain, Sweden, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uganda, the United \n        Kingdom, and Yemen.\n            (15) There are approximately 245 detainees from over 30 \n        countries remaining at GTMO. These detainees include terrorist \n        trainers, terrorist financiers, bomb makers, Osama bin Laden \n        bodyguards, recruiters and facilitators, and would-be suicide \n        bombers. Detainees remaining at GTMO fall into three \n        categories:\n                    (A) Detainees who have been cleared for release but \n                the United States has not been able to find a foreign \n                country willing to accept them.\n                    (B) Detainees who have been tried, had charges \n                referred to trial, or are awaiting for referral to \n                trial.\n                    (C) Detainees who are either of high threat to the \n                United States or are from countries where the United \n                States is unable to get sufficient assurances that the \n                country will mitigate their threat if transferred.\n            (16) The Pentagon claims that 61 of released GTMO detainees \n        have ``returned to the fight''.\n            (17) Said Ali al-Shihri, suspected of involvement in the \n        bombing of the United States Embassy in Yemen on 17 September \n        2008, was released to Saudi Arabia in 2007, passed through a \n        Saudi rehabilitation program, and has resurfaced as the new \n        deputy leader of al-Qaida in Yemen.\n            (18) In 2007, the Senate passed a resolution, 94-3, \n        stating, ``detainees housed at Guantanamo should not be \n        released into American society, nor should they be transferred \n        stateside into facilities in American communities and \n        neighborhoods.''.\n            (19) On January 20, 2009, President Obama instructed \n        military prosecutors to seek a 120-day suspension of legal \n        proceedings at GTMO or what administration officials called ``a \n        continuance of the proceedings''.\n            (20) On January 22, 2009, President Obama ordered the \n        closing of the GTMO prisons within a year.\n            (21) The United States is still in a global war on terror, \n        engaged in armed conflict with terrorist organizations, and \n        will, in all probability, continue to capture terrorists who \n        will be detained in a facility.\n            (22) If the detention facility at GTMO is closed, some \n        United States domestic or overseas prison will have to house \n        these detainees while they await disposition.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO TRANSFER DETAINEES AT NAVAL \n              STATION GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, TO ANY FACILITY IN THE \n              UNITED STATES OR CONSTRUCT ANY FACILITY FOR SUCH \n              DETAINEES IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to any \ndepartment or agency of the United States Government may be obligated \nor expended for a purpose as follows:\n            (1) To transfer any detainee of the United States housed at \n        Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to any facility in the \n        United States or its territories.\n            (2) To construct, improve, modify, or otherwise enhance any \n        facility in the United States or its territories for the \n        purpose of housing any detainee described in paragraph (1).\n            (3) To house or otherwise incarcerate any detainee \n        described in paragraph (1) in the United States or its \n        territories."
