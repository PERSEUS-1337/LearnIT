FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Management of Federal lands has been characterized by \n        large cyclical variations in fire suppression policies, timber \n        harvesting levels, and the attention paid to commodity and \n        noncommodity values.\n            (2) Forests on Federal lands are experiencing significant \n        disease epidemics and insect infestations.\n            (3) The combination of inconsistent management and natural \n        effects has resulted in a hazardous fuels buildup on Federal \n        lands that threatens catastrophic wildfire.\n            (4) While the long-term effect of catastrophic wildfire on \n        forests and forest systems is a matter of debate, there should \n        be no question that catastrophic wildfire must be prevented in \n        areas of the Federal lands where wildlands abut, or are located \n        in close proximity to, communities, residences, and other \n        private and public facilities on non-Federal lands.\n            (5) Wildfire resulting from hazardous fuels buildup in such \n        wildland/urban interface areas threatens the destruction of \n        communities, puts human life and property at risk, threatens \n        community water supplies with erosion that follows wildfire, \n        destroys wildlife habitat, and damages ambient air quality.\n            (6) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the \n        Interior must assign a high priority and undertake aggressive \n        management to achieve the elimination of hazardous fuel buildup \n        and reduction of the risk of wildfire to the wildland/urban \n        interface areas on Federal lands. Protection of human life and \n        property, including water supplies and ambient air quality, \n        must be given the highest priority.\n            (7) The noncommodity resources, including riparian zones \n        and wildlife habitats, in wildland/urban interface areas on \n        Federal lands which must be protected to provide recreational \n        opportunities, clean water, and other amenities to neighboring \n        communities and the public suffer from a backlog of unfunded \n        forest management projects designed to provide such protection.\n            (8) In a period of fiscal austerity characterized by \n        shrinking budgets and personnel levels, Congress must provide \n        the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior \n        with innovative tools to accomplish the required reduction in \n        hazardous fuels buildup and undertake other forest management \n        projects in the wildland/urban interface areas on the Federal \n        lands at least cost.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide new authority \nand innovative tools to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary \nof the Interior to safeguard communities, lives, and property by \nreducing or eliminating the threat of catastrophic wildfire, and to \nundertake needed forest management projects, in wildland/urban \ninterface areas on Federal lands.\n\nSEC. 3.
