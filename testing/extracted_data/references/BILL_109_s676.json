FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The national secondary school graduation rate is only \n        70 percent. For the class of 2001, the national graduation rate \n        was only 51 percent for African-American students and 52 \n        percent for Latino students.\n            (2) In our Nation's high poverty urban districts, as few as \n        \\1/3\\ of students graduate from secondary school. In these \n        places, completion rates among certain disadvantaged groups of \n        students are often lower still.\n            (3) In rural areas, where \\1/3\\ of American students attend \n        school, only 58.8 percent of students attend institutions of \n        higher education, compared with 68.2 percent of American \n        students from urban and suburban areas.\n            (4) Each school day, approximately 3,000 secondary school \n        students drop out of school.\n            (5) Alaska Natives have a substantially higher dropout rate \n        than all other students in Alaska as a group. The dropout rate \n        is 8.8 percent for Alaska Natives compared to 4.7 percent for \n        the 2001-2002 school year for other students in Alaska.\n            (6) The 6,000,000 secondary students who make up the lowest \n        25 percent in terms of achievement scores are 3.5 times more \n        likely to drop out of secondary school than students in the \n        next highest quarter of academic achievement, and are 20 times \n        more likely to drop out than high achieving students.\n            (7) Approximately 25 percent of secondary school students \n        are reading at below basic levels. The problem is even more \n        severe for poor students of color. The average minority or low-\n        income 9th grader performs at only the 5th or 6th grade level \n        in reading.\n            (8) During the 2002-2003 school year Alaska Benchmark \n        Examinations, significantly lower percentages of Alaska Natives \n        were proficient in reading, writing, and mathematics at each of \n        the 3 tested grade levels when compared to all other students. \n        These achievement gaps persist into secondary school, where \n        significantly lower percentages of Alaska Natives were \n        proficient in the subjects tested on the Alaska High School \n        Graduation Qualifying Examination in all grade levels where \n        that test was administered in 2002-2003 school year.\n            (9) Achievement gaps persist across racial and \n        socioeconomic lines in rural schools. There are 2,500,000 poor \n        children in rural areas and the child poverty rate in some \n        rural areas is 2 to 3 times the national average.\n            (10) Recruiting and retaining good teachers is an enormous \n        challenge in rural areas. The average salary in rural districts \n        is 13.4 percent lower than in nonrural areas, and teachers \n        often teach more than 1 subject, teach in poor working \n        conditions, live far from colleges, have little access to \n        training, and face geographic and social isolation.\n            (11) Low graduation rates and college attendance rates are \n        evidence that, in the earlier grades, schools are not meeting \n        the fundamental achievement needs of low-income, minority, and \n        rural students.\n            (12) Even those students who do graduate from secondary \n        schools and go on to college are struggling because they lack \n        the basic skills to succeed. Approximately 40 percent of all 4-\n        year college students take a remedial course and 63 percent of \n        all community college students are assigned to at least 1 \n        remedial course.\n            (13) A small percentage of low-income students who manage \n        to enter college are able to complete a degree. Of students \n        from families in the bottom 20 percent in terms of income who \n        enter college, only 27 percent go on to complete a 2- or 4-year \n        college degree within 8 years.\n            (14) Graduation rates impact early drop-out rates in the \n        military. The attrition rates in the military of both \n        individuals who are not secondary school graduates and GED \n        recipients are 8 percentage points higher than the attrition \n        rate of secondary school graduates. As a result, the Armed \n        Forces no longer accept secondary school dropouts and put less \n        value on alternative certificates.\n            (15) Students who fail to graduate from secondary school \n        are more likely to engage in criminal activity than students \n        who graduate. A 1-percent increase in secondary school \n        graduation rates would save approximately $1,400,000,000 in \n        costs associated with incarceration, or about $2,100 for each \n        male secondary school graduate.\n            (16) In today's workplace, nearly 8 in 10 adults with \n        baccalaureate degrees are employed, but for those who completed \n        secondary school only, the number falls to about 6 in 10. And \n        for students who dropped out of secondary school, the number \n        drops further to 4 in 10.\n            (17) Employment projections indicate that jobs requiring \n        only a secondary school degree will grow by just 9 percent by \n        the year 2008, while those jobs requiring a bachelor's degree \n        will grow by 25 percent and those jobs requiring an associate's \n        degree will grow by 31 percent.\n            (18) Personalization of the school environment has been \n        proven to increase success rates for low-performing secondary \n        school students. Nearly 50 percent of middle school youth and \n        40 percent of secondary school youth report feelings of \n        disengagement from school. Rates are even higher for teens and \n        minorities in urban schools. These feelings result in failure \n        to work hard, to seek assistance, or to take appropriate \n        courses.\n            (19) Effective research-based education programs that \n        improve secondary school graduation rates are comprehensive in \n        nature and include interventions that begin in kindergarten or \n        earlier and span all the grades through grade 12.\n\nSEC. 3.
