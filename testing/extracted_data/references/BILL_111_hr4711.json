FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Postal Service delivery vehicles which operate using \n        gasoline have an average fuel economy of 8 to 12 miles per \n        gallon;\n            (2) the Inspector General of the United States Postal \n        Service recently estimated that, for each delivery vehicle \n        converted from gasoline to electric, the Postal Service would \n        save approximately $1,500 in fuel costs each year;\n            (3) 97 percent of Postal Service delivery routes are less \n        than 40 miles long; and\n            (4) it is in the national interest to reduce American \n        dependence on foreign oil and to support domestic automobile \n        manufacturing.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Postmaster General shall--\n            (1) during each year in the 5-year period beginning on the \n        date of enactment of this Act, replace at least 10 percent of \n        the gasoline-powered motor vehicles in the Postal fleet with \n        electric motor vehicles;\n            (2) take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that, \n        by the end of the 5-year period described in paragraph (1), at \n        least 75 percent of the Postal fleet is comprised of electric \n        motor vehicles; and\n            (3) carry out the preceding provisions of this subsection, \n        in coordination with local electric distribution companies, in \n        a manner consistent with the goals of--\n                    (A) maintaining electric grid reliability; and\n                    (B) minimizing charging costs of electric motor \n                vehicles in the Postal fleet.\n    (b) Buy American.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nelectric motor vehicles acquired to carry out this Act shall be \nelectric motor vehicles manufactured in the United States. The \nPostmaster General shall ensure that manufacturers of electric motor \nvehicles so acquired solicit competitive bids for electric drive \ncomponents and storage devices from domestic manufacturers that \nparticipate in the Department of Energy's Electric Drive Vehicle \nBattery and Component Manufacturing Initiative (or successor program, \nas determined by the Postmaster General in consultation with the \nSecretary of Energy).\n    (c) Oversight.--Not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal \nyear, the Postal Service shall submit to the Postal Regulatory \nCommission a report that includes a detailed accounting of the \nexpenditures made, savings realized, and revenues received by the \nPostal Service pursuant to this section.
