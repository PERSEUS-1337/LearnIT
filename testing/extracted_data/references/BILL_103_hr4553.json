FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) by the year 2050, the world will need to supply between \n        2 and 3 times as much energy as is presently produced to meet \n        minimum requirements for food, shelter, transportation, and \n        economic security;\n            (2) meeting the increased energy demands of the year 2050 \n        cannot be achieved without substantial environmental \n        degradation unless there is a massive shift from dependence on \n        the fossil fuels which today provide more than three-quarters \n        of all energy supply;\n            (3) a wide variety of nonfossil fuel energy technologies \n        must be developed to meet the expected demand of the year 2050;\n            (4) the Federal Government has a responsibility to fund \n        research in energy technologies to help meet future expected \n        energy demand where the technical or economic risks of \n        developing such technologies are too high to be borne solely by \n        the private sector;\n            (5) despite the urgent need to develop a wide variety of \n        nonfossil fuel energy technologies, the Federal Government's \n        investment in all energy supply research and development \n        (including fossil fuels) has declined in real terms by more \n        than two-thirds in the last 14 years;\n            (6) fusion energy is one of the nonfossil fuel technologies \n        which could potentially provide safe, abundant, environmentally \n        sound, secure, and affordable energy supplies in the future;\n            (7) in the last 16 years, fusion energy researchers have \n        made significant progress toward realizing magnetic fusion as a \n        viable source of energy, increasing power production from test \n        reactors more than a million-fold over that time period;\n            (8) while significant engineering, technical, and \n        scientific challenges remain to make fusion energy commercially \n        viable, limited funding remains the primary constraint to more \n        rapid progress;\n            (9) the technical risks and the long time scale needed to \n        demonstrate the commercial viability of fusion energy will \n        likely require a stable, predictable, and sustained investment \n        of government funding for decades to come;\n            (10) while magnetic fusion is the leading fusion \n        technology, research on alternative fusion concepts should \n        continue to be supported;\n            (11) opportunities to participate in international fusion \n        experiments can dramatically lower the cost to the Federal \n        Government of fusion energy research;\n            (12) the United States must demonstrate that it is a \n        credible partner in international scientific programs by being \n        able to make and keep long-term commitments to funding and \n        participation; and\n            (13) the United States should commit to participating in \n        the siting, construction, and operation of ITER as soon as \n        practicable.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) provide direction and authorize appropriations for a \n        broadly based fusion energy research program at the Department \n        of Energy which includes development of the magnetic fusion \n        program and research on alternative fusion concepts;\n            (2) provide an accelerated commitment to United States \n        participation in ITER and provide authorization of \n        appropriations for such activity contingent on meeting program \n        milestones;\n            (3) provide for the selection of a host country and \n        establish a site selection process for ITER; and\n            (4) provide a stable basis of funding for multi-year fusion \n        energy research facility construction commitments through the \n        establishment of a trust fund.\n\nSEC. 4.
