    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Telephone Billing Act of \n2013''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) For years, telephone users have complained that their \n        wireline telephone bills included unauthorized third-party \n        charges.\n            (2) This problem, commonly referred to as ``cramming'', \n        first appeared in the 1990s, after wireline telephone companies \n        opened their billing platforms to an array of third-party \n        vendors offering a variety of services.\n            (3) Since the 1990s, the Federal Communications Commission, \n        the Federal Trade Commission, and State attorneys general have \n        brought multiple enforcement actions against dozens of \n        individuals and companies for engaging in cramming.\n            (4) An investigation by the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n        and Transportation of the Senate confirmed that cramming is a \n        problem of massive proportions and has affected millions of \n        telephone users, costing them billions of dollars in \n        unauthorized third-party charges over the past decade.\n            (5) The Committee showed that third-party billing through \n        wireline telephone numbers has largely failed to become a \n        reliable method of payment that consumers and businesses can \n        use to conduct legitimate commerce.\n            (6) Telephone companies regularly placed third-party \n        charges on their customers' telephone bills without their \n        customers' authorization.\n            (7) Many companies engaged in third-party billing were \n        illegitimate and created solely to exploit the weaknesses in \n        the third-party billing platforms established by telephone \n        companies.\n            (8) In the last decade, millions of business and \n        residential consumers have transitioned from wireline telephone \n        service to interconnected VoIP service.\n            (9) Users of interconnected VoIP service often use the \n        service as the primary telephone line for their residences and \n        businesses.\n            (10) Millions more business and residential consumers are \n        expected to migrate to interconnected VoIP service in the \n        coming years as the evolution of the nation's traditional voice \n        communications networks to IP-based networks continues.\n            (11) Users of interconnected VoIP service that have \n        telephone numbers through the service should be protected from \n        the same vulnerabilities that affected third-party billing \n        through wireline telephone numbers.\n\nSEC. 3. UNAUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY CHARGES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \nU.S.C. 258) is amended--\n            (1) by amending the heading to read as follows: ``sec. 258. \n        preventing illegal changes in subscriber carrier selections and \n        unauthorized third-party charges.''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Prohibition.--\n            ``(1) In general.--No local exchange carrier or provider of \n        interconnected VoIP service shall place or cause to be placed a \n        third-party charge that is not directly related to the \n        provision of telephone services on the bill of a customer, \n        unless--\n                    ``(A) the third-party charge is from a contracted \n                third-party vendor;\n                    ``(B) the third-party charge is for a product or \n                service that a local exchange carrier or provider of \n                interconnected VoIP service jointly markets or jointly \n                sells with its own service;\n                    ``(C) the customer was provided with clear and \n                conspicuous disclosure of all material terms and \n                conditions prior to consenting under subparagraph (D);\n                    ``(D) the customer provided affirmative consent for \n                the placement of the third-party charge on the bill;
