FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) each year, throughout the United States, the 850,000 \n        first responders of Emergency Medical Services answer more than \n        30,000,000 calls to serve 22,000,000 patients in need of life-\n        saving care and comfort at a moment of notice and without \n        reservation;\n            (2) with little regard for their own safety and in the face \n        of all hazards, the first responders of Emergency Medical \n        Services respond across the spectrum of incidents from a \n        medical emergency of a single person to naturally occurring or \n        manmade disasters, including terrorist attacks that threaten \n        the entire United States;\n            (3) the commitment of the first responders of Emergency \n        Medical Services to others, at a moment of notice and despite \n        risk, exemplifies the finest traditions of the spirit of the \n        people of the United States;\n            (4) as an element of the homeland defense strategy of the \n        United States, Emergency Medical Services stands on the \n        ``Nation's first line of defense in the prevention and \n        mitigation of risk from terrorist attacks, man-made incidents, \n        and natural disasters'';\n            (5) the first responders of Emergency Medical Services, \n        along with the members of Law Enforcement and Fire Services, \n        serving in both the public and private sectors as career and \n        volunteer emergency medical service providers--\n                    (A) are a critical element of the homeland and \n                national security efforts of the United States; and\n                    (B) provide for the domestic tranquility of the \n                citizens of the United States;\n            (6) all too often the risks associated with the critical \n        role of Emergency Medical Services results in an unacceptable \n        rate of injury and fatality to first responders;\n            (7) statistics compiled by the Department of Labor and the \n        National Highway Safety Administration indicate that Emergency \n        Medical Services providers--\n                    (A) die in the line of duty at a rate more than \n                twice the national average for all occupational \n                fatalities; and\n                    (B) experience an injury rate of virtually 100 \n                percent during the careers of the providers;\n            (8) the United States has historically and continually \n        relied on the selfless and ultimate sacrifices made by citizens \n        in service to the United States and the families and loved ones \n        of citizens in service to the United States, in order to \n        maintain the domestic tranquility, safety, and security of the \n        United States;\n            (9) the first responders of Emergency Medical Services \n        continue to serve in this finest tradition, in the face of \n        unacceptable sacrifice, risk, and danger in service to the \n        United States and the citizens of the United States;\n            (10) the scope of responsibility assumed by the first \n        responders of Emergency Medical Services is broad and unique; \n        and\n            (11) the sacrifice and commitment of the first responders \n        of Emergency Medical Services in service to the United States \n        is deserving of a commemorative work that recognizes the \n        sacrifice and commitment of the first responders.\n\nSEC. 3.
