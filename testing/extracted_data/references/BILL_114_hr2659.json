TRADE FACILITATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) As a land-locked least-developed country, Nepal has \n        severe challenges reaching markets and developing capacity to \n        export goods. As of 2015, exports from Nepal are approximately \n        $800,000,000 per year, with India the major market at \n        $450,000,000 annually. The United States imports about \n        $80,000,000 worth of goods from Nepal, or 10 percent of the \n        total goods exported from Nepal.\n            (2) The World Bank has found evidence that the overall \n        export competitiveness of Nepal has been declining since 2005. \n        Indices compiled by the World Bank and the Organization for \n        Economic Co-operation and Development found that export costs \n        in Nepal are high with respect to both air cargo and container \n        shipments relative to other low-income countries. Such indices \n        also identify particular weaknesses in Nepal with respect to \n        automation of customs and other trade functions, involvement of \n        local exporters and importers in preparing regulations and \n        trade rules, and export finance.\n            (3) Implementation by Nepal of the Agreement on Trade \n        Facilitation of the World Trade Organization could directly \n        address some of the weaknesses described in paragraph (2).\n    (b) Establishment of Trade Facilitation and Capacity Building \nProgram.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act, the President shall, in consultation with the Government of \nNepal, establish a trade facilitation and capacity building program for \nNepal--\n            (1) to enhance the central export promotion agency of Nepal \n        to support successful exporters and to build awareness among \n        potential exporters in Nepal about opportunities abroad and \n        ways to manage trade documentation and regulations in the \n        United States and other countries;\n            (2) to provide export finance training for financial \n        institutions in Nepal and the Government of Nepal;\n            (3) to assist the Government of Nepal in maintaining \n        publication of all trade regulations, forms for exporters and \n        importers, tax and tariff rates, and other documentation \n        relating to exporting goods on the Internet and developing a \n        robust public-private dialogue, through its National Trade \n        Facilitation Committee, for Nepal to identify timelines for \n        implementation of key reforms and solutions, as provided for \n        under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade \n        Organization; and\n            (4) to increase access to guides for importers and \n        exporters on the Internet, including rules and documentation \n        for United States tariff preference programs.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n    Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, and annually thereafter, the President shall monitor, review, and \nreport to Congress on the implementation of this Act, the compliance of \nNepal with section 3(a), and the trade and investment policy of the \nUnited States with respect to Nepal.\n\nSEC. 7. TERMINATION OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT.\n\n    No preferential treatment extended under this Act shall remain in \neffect after December 31, 2025.\n\nSEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    The provisions of this Act shall take effect on January 1, 2016."
