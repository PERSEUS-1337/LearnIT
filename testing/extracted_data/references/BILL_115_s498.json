FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Department of Defense has made impressive strides \n        in the development and use of methods of medical training and \n        troop protection, such as the use of tourniquets and \n        improvements in body armor, that have led to decreased \n        battlefield fatalities.\n            (2) The Department of Defense uses more than 8,500 live \n        animals each year to train physicians, medics, corpsmen, and \n        other personnel methods of responding to severe battlefield \n        injuries.\n            (3) The civilian sector has almost exclusively phased in \n        the use of superior human-based training methods for numerous \n        medical procedures currently taught in military courses using \n        animals.\n            (4) Human-based medical training methods such as simulators \n        replicate human anatomy and can allow for repetitive practice \n        and data collection.\n            (5) According to scientific, peer-reviewed literature, \n        medical simulation increases patient safety and decreases \n        errors by healthcare providers.\n            (6) The Army Research, Development and Engineering Command \n        and other entities of the Department of Defense have taken \n        significant steps to develop methods to replace live animal-\n        based training.\n            (7) According to the report by the Department of Defense \n        titled ``Final Report on the use of Live Animals in Medical \n        Education and Training Joint Analysis Team'', published on July \n        12, 2009--\n                    (A) validated, high-fidelity simulators were to \n                have been available for nearly every high-volume or \n                high-value battlefield medical procedure by the end of \n                2011, and many were available as of 2009; and\n                    (B) validated, high-fidelity simulators were to \n                have been available to teach all other procedures to \n                respond to common battlefield injuries by 2014.\n            (8) The Center for Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness \n        Skills of the Air Force exclusively uses human-based training \n        methods in its courses and does not use animals.\n            (9) In 2013, the Army instituted a policy forbidding non-\n        medical personnel from participating in training courses \n        involving the use of animals.\n            (10) In 2013, the medical school of the Department of \n        Defense, part of the Uniformed Services University of the \n        Health Sciences, replaced animal use within its medical student \n        curriculum.\n            (11) The Coast Guard announced in 2014 that it would reduce \n        by half the number of animals it uses for combat trauma \n        training courses but stated that animals would continue to be \n        used in courses designed for Department of Defense personnel.\n            (12) Effective January 1, 2015, the Department of Defense \n        replaced animal use in six areas of medical training, including \n        Advanced Trauma Life Support courses and the development and \n        maintenance of surgical and critical care skills for field \n        operational surgery and field assessment and skills tests for \n        international students offered at the Defense Institute of \n        Medical Operations.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO USE HUMAN-BASED METHODS FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL \n              TRAINING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 101 of title 10, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 2017. Use of human-based methods for certain medical training\n    ``(a) Combat Trauma Injuries.--(1) Not later than October 1, 2020, \nthe Secretary of Defense shall develop, test, and validate human-based \ntraining methods for the purpose of training members of the armed \nforces in the treatment of combat trauma injuries with the goal of \nreplacing live animal-based training methods.\n    ``(2) Not later than October 1, 2022, the Secretary--\n            ``(A) shall only use human-based training methods for the \n        purpose of training members of the armed forces in the \n        treatment of combat trauma injuries; and\n            ``(B) may not use animals for such purpose.\n    ``(b) Exception for Particular Commands and Training Methods.--(1) \nThe Secretary may exempt a particular command, particular training \nmethod, or both, from the requirement for human-based training methods \nunder subsection (a)(2) if the Secretary determines that human-based \ntraining methods will not provide an educationally equivalent or \nsuperior substitute for live animal-based training methods for such \ncommand or training method, as the case may be.\n    ``(2) Any exemption under this subsection shall be for such period, \nnot more than one year, as the Secretary shall specify in granting the \nexemption. Any exemption may be renewed (subject to the preceding \nsentence).\n    ``(c) Annual Reports.--(1) Not later than October 1, 2018, and each \nyear thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional \ndefense committees a report on the development and implementation of \nhuman-based training methods for the purpose of training members of the \narmed forces in the treatment of combat trauma injuries under this \nsection.\n    ``(2) Each report under this subsection on or after October 1, \n2022, shall include a description of any exemption under subsection (b) \nthat is in force at the time of such report, and a current \njustification for such exemption.\n    ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) The term `combat trauma injuries' means severe \n        injuries likely to occur during combat, including--\n                    ``(A) hemorrhage;\n                    ``(B) tension pneumothorax;\n                    ``(C) amputation resulting from blast injury;\n                    ``(D) compromises to the airway; and\n                    ``(E) other injuries.\n            ``(2) The term `human-based training methods' means, with \n        respect to training individuals in medical treatment, the use \n        of systems and devices that do not use animals, including--\n                    ``(A) simulators;\n                    ``(B) partial task trainers;\n                    ``(C) moulage;\n                    ``(D) simulated combat environments;\n                    ``(E) human cadavers; and\n                    ``(F) rotations in civilian and military trauma \n                centers.\n            ``(3) The term `partial task trainers' means training aids \n        that allow individuals to learn or practice specific medical \n        procedures.''.\n    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of \nchapter 101 of such title is amended by adding at the end the following \nnew item:\n\n``2017.
