FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) increased demands on firefighting personnel have made \n        it difficult for local governments to adequately fund necessary \n        fire safety precautions;\n            (2) the Federal Government has an obligation to protect the \n        health and safety of the firefighting personnel of the United \n        States and to ensure that the personnel have the financial \n        resources to protect the public; and\n            (3) the high rates in the United States of death, injury, \n        and property damage caused by fires demonstrates a critical \n        need for Federal investment in support of firefighting \n        personnel.\n\nSEC. 3.
