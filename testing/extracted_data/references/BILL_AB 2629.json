    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) Official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore employed by the courts are currently paid under a dual compensation structure in which the base salary of the court reporter is supplemented by income from preparing required transcripts and providing other required transcription services.\n(b) The dual compensation structure protects the state from bearing the full cost of transcript preparation and other transcription services and avoids the resulting consequences of overtime liability related to these services.\n(c) The fees for original transcripts prepared by official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore have not been adjusted in 26 years, and fees for copies purchased at the same time as the original transcript have only increased once in 103 years.\n(d) In order to ensure full and fair compensation of official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore employed by the court, and in order to attract and retain official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore employed by the courts that have sufficient skills and competence to serve the needs of the justice system, it is imperative that the system of dual compensation provide sufficient payment for transcription services.\n(e) Therefore, it is necessary to revise the fees for transcripts prepared by official court reporters and court reporters pro tempore.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 69950 of the Government Code is amended to read:\n69950.\n(a) From January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, inclusive, the fee for transcription for the original printed copy is ninety-three cents ($0.93) for each 100 words, and for each copy

for a first copy to any court, party, or other person who does not simultaneously purchase the original shall be twenty-one cents ($0.21) for each 100 words, and for each additional copy, purchased at the same time, sixteen cents ($0.16) for each 100 words.\n(c) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), if a trial court had established transcription fees that were in effect on January 1, 2012, based on an estimate or assumption as to the number of words or folios on a typical transcript page, those transcription fees shall be the transcription fees for proceedings in those trial courts, and the policy or practice for determining transcription fees in those trial courts shall not be unilaterally changed.\n(d) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2019, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2019, deletes or extends that date.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 69950 is added to the Government Code, to read:\n69950.\n(a)
