    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Suicide Early Intervention and \nPrevention Expansion Act of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More children and young adults die from suicide each \n        year than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, \n        stroke, and chronic lung disease combined.\n            (2) Over 4,000 children and young adults tragically take \n        their lives every year, making suicide the third overall cause \n        of death between the ages of 10 and 24. According to the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suicide is the third \n        overall cause of death among college-age students.\n            (3) According to the National Center for Injury Prevention \n        and Control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n        children and young adults accounted for 15 percent of all \n        suicides completed in 2000.\n            (4) From 1952 to 1995, the rate of suicide in children and \n        young adults has tripled.\n            (5) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among young \n        adults ages 15 to 19 increased 11 percent.\n            (6) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among children \n        ages 10 to 14 increased 109 percent.\n            (7) According to the National Center of Health Statistics, \n        suicide rates among Native Americans range from 1.5 to 3 times \n        the national average for other groups, with young people ages \n        15 to 34 making up 64 percent of all suicides.\n            (8) Congress has recognized that youth suicide is a public \n        health tragedy linked to underlying mental health problems and \n        that youth suicide early intervention and prevention activities \n        are national priorities.\n            (9) Youth suicide early intervention and prevention have \n        been listed as urgent public health priorities by the \n        President's New Freedom Commission in Mental Health (2002), the \n        Institute of Medicine's Reducing Suicide: A National Imperative \n        (2002), the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention: Goals and \n        Objectives for Action (2001), and the Surgeon General's Call to \n        Action To Prevent Suicide (1999).\n            (10) Many States have already developed comprehensive youth \n        suicide early intervention and prevention strategies that seek \n        to provide effective early intervention and prevention \n        services.\n\nSEC. 3.
