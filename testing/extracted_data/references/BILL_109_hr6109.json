FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Identity theft remains a critical problem for \n        consumers. In May 2006, the Federal Trade Commission revealed \n        that 10,000,000 individuals are subjected to theft of their \n        personal identification licenses and records each year.\n            (2) Recent thefts of computer hardware containing sensitive \n        personal information from the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        and its contractors have made millions of veterans vulnerable \n        to identity theft and fraud.\n            (3) On May 22, 2006, the Department of Veterans Affairs \n        announced an employee laptop containing personal records of \n        nearly 26,500,000 million veterans and spouses had been stolen.\n            (4) On August 7, 2006, a desktop computer containing \n        personal information of more than 38,000 veterans was stolen \n        from a subcontractor hired to assist in insurance collections \n        for medical centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs in \n        Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n            (5) In August 2006, in response to the loss of these \n        records, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs created the office \n        of Special Advisor to the Secretary for Information Security.\n            (6) On August 14, 2006, the Secretary announced the award \n        of a $3,700,000 contract to a service-disabled, veteran-owned \n        small business to upgrade all Department computers with \n        enhanced data security encryption systems.\n            (7) In order to prevent the Nation's veterans from being \n        exposed to identity theft and fraud, additional Federal \n        safeguards, including those provided by this Act, must be \n        applied to increase accountability of those who handle \n        veterans' records in order to prevent future losses of \n        sensitive personal information.\n\nSEC. 3.
