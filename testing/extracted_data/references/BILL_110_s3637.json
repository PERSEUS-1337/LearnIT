FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Al Qaeda and its related affiliates attacked the United \n        States on September 11, 2001 in New York, New York, Arlington, \n        Virginia, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, murdering almost 3000 \n        innocent civilians.\n            (2) Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri remain \n        at large.\n            (3) In testimony to the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n        the Senate on February 5, 2008, Director of National \n        Intelligence J. Michael McConnell stated, ``Al-Qa'ida has been \n        able to retain a safehaven in Pakistan's Federally Administered \n        Tribal Areas (FATA) that provides the organization many of the \n        advantages it once derived from its base across the border in \n        Afghanistan''.\n            (4) The July 2007 National Intelligence Estimate states, \n        ``Al Qaeda is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat \n        to the Homeland''.\n            (5) In testimony to the Permanent Select Committee on \n        Intelligence of the House of Representatives on February 7, \n        2008, Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell \n        stated, ``Al-Qa'ida and its terrorist affiliates continue to \n        pose significant threats to the United States at home and \n        abroad, and al-Qa'ida's central leadership based in the border \n        area of Pakistan is its most dangerous component.''.\n            (6) The ``National Strategy for Combating Terrorism'', \n        issued in September 2006, affirmed that long-term efforts are \n        needed to win the battle of ideas against the root causes of \n        the violent extremist ideology that sustains Al Qaeda and its \n        affiliates. The United States has obligated resources to \n        support democratic reforms and human development to undercut \n        support for violent extremism, including in the Federally \n        Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan and the Sahel region of \n        Africa. However, 2 reports released by the Government \n        Accountability Office in 2008 (``Combating Terrorism: The \n        United States Lacks Comprehensive Plan to Destroy the Terrorist \n        Threat and Close the Safe Haven in Pakistan's Federally \n        Administered Tribal Areas'' (GAO-08-622, April 17, 2008) and \n        ``Combating Terrorism: Actions Needed to Enhance Implementation \n        of Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership'' (GAO-08-860, \n        July 31, 2008)) found that ``no comprehensive plan for meeting \n        U.S. national security goals in the FATA have been developed,'' \n        and ``no comprehensive integrated strategy has been developed \n        to guide the [Sahel] program's implementation''.\n            (7) Such efforts to combat violent extremism and radicalism \n        must be undertaken using all elements of national power, \n        including military tools, intelligence assets, law enforcement \n        resources, diplomacy, paramilitary activities, financial \n        measures, development assistance, strategic communications, and \n        public diplomacy.\n            (8) In the report entitled ``Suggested Areas for Oversight \n        for the 110th Congress'' (GAO-08-235R, November 17, 2006), the \n        Government Accountability Office urged greater congressional \n        oversight in assessing the effectiveness and coordination of \n        United States international programs focused on combating and \n        preventing the growth of terrorism and its underlying causes.\n            (9) Section 140(a) of the Foreign Relations Authorization \n        Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 2656f(a)) requires \n        that the Secretary of State submit annual reports to Congress \n        that detail key developments on terrorism on a country-by-\n        country basis. These Country Reports on Terrorism provide \n        information on acts of terrorism in countries, major \n        developments in bilateral and multilateral counterterrorism \n        cooperation, and the extent of State support for terrorist \n        groups responsible for the death, kidnaping, or injury of \n        Americans, but do not assess the scope and efficacy of United \n        States counterterrorism efforts against Al Qaeda and its \n        related affiliates.\n            (10) The Executive Branch submits regular reports to \n        Congress that detail the status of United States combat \n        operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including a breakdown of \n        budgetary allocations, key milestones achieved, and measures of \n        political, economic, and military progress.\n            (11) The Department of Defense compiles a report of the \n        monthly and cumulative incremental obligations incurred to \n        support the Global War on Terrorism in a monthly Supplemental \n        and Cost of War Execution Report.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) 7 years after the attacks on September 11, 2001, Al \n        Qaeda and its related affiliates remain the most serious \n        national security threat to the United States, with alarming \n        signs that Al Qaeda and its related affiliates recently \n        reconstituted their strength and ability to generate new \n        attacks throughout the world, including against the United \n        States;\n            (2) there remains insufficient information on current \n        counterterrorism efforts undertaken by the Federal Government \n        and the level of success achieved by specific initiatives;\n            (3) Congress and the American people can benefit from more \n        specific data and metrics that can provide the basis for \n        objective external assessments of the progress being made in \n        the overall war being waged against violent extremism;\n            (4) the absence of a comparable timely assessment of the \n        ongoing status and progress of United States counterterrorism \n        efforts against Al Qaeda and its related affiliates in the \n        overall Global War on Terrorism hampers the ability of Congress \n        and the American people to independently determine whether the \n        United States is making significant progress in this defining \n        struggle of our time; and\n            (5) the Executive Branch should submit a comprehensive \n        report to Congress, updated on an annual basis, which provides \n        a more strategic perspective regarding--\n                    (A) the United States' highest global \n                counterterrorism priorities;\n                    (B) the United States' efforts to combat and defeat \n                Al Qaeda and its related affiliates;\n                    (C) the United States' efforts to undercut long-\n                term support for the violent extremism that sustains Al \n                Qaeda and its related affiliates;\n                    (D) the progress made by the United States as a \n                result of such efforts;\n                    (E) the efficacy and efficiency of the United \n                States resource allocations; and\n                    (F) whether the existing activities and operations \n                of the United States are actually diminishing the \n                national security threat posed by Al Qaeda and its \n                related affiliates.\n\nSEC. 4.
