DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the \n        enactment of a disadvantaged business enterprise program for \n        highways and mass transit, including commuter rail passenger \n        transportation, discrimination and related barriers continue to \n        pose significant obstacles for minority-owned and women-owned \n        businesses seeking to do business in federally assisted surface \n        transportation-related markets, including intercity rail \n        passenger transportation markets. This continuing \n        discrimination warrants the establishment of the disadvantaged \n        business enterprise program under this section.\n            (2) Discrimination poses serious barriers to the full and \n        fair participation of minority and women business owners, \n        including African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-\n        Americans, and Native Americans in federally assisted surface \n        transportation-related projects and contracts, including \n        intercity rail passenger transportation projects and contracts.\n            (3) Discrimination impacts minority and women business \n        owners in every geographic region of the United States and \n        throughout all of the surface transportation-related \n        industries, including intercity rail passenger transportation \n        industries.\n            (4) Congress has reviewed evidence of discrimination \n        against minority and women business owners throughout the \n        transportation sector, including--\n                    (A) statistical analyses demonstrating significant \n                disparities in the utilization of minority-owned and \n                women-owned businesses in federally and locally funded \n                transportation contracting;\n                    (B) statistical analyses of private sector \n                disparities in business success by minority-owned and \n                women-owned businesses in transportation industries;\n                    (C) research compiling anecdotal reports of \n                discrimination against individual minority and women \n                business owners;\n                    (D) individual reports of discrimination against \n                minority and women business owners and the \n                organizations and individuals who represent minority \n                and women business owners;\n                    (E) analyses demonstrating significant reductions \n                in the participation of minority and women businesses \n                in jurisdictions that have reduced or eliminated their \n                minority-owned and women-owned business programs;\n                    (F) statistical analyses showing significant \n                disparities in the credit available to minority-owned \n                and women-owned businesses;\n                    (G) research and statistical analyses demonstrating \n                how discrimination negatively impacts firm formation, \n                growth, and success;\n                    (H) experience of State departments of \n                transportation and localities demonstrating that race-\n                neutral and gender-neutral efforts alone are \n                insufficient to remedy discrimination; and\n                    (I) other qualitative and quantitative evidence of \n                discrimination against minority-owned and women-owned \n                businesses in the transportation sector.\n            (5) Congress has received and reviewed compelling evidence \n        of discrimination from many different sources, including \n        congressional hearings and roundtables, studies, scientific \n        reports, reports issued by public and private agencies, news \n        stories, reports of discrimination by organizations and \n        individuals, and discrimination lawsuits.\n            (6) All of this evidence applies not only to highway and \n        mass transportation programs, but also to rail programs, \n        providing a compelling need for the establishment of the \n        disadvantaged business enterprise program under this section to \n        address race and gender discrimination in intercity rail \n        passenger transportation.\n    (b) Program.--There is established a disadvantaged business \nenterprise program for the Federal Railroad Administration to ensure \nthat disadvantaged business enterprises have a full and fair \nopportunity to compete in covered rail projects and to ensure that the \nFederal Government does not subsidize discrimination in covered rail \nprojects.\n    (c) Amounts for Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--Except to the \nextent that the Secretary of Transportation determines otherwise, not \nless than 10 percent of the amounts made available through a grant, \ncontract, loan, or other financing instrument for any covered rail \nproject shall be expended through disadvantaged business enterprises.\n    (d) Annual Listing of Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--The \nunified certification program established under subsection (e) shall \nannually survey and compile a list of disadvantaged business \nenterprises and their location, and shall include an indication of the \npercentage of such enterprises which are controlled by women, by \nsocially and economically disadvantaged individuals (other than women), \nand by individuals who are women and are otherwise socially and \neconomically disadvantaged individuals.\n    (e) Uniform Certification.--For purposes of carrying out this \nsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish minimum \nuniform criteria to use in certifying whether a concern qualifies as a \nsmall business concern. The minimum uniform criteria shall include on-\nsite visits, personal interviews with personnel, issuance or inspection \nof licenses, analyses of stock ownership, listing of equipment, \nanalyses of bonding capacity, listing of work completed, examination of \nthe resume of principal owners, analyses of financial capacity, and \nanalyses of the type of work preferred. Federal Railroad Administration \nrecipients of funds subject to this section must participate in unified \ncertification program approved by the Secretary.\n    (f) Reporting.--The Secretary of Transportation shall establish \nminimum requirements for covered rail project Federal funding \nrecipients to report to the Secretary--\n            (1) information concerning minority-owned and women-owned \n        business awards, commitments, and achievements; and\n            (2) such other information as the Secretary determines to \n        be appropriate for the proper monitoring of the disadvantaged \n        business enterprise program under this section.\n    (g) Compliance With Court Orders.--Nothing in this section limits \nthe eligibility of an entity or person to receive funds if the entity \nor person is prevented, in whole or in part, from complying with \nsubsection (c) because a Federal court issues a final order in which \nthe court finds that a requirement or the implementation of subsection \n(c) is unconstitutional.\n    (h) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) Commuter rail passenger transportation and intercity \n        rail passenger transportation.--The terms ``commuter rail \n        passenger transportation'' and ``intercity rail passenger \n        transportation'' have the meaning given those terms in section \n        24102 of title 49, United States Code.\n            (2) Covered rail project.--The term ``covered rail \n        project'' means any railroad project that is carried out or is \n        planned to be carried out with the use of Federal funds \n        administered by the Federal Railroad Administration through a \n        grant, contract, loan, or other financing instrument.\n            (3) Disadvantaged business enterprise.--The term \n        ``disadvantaged business enterprise'' means a small business \n        concern owned by socially and economically disadvantaged \n        individuals.\n            (4) Small business concern.--The term ``small business \n        concern'' has the meaning given that term under section 3 of \n        the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632), except that the term \n        shall not include any concern or group of concerns controlled \n        by the same socially and economically disadvantaged individual \n        or individuals that have average annual gross receipts over the \n        preceding 3 fiscal years in excess of $22,410,000, as adjusted \n        annually by the Secretary of Transportation for inflation.\n            (5) Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.--\n        The term ``socially and economically disadvantaged \n        individuals'' has the meaning given that term under section \n        8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant \n        subcontracting regulations issued pursuant to that Act, except \n        that women shall be presumed to be socially and economically \n        disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this section."
