It also serves as a unique urban greenbelt composed of more than 5,000 acres and lying immediately next to and within two incorporated cities and the unincorporated County of Sacramento.\n(2) The American River Parkway includes natural and recreational resources of statewide interest and is often referred to as \u201cthe jewel\u201d of the Sacramento region, and it is managed as such with an intent to fulfill the vision set forth through past collaborative efforts involving advocates and stakeholders, the County of Sacramento, state agencies, and the Legislature.\n(3) The American River Parkway was established by the County of Sacramento, with financial support from the state and other public and private entities.\n(4) Since establishing the American River Parkway in 1959, the County of Sacramento has and will continue to update, maintain, and determine consistency with the American River Parkway Plan and to serve as the Parkway Manager to own, manage, operate, and patrol the lands and resources within the American River Parkway.\n(5) The American River Parkway provides additional benefits to the state and the Sacramento region including flood control, water supply, water quality, habitat for anadromous fisheries, including salmon and steelhead, habitat for migratory waterfowl, habitat for sensitive species, including Swainson\u2019s hawks, peregrine falcons, northern harriers, white-tailed kites, and western pond turtles, and habitat for other wildlife, including river otters.\n(6) The Legislature recognized the statewide importance of the American River Parkway in enacting the Urban American River Parkway Preservation Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 5840)), which culminated with the adoption of the American River Parkway Plan and the Bushy Lake Preservation Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 5830)).\n(7) The statewide and national importance of the Lower American River Parkway was further recognized when it was designated as part of the California Wild and Scenic Rivers System and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
