    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Park Service 100th \nAnniversary Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1916, Congress established the National Park Service \n        as a bureau within the Department of the Interior to administer \n        America's great national parks and monuments as a unified \n        National Park System.\n            (2) From 1916 to the present, the National Park System has \n        grown from 37 park units with 6,000,000 acres of land in the \n        western United States to more than 395 units with 84,000,000 \n        acres of land in nearly all States and territories.\n            (3) The responsibilities of the National Park Service have \n        grown to include--\n                    (A) managing national historic trails and national \n                scenic trails;\n                    (B) administering wild and scenic rivers;\n                    (C) recognizing America's most significant historic \n                resources through the National Register of Historic \n                Places and the National Historic Landmark program;\n                    (D) providing historic preservation grants; and\n                    (E) assisting communities in meeting their \n                preservation, conservation, and recreation needs.\n            (4) The National Park Service Organic Act of 1916, which \n        established the National Park Service, remains the preeminent \n        law guiding the management of parks and articulating the \n        Service's core mission, ``to conserve the scenery and the \n        natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to \n        provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by \n        such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of \n        future generations''.\n            (5) The 100th anniversary of the National Park Service in \n        2016 will be an occasion to celebrate a century of American \n        vision and achievement in identifying and preserving our \n        Nation's special places for the benefit of everyone and the \n        culmination of 100 years of accomplishment by the National Park \n        Service's employees, partners, and volunteers. It will also \n        mark the beginning of the organization's second century of \n        service to the American people as environmental leaders and \n        vigilant stewards of the Nation's treasured places and stories.\n            (6) Coins commemorating the 100th anniversary of the \n        National Park Service will bring national and international \n        attention to the National Park System and to the legacy \n        Congress left in 1916 when it established a Federal agency to \n        ensure the protection of our Nation's most treasured natural \n        and cultural resources for all time.\n            (7) The proceeds from a surcharge on the sale of \n        commemorative coins will assist the financing of the needs of \n        the National Park Service's parks and programs, helping to \n        ensure that our Nation's great natural and cultural resources \n        will endure for generations to come.\n\nSEC. 3.
