FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Federal agencies rely on networked computer systems to \n        deliver critical services and information to the American \n        people, including operations related to national defense, \n        emergency services, tax collection, and the payment of \n        benefits.\n            (2) There has been an astonishing increase in cyber threats \n        to government and industry in recent years. The number of cyber \n        attacks on Federal Government systems in 2001 was 71 percent \n        greater than the number of such attacks on such systems in \n        2000.\n            (3) Cyber attacks can cause irreparable harm in network \n        systems, including the loss or dissemination of sensitive and \n        important data. Cyber attacks can also reduce the confidence of \n        the American people in the integrity and security of the \n        Internet.\n            (4) There is mounting evidence to suggest that terrorists \n        view the Internet as a tool to achieve their goals. Government \n        investigators found that al Qaeda operatives browsed Internet \n        sites that offered software describing the digital switches \n        that control power, water, transport, and communications grids.\n            (5) The Bush Administration has recognized in its draft \n        National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace ``the pressing need to \n        make federal cyberspace security a model for the nation''.\n            (6) All but a few Federal agencies continue to receive \n        failing grades for their cyber security programs.\n            (7) Federal agencies must take significant steps to better \n        protect themselves against cyber attacks, including--\n                    (A) identifying significant vulnerabilities in \n                their computer networks and the tools needed to detect \n                such vulnerabilities;\n                    (B) monitoring for new vulnerabilities in their \n                computer networks, and assessing risks of cyber \n                attacks;\n                    (C) testing computers against identified \n                vulnerabilities; and\n                    (D) ensuring that computers and networks are \n                adequately protected against such vulnerabilities.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Chief information officer.--The term ``Chief \n        Information Officer'', with respect to an agency, means the \n        official designated as the Chief Information Officer of the \n        agency pursuant to section 3506(a)(2) of title 44, United \n        States Code.\n            (2) Vulnerability.--The term ``vulnerability'', in the case \n        of information technology, means an error or defect in coding, \n        configuration, or installation of such information technology \n        that increases its susceptibility to a cyber threat.\n            (3) Other definitions.--Except as otherwise provided in \n        this section, any term used in this Act which is defined in \n        section 3502 of title 44, United States Code, shall have the \n        meaning given that term in such section 3502.\n\nSEC. 4.
