FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The renewed commitment of the world community to the \n        formulation of government policies that contribute to global \n        population stabilization and to improvements in the status of \n        women owes much to the efforts of the United Nations and its \n        specialized agencies and organizations, particularly the United \n        Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\n            (2) Over one-half of the UNFPA's assistance is devoted to \n        maternal and child health programs, including the provision of \n        family planning services, and it is a major supplier of modern \n        methods of contraception. UNFPA also supports efforts aimed at \n        preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually-\n        transmitted diseases and activities aimed specifically at \n        enhancing the status of women.\n            (3) UNFPA does not fund abortion services, rather, UNFPA \n        seeks to reduce the incidence of abortion by improving access \n        to contraceptive services and to reduce deaths and injuries \n        related to unsafe abortion by supporting treatment of women \n        suffering from its complications.\n            (4) Operating in over 130 nations in all regions of the \n        world and as a politically neutral source of funds, UNFPA \n        complements the important work of the United States Agency for \n        International Development population assistance program.\n            (5) The United States contribution to UNFPA last year \n        provided an estimated 870,000 women in the developing world \n        with effective modern contraception, thereby preventing 500,000 \n        unintended pregnancies, 200,000 abortions, and thousands of \n        maternal and child deaths.\n            (6) Many global environmental problems, including water \n        shortages, pollution, tropical deforestation, and the loss of \n        wildlife habitat are linked to rapid population growth. UNFPA \n        has assisted countries around the world plan for and slow \n        population growth, therefore reducing its effects on the \n        environment.\n            (7) Assistance provided by UNFPA conforms to the principle, \n        affirmed at the 1994 International Conference on Population and \n        Development by 180 nations, including the United States, that \n        ``all couples and individuals have the basic right to decide \n        freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children \n        and to have the information, education, and means to do so.''.\n            (8) UNFPA opposes coercion in any form. All of UNFPA's \n        programs are designed in conformity with universally recognized \n        human rights principles.\n            (9) An appropriate way to express the legitimate concerns \n        of the United States Government about the population policies \n        of the People's Republic of China is by placing those concerns \n        on the bilateral agenda along with other important human rights \n        issues, not by singling out a United Nations agency by \n        withholding all funding thereby punishing the women and \n        families around the world who depend on its humanitarian aid.\n            (10) UNFPA plays a constructive role in helping to reduce \n        the incidence of coercive practices in China through its \n        country program which has been successful in eliminating \n        targets and quotas and promoting voluntary family planning and \n        informed consent in the 32 program counties. By improving \n        contraceptive method choice, expanding the range of \n        reproductive health services, and enhancing the status of \n        women, the UNFPA country program will help to enable the \n        Chinese to operationalize the human rights approach of the \n        International Conference on Population and Development.\n            (11) The United States Government provided a voluntary \n        contribution of $21,500,000 to UNFPA for fiscal year 2001 and \n        President Bush's budget request for fiscal year 2002 allocated \n        $25,000,000 for UNFPA.\n            (12) In the spring of 2001, the Secretary of State \n        submitted written testimony to the Committee on Foreign \n        Relations of the Senate expressing support for the invaluable \n        work of UNFPA and for securing funding for the organization.\n            (13) The United States Government, as part of its efforts \n        to improve the dire health conditions of Afghan women, pledged \n        in October 2001 an additional $600,000 to UNFPA to address the \n        reproductive health care needs of Afghan refugees in \n        surrounding nations and of the internally displaced within \n        Afghanistan.\n            (14) Congress demonstrated its strong bipartisan support \n        for a voluntary United States contribution to UNFPA of up to \n        $34,000,000 in adopting the fiscal year 2002 foreign operations \n        appropriations bill, which was passed by the House of \n        Representatives on a vote of 357 to 66 and by the Senate by \n        unanimous consent and signed into law (Public Law 107-115) by \n        the President on January 10, 2002.\n            (15) The Bush Administration ``recognizes our country's \n        long history of providing international health care services, \n        including voluntary family planning to couples around the world \n        who want to make free and responsible decisions about the \n        number and spacing of their children,'' and the President is \n        committed to maintaining funding for these programs ``because \n        he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by \n        providing voluntary family planning services.''.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNITED NATIONS \n              POPULATION FUND.\n\n    (a) Reappropriation of Funds.--Of the amounts appropriated for \n``International Organizations and Programs'' under the Kenneth M. \nLudden Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2002, and which remain available, \n$34,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 shall be made available only for \nUnited States voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population \nFund.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to amounts \notherwise available to carry out the purposes of chapter 3 of part 1 of \nthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, there are authorized to be \nappropriated $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 to be available only for \nUnited States voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population \nFund.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATIONS ON UNITED STATES VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE \n              UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on Use of Funds in China.--None of the funds made \navailable or authorized to be appropriated by this Act may be made \navailable for the United Nations Population Fund (hereinafter in this \nAct referrred to as the ``UNFPA'') for a country program in the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n    (b) Conditions on Availability of Funds.--Amounts made available or \nauthorized to be appropriated by this Act may not be made available to \nUNFPA unless--\n            (1) the UNFPA maintains amounts made available to the UNFPA \n        under this Act in an account separate from other accounts of \n        the UNFPA;\n            (2) the UNFPA does not commingle amounts made available to \n        the UNFPA under this Act with other sums; and\n            (3) the UNFPA does not fund abortions as a method of family \n        planning."
