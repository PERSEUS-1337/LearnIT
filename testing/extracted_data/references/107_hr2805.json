    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Abortion Depression Research \nand Care Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) About 3,000,000 women per year in the United States \n        have an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and approximately \n        1,186,000 of these pregnancies end in elective abortion.\n            (2) Abortion can have severe and long-term effects on the \n        mental and emotional well-being of women. Women often \n        experience sadness and guilt following abortions with no one to \n        console them. They may have difficulty in bonding with new \n        babies, become overprotective parents or develop problems in \n        their relationship with their spouses. Problems such as eating \n        disorders, depression and suicide attempts have also been \n        traced to past abortions.\n            (3) The symptoms of post-abortion depression include bouts \n        of crying, guilt, intense grief or sadness, emotional numbness, \n        eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, suicidal urges, \n        anxiety and panic attacks, anger/rage, sexual problems or \n        promiscuity, lowered self esteem, nightmares and sleep \n        disturbance, flashbacks, and difficulty with relationships.\n            (4) Women who aborted a first pregnancy are four times more \n        likely to report substance abuse compared to those who suffered \n        a natural loss of their first pregnancy, and they are five \n        times more likely to report subsequent substance abuse than \n        women who carried to term.\n            (5) Greater thought suppression is associated with \n        experiencing more intrusive thoughts of the abortion. Both \n        suppression and intrusive thoughts, in turn, are positively \n        related to increases in psychological distress over time.\n            (6) Women who experience decision-making difficulties and \n        may lack social support may experience more negative emotional \n        consequences to induced abortion.\n            (7) Post-abortion depression often relates to the lack of \n        understanding in society and the medical community of the \n        complexity of post-abortion depression, and economic pressures \n        placed on hospitals and providers are contributing factors.\n            (8) Social pressure to have an abortion can be directly \n        related to higher levels of immediate regret and more mental \n        undoing over subsequent years.\n            (9) Post-abortion depression is a treatable disorder if \n        promptly diagnosed by a trained provider and attended to with a \n        personalized regimen of care including social support, therapy, \n        medication, and when necessary hospitalization.\n            (10) While there have been many studies regarding the \n        emotional aftermath of abortion, very little research has been \n        sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n      TITLE I--RESEARCH ON POST-ABORTION DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOSIS\n\nSEC. 101.
