TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAID \n              RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION TO BE REPORTED BY A CONFERENCE \n              COMMITTEE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n        long-term care services to more than 50,000,000 low-income \n        children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with \n        disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee \n        that ensures that the most vulnerable will have access to \n        needed medical services.\n            (2) The Medicaid program provides critical access to long-\n        term care and other services for the elderly and individuals \n        living with disabilities, and is the single largest provider of \n        long-term care services. The Medicaid program also pays for \n        personal care and other supportive services that are typically \n        not provided by private health insurance or under the Medicare \n        program, but are necessary to enable individuals with spinal \n        cord injuries, developmental disabilities, neurological \n        degenerative diseases, serious and persistent mental illnesses, \n        HIV/AIDS, and other chronic conditions to remain in the \n        community, to work, and to maintain independence.\n            (3) The Medicaid program supplements the Medicare program \n        for more than 6,000,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare \n        beneficiaries, assisting those beneficiaries with their \n        Medicare premiums and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and \n        the costs of nursing home care that the Medicare program does \n        not cover. The Medicaid program spent nearly $40,000,000,000 in \n        2002 on services not covered under the Medicare program.\n            (4) The Medicaid program provides health insurance for more \n        than \\1/4\\ of America's children and is the largest purchaser \n        of maternity care, paying for more than \\1/3\\ of all the births \n        in the United States each year. The Medicaid program also \n        provides vital access to care for children with disabilities, \n        covering more than 70 percent of the poor children with \n        disabilities in the United States.\n            (5) Medicaid's benefits for children are comprehensive, \n        including mandatory coverage for Early and Periodic Screening \n        Diagnosis and Treatment benefits covering all medically \n        necessary care. Medicaid ensures that children have the \n        benefits, health services and health care support they need to \n        be fully immunized and that children can secure eyeglasses, \n        dental care, and hearing aids when necessary, and that children \n        have access to comprehensive, regularly scheduled, and as-\n        needed health examinations, as well as preventive \n        interventions, to correct physical and mental conditions that \n        threaten to delay proper growth and development.\n            (6) More than 16,000,000 American women depend on the \n        Medicaid program for their health care. Women comprise the \n        majority of seniors (71 percent) on Medicaid. Half of \n        nonelderly women with permanent mental or physical disabilities \n        have health care coverage under the Medicaid program. The \n        Medicaid program also provides critical access to treatment for \n        low-income women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer.\n            (7) The Medicaid program is the Nation's largest source of \n        payment for mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for \n        children with special needs. Much of this care is either not \n        covered by private insurance or is limited in scope or \n        duration. The Medicaid program is also a critical source of \n        funding for health care for children in foster care and for \n        health care services provided in schools.\n            (8) Funds under the Medicaid program help to ensure access \n        to care for all Americans. The Medicaid program is the single \n        largest source of revenue for the Nation's safety net \n        hospitals, health centers, and nursing homes, and is critical \n        to the ability of these providers to adequately serve all \n        Americans.\n            (9) The Medicaid program serves a major role in ensuring \n        that the number of Americans without health insurance, \n        approximately 45,000,000 in 2003, is not substantially higher. \n        The system of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures \n        ensures that Federal funds will grow as State spending \n        increases in response to unmet needs, enabling the Medicaid \n        program to help buffer the drop in private coverage during \n        recessions. More than 4,800,000 Americans lost employer-\n        sponsored health care coverage between 2000 and 2003, during \n        which time the Medicaid program enrolled an additional \n        8,400,000 Americans.\n            (10) Many individuals living below the Federal poverty \n        level are ineligible for Medicaid because of stringent income \n        eligibility rules. For parents, eligibility levels are often \n        very far below the Federal poverty level. On average, a working \n        parent in a family of three would have to make less than $224 \n        per week and a non-working parent in a family of three would \n        have to make less than $150 per week to qualify. Single \n        individuals with disabilities would be ineligible if they have \n        more than $147 per week in income.\n            (11) Eligibility levels for pregnant women and children are \n        generally at or just above the Federal poverty level, but a \n        family with income just over minimum wage can be disqualified \n        for Medicaid. At the minimum eligibility levels for pregnant \n        women, earning as little as $8.80 per hour at a full-time job \n        could disqualify a pregnant woman from Medicaid eligibility. A \n        working parent in a family of three earning less than $8.40 per \n        hour at a full-time job could make their child 6 years-old or \n        older ineligible for Medicaid.\n            (12) Title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n        House of Representatives, as reported out by the Committee on \n        Energy and Commerce, would adversely affect these low-income \n        beneficiaries, many of whom are children or have special health \n        care needs, by increasing beneficiary cost-sharing, limiting \n        access to benefits, and restricting eligibility for long-term \n        care services that the Medicaid program covers. These new \n        limits make up \\2/3\\ of the House of Representative's projected \n        Medicaid spending reductions, accounting for $30,100,000,000 of \n        the total $45,300,000,000 in Medicaid reductions over 10 years.\n            (13) Making beneficiaries pay more for more limited \n        benefits under Medicaid may put a significant financial burden \n        on these very low-income individuals. Research also \n        demonstrates that increasing beneficiary cost-sharing can make \n        prescription drugs and other essential health services \n        unaffordable for beneficiaries, can cause the health of \n        children and adults to deteriorate, and can lead to higher \n        emergency room and hospital costs.\n            (14) By contrast, while S. 1932, as passed by the Senate on \n        November 3, 2005, includes substantial cuts to the Medicaid \n        program, it does not include direct limits on beneficiary \n        access to Medicaid services. Even so, enactment of S. 1932 \n        would result in a net Medicaid cut of $14,200,000,000 over 10 \n        years, less than \\1/3\\ of the projected Medicaid reductions \n        contained in the House of Representative's budget \n        reconciliation bill.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \nconferees for any budget reconciliation bill of the 109th Congress \nshall not report a reconciliation bill that would--\n            (1) with respect to low-income children, pregnant women, \n        disabled individuals, elderly individuals, individuals with \n        chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes, \n        individuals with mental illnesses, and other Medicaid \n        beneficiaries--\n                    (A) impair access to Medicaid services;\n                    (B) undermine eligibility for such Medicaid \n                beneficiaries;\n                    (C) make Medicaid services unavailable by making \n                them unaffordable to such Medicaid beneficiaries; or\n                    (D) cut health care services for such Medicaid \n                beneficiaries; or\n            (2) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance \n        coverage that the Medicaid program provides, which would \n        threaten not only the health care safety net of the United \n        States, but the entire health care system of the United States.\n                                                       "
