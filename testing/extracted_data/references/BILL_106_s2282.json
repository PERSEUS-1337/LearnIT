FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States \n        Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the \n        United States and Indian tribes.\n            (2) Beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon \n        Administration of the Indian self-determination era, each \n        successive President has reaffirmed the special government-to-\n        government relationship between Indian tribes and the United \n        States.\n            (3) In 1994, President Clinton issued an executive \n        memorandum to the heads of all Federal departments and agencies \n        that obligated all such departments and agencies, particularly \n        those that have an impact on economic development, to evaluate \n        the potential impacts of their actions on Indian tribes.\n            (4) The United States has an obligation to guard and \n        preserve the agricultural and related renewable resources of \n        Indian tribes in order to foster strong tribal governments, \n        Indian self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency among \n        Indian tribes.\n            (5) Despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n        on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n        value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n        Native Americans suffer higher rates of unemployment, poverty, \n        poor health, substandard housing, and associated social ills \n        than those of any other group in the United States.\n            (6) Reservation-based Indians tend to be the most rural of \n        any minority group. They tend to be geographically isolated, \n        resource limited, and the least likely of any farm group to \n        receive payment or loans from the United States.\n            (7) Indian land represents close to 55,000,000 acres, or \n        about 2 percent of the United States land base, with nearly \n        47,000,000 of these acres consisting of range and cropland.\n            (8) Indian agriculture constitutes the second largest \n        revenue generator and employer in Indian country and is not \n        limited to farming and ranching, but often includes such \n        products as forestry, bison, wild rice and fruits, cotton, \n        tobacco and other Native-made or grown products.\n            (9) Because of the lack of Federal intra-agency and inter-\n        agency coordination in agriculture programs and policies, the \n        development of Indian agriculture and related tribal business \n        and economic development potential has been hindered.\n            (10) It is estimated that about 20 percent of reservation \n        grazing land and about 70 percent of cropland is leased to non-\n        Indian producers.\n            (11) American Indians today use their lands and natural \n        resources for agriculture and agribusiness to provide food and \n        other staples for consumption, improving their economic self-\n        sufficiency, agriculture income and reservation employment.\n            (12) Although there are many programs within Department of \n        Agriculture for which tribal and individual Indian producers \n        are eligible, Indian producers have not fully benefited from \n        these programs because of insufficient coordination within the \n        Department of Agriculture.\n            (13) The United States has an obligation to assist Indian \n        tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and political \n        conditions with respect to Indian lands to--\n                    (A) encourage investment from outside sources that \n                do not originate with the tribes; and\n                    (B) facilitate economic ventures with outside \n                entities that are not tribal entities.\n            (14) The economic success and material well-being of Native \n        American communities depends on the combined efforts of the \nFederal Government, tribal governments, the private sector, and \nindividuals.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) promote the coordination of existing agricultural and \n        related programs within the Department of Agriculture to \n        provide the maximum benefit to Indian tribes and their members;\n            (2) encourage intertribal, regional, and international \n        trade and business development in order to assist in increasing \n        productivity and the standard of living of members of Indian \n        tribes and improving the economic self-sufficiency of the \n        Indian tribes;\n            (3) through improving the administration of Federal \n        program, improve the access of Indian tribes to capital, \n        specialty markets, export promotions, and marketing assistance \n        that non-Indian agriculture producers currently have access to;\n            (4) improve the development and coordination of Indian \n        agriculture and related value-added industries to promote self-\n        sustaining Native economies and communities; and\n            (5) promote economic self-sufficiency and political self-\n        determination for Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes.\n\nSEC. 3.
