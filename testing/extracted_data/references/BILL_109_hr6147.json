FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The prevalence of gestational diabetes among pregnant \n        women in the United States is increasing.\n            (2) Gestational diabetes, which is similar to chronic forms \n        of diabetes, normally appears at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation and \n        occurs in approximately 4 to 8 percent of pregnant women.\n            (3) The causes of gestational diabetes are unknown, but \n        genetics, excess weight, ethnicity, and age are considered risk \n        factors for the condition.\n            (4) There is disagreement among physicians about how to \n        treat gestational diabetes, as well as the effectiveness of \n        current treatment regimens.\n            (5) Gestational diabetes, which can cause preeclampsia, \n        also increases a pregnant woman's risk for developing the \n        condition in subsequent pregnancies.\n            (6) Infants of women who develop gestational diabetes may \n        have extreme increases in birth weight and the risks related to \n        difficulties during the birthing process, and some of the \n        infants born to these women--\n                    (A) may subsequently have low blood sugar or \n                jaundice during the newborn period;\n                    (B) are at an increased risk for obesity and birth \n                trauma; and\n                    (C) are at an increased risk of developing type 2 \n                diabetes as an adolescent or adult.\n            (7) About 15 percent of infertility cases are linked to \n        weight disorders, most often being overweight or obese. Obesity \n        affects fertility and is also associated with increased \n        morbidity for both the mother and the child.\n            (8) Improved nutritional and physical health care, both \n        before and during pregnancy, may significantly decrease the \n        rates of gestational diabetes.\n            (9) Ten percent of obese pregnant women are estimated to \n        have gestational diabetes.\n            (10) Obesity potentially leads to a higher rate of \n        induction and primary caesarean section.\n\nSEC. 3. GESTATIONAL DIABETES.\n\n    The Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n\n                   ``TITLE XXIX--GESTATIONAL DIABETES\n\n``SEC. 2901.
