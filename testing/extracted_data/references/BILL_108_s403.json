FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the continuation of the embargo on trade between the \n        United States and Cuba that was declared in February of 1962 is \n        counterproductive, adding to the hardships of the Cuban people \n        while making the United States the scapegoat for the failures \n        of the communist system;\n            (2) in the former Soviet Union, the Eastern bloc countries, \n        China, and Vietnam, the United States is using economic, \n        cultural, academic, and scientific engagement to support its \n        policy of promoting democratic and human rights reforms;\n            (3) the United States can best support democratic change in \n        Cuba by promoting trade and commerce, travel, communications, \n        and cultural, academic, and scientific exchanges;\n            (4) the Castro regime has a record of harboring fugitives \n        from United States justice and denying its people basic human \n        and civil rights;\n            (5) expanding bilateral trade with the Cuban people is one \n        of the most effective ways of influencing change from within \n        Cuba's repressive society and promoting progress on human \n        rights and democratic rule;\n            (6) since many United States trading partners, including \n        all other countries in the Western Hemisphere, trade with Cuba, \n        the affect of the United States policy is to disadvantage \n        United States farmers and businesses that could otherwise \n        compete in the Cuban market;\n            (7) Cuba was one of the founding members of the General \n        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947 and is an original \n        member of the World Trade Organization; and\n            (8) extending permanent normal trade relations to Cuba, as \n        the United States has done with nearly every other member of \n        the World Trade Organization, would enable the United States to \n        avail itself of all rights under the World Trade Organization \n        with respect to Cuba.\n\nSEC. 3.
