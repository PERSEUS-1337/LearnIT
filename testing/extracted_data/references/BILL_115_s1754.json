FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The program of payments to teaching health centers for \n        graduate medical education under section 340H of the Public \n        Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 256h) was enacted in 2010 to \n        address the crisis-level shortage of primary care physicians, \n        especially in rural and medically underserved communities.\n            (2) Teaching health center residents and faculty will \n        provide more than one million primary care medical visits in \n        2017 to underserved communities.\n            (3) When compared with traditional Medicare GME residents, \n        residents who train at teaching health centers are more likely \n        to practice primary care and remain in underserved or rural \n        communities.\n            (4) The teaching health center program not only plays a \n        vital role in training the Nation's next generation of primary \n        care physicians (including dentists), but helps bridge the \n        Nation's physician shortfall.\n            (5) For these reasons, it is of vital importance to \n        continue the program under section 340H of the Public Health \n        Service Act (42 U.S.C. 256h) at a sustainable level of funding \n        per full-time equivalent resident, as recommended in the fact \n        sheet of the Health Resources and Services Administration \n        entitled ``Cost Estimates for Training Residents in a Teaching \n        Health Center''.\n\nSEC. 3.
