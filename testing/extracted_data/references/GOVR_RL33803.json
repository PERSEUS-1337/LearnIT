    "content": "During the 1970-1973 period, Congress considered a variety of proposals to restrict U.S. military operations in Indochina and require a withdrawal of troops from Vietnam in response to the growing controversy in the United States over U.S. military involvement in Vietnam during the 1965-1969 period. The specific proposals for legislation often were in response to key elements of the Nixon Administration's policies and were intended to influence or force changes in the Administration's policies on U.S. military involvement, particularly in Vietnam and Cambodia. A main element of the Nixon Administration's policies was the staged withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam from mid-1969 until the end of 1972 as part of the Administration's Vietnamization strategy of turning over the responsibility for ground combat operations in Vietnam to the South Vietnamese government and army. According to Department of Defense statistics, U.S. troop levels fell from 539,000 in June 1969 to 415,000 in June 1970, 239,000 in June 1971, 47,000 in June 1972, and 21,500 in January 1973. In 1974, a non-funding bill was passed to cap personnel levels in Indochina at 4,000 by mid-1975 (2,500 of whom could be members of the armed forces), and at 3,000 by the end of 1975 (1,500 of whom could be members of the armed forces). The Nixon Administration, however, set no goal of a total withdrawal of U.S. forces or a total end of U.S. combat operations in Vietnam. In particular, the Air Force continued bombing operations at a high level. Thus, many of the proposed amendments and bills in Congress in the 1970-1972 period were aimed at requiring the President to withdraw all U.S. troops from Vietnam and prohibit U.S. combat operations in Vietnam and Indochina. Several of these came to votes in the full House of Representatives and the Senate, but none was enacted into law. A second policy element was the incursion of U.S. ground forces into eastern Cambodia that President Nixon ordered on April 30, 1970. U.S. ground troops withdrew by June 30, 1970, but U.S. bombing of North Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge forces in Cambodia continued. Proposed and enacted amendments in Congress were designed to prohibit both the reintroduction of U.S. ground forces into Cambodia after June 30, 1970 and continued U.S. aerial bombing of Cambodia. The \"Cooper-Church\" amendment, enacted into law in January 1971, prohibited the reintroduction of U.S. ground forces into Cambodia. The restrictive bills passed in June and July 1973 terminated funding for the bombing in Cambodia on August 15, 1973, and bombing stopped on that date. The incursion into Cambodia had an important impact on congressional attempts to legislate restrictions on U.S. military operations. It triggered congressional amendments aimed at restrictions on U.S. military operations not only in Cambodia but in Vietnam as well. The third policy element was the negotiation and signing of an \"Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam\" between the United States and North Vietnam on January 27, 1973. The agreement, in effect a cease-fire agreement with additional political provisions, provided for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from South Vietnam within 60 days of the signing of the accord. U.S. troops were withdrawn fully by March 1973. A major problem for President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in negotiating the agreement was securing the support of South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu. In a November 14, 1972, letter, President Nixon assured President Thieu that \"But far more important than what we say in the agreement on this issue is what we do in the event the enemy renews its aggression. You have my absolute assurance that if Hanoi fails to abide by the terms of this agreement it is my intention to take swift and severe retaliatory action.\" President Nixon and other Administration officials hinted publicly in March 1973 that the United States would intervene militarily if North Vietnam violated the cease-fire agreement. On May 3, 1973, President Nixon submitted a report to Congress entitled U.S. Foreign Policy for the 1970s: Shaping a Durable Peace . In it, he asserted that the United States would not tolerate communist violations of the agreement and that North Vietnam would risk renewed confrontation with the United States if it broke the agreement. President Nixon undoubtedly had in mind the renewal of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam and North Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam if Hanoi renewed the war. As the Nixon Administration withdrew U.S. ground forces from Vietnam in 1971 and 1972, it ordered heavy bombing of communist forces and installations, including massive bombing by B-52 bombers. These indications of Nixon's policy intention no doubt influenced the legislation proposed and passed by Congress in mid-1973 to cut off funding for combat operations \"in or over or from off the shore of North Vietnam, South Vietnam....\" For a CRS Report that compares Congressional funding cutoffs of U.S. military forces to use of the War Powers Act, see CRS Report RS20775, Congressional Use of Funding Cutoffs Since 1970 Involving U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Deployments , by [author name scrubbed]. The proposals included in Table 1 adopted funding cutoffs that follow certain patterns. The section that follows describes the types of restrictions and identifies proposals that fall under that category using the number included in both the tables and the Appendix that follow. The proposals to cut off funds generally prohibit obligating or expending funds in a particular bill or bills after Congress has appropriated the funds. Obligations occur when the government signs a contract to buy goods or services or pays its military or civilian personnel. Expenditures, or outlays, take place when the contractor or employee is paid. Generally, funding prohibitions apply as of a certain date, to specific countries, and to particular types of military activities (entries 2, 3, 4, 5). In one case, the Department of Defense was prohibited from transferring funds from its regular programs to finance wartime operations (entry 19). In some cases, funding prohibitions applied to certain military operations\u2014such as combat operations\u2014and were absolute (entries 2, 3, 4, 18). In other cases, funding was to be cut off for some military activities (e.g., combat) but permitted for other activities (e.g., the withdrawal of troops or the protection of U.S. civilians) (entries 7, 8, 11, 15). In other cases, the funding cutoff was contingent upon certain conditions or events taking place, such as the negotiation by the President of a cease-fire, the release of U.S. prisoners of war (POWs), or a presidential determination that personnel can be withdrawn safely (entries 12, 13, 14, 16). In some cases, the President could recommend extending the deadline if certain conditions, such as the safe withdrawal of troops, have not occurred (entries 13, 14). The prohibition on obligating or spending funds could also be reversed if Congress authorized the activity (entries 5, 8, 20, 21). Prohibitions on funding were set to take effect as of or after a particular date or some specified length of time after enactment and applied to the funds included in the bill under consideration, all previous bills of that type, or any bill (entries 2, 3, 8, 17, 20, 25, 27). Funding restrictions were placed in various types of bills, often appropriations bills but sometimes authorization or other bills (e.g., amendments to the Selective Service Act). The range of prohibited military activities included also varied from the specific\u2014\"Bomb, rocket, napalm, or otherwise attack by air, any target whatsoever ...\" (entry 14) or the \"deployment of ground elements\" in Yugoslavia (entry 21) to general designations such as combat activities, conducting U.S. military operations (entries 2, 13) or \"to support directly or indirectly combat activities,\" (entry 18) or the \"involvement of U.S. military forces in hostilities\" (entry 20). The well-known McGovern-Hatfield amendment that was considered in 1970 combined several of the elements above\u2014prohibiting funds for some but not other specified military activities, setting two specific deadlines, one for a ceiling on the number of troops and another for the withdrawal of remaining forces while at the same time giving the President some leeway to propose an alternative. The amendment prohibited the obligation or expenditure of funds \"authorized by this or any other act\" to \"maintain a troop level of more than 280,000 armed forces\" in Vietnam after April 30, 1971, unless the President finds that a 60-day extension is necessary and recommends that to Congress. For a set period\u2014between April 30 and December 31, 1971, the amendment limited the \"expenditure of funds\" in or over Indochina to the \"safe and systematic withdrawal of remaining forces,\" or providing asylum to endangered Vietnamese (entry 9). It was rejected in June 1971.  Table 2 describes eight proposals\u2014including four that were enacted\u2014which adopt a variety of non-funding restrictions considered by Congress during the Indochina conflict. Several well-known amendments were introduced by Senator Mansfield including two that required the termination of U.S. military operations in Indochina at \"the earliest practicable date\" as well as a withdrawal of all troops within either six or nine months. These versions ultimately did not pass (entries 25, and 27). Two other Mansfield amendments provided for a \"prompt and orderly withdrawal\" at \"the earliest practicable date,\" but did not set a time limit (entries 24 and 26). One amendment was a sense of the Congress and the other stated that it was U.S. policy to terminate military operations and withdraw forces. Although both of these amendments were enacted in the fall of 1971, their practical effect is not clear since no deadline was set. All U.S. troops were withdrawn by March 1973 as required by the Paris Peace accords, almost a year and a half after passage of the first Mansfield amendment. In other cases, such as Somalia in 1993, Congress considered provisions requiring that the President remove forces by January 31, 1994, unless there is a declaration of war or specific congressional authorization (entry 30). Congress also considered and passed a repeal of the August 10, 1964, Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that gave congressional approval to \"take all necessary measures\" to repel an armed attack against the United States in January 1971, but military operations continued in Vietnam for another two years (entry 22).

Therefore, in order to bring an end to the involvement of the armed forces of the United States in the hostilities in Indochina, to secure the safe return of the United States' prisoners of war held by North Vietnam and its allies, and to help bring about a political settlement of the war in Indochina, it is the sense of the Congress that it should be the policy of the United States to provide for the expeditious withdrawal from Indochina of all United States armed forces. (b) On and after the date of enactment of this Act, in order to carry out the policy of withdrawal of all United States armed forces from Indochina, funds authorized for use by such forces by this or any other Act may be used only for the purpose of withdrawal of all such forces from Indochina and may not be used for the purpose of engaging such forces in hostilities in North or South Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos, except for actions necessary to protect those forces against imminent danger as they are withdrawn. 16. Cranston Amendment, H.R. 15495 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this or any other Act, all United States military forces, including combat and support forces, stationed in South Vietnam, shall be withdrawn in a safe and orderly manner from South Vietnam no later than October 1, 1972.

(b) The involvement of United States military forces, land, sea, or air for the purpose of maintaining, supporting, or engaging in hostilities in or over Indochina shall terminate after an agreement for (1) a verified cease-fire between United States Forces and the National Liberation Front and those allied with the National Liberation Front, and (2) the release of all United States prisoners of war held by the Government of North Vietnam and forces allied with such Government, and (3) an accounting for all Americans missing in action who have been held by or known to such Government of such forces. An accounting for such American personnel referred to above shall be subject to verification by the International Red Cross or any other international body mutually agreed to by the President of the United States and the Government of North Vietnam. 17. Brooke Amendment, H.R. 15495 Sec. 13. (a) Funds authorized or appropriated by this or any other Act for United States forces with respect to military actions in Indochina may be used only for the purposes of withdrawing all United States ground, naval, and air forces from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia and protecting such forces as they are withdrawn. The withdrawal of all United States forces from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia shall be carried out within four months after the date of enactment of this act: Provided , That there is a release within the four month period of all American prisoners of war held by the Government of North Vietnam and all forces allied with such Government. 18. Supplemental Appropriations, H.R. 7447 Title III, Sec. 304.

Case-Church Amendment , H.R. 7645 Notwithstanding any other provision of law upon enactment of this act, no funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated may be obligated or expended to finance the involvement of United States military forces in hostilities in or over or from off the shores of North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia unless specifically authorized hereafter by the Congress. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon enactment of this act, no funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated may be obligated or expended for the purpose of providing assistance of any kind, directly or indirectly, to or on behalf of North Vietnam unless specifically authorized hereafter by the Congress. 21. Military Operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Limitation Act of 1999, H.R. 1569 Sec. 2. Prohibition on use of Department of Defense Funds for deployment of United States Ground Forces to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia without specific authorization by law. (a) In General.\u2014None of the funds appropriated or otherwise available to the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for the deployment of ground elements of the United States Armed Forces in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia unless such deployment is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the enactment of this Act. (b) Rule of Construction.\u2014The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to the initiation of missions specifically limited to rescuing United States military personnel or United States citizens in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or rescuing military personnel of another member nation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a result of operations as a member of an air crew. 22.

Non-Funding Restrictions on Military Operations 22. Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Repeal, P.L. 91-672, H.R. 15628 Sec. 12. The joint resolution entitled \"Joint resolution to promote the maintenance of international peace and security in Southeast Asia\", approved August 10, 1964 (78 Stat. 384; Public Law 88-408), is terminated effective upon the day that the second session of the Ninety-first Congress is last adjourned. 24. Mansfield Amendment, P.L. 92-129, H.R. 6531 Title IV\u2014Termination of Hostilities in Indochina Sec. 401. It is hereby declared to be the sense of Congress that the United States terminate at the earliest practicable date all military operations of the United States in Indochina, and provide for the prompt and orderly withdrawal of all United States military forces at a date certain subject to the release of all American prisoners of war held by the Government of North Vietnam and forces allied with such Government, and an accounting for all Americans missing in action who have been held by or known to such Government or such forces.

(a) Sense of Congress Regarding United States Policy Towards Somalia.\u2014 (1) Since United States Armed Forces made significant contributions under Operation Restore Hope towards the establishment of a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations and restoration of peace in the region to end the humanitarian disaster that had claimed more than 300,000 lives. (2) Since the mission of United States forces in support of the United Nations appears to be evolving from the establishment of \"a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations,\" as set out in United Nations Security Council Resolution 794 of December 3, 1992, to one of internal security and nation building. (b) Statement of Congressional Policy.\u2014 (1) Consultation with the Congress.\u2014The President should consult closely with the Congress regarding United States policy with respect to Somalia, including in particular the deployment of United States Armed Forces in that country, whether under United Nations or United States command. (2) Planning.\u2014The United States shall facilitate the assumption of the functions of United States forces by the United Nations. (3) Reporting Requirement.\u2014 (A) The President shall ensure that the goals and objectives supporting deployment of United States forces to Somalia and a description of the mission, command arrangements, size, functions, location, and anticipated duration in Somalia of those forces are clearly articulated and provided in a detailed report to the Congress by October 15, 1993. (B) Such report shall include the status of planning to transfer the function contained in paragraph (2). (4) Congressional Approval.\u2014Upon reporting under the requirements of paragraph (3) Congress believes the President should by November 15, 1993, seek and receive congressional authorization in order for the deployment of United States forces to Somalia to continue. 29.
