SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Aircraft From Explosives \nResponsibly: Advanced Imaging Recognition Act of 2010'' or ``SAFER AIR \nAct of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On December 25, 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a \n        national of Nigeria, allegedly attempted to detonate a \n        concentration of pentaerythritol tetranitrate aboard Northwest \n        Airlines Flight 253 as the aircraft prepared to land in \n        Detroit, Michigan.\n            (2) Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is an explosive chemical \n        compound that cannot be detected by conventional metal \n        detection devices like those that Mr. Abdulmutallab allegedly \n        passed through at airport checkpoints in Nigeria and the \n        Netherlands.\n            (3) However, detection devices employing advanced imaging \n        technology (formerly known as whole-body imaging), and other \n        technologies currently available, such as trace detection \n        equipment, can be used to identify or detect on-body plastic \n        explosives and other nonmetallic explosives, including \n        pentaerythritol tetranitrate, as well as other materials that \n        can be used as weapons.\n            (4) Despite these capabilities, advanced imaging technology \n        has not been fully deployed in the United States or abroad. \n        Through 2009, the Department of Homeland Security used 40 \n        advanced imaging technology units in 19 airports in the United \n        States. Only 6 of those airports used advanced imaging for \n        primary screening, and only then in a limited role at the \n        airport.\n            (5) The Department of Homeland Security has announced plans \n        to deploy 950 additional advanced imaging technology units \n        through fiscal year 2011, for use at approximately 2,200 \n        checkpoints at commercial airports.\n            (6) Other detection technologies complement, and may be \n        used in combination with, advanced imaging technology units as \n        part of a multi-layered approach at the airport checkpoint, and \n        need to be tested and deployed more consistently. These \n        technologies include devices that detect traces of explosives \n        from swabs of passengers or carry-on baggage and advanced \n        technology machines that conduct multiple-view examinations of \n        carry-on baggage.\n    (b) Sense of Congress on Privacy Concerns Related to the Use of \nAdvanced Imaging Technology.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security should--\n            (1) increase efforts to address privacy concerns with \n        respect to the screening of passengers at airports using \n        advanced imaging technology; and\n            (2) conduct additional lab and operational testing of \n        advanced imaging technology and deploy, in a reasonable period \n        of time, technology--\n                    (A) to standardize images produced using advanced \n                imaging technology;\n                    (B) to remove personally identifying \n                characteristics from the images viewed by \n                transportation security officers, while providing such \n                officers with the information necessary to make a clear \n                assessment of the threat posed by individual \n                passengers; and\n                    (C) to upgrade equipment to be able to detect new \n                threats without major capital expenditures.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO PRIMARY SCREENING \n              TECHNOLOGIES AT AIRPORT CHECKPOINTS.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to aggressively seek, \ndevelop, and deploy, in a timely fashion and in sufficient numbers, \nprimary screening technologies capable of detecting and protecting \nagainst threats to domestic and international aviation travel that \ncannot be effectively and efficiently detected by other technologies \ncurrently more commonly utilized in airports, such as metal detection.\n\nSEC. 4. USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY FOR SCREENING AIRCRAFT PASSENGERS.\n\n    Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(l) Use of Advanced Technology for Screening Passengers.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n        ensure that advanced imaging technology and other advanced \n        technology with the capability to detect weapons, on-body \n        plastic explosives, and other nonmetallic explosives, are \n        deployed, individually or in combination with each other, in a \n        timely and effective manner for the primary screening of \n        aircraft passengers in accordance with this subsection.\n            ``(2) Technological and operational certification.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n                date of the enactment of the Securing Aircraft From \n                Explosives Responsibly: Advanced Imaging Recognition \n                Act of 2010, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n                certify to Congress that--\n                            ``(i) the Department of Homeland Security \n                        has the capacity to deploy advanced technology \n                        described in subparagraph (B) at airport \n                        checkpoints to detect weapons, on-body plastic \n                        explosives, and other nonmetallic explosives;
