SHORT TITLE.\n\n    ``This part may be cited as the `Access to High Standards Act'.\n\n``SEC. 10995B. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            ``(1) far too many students are not being provided \n        sufficient academic preparation in secondary school, which \n        results in limited employment opportunities, college dropout \n        rates of over 25 percent for the first year of college, and \n        remediation for almost one-third of incoming college freshmen;\n            ``(2) there is a growing consensus that raising academic \n        standards, establishing high academic expectations, and showing \n        concrete results are at the core of improving public education;\n            ``(3) modeling academic standards on the well-known program \n        of advanced placement courses is an approach that many \n        education leaders and almost half of all States have endorsed;\n            ``(4) advanced placement programs already are providing 30 \n        different college-level courses, serving almost 60 percent of \n        all secondary schools, reaching over 1,000,000 students (of \n        whom 80 percent attend public schools, 55 percent are females, \n        and 30 percent are minorities), and providing test scores that \n        are accepted for college credit at over 3,000 colleges and \n        universities, every university in Germany, France, and Austria, \n        and most institutions in Canada and the United Kingdom;\n            ``(5) 24 States are now funding programs to increase \n        participation in advanced placement programs, including 19 \n        States that provide funds for advanced placement teacher \n        professional development, 3 States that require that all public \n        secondary schools offer advanced placement courses, 10 States \n        that pay the fees for advanced placement tests for some or all \n        students, and 4 States that require that their public \n        universities grant uniform academic credit for scores of 3 or \n        better on advanced placement tests; and\n            ``(6) the State programs described in paragraph (5) have \n        shown the responsiveness of schools and students to such \n        programs, raised the academic standards for both students \n        participating in such programs and other children taught by \n        teachers who are involved in advanced placement courses, and \n        shown tremendous success in increasing enrollment, achievement, \n        and minority participation in advanced placement programs.\n    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are--\n            ``(1) to encourage more of the 600,000 students who take \n        advanced placement courses but do not take advanced placement \n        exams each year to demonstrate their achievements through \n        taking the exams;\n            ``(2) to build on the many benefits of advanced placement \n        programs for students, which benefits may include the \n        acquisition of skills that are important to many employers, \n        Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) scores that are 100 points \n        above the national averages, and the achievement of better \n        grades in secondary school and in college than the grades of \n        students who have not participated in the programs;\n            ``(3) to support State and local efforts to raise academic \n        standards through advanced placement programs, and thus further \n        increase the number of students who participate and succeed in \n        advanced placement programs;\n            ``(4) to increase the availability and broaden the range of \n        schools that have advanced placement programs, which programs \n        are still often distributed unevenly among regions, States, and \n        even secondary schools within the same school district, while \n        also increasing and diversifying student participation in the \n        programs;\n            ``(5) to build on the State programs described in \n        subsection (a)(5) and demonstrate that larger and more diverse \n        groups of students can participate and succeed in advanced \n        placement programs;\n            ``(6) to provide greater access to advanced placement \n        courses for low-income and other disadvantaged students;\n            ``(7) to provide access to advanced placement courses for \n        secondary school juniors at schools that do not offer advanced \n        placement programs, increase the rate of secondary school \n        juniors and seniors who participate in advanced placement \n        courses to 25 percent of the secondary school student \n        population, and increase the numbers of students who receive \n        advanced placement test scores for which college academic \n        credit is awarded; and\n            ``(8) to increase the participation of low-income \n        individuals in taking advanced placement tests through the \n        payment or partial payment of the costs of the advanced \n        placement test fees.\n\n``SEC. 10995C.
