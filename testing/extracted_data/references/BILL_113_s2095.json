SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) veterans who are authorized by the Secretary of \n        Veterans Affairs to receive health care in the community must \n        not lose the high quality, safety, care coordination, and other \n        veteran-centric elements that the health care system of the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs provides;\n            (2) many veterans receive health care from both the \n        Department and community providers but the lack of care \n        coordination among the Department and community providers when \n        veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for \n        poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite \n        health care resources;\n            (3) veteran-centric care coordination is associated with \n        improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department \n        health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the \n        best care for veterans; and\n            (4) if the Secretary purchases care for veterans from the \n        private sector, such care must be secured in a cost-effective \n        manner, in a way that complements the larger health care system \n        of the Department by using industry standards for care and \n        costs.\n\nSEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION AND MODIFICATION OF PILOT PROGRAM OF ENHANCED \n              CONTRACT CARE AUTHORITY FOR HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF \n              VETERANS.\n\n    Section 403 of the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care \nImprovements Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-387; 38 U.S.C. 1703 note) is \namended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``120 days after \n                the date of the enactment of this Act'' and inserting \n                ``90 days after the date of the enactment of the \n                Veterans Health Care Access Received Closer to Home Act \n                of 2014''; and\n                    (B) by amending paragraph (4) to read as follows:\n            ``(4) Program locations.--The Secretary shall carry out the \n        pilot program at locations in the following Veterans Integrated \n        Service Networks (and such other locations as the Secretary \n        considers appropriate):\n                    ``(A) Veterans Integrated Service Network 1.\n                    ``(B) Veterans Integrated Service Network 6.\n                    ``(C) Veterans Integrated Service Network 15.\n                    ``(D) Veterans Integrated Service Network 18.\n                    ``(E) Veterans Integrated Service Network 19.'';\n            (2) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:\n    ``(b) Covered Veterans.--For purposes of the pilot program under \nthis section, a covered veteran is any rural or highly rural veteran \nwho--\n            ``(1) is--\n                    ``(A) enrolled in the system of patient enrollment \n                established under section 1705(a) of title 38, United \n                States Code;\n                    ``(B) eligible for health care under the laws \n                administered by the Secretary and enrolls in such \n                system of patient enrollment not later than 30 days \n                after the veteran begins receiving covered health \n                services under the pilot program; or\n                    ``(C) eligible for health care under section \n                1710(e)(3) of such title; and\n            ``(2) resides in a location that is--\n                    ``(A) more than 60 minutes driving distance from \n                the nearest Department health care facility providing \n                primary care services, if the veteran is seeking such \n                services;\n                    ``(B) more than 120 minutes driving distance from \n                the nearest Department health care facility providing \n                acute hospital care, if the veteran is seeking such \n                care; or\n                    ``(C) more than 240 minutes driving distance from \n                the nearest Department health care facility providing \n                tertiary care, if the veteran is seeking such care.'';\n            (3) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (j);\n            (4) by inserting after subsection (g) the following new \n        subsections:\n    ``(h) Appointments.--In carrying out the pilot program under this \nsection, the Secretary shall ensure that medical appointments for \nveterans occur during the 30-day period beginning on the date that is \n15 days after the date on which the appointment is requested.\n    ``(i) Outreach.--The Secretary shall ensure that a veteran eligible \nfor the pilot program under this section is informed of such \nprogram.''; and\n            (5) in paragraph (2)(B) of subsection (j), as redesignated \n        by paragraph (3) of this section, by striking the semicolon at \n        the end and inserting ``; and''."
