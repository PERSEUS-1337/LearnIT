FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n        the Internet has grown robustly. Today, Americans are changing \n        how they access the Internet, moving from dial-up to broadband \n        for their home connections. According to the Pew Internet and \n        American Life Project, 72 percent of Americans use the Internet \n        and 59 percent of Americans with home Internet have a high-\n        speed Internet connection.\n            (2) Americans use the Internet for many daily activities. \n        Over 17 percent of Americans have sold something over the \n        Internet. Everyday, approximately 60,000,000 Americans use \n        search engines to get access to information. 80 percent of \n        Americans have looked online for health care information. In \n        growing numbers, Americans are using the Internet to place \n        phone calls, watch their favorite televisions shows or movies, \n        and play games.\n            (3) The growth of the Internet and its success are due in \n        large part to the freedom that has always existed on the \n        content and applications layer of the Internet. Innovation has \n        thrived on this layer, as anyone with a good idea has the \n        ability to access consumers. The continuation of this freedom \n        is essential for future innovation.\n            (4) Freedom on the content and applications layer has also \n        led to robust competition for retail goods for consumers. \n        Consumers can shop at thousands upon thousands of retailers \n        from their home computers, including small businesses located \n        miles away in other towns, States, and even countries.\n            (5) Such freedom is leading to the development of important \n        new entertainment offerings, on-demand video and movie \n        purchases, Internet Protocol television, and enhanced gaming \n        options. The entertainment options available in the future will \n        only be limited by the bandwidth that can be used and the \n        innovation of people all over the world.\n            (6) Despite the growth of the Internet and increased access \n        to the Internet for Americans, there is very little choice in \n        who provides them high-speed Internet access. According to an \n        April 2005 White Paper by Harold Feld and Gregory Rose, et. \n        al., entitled, ``Connecting the Public: The Truth About \n        Municipal Broadband'' only 2 percent of Americans get high-\n        speed Internet access from someone other than their local phone \n        company or cable provider. According to the Federal \n        Communications Commission, approximately 20 percent of \n        Americans do not have a high-speed Internet access provider \n        that offers them service.\n            (7) As more and more Americans get high-speed access to the \n        Internet without having much choice of who their provider will \n        be, it is important that Congress protect the freedom on the \n        Internet to ensure its continued success.\n\nSEC. 3.
