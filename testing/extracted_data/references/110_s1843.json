    "title": "A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to clarify that an unlawful practice occurs each time compensation is paid pursuant to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, and for other purposes.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Pay Restoration Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \n        Rubber Co., No. 05-1074 (May 29, 2007), significantly impairs \n        statutory protections against discrimination in compensation \n        that Congress established and that have been bedrock principles \n        of American law for decades. The Ledbetter decision undermines \n        those statutory protections by unduly restricting the time \n        period in which victims of discrimination can challenge and \n        recover for discriminatory compensation decisions or other \n        practices, contrary to the intent of Congress.\n            (2) The limitation imposed by the Court on the filing of \n        discriminatory compensation claims ignores the reality of wage \n        discrimination and is at odds with the robust application of \n        the civil rights laws that Congress intended.\n            (3) With regard to any charge of discrimination under any \n        law, nothing in this Act is intended to preclude or limit an \n        aggrieved person's right to introduce evidence of an unlawful \n        employment practice that has occurred outside the time for \n        filing a charge of discrimination.\n            (4) Nothing in this Act is intended to change the law in \n        effect as of May 28, 2007, concerning the treatment of when \n        pension benefits are considered paid.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION BECAUSE OF RACE, COLOR, \n              RELIGION, SEX, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN.\n\n    Section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-\n5(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(3)(A) For purposes of this section, an unlawful employment \npractice occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in \nviolation of this title, when a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an \nindividual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a \ndecision or other practice.\n    ``(B) Liability may accrue and (in addition to any relief \nauthorized by section 1977A of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981a)), \nan aggrieved person may obtain relief as provided in subsection (g)(1), \nincluding recovery of back pay for up to 2 years preceding the filing \nof the charge, in an action under this title concerning an unlawful \nemployment practice with regard to discrimination in compensation, \nwhere the unlawful employment practice that has occurred during the \ncharge filing period is similar or related to an unlawful employment \npractice with regard to discrimination in compensation that occurred \noutside the charge filing period.''.\n\nSEC. 4. DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION BECAUSE OF AGE.\n\n    Section 7(d) of the Age Discrimination Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n626(d)) is amended--\n            (1) in the first sentence--\n                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n                subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively; and\n                    (B) by striking ``(d)'' and inserting ``(d)(1)'';\n            (2) in the third sentence, by striking ``Upon'' and \n        inserting the following:\n    ``(2) Upon''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(3) For purposes of this section, an unlawful practice occurs, \nwith respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of this \nAct, when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is \nadopted, when a person becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, or when a person is affected by application \nof a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including \neach time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in \nwhole or in part from such a decision or other practice.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
