FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) in order to maintain our quality of life, economic \n        growth should--\n                    (A) be balanced with environmental management; and\n                    (B) include collaborative scientific inquiry, \n                technology development, and public policy;\n            (2) the failure of environmental science data, technology, \n        and knowledge to adequately support long-term policy leads to \n        questions of scientific data quality, credibility, and utility, \n        and results in an atmosphere of adversarial science and \n        conflicting policy;\n            (3) individuals affected by decisions regarding long-term \n        stewardship have not always been effective in determining the \n        needs for, setting the agenda for, and participating in \n        environmental research and development;\n            (4) decisions regarding the long-term stewardship can \n        significantly impact a region's economy and its residents' \n        quality of life;\n            (5) the Department of Energy is just beginning to develop \n        long-term strategies for managing its vast holdings of land;\n            (6) the Department of Energy environmental management \n        program--\n                    (A) is the largest program in the Department;\n                    (B) must have the scientific capability to support \n                long-term stewardship in order for the Department to \n                manage legacy waste; and\n                    (C) has no national laboratories designated to \n                address the science, research, and developmental needs \n                for long-term stewardship; and\n            (7) the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \n        Laboratory, a multiprogrammatic federally funded research and \n        development laboratory, is geographically and technologically \n        positioned to capably address the needs for long-term \n        stewardship.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to designate the Idaho National Engineering and \n        Environmental Laboratory as the Center of Excellence for \n        Environmental Stewardship of the Department of Energy to \n        provide for the long-term stewardship of Department land;\n            (2) to establish the Natural Resources Institute within the \n        Center;
