FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the additional guidance contained in the Federal \n        Communication Commission's memorandum opinion and order in WQED \n        Pittsburgh (FCC 99-393), adopted December 15, 1999, and \n        released December 29, 1999, the Commission attempted to impose \n        content-based programming requirements on noncommercial \n        educational television broadcasters without the benefit of \n        notice and comment in a rulemaking proceeding.\n            (2) In doing so, the Commission did not adequately consider \n        the implications of its proposed guidelines on the rights of \n        such broadcasters under First Amendment and the Religious \n        Freedom Restoration Act.\n            (3) Noncommercial educational broadcasters should be \n        responsible for using the station to primarily serve an \n        educational, instructional, cultural, or religious purpose in \n        its community of license, and for making judgments about the \n        types of programming that serve those purposes.\n            (4) Religious programming contributes to serving the \n        educational and cultural needs of the public, and should be \n        treated by the Commission on a par with other educational and \n        cultural programming.\n            (5) Because noncommercial broadcasters are not permitted to \n        sell air time, they should not be required to provide free air \n        time to commercial entities or political candidates.\n            (6) The Commission should not engage in regulating the \n        content of speech broadcast by noncommercial educational \n        stations.\n\nSEC. 3.
