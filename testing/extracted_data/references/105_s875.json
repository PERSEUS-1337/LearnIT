    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Mailbox Protection Act of \n1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Internet has increasingly become a critical mode of \n        global communication and now presents unprecedented \n        opportunities for the development and growth of global commerce \n        and an integrated worldwide economy.\n            (2) In order for global commerce on the Internet to reach \n        its full potential, individuals and entities using the Internet \n        and other online services should be prevented from engaging in \n        activities that prevent other users and Internet service \n        providers from having a reasonably predictable, efficient, and \n        economical online experience.\n            (3) Unsolicited electronic mail can be an important \n        mechanism through which commercial vendors, nonprofit \n        organizations, and other providers of services recruit members, \n        advertise, and attract customers in the online environment.\n            (4) The receipt of unsolicited electronic mail may result \n        in undue monetary costs to recipients who cannot refuse to \n        accept such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such \n        mail, or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and \n        discarding such mail, or for both.\n            (5) Unsolicited electronic mail sent in bulk may impose \n        significant monetary costs on the Internet service providers, \n        businesses, and educational and non-profit institutions that \n        carry and receive such mail, as there is a finite volume of \n        mail that such providers, businesses, and institutions can \n        handle at any one point in time. The sending of such mail is \n        increasingly and negatively affecting the quality of service \n        provided to customers of Internet service providers.\n            (6) While many senders of bulk unsolicited electronic mail \n        provide simple and reliable ways for recipients to reject (or \n        ``opt-out'' of) receipt of unsolicited electronic mail from \n        such senders in the future, other senders provide no such \n        ``opt-out'' mechanism, or refuse to honor the requests of \n        recipients not to receive electronic mail from such senders in \n        the future, or both.\n            (7) An increasing number of senders of bulk unsolicited \n        electronic mail purposefully disguise the source of such mail \n        so as to prevent recipients from responding to such mail \n        quickly and easily.\n            (8) Many senders of unsolicited electronic mail collect (or \n        ``harvest'') electronic mail addresses of potential recipients \n        without the knowledge of their intended recipients and in \n        violation of the rules or terms of service of the fora from \n        which such addresses are collected.\n            (9) Because recipients of unsolicited electronic mail are \n        unable to avoid the receipt of such mail through reasonable \n        means, such mail may threaten the privacy of recipients. This \n        privacy threat is enhanced for recipients whose electronic mail \n        software or server alerts them to new mail as it arrives, as \n        unsolicited electronic mail thereby disrupts the normal \n        operation of the recipient's computer.\n            (10) In legislating against certain abuses on the Internet, \n        Congress and the States should be very careful to avoid \n        infringing in any way upon constitutionally protected rights, \n        including the rights of assembly, free speech, and privacy.\n            (11) In order to realize the full potential for online \n        electronic commerce, senders of bulk unsolicited electronic \n        mail should be required to abide by the requests of electronic \n        mail recipients, Internet service providers, businesses, and \n        educational and non-profit institutions to cease sending such \n        mail to such recipients, providers, businesses, and educational \n        and non-profit institutions.\n\nSEC. 3.
