FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Medical costs are a substantial burden to society. For \n        example, the cost for acute care and followup treatment of \n        gunshot injuries in 1994 in the United States was \n        $2,300,000,000, of which $1,100,000,000 was paid by government \n        programs, according to an article in the Journal of the \n        American Medical Association.\n            (2) The mean medical cost per gunshot injury is about \n        $17,000.\n            (3) For hospital-admitted survivors of gunshot injuries, \n        estimates suggest that Federal, State, or local government is \n        the primary payer of medical costs of the injuries in 44 \n        percent of the cases.\n            (4) The excise tax on firearms and ammunition has not \n        changed in 60 years.\n            (5) This excise tax has raised more than $2,600,000,000 \n        during that time.\n            (6) Congress needs to ensure that the revenue raised by \n        this excise tax is used for the proper purposes.\n\nSEC. 3. INCREASE IN EXCISE TAX ON FIREARMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 4181 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n(relating to tax on firearms) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``10 percent'' and inserting ``15 \n        percent'', and\n            (2) by striking ``11 percent'' and inserting ``16 \n        percent''.\n    (b) Retention of Prior Rate for Taxable Sales to Government.--\nSection 4182 of such Code is amended by adding at the end the following \nnew subsection:\n    ``(d) Sales to Government.--Except as provided in subsection (b), \nin the case of a sale for the use by the United States, a State, or a \npolitical subdivision of a State (or any department, agency, or \ninstrumentality of any of the foregoing), the tax imposed by section \n4181 shall be determined by substituting ``10 percent'' for ``15 \npercent'' and ``11 percent'' for ``16 percent''.\n    (c) Use of Proceeds of Excise Tax.--Subchapter A of chapter 98 of \nsubtitle I such Code is amended by adding at the end the following new \nsections:\n\n``SEC. 9511.
