FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following--\n            (1) The Commonwealth Government is confronted with a dire \n        fiscal emergency and liquidity crisis that imminently threatens \n        the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, affecting the \n        provision of essential public services including public safety, \n        health care, and education that are needed both to sustain the \n        welfare of the people and the economic ability of the \n        Commonwealth to address any future resolution of debts and \n        legal obligations.\n            (2) A temporary stay on litigation with respect to debt \n        holders for the Commonwealth is essential to provide breathing \n        space to the Commonwealth, creditors, and the Congress to \n        determine an orderly process for the Commonwealth to address \n        any future resolution of legal obligations and to provide the \n        Commonwealth a path to sustainable growth; and thereby, protect \n        the lives of more than 3.5 million American citizens living in \n        the Commonwealth.\n            (3) The Commonwealth is in a state of fiscal emergency \n        brought on by, among other things, a combination of accumulated \n        operating deficits, cash shortages, management inefficiencies, \n        and excessive borrowing.\n            (4) The Commonwealth Government's debt is unusually \n        complex, with eighteen different but inter-related issuers.\n                    (A) There is an even larger number of creditor \n                groups, each of which may have divergent interests.\n                    (B) The debt's unusual complexity will \n                substantially complicate any potential consensual \n                restructuring in the absence of Federal legislation to \n                facilitate the negotiations.\n            (5) This legislation, which includes a stay on litigation \n        by debt holders, can protect essential government services and \n        help the Commonwealth address its liabilities in an orderly \n        fashion, benefitting all stakeholders.\n                    (A) A temporary stay on litigation is essential to \n                facilitate an orderly process for stabilizing, \n                evaluating, and comprehensively resolving the \n                Commonwealth's fiscal crisis.\n                    (B) Avoiding a disorderly race to the courthouse \n                will benefit creditors as well as other stakeholders.\n                    (C) Furthermore, the stay is only temporary.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) provide a limited period of time to permit Congress to \n        enact comprehensive relief for the Commonwealth, providing it \n        the necessary tools to address its economic and fiscal crisis; \n        and\n            (2) provide the Commonwealth Government with a tool it \n        needs to address an immediate and imminent crisis that is \n        unprecedented in the history of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \nAct.\n\nSEC. 4. SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any \nperson or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Act, or \nthe application of that provision to persons or circumstances other \nthan those as to which it is held invalid, is not affected thereby.\n\nSEC. 5.
