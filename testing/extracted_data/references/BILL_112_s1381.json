FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Lyme disease is a common but frequently misunderstood \n        illness that, if not caught early and treated properly, can \n        cause serious health problems.\n            (2) Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia \n        burgdorferi, which belongs to the class of spirochetes, and is \n        transmitted to humans by the bite of infected black-legged \n        ticks. Early signs of infection may include a rash and flu-like \n        symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue.\n            (3) Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics \n        if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it \n        mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed.\n            (4) If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive \n        treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, \n        neurological, eye, and joint problems.\n            (5) Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all \n        vector-borne infections in the United States, the ticks that \n        spread Lyme disease also spread other diseases, such as \n        anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and tularemia, and carry Bartonella \n        and other strains of Borrelia. Other tick species, such as the \n        aggressive lone star, spread ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain \n        spotted fever, and southern tick-associated rash illness \n        (STARI). Multiple diseases in 1 patient make diagnosis and \n        treatment more difficult.\n            (6) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported \n        more than 38,000 confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases in \n        2009. Over the past decade, the incidence of Lyme disease has \n        increased by 84 percent.\n            (7) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, from 1992 to 2006, the incidence of Lyme disease \n        was highest among children aged 5 to 14 years of age.\n            (8) Persistence of symptomatology in many patients without \n        reliable testing makes diagnosis and treatment of patients more \n        difficult.\n\nSEC. 3.
