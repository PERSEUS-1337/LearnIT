FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The events of September 11, 2001, demonstrated that the \n        United States needs to do more to ensure the survivability and \n        quick retrieval of critical flight data and cockpit voice \n        recording units aboard commercial aircraft.\n            (2) Increased national security threats to commercial \n        airliners demand that the United States do everything possible \n        to better secure the safety of our passengers by ensuring the \n        quick and complete recovery of critical flight data from \n        commercial air disasters for immediate analysis of potential \n        terrorism and to avoid unnecessary grounding of our commercial \n        air fleet.\n            (3) In light of new commercial aviation advances, including \n        increased polar flights, increased air traffic over-water, and \n        the onset of free flight, there is increased potential for more \n        difficult location and recovery of fixed flight recorder and \n        cockpit voice recorder units.\n            (4) Hundreds of millions of dollars are unnecessarily -\n        expended to locate and recover ``black boxes'', especially in \n        underwater investigations, despite existing deployable recorder \n        technology currently used by the United States Armed Forces, \n        which would allow us to avoid such unnecessary and wasteful \n        costs.-\n            (5) It is in the public's best interest to accomplish these \n        -improvements by implementing the March, 9, 1999, \n        recommendations A-99-16 through A-99-18 of the National \n        Transportation Safety Board, in addition to incorporating a \n        combined cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data \n        recorder system designed to eject from the rear of the aircraft \n        at the moment of an accident, so that the system will avoid the \n        direct impact forces of the crash, avoid -becoming ensnarled in \n        the wreckage or fire intensity of the crash site, and float \n        indefinitely on water.\n            (6) The Navy's successful experience since 1993 with \n        deployable technology indicates that transfer of this \n        technology into the commercial sector provides an obvious way \n        to help us meet our goals to increase the survivability and \n        retrieval of recorders while reducing the time and cost of a \n        mishap, investigation, search, rescue, and recovery.\n            (7) Valuable time is lost searching for fixed flight data \n        recorders in the wreckage of a crash site, especially at the \n        bottom of the ocean, and critical data is unnecessarily lost in \n        incidents in which the aircraft's electrical supply is \n        prematurely interrupted or the black boxes do not survive the \n        crash circumstances, as is evident in reviewing some of our \n        most recent and devastating air incidents, the including the \n        following:\n                    (A) Neither flight data or cockpit voice recorder \n                was recovered from American Airlines Flight 11 and \n                United Airlines Flight 175 that were used in the World \n                Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001.\n                    (B) It took 3 days to recover the flight data and \n                cockpit voice recorders from American Airlines Flight \n                77 that was used in the Pentagon attack on September \n                11, 2001. In addition, the cockpit voice recorder was \n                damaged beyond repair, rendering no information.\n                    (C) It took 13 days to locate the cockpit voice \n                recorder and 9 days to recover the flight data recorder \n                from the air disaster involving Egypt Air Flight 990 in \n                the vicinity of Nantucket, Massachusetts, air disaster \n                on October 31, 1999.\n                    (D) With respect to Swiss Air Flight 111 \n                International in Halifax, Canada, on September 2, 1998, \n                the cockpit voice recorder stopped nearly 6 minutes \nbefore the airplane hit the water, and it took search teams 9 days to \nlocate the cockpit voice recorder and 4 days to recover the flight data \nrecorder.\n                    (E) The cockpit voice recorder and flight data \n                recorder stopped about 40 to 50 seconds before the \n                Valuejet Flight 592 crashed on its way back to the \n                Miami, Florida, airport on May 11, 1996. It took 15 \n                days to recover the cockpit voice recorder, and 2 days \n                to recover the flight data recorder from such flight \n                because the underwater locator beacon failed.\n                    (F) With respect to TWA Flight 800 which exploded \n                and crashed in the vicinity of Moriches, New York, on \n                July 17, 1996, the cockpit voice recorder and flight \n                data recorder stopped at the time of the explosion, \n                even though the airplane did not hit the water for \n                another 40 to 50 seconds, and it took 7 days to recover \n                such recorders.\n\nSEC. 3. REGULATIONS REQUIRING DEPLOYABLE RECORDERS AND OTHER PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 447 of title 49, United States Code is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 44727.
