SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medically \nUnderserved Access to Care Act of 2001''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Minority individuals living in medically underserved \n        areas are generally less well-off socioeconomically, and are \n        often sicker than the population that managed care \n        organizations traditionally serve.\n            (2) Many managed care organizations are not equipped to \n        deal effectively with minorities in underserved areas and \n        consequently may offer lower quality health care in such areas.\n            (3) Often managed care organizations do not contract with \n        physicians and other community-based service providers who \n        traditionally serve medically underserved areas.\n            (4) There is a concern among minority physicians that \n        selective marketing practices and referral processes may keep \n        minority and community-based physicians out of some managed \n        care organizations.\n            (5) Managed care organizations sometimes exclude physicians \n        and other community-based health care providers who \n        traditionally provide service to underserved areas; this is \n        particularly the case among minority physicians who may be well \n        established in their community based practices but are not \n        board certified.\n\nSEC. 2.
