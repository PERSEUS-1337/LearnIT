FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Numerous species of fauna have continued to decline to \n        the point that the long-term survival of those species in the \n        wild is in serious jeopardy.\n            (2) Many of those species are listed under section 4 of the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) or in Appendix \n        I, II, or III of the Convention on International Trade in \n        Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n            (3) There are insufficient resources available for \n        addressing the threats facing those species, which will require \n        the joint commitment and effort of countries within the range \n        of those species, the United States and other countries, and \n        the private sector.\n            (4) The grant programs established by the Congress for \n        tigers, rhinoceroses, Asian elephants, and African elephants \n        have proven to be extremely successful, provide Federal funds \n        for conservation projects in an efficient and expeditious \n        manner, and encourage additional support for conservation in \n        countries where those species exist in the wild.\n            (5) A new grant program modeled on the existing programs \n        for tigers, rhinoceroses, and elephants would provide an \n        effective means to assist in the conservation of keystone \n        species for which there are no existing grant programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to conserve keystone \nspecies of fauna throughout the world, and the ecosystems on which \nthose species depend, by supporting the conservation programs for those \nspecies and the CITES Secretariat, promoting partnerships between the \npublic and private sectors, and providing financial resources for those \nprograms and partnerships.\n\nSEC. 3.
