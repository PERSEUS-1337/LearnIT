PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to optimize Federal data center usage \nand efficiency.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Federal data center optimization initiative.--The term \n        ``Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative'' means the \n        initiative developed and implemented pursuant to section 4.\n            (2) Covered agency.--The term ``covered agency'' means any \n        agency included in the Federal Data Center Optimization \n        Initiative pursuant to section 8.\n            (3) Federal chief information officer.--The term ``Federal \n        Chief Information Officer'' means the chief information officer \n        of the Office of Management and Budget.\n            (4) Data center.--The term ``data center'' means any room \n        that is devoted to data processing servers, including server \n        closets (typically less than 200 square feet) and server rooms \n        (typically less than 500 square feet), within a conventional \n        building, and larger spaces in any building dedicated to \n        housing servers, storage devices, and network equipment, but \n        the term does not include facilities that are exclusively \n        devoted to communications and network equipment (such as \n        telephone exchanges) and telecommunications rooms and closets.\n            (5) Desktop virtualization.--The term ``desktop \n        virtualization'' means any technology that creates a virtual \n        version of an information technology device or resource and is \n        used to separate a computer desktop environment from the \n        physical computer.\n            (6) Virtualization.--The term ``virtualization'' means the \n        simulation of the software or hardware, or both, upon which \n        other software runs which allows servers to be consolidated in \n        ratios of 5:1 up to 25:1. The use of virtualization technology \n        is both an instrumental and necessary component to achieve \n        increases in server utilization rates. This simulated \n        environment is called a virtual machine (VM).\n            (7) Federal data center.--The term ``Federal data center'' \n        means any data center of a covered agency used or operated by a \n        covered agency, by a contractor of a covered agency, or by \n        another organization on behalf of a covered agency.\n            (8) Power utilization effectiveness.--The term ``power \n        utilization effectiveness'' means the ratio obtained by \n        dividing the total amount of electricity and other power \n        consumed in running a data center by the power consumed by the \n        information and communications technology in the data center.\n            (9) Server utilization.--The term ``server utilization'' \n        refers to the activity level of a server relative to its \n        maximum activity level during peek hours of operation, \n        expressed as a percentage.\n            (10) Cloud computing.--The term ``cloud computing'', as \n        defined by National Institute of Standards and Technology, \n        means a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand \n        network access to a shared pool of configurable computing \n        resources (such as networks, servers, storage, applications, \n        and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with \n        minimal management effort or service provider interaction. The \n        model is composed of the following:\n                    (A) Five essential characteristics, which are on-\n                demand service, broad network access, resource pooling, \n                rapid elasticity, and measured service.\n                    (B) Three service models, which are software as a \n                service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a \n                service.\n                    (C) Four deployment models, which are private \n                cloud, community cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL DATA CENTER OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) Requirement for Initiative.--The Federal Chief Information \nOfficer, in consultation with the chief information officers of covered \nagencies, shall develop and implement an initiative to optimize the \nusage and efficiency of Federal data centers by meeting the \nrequirements of this Act and taking additional measures, as \nappropriate.\n    (b) Requirement for Plan.--Within 6 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Federal Chief Information Officer, in \nconsultation with the chief information officers of covered agencies, \nshall develop and submit to Congress a consolidated plan for \nimplementation of the initiative by each agency. The agency \nconsolidation plans must include descriptions of how agencies will use \nreductions in floor space, energy use, infrastructure, equipment, \napplications, personnel, increases in multiorganizational use, and \nother appropriate methods to meet the requirements of the initiative. \nThe agency consolidation plans must also be included in, and consistent \nwith, the President's annual budget submission materials, including the \ndetailed budget justifications and appropriations estimates.\n\nSEC. 5.
