FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and \n        tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Currently, more \n        than \\1/3\\ of children and adolescents in the United States are \n        overweight or obese.\n            (2) A report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and \n        Trust for America's Health found that if the population of the \n        United States continues on its current trajectory, adult \n        obesity rates could exceed 60 percent in a number of States by \n        2030.\n            (3) Health-related behaviors, such as eating habits and \n        physical activity patterns, develop early in life and affect \n        behavior and health in adulthood. The diets of American \n        children and adolescents depart substantially from recommended \n        patterns that put their health at risk. Overall, American \n        children and youth are not achieving basic nutritional goals. \n        They are consuming excess calories and added sugars and have \n        higher than recommended intakes of sodium, total fat, and \n        saturated fats.\n            (4) According to a 2012 report from the Federal Trade \n        Commission, the total amount spent on food marketing to \n        children is about $2,000,000,000 per year.\n            (5) Companies market food to children through television, \n        radio, Internet, magazines, product placement in movies and \n        video games, schools, product packages, toys, clothing and \n        other merchandise.\n            (6) According to a comprehensive review by the National \n        Academy of Medicine, studies demonstrate that television food \n        advertising affects children's food choices, food purchase \n        requests, diets, and health. The Academy concluded that the \n        marketing of high-calorie foods to children and adolescents is \n        one of the major contributors to childhood obesity.\n            (7) More than 80 percent of the food advertisements seen by \n        children on television are for foods of poor nutritional value.\n            (8) A study published in the Journal of Law and Economics \n        and funded by the National Institutes of Health found that the \n        elimination of the tax deduction that allows companies to \n        deduct costs associated with advertising food of poor \n        nutritional quality to children could reduce the rates of \n        childhood obesity by 5 to 7 percent.\n            (9) A study published in the Journal of Health Affairs \n        found that the elimination of the tax deduction for costs \n        described in paragraph (8) would save up to $260,000,000 in \n        health care costs and prevent nearly 130,000 cases of childhood \n        obesity over 10 years.\n\nSEC. 3.
