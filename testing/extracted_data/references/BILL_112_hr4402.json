FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The industrialization of China and India has driven \n        demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, sparking a period of \n        resource nationalism exemplified by China's reduction in \n        exports of rare-earth elements necessary for \n        telecommunications, military technologies, healthcare \n        technologies, and conventional and renewable energy \n        technologies.\n            (2) The availability of minerals and mineral materials are \n        essential for economic growth, national security, technological \n        innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply \n        chain.\n            (3) The exploration, production, processing, use, and \n        recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic \n        well-being, security and general welfare of the Nation.\n            (4) The United States has vast mineral resources, but is \n        becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these \n        mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following:\n                    (A) Twenty-five years ago the United States was \n                dependent on foreign sources for 30 nonfuel mineral \n                materials, 6 of which the United States imported 100 \n                percent of the Nation's requirements, and for another \n                16 commodities the United States imported more than 60 \n                percent of the Nation's needs.\n                    (B) By 2011 the United States import dependence for \n                nonfuel mineral materials had more than doubled from 30 \n                to 67 commodities, 19 of which the United States \n                imported 100 percent of the Nation's requirements, and \n                for another 24 commodities, imported more than 50 \n                percent of the Nation's needs.\n                    (C) The United States share of world wide mineral \n                exploration dollars was 8 percent in 2011, down from 19 \n                percent in the early 1990s.\n                    (D) In the 2012 Ranking of Countries for Mining \n                Investment, out of 25 major mining countries, the \n                United States ranked last with Papua New Guinea in \n                permitting delays, and towards the bottom regarding \n                government take and social issues affecting mining.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Strategic and critical minerals.--The term ``strategic \n        and critical minerals'' means minerals that are necessary--\n                    (A) for national defense and national security \n                requirements;\n                    (B) for the Nation's energy infrastructure, \n                including pipelines, refining capacity, electrical \n                power generation and transmission, and renewable energy \n                production;\n                    (C) to support domestic manufacturing, agriculture, \n                housing, telecommunications, healthcare, and \n                transportation infrastructure; and\n                    (D) for the Nation's economic security and balance \n                of trade.\n            (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency, \n        department, or other unit of Federal, State, local, or tribal \n        government, or Alaska Native Corporation.\n            (3) Mineral exploration or mine permit.--The term ``mineral \n        exploration or mine permit'' includes plans of operation issued \n        by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service \n        pursuant to 43 CFR 3809 and 36 CFR 228A respectively.\n\n  TITLE I--DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SOURCES OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL \n                                MINERALS\n\nSEC. 101. IMPROVING DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS.\n\n    Domestic mines that will provide strategic and critical minerals \nshall be considered an ``infrastructure project'' as described in \nPresidential Order ``Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and \nReview of Infrastructure Projects'' dated March 22, 2012.\n\nSEC. 102. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD AGENCY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a \nmineral exploration or mine permit shall appoint a project lead who \nshall coordinate and consult with other agencies, cooperating agencies, \nproject proponents and contractors to ensure that agencies minimize \ndelays, set and adhere to timelines and schedules for completion of \nreviews, set clear permitting goals and track progress against those \ngoals.\n    (b) The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral \nexploration or mine permit shall determine any such action would not \nconstitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality \nof the human environment within the meaning of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 if the procedural and substantive \nsafeguards of the lead agency's permitting process alone, any \napplicable State permitting process alone, or a combination of the two \nprocesses together provide an adequate mechanism to ensure that \nenvironmental factors are taken into account.\n    (c) The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral \nexploration or mine permit shall enhance government coordination on \npermitting and review by avoiding duplicative reviews, minimizing \npaperwork and engaging other agencies and stakeholders early in the \nprocess.
