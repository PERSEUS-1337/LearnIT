REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF GOVERNMENT OF NORTH KOREA AS A STATE \n              SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Government designated the Government \n        of North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism on January 20, \n        1988.\n            (2) On October 11, 2008, North Korea's designation as a \n        state sponsor of terrorism was rescinded, following commitments \n        by the Government of North Korea to dismantle its nuclear \n        weapons program. However, North Korea has failed to live up to \n        these commitments.\n            (3) On October 22, 2015, the United States Special \n        Representative for North Korea Policy with the Department of \n        State, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee \n        on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade that North Korea's \n        ``conduct poses a growing threat to the United States, our \n        friends in the region, and the global nonproliferation regime'' \n        and the Deputy Coordinator for Homeland Security, Screening, \n        and Designations with the U.S. Department of State noted that \n        ``weapons transfers that violate nonproliferation or missile \n        control regimes could be a relevant factor for consideration, \n        depending on the circumstances, consistent with the statutory \n        criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism''.\n            (4) The Government of North Korea has harbored members of \n        the Japanese Red Army since a 1970 hijacking and continues to \n        harbor the surviving hijackers to this day.\n            (5) On July 16, 2010, in the case of Calderon-Cardona v. \n        Democratic People's Republic of Korea (case number 08-01367), \n        the United States District Court for the District of Puerto \n        Rico found that the Government of North Korea provided material \n        support to the Japanese Red Army, designated as a foreign \n        terrorist organization between 1997 and 2001, in furtherance of \n        a 1972 terrorist attack at Lod Airport, Israel that killed 26 \n        people, including 17 Americans.\n            (6) In the case of Chaim Kaplan v. Hezbollah (case number \n        09-646), a United States district court found in 2014 that \n        North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by \n        Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization, against \n        Israel in 2006.\n            (7) In June 2010, Major Kim Myong-ho and Major Dong Myong-\n        gwan of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau pled guilty \n        in a South Korean court to attempting to assassinate Hwang \n        Jang-yop, a North Korean dissident in exile, on the orders of \n        Lieutenant General Kim Yong-chol, the head of North Korea's \n        Reconnaissance General Bureau. The court sentenced each \n        defendant to 10 years in prison.\n            (8) In March 2015, the Government of South Korea concluded \n        that North Korea was responsible for a December 2014 cyber \n        attack against multiple nuclear power plants in South Korea. \n        The South Korean Government stated that the attacks were \n        intended to cause a malfunction at the plants' reactors, and \n        described the attacks as acts of ``cyber-terror targeting our \n        country''.\n            (9) On December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of \n        Investigation (FBI) concluded that North Korea was responsible \n        for a cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment and a \n        subsequent threat of violence against theaters that showed the \n        film ``The Interview''. The FBI concluded that the ``Guardians \n        of Peace'', which sent the threat to Sony Pictures \n        Entertainment, was a unit of North Korea's Reconnaissance \n        General Bureau, its foreign intelligence service.\n            (10) Malaysian authorities have alleged that officials from \n        North Korea's secret police and Foreign Ministry were involved \n        in the poisoning and killing of the estranged half-brother of \n        the country's leader, Kim Jong-nam, using the chemical weapon \n        VX nerve agent, a substance banned for use as a weapon by the \n        United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention, on February 13, \n        2017, in Kuala Lumpur.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \nGovernment of North Korea likely meets the criteria for designation as \na state sponsor of terrorism and, if so should be so designated.\n    (c) Determination.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the \nappropriate congressional committees a determination as to whether the \nGovernment of North Korea meets the criteria for designation as a state \nsponsor of terrorism.\n    (d) Form.--The determination required by subsection (c) shall be \nsubmitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex, if \nappropriate.\n\nSEC. 3.
