    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-Excessive Speculation Act of \n2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) as scores of recent academic and governmental studies, \n        reports, and analyses have shown, unlimited and excessive \n        speculation in commodity markets causes harm to consumers and \n        commodity-dependent businesses of the United States by \n        contributing to unnecessary volatility and unwarranted \n        increases in food and energy prices;\n            (2) for the purpose of diminishing, eliminating, or \n        preventing the burdens imposed on interstate commerce by \n        excessive speculation in commodities, section 4a(a)(1) of the \n        Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6a(a)(1)) directs the \n        Commodity Futures Trading Commission to proclaim and fix \n        speculative position limits, as necessary, on the amount of \n        commodity trading by any person, including any group or class \n        of traders other than bona fide hedgers;\n            (3) pursuant to the standards set forth in section 4a(a)(1) \n        of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6a(a)(1)), section \n        4a(a)(2) of that Act directs the Commodity Futures Trading \n        Commission to establish limits on the positions that may be \n        held by commodity traders, other than bona fide hedge \n        positions, and establishes a specific timetable for \n        implementation of those limits;\n            (4) the rulemaking authority of section 4a of the Commodity \n        Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6a) provides the Commodity Futures \n        Trading Commission with ample authority to impose meaningful \n        speculative position limits on commodity trading by individual \n        speculators, as well as position limits on the overall level of \n        speculative trading in the marketplace;\n            (5) in recent years, the interpretation of the Commodity \n        Futures Trading Commission of the term ``excessive \n        speculation'' has focused on the threat that singular, \n        concentrated positions pose to the liquidity and efficient \n        management of commodity trading;\n            (6) the historically narrow emphasis of the Commodity \n        Futures Trading Commission on the burden created by \n        concentrated speculative positions has deterred the Commission \n        from adopting additional measures to ensure that the aggregate \n        level of speculation in the market does not contribute to \n        unwarranted increases in commodity price levels;\n            (7) this Act clarifies that--\n                    (A) one of the fundamental objectives of the \n                Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is to \n                ensure that the commodity markets accurately reflect \n                the fundamental supply and demand for commodities; and\n                    (B) the deterrence and prevention of excessive \n                speculation is an express purpose of that Act;\n            (8) in order to end decades of legal uncertainty and \n        regulatory ambiguity that has undermined enforcement efforts, \n        this Act defines the term ``excessive speculation'' and creates \n        legal presumptions that give rise to a determination that \n        excessive speculation is present in a commodity market; and\n            (9) the individual and aggregate position limits set forth \n        in this Act and applicable to energy contracts seek to \n        strengthen, and not replace, any limits established by the \n        Commodity Futures Trading Commission under the rulemaking \n        processes of the Commission.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    Section 3 of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 5) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``, or'' and inserting \n        ``that accurately reflect the fundamental supply and demand for \n        commodities, and''; and\n            (2) in subsection (b), in the second sentence, by inserting \n        ``and excessive speculation'' after ``prevent price \n        manipulation''.\n\nSEC. 4. FOREIGN BOARDS OF TRADE.\n\n    Section 4(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. \n6(b)(1)(A)(i)) is amended by striking ``subject to comparable, \ncomprehensive'' and inserting the following: ``subject to--\n                                    ``(I) rules and restrictions \n                                prohibiting excessive speculation by \n                                governmental authorities that are \n                                comparable to the law, regulations, and \n                                orders applicable to boards of trade in \n                                the United States; and\n                                    ``(II) comparable, comprehensive''.\n\nSEC. 5.
