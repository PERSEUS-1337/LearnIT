FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the oceans have for millennia been a source of food, \n        minerals and other natural products;\n            (2) molecular biology and biotechnology hold tremendous \n        potential to expand the range and increase the utility of \n        products from the oceans;\n            (3) marine biotechnology can improve the condition of \n        marine ecosystems by developing substitute products that \n        decrease the harvest pressure on living resources, improving \n        the production of aquaculture, providing new tools for \n        understanding ecological and evolutionary processes, and \n        improving the techniques for remediation of environmental \n        damage;\n            (4) the United States is currently preeminent in marine \n        biotechnology but its competitive edge is threatened by \n        inadequate public investment compared with other leaders in \n        this field; and\n            (5) in order to support job creation, stimulate private \n        sector investment, and maintain preeminence in marine \n        biotechnology, the United States should establish a national \n        program for marine biotechnology within the National Sea Grant \n        College Program and greatly increase its investment in this \n        promising new area of research and development.\n\nSEC. 3. MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n    The National Sea Grant College Program Act (33 U.S.C. 1121 et seq.) \nis amended by inserting after section 205 the following:\n\n``SEC. 206A.
