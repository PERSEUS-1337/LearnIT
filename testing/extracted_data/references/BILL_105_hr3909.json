FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in the \n        State of Utah was established by the President on September 18, \n        1996, in Presidential Proclamation 6920 (61 Fed. Reg. 50223; \n        September 24, 1996).\n            (2) The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was \n        planned and its boundaries were drawn in secret, without the \n        type of public input that is generally conducive to sound \n        decision making.\n            (3) As a result of the lack of public input in the \n        development of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, \n        several parcels of Federal land were included within the \n        boundaries of the national monument that are not suited for \n        inclusion or that would better serve the public interest if \n        managed in another capacity.\n            (4) Certain parcels of Federal Land within the present \n        boundaries of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument \n        would better serve the public interest if ownership of the \n        parcels were transferred to the State of Utah or a local \n        government.\n\n SEC. 3.
