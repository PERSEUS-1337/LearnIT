FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) during periods of inflation, the United States has \n        experienced a deterioration in its potential economic growth;\n            (2) a decline in inflation has been a crucial factor in \n        encouraging recent robust economic growth;\n            (3) stable prices facilitate higher sustainable levels of \n        economic growth, investment, and job creation;\n            (4) the multiple policy goals of the Full Employment and \n        Balanced Growth Act of 1978 cause confusion and ambiguity about \n        the appropriate role and aims of monetary policy, which can add \n        to volatility in economic activity and financial markets, \n        harming economic growth and costing workers jobs;\n            (5) recognizing the dangers of inflation and the \n        appropriate role of monetary policy, political leaders in \n        countries throughout the world have directed the central banks \n        of those countries to institute reforms that focus monetary \n        policy on the single objective of price stability, rather than \n        on multiple policy goals;\n            (6) there is a need for the Congress to clarify the proper \n        role of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in \n        economic policymaking, in order to achieve the best environment \n        for long-term economic growth and job creation; and\n            (7) because price stability is a key condition for \n        maintaining the highest possible levels of productivity, real \n        incomes, living standards, employment, and global \n        competitiveness, price stability should be the primary long-\n        term goal of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n        System.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States \nthat--\n            (1) the principal economic responsibilities of the \n        Government are to establish and ensure an environment that is \n        conducive to both long-term economic growth and increases in \n        living standards, by establishing and maintaining free markets, \n        low taxes, respect for private property, and the stable, long-\n        term purchasing power of the United States currency; and\n            (2) the primary long-term goal of the Board of Governors of \n        the Federal Reserve System (hereafter in this Act referred to \n        as the ``Board'') should be to promote price stability.\n\nSEC. 3.
