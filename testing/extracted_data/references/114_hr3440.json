    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fusion Innovation Act of 2015''.\n\nSEC. 2. FUSION INNOVATION INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of Science of the \nDepartment of Energy shall establish a Fusion Innovation Initiative. \nUnder the Initiative, the Director shall issue a competitive, merit-\nreviewed funding opportunity announcement to solicit proposals for \nengineering designs for innovative fusion energy systems, including \nupgrades to existing facilities, which have the potential to \ndemonstrate net energy production not later than 7 years after the \nstart of construction.\n    (b) Application Requirements.--In order to be eligible to receive \nan award under this section, an applicant shall submit an application \nto the Director that includes--\n            (1) a detailed cost estimate and schedule for construction \n        of the design, including a summary of any design modifications \n        that would accelerate the achievement of net energy production; \n        and\n            (2) an assessment of the scalability of the design.\n    (c) Award and Design Submission.--\n            (1) Award.--The Director shall review each application \n        submitted under subsection (b) and shall provide awards to \n        applicants with design concepts that the Director considers to \n        have potential based on the criteria described in subsection \n        (a).\n            (2) Design submission.--As a condition of receiving such \n        award, the Director shall require any such applicant to submit \n        the design upon which the application is based to the Director \n        not later than 18 months after receipt of the award.\n    (d) Assessment.--The Director shall carry out an assessment of each \ndesign submitted under subsection (c)(2) to determine which designs, if \nany, merit support from the Department due to their potential to \ndemonstrate net energy production not later than 7 years after the \nstart of construction, and shall--\n            (1) submit the assessment to Congress not later than 30 \n        months after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n            (2) assign top priority to, and provide expedited financial \n        support (to the extent provided in advance in appropriations \n        Acts) for, relevant construction activities for any design that \n        the Director determines merits such support, based on the \n        project management practices of the Office of Science.\n\nSEC. 3. RESOURCE AND INFORMATION SHARING.\n\n    (a) In General.--To the extent practicable, the Secretary of Energy \nshall establish open, transparent processes to share unclassified \nresources and information that will accelerate the advancement of \nfusion energy technologies among researchers from the National \nLaboratories, institutions of higher education, and the private sector. \nSuch resources and information shall include--\n            (1) advanced computing platforms and simulation codes;\n            (2) diagnostic equipment information; and\n            (3) pulsed power system information.\n    (b) Computing.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish processes to \n        make unclassified, proprietary simulation codes relevant to the \n        development of a fusion energy system, that are controlled by a \n        National Laboratory, available to researchers from other \n        National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and \n        the private sector.\n            (2) Shared platforms.--The Secretary shall support shared \n        platforms for the codevelopment of simulation codes for fusion \n        energy systems among researchers from the National \n        Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and the private \n        sector.\n    (c) Personnel Exchanges.--The Secretary shall establish a process \nfor fusion researchers from the National Laboratories to serve limited-\nterm residencies at private sector companies working to advance fusion \ntechnologies. Such residencies shall be entirely supported by the host \ncompanies.\n\nSEC. 4. FUSION DEMONSTRATION SITES.\n\n    (a) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with \nthe National Laboratories, relevant Federal agencies, and stakeholders, \nshall transmit to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of \nthe House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources of the Senate a report assessing the Department of Energy's \ncapabilities to authorize, host, and oversee privately funded fusion \nprototypes with up to 20 megawatts thermal output and related \ndemonstration facilities at sites owned by the Department.\n    (b) Report Elements.--The report described in subsection (a) shall \naddress the following:\n            (1) The Department's safety review and oversight \n        capabilities.\n            (2) Potential sites capable of hosting research, \n        development, and demonstration of prototype reactors and \n        related facilities, for the purpose of reducing technical risk.\n            (3) The Department's and the National Laboratories' \n        existing physical and technical capabilities relevant to \n        research, development, and oversight.\n            (4) The efficacy of the Department's available contractual \n        mechanisms, including cooperative research and development \n        agreements, work-for-others agreements, and agreements for \n        commercializing technology.\n            (5) Potential cost structures related to physical security, \n        decommissioning, liability, and other long-term project costs.\n            (6) Other challenges or considerations identified by the \n        Secretary, including issues related to potential cases of \n        demonstration reactors with up to 2 gigawatts of thermal \n        output.\n\nSEC. 5. NATIONAL LABORATORIES.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``National Laboratories'' has the meaning \ngiven the term in section 2 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \n15801)."
