FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A 1987 study by the United Church of Christ found that \n        the proportion of minorities in communities with large \n        commercial landfills or a high number of commercial waste \n        facilities was 3 times greater than in communities without such \n        facilities.\n            (2) The same United Church of Christ study found that \n        approximately 60 percent of African- and Hispanic-Americans \n        live in a community that has an uncontrolled hazardous waste \n        site.\n            (3) An Environmental Protection Agency report released in \n        1992 found that racial minority and low-income populations \n        experience higher than average exposures to selected air \n        pollutants and hazardous waste facilities.\n            (4) A 1983 analysis by the General Accounting Office found \n        that, in the southeastern United States, 3 of the 4 commercial \n        hazardous waste landfills were located in communities with more \n        blacks than whites, and the percentage of residents near the \n        sites with incomes below the poverty line ranged from 26 \n        percent to 42 percent.\n            (5) A University of Michigan study released in 1990 found \n        that minorities were 4 times more likely than whites to live \n        within 1 mile of a commercial hazardous waste facility in the \n        3-county Detroit metropolitan area.\n            (6) A National Law Journal study found that penalties \n        imposed for pollution law violations in areas predominantly \n        populated by minorities were dramatically lower than those \n        imposed for violations in largely white areas.\n\nSEC. 3.
