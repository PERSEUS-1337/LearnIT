FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which struck the Gulf \n        Coast in 2005, caused almost $200,000,000,000 in total economic \n        losses, including insured and uninsured losses;\n            (2) while multiple reviews have been conducted to assess \n        the failure of each flood detection system and related \n        infrastructure since August 2005, Congress has yet to be \n        informed of definitive recommendations or specific proposals \n        for action;\n            (3) to the extent the possibility of another significant \n        flood protection system failure with the resulting devastation \n        and damage exists, a proper technical and investigative review \n        is needed; and\n            (4) the most efficient and effective approach to assessing \n        the failure of the flood protection system and subsequent \n        devastation is--\n                    (A) to establish a bipartisan investigation team of \n                experts to study--\n                            (i) the management, construction, and \n                        funding of levee, flood control, coastal \n                        reconstruction, and hurricane protection \n                        projects; and\n                            (ii) the means by which the Federal \n                        Government responds to catastrophic disasters \n                        and by which the Federal Government prepares \n                        and develops contingency plans and disaster \n                        preparations; and\n                    (B) to require the Investigation Team to timely \n                report the recommendations of the Investigation Team to \n                Congress so that Congress can quickly identify any \n                outstanding issues and determine a solution to protect \n                residents of the Gulf Coast in particular and the \n                United States in general.\n\nSEC. 3.
