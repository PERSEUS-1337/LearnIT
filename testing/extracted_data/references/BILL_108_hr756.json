FINDINGS. &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n\n    The Congress finds the following:&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (1) The use of children in the production of exploitive \n        child modeling, including on Internet websites, in photographs, \n        films, videos, and other visual depictions, is a form of child \n        abuse that can result in physical and psychological harm to the \n        children involved. &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (2) Exploitive child modeling is different from other, \n        legitimate, child modeling because exploitive child modeling \n        involves marketing the child himself or herself in lascivious \n        positions and acts, rather than actually marketing products to \n        average American consumers. &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (3) The purpose of exploitive child modeling is to satisfy \n        the demand of pedophiles. &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (4) Unlike legitimate child modeling, exploitive child \n        modeling may involve a direct and personal interaction between \n        the child model and the pedophile. The pedophile often knows \n        the child's name and has a way of communicating with the child. \n        &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (5) The interaction between the exploited child model and \n        the pedophile can lead the child to trust pedophiles and to \n        believe that it is acceptable and safe to meet with pedophiles \n        in private. &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (6) Over 70 percent of convicted pedophiles have used child \n        pornography or exploitive child modeling depictions to whet \n        their sexual appetites. Because children are used in its \n        production, exploitive child modeling can place the child in \n        danger of being abducted, abused, or murdered by the pedophiles \n        who view such depictions. &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (7) These exploitive exhibitions of children are \n        unacceptable by social standards and lead to a direct harm to \n        the children involved. &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n\nSEC. 3. EMPLOYMENT IN EXPLOITIVE CHILD MODELING. &lt;greek-th&gt; x \n\n    (a) Prohibition on Employment.--Section 12 of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 212) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n    ``(e)(1) No employer may employ a child model in exploitive child \nmodeling.&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n    ``(2) Notwithstanding section 16(a), whoever violates paragraph (1) \nshall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or \nboth.&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n    ``(3)(A) In this subsection, the term `exploitive child modeling' \nmeans modeling involving the use of a child under 17 years old for \nfinancial gain without the purpose of marketing a product or service \nother than the image of the child.&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n    ``(B) Such term applies to any such use, regardless of whether the \nemployment relationship of the child is direct or indirect, or \ncontractual or noncontractual, or is termed that of an independent \ncontractor.&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n    ``(C) Such term does not apply to an image which, taken as a whole, \nhas serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific \nvalue.''.&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n    (b) Oppressive Child Labor.--Section 3(l) of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n203(l)) is amended--&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (1) by striking ``(1) any'' and inserting ``(A) \n        any'';&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (2) by striking ``(2) any'' and inserting ``(B) \n        any'';&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (3) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(l)''; and&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n            (4) by adding at the end the following new \n        paragraph:&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n    ``(2) Such term includes employment of a minor in violation of \nsection 12(e)(1).''.&lt;greek-th&gt; x \n\nSEC. 4.
