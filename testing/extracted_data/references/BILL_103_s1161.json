FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) Toxic chemicals are being released in significant \n        amounts into the environment. Over three billion five hundred \n        million pounds of toxic releases were reported by approximately \n        nineteen thousand six hundred industrial plants in 1990, under \n        the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.\n            (2) Notwithstanding the benefits of the Emergency Planning \n        and Community Right-to-Know Act, many toxic chemicals posing \n        substantial health threats as a result of releases, are not \n        being reported. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-\n        Know Act excludes hundreds of chemicals listed as toxics under \n        various environmental laws including: sixteen hazardous air \n        pollutants, and five extremely hazardous substances listed in \n        the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments; one hundred and forty \n        chemicals regulated as hazardous waste under the Resource \n        Conservation and Recovery Act because of acute or chronic \n        toxicity; over two hundred chemicals identified as known or \n        probable human carcinogens by the EPA and the National \n        Toxicology Program; sixty-nine special review pesticides \n        identified under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and \n        Rodenticide Act and hundreds of restricted use pesticides; and \n        ninety reproductive toxins identified by the California \n        Department of Health.\n            (3) Although environmental and health data of toxic \n        chemical releases are not routinely collected and analyzed by \n        income and race, racial and ethnic minorities and lower income \n        Americans may be disproportionately exposed to toxic chemicals \n        in their residential and workplace environments.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES AND POLICIES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish and maintain information which provides an \n        objective basis for assessment of health effects by income and \n        race;\n            (2) to identify those areas with the largest releases of \n        toxic chemicals to the air, land, water, and workplace;\n            (3) to assess the health effects that may be caused by \n        emissions in those areas of highest environmental impact;\n            (4) to ensure that groups or individuals residing within \n        High Environmental Impact Areas have the opportunity and the \n        resources to participate in the technical process which will \n        determine the possible existence of adverse health impacts;\n            (5) to identify those activities in high environmental \n        impact areas found to have significant adverse impacts on human \n        health; and\n            (6) to incorporate environmental equity considerations into \n        planning and implementation of all Federal environmental \n        programs and statutes.\n\nSEC. 4.

If less than \nfive years of data are available the Administrator shall use available \ndata until further information is reported.\n    (c) Compilation of List.--(1) In compiling the list under \nsubsection (a), the Administrator shall consider and utilize all \nappropriate and available data compiled pursuant to any environmental \nregulatory authority and other sources, including available data on the \npresence of lead-based paint and toxic chemicals from mobile vehicles.\n    (2) For each county or appropriate geographic unit the \nAdministrator shall calculate and compile in a data base--\n            (A) the total weight of toxic chemicals released into the \n        ambient environment;\n            (B) the total weight of toxic chemicals released into each \n        environmental media (air, water, land, workplace); and\n            (C) the total weight of each toxic chemical released into \n        the ambient environment, and into each environmental media \n        (air, water, land, workplace);\nand whenever possible shall adjust the estimates of each of the items \nin subparagraphs (A) through (C) to account for the toxicity of the \ntoxic chemicals.\n    (3) Within six months after the date of enactment the Administrator \nshall review the methodology used to compile and summarize information \ncollected under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community \nRight-to-Know Act, and publish for public comment any proposed changes \nto the methodology necessary to calculate and compile the information \nrequired in paragraph (1).\n    (4) The Administrator shall revise and republish the list described \nin subsection (c) by the date that is five years after the date of \ninitial publication, and not less frequently than every five years \nthereafter, using data compiled during the preceding five-year period.\n    (d) Environmental High Impact Areas.--(1) Within twelve months \nafter the date of enactment, and every five years thereafter, the \nAdministrator shall publish a list of the one hundred counties or other \nappropriate geographic unit with the highest total toxic chemical \nreleases based on the list published in subsection (b). Such counties \nor other appropriate geographic unit shall be designated as \n``Environmental High Impact Areas''.\n    (2)(A) To ensure that facilities with the highest potential for \nrelease of toxic chemicals are operating in compliance with all \napplicable environmental health and safety standards, the \nAdministrator, and the Secretary of Labor, shall conduct compliance \ninspections of all toxic chemical facilities subject to their \njurisdiction in Environmental High Impact Areas within two years after \nthe date of enactment of this Act, and not less frequently than every \ntwo years thereafter.\n    (B) Notwithstanding the requirements in subparagraph (A), the \nAdministrator or the Secretary of Labor may authorize any state or \nIndian tribe which has been delegated authority to administer any \nFederal law regulating a toxic chemical which authorizes the inspection \nof toxic chemical facilities for compliance with applicable Federal \nenvironmental laws, to conduct such inspections in lieu of the \nAdministrator or the Secretary of Labor.\n    (3) Within twenty-four months after the date of enactment of this \nAct, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with \nthe Administrator, the Secretary of Labor, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, and the Commissioners of the United States Commission on Civil \nRights, shall issue for public comment a report identifying the nature \nand extent, if any, of acute and chronic impacts on human health in \nEnvironmental High Impact Areas from exposure to toxic chemicals. Such \nimpacts shall include incidence of cancer, birth deformities, infant \nmortality rates, and respiratory diseases. Such report shall include a \ncomparison of the health impact from exposure to toxic chemicals in \nEnvironmental High Impact Areas with other counties in the United \nStates. The report shall be coordinated by the Administrator of the \nAgency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and in coordinating the report, the \nAdministrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \nshall seek to--\n            (A) isolate the impacts of environmental pollution;\n            (B) segregate the effects of other factors such as health \n        care availability or substance abuse;\n            (C) rank the relative risks posed by the toxic chemicals \n        present in Environmental High Impact Areas and by the varied \n        sources of toxic chemicals both individually and cumulatively;\n            (D) take into account the need to remedy the impacts of \n        such toxic chemicals in high population density areas;\n            (E) evaluate the levels below which release of toxic \n        chemicals, either individually or cumulatively, must be reduced \n        to avoid adverse impacts on human health; and\n            (F) determine the impacts of maintaining toxic chemical \n        releases at the current levels.\n    (4) If the report under paragraph (3) identifies significant \nadverse impacts from exposure to toxic chemicals on human health in \nEnvironmental High Impact Areas as a group, the President shall submit \nto Congress within one year after publication of the report, proposed \nadministrative and legislative changes to remedy and prevent such \nimpacts, including--\n            (A) the addition of facilities or chemicals to be subject \n        to reporting requirements of the Emergency Planning and \n        Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, or a reduction in \n        threshold quantities of chemicals that trigger reporting \n        requirements under such Act;\n            (B) the regulation of toxic chemicals not subject to \n        Federal law based on a statutory or administrative exemption; \n        and\n            (C) the imposition of additional regulatory measures for \n        toxic chemical facilities in an Environmental High Impact Area, \n        such as emissions fees, source reduction requirements, or \n        restrictions on toxic chemical releases.\n\nSEC. 6. REDUCTION OF TOXIC CHEMICALS\n\n    If the report under section 4(d)(3) identifies significant adverse \nimpacts on human health from exposure to toxic chemicals in an \nEnvironmental High Impact Area, the Administrator shall promulgate \nregulations applicable to any Federal permit for construction or \nmodification of a toxic chemical facility in that area. Such \nregulations shall require a net reduction in the release of any toxic \nchemical determined to cause such significant adverse impacts on human \nhealth in that area.\n\nSEC. 7. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subject to appropriations, and in accordance with \nrules promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in \nconsultation with the Administrator, the Secretary may award a grant to \nany individual or group of individuals who may be affected by a release \nor threatened release of a toxic chemical from any toxic chemical \nfacility in an environmental high impact area.\n    (b) Grant requirements.--(1) A grant awarded under this section \nshall--\n            (A) be designed to facilitate access by representatives of \n        environmental high impact areas to the activities that involve \n        public participation under this Act and any other related law.\n            (B) be used to obtain technical assistance relating to the \n        inspection and review authorities described in section 4(d)(2) \n        and the study described in section 4(d)(3); and\n            (C) be in an amount not to exceed $50,000.\n    (2) Each grant recipient shall be required, as a condition of the \ngrant, to pay a non-Federal share equal to 20 percent of the grant \namount. The Administrator may waive the 20 percent contribution \nrequirement if the grant recipient demonstrates financial need to the \nsatisfaction of the Administrator. Not more than one grant may be made \nwith respect to each environmental high impact area for the period of a \ngrant (as determined by the Administrator). At the end of the period, a \ngrant may be renewed if the Administrator determines that the renewal \nis necessary to facilitate public participation.\n    (3) Grants under this subsection shall be considered to be grants \nunder section 117(e) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 as amended by the Superfund \nAmendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, and shall be funded in the \nsame manner."
