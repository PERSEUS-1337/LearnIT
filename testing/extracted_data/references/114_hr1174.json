    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement Access to Data \nStored Abroad Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 \n        (Public Law 99-508; 100 Stat. 1848) (referred to in this \n        section as ``ECPA'') was intended to protect the privacy of \n        electronic communications stored with providers of electronic \n        communications services and remote computing services, while \n        balancing the legitimate needs of law enforcement to access \n        records stored by such providers.\n            (2) To strike this balance, ECPA authorized governmental \n        entities to obtain certain categories of communications data \n        from providers using established, pre-existing forms of \n        process--warrants and subpoenas. It also created a new form of \n        court order, in section 2703(d) of title 18, United States \n        Code, that governmental entities could use to obtain additional \n        types of communications data.\n            (3) It has been well established that courts in the United \n        States lack the power to issue warrants authorizing \n        extraterritorial searches and seizures, and neither ECPA nor \n        subsequent amendments extended the warrant power of courts in \n        the United States beyond the territorial reach of the United \n        States.\n            (4) Nevertheless, Congress also recognizes the legitimate \n        needs of law enforcement agencies in the United States to \n        obtain, through lawful process, electronic communications \n        relevant to criminal investigations related to United States \n        persons wherever that content may be stored. Therefore, this \n        Act authorizes the use of search warrants extraterritorially \n        only where the Government seeks to obtain the contents of \n        electronic communications belonging to a United States person.\n\nSEC. 3. SCOPE AND CLARIFICATION OF WARRANT REQUIREMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 121 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended--\n            (1) in section 2702(a), by amending paragraph (3) to read \n        as follows:\n            ``(3) a provider of remote computing service or electronic \n        communication service to the public shall not knowingly divulge \n        to any governmental entity the contents of any communication \n        described in section 2703(a), or any record or other \n        information pertaining to a subscriber or customer of such \n        service.'';\n            (2) in section 2703--\n                    (A) by striking subsections (a) and (b) and \n                inserting the following:\n    ``(a) Contents of Wire or Electronic Communication in Electronic \nStorage.--A governmental entity may require the disclosure by a \nprovider of electronic communication service or remote computing \nservice of the contents of a wire or electronic communication that is \nin electronic storage with or otherwise stored, held, or maintained by \nthe provider only pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures \ndescribed in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case \nof a State court, issued using State warrant procedures) by a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction. Subject to subsection (b), a warrant issued \npursuant to this subsection may be used to require the disclosure of \ncontents of a wire or electronic communication that are in the \nprovider's electronic storage within the United States or otherwise \nstored, held, or maintained within the United States by the provider.\n    ``(b) Warrant Requirements.--A warrant issued under subsection (a) \nmay require the disclosure of the contents of a wire or electronic \ncommunication, regardless of where such contents may be in electronic \nstorage or otherwise stored, held, or maintained by the provider, if \nthe account-holder whose contents are sought by the warrant is a United \nStates person. A court issuing a warrant pursuant to this subsection, \non a motion made promptly by the service provider, shall modify or \nvacate such warrant if the court finds that the warrant would require \nthe provider of an electronic communications or remote computing \nservice to violate the laws of a foreign country.'';\n                    (B) in subsection (d), in the first sentence--\n                            (i) by striking ``(b) or'';\n                            (ii) by striking ``the contents of a wire \n                        or electronic communication, or''; and\n                            (iii) by striking ``sought, are'' and \n                        inserting ``sought are''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(h) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section or in section \n2702 shall be construed to limit the authority of a governmental entity \nto use an administrative subpoena authorized under a Federal or State \nstatute or to use a Federal or State grand jury, trial, or civil \ndiscovery subpoena to--\n            ``(1) require an originator, addressee, or intended \n        recipient of an electronic communication to disclose the \n        contents of the electronic communication to the governmental \n        entity; or\n            ``(2) require an entity that provides electronic \n        communication services to the officers, directors, employees, \n        or agents of the entity (for the purpose of carrying out their \n        duties) to disclose the contents of an electronic communication \n        to or from an officer, director, employee, or agent of the \n        entity to a governmental entity, if the electronic \n        communication is held, stored, or maintained on an electronic \n        communications system owned or operated by the entity.\n    ``(i) Notice.--Except as provided in section 2705, not later than \n10 business days after a governmental entity receives the contents of a \nwire or electronic communication of a subscriber or customer from a \nprovider of electronic communication service or remote computing \nservice under subsection (a), the governmental entity shall serve upon, \nor deliver to by registered or first-class mail, electronic mail, or \nother means reasonably calculated to be effective, as specified by the \ncourt issuing the warrant, the subscriber or customer--\n            ``(1) a copy of the warrant; and\n            ``(2) notice that informs the customer or subscriber--\n                    ``(A) of the nature of the law enforcement inquiry \n                with reasonable specificity; and\n                    ``(B) that information maintained for the customer \n                or subscriber by the provider of electronic \n                communication service or remote computing service named \n                in the process or request was supplied to, or requested \n                by, the governmental entity.'';\n            (3) in section 2704(a)(1), by striking ``section \n        2703(b)(2)'' and inserting ``section 2703'';\n            (4) in section 2705--\n                    (A) in subsection (a), by striking paragraph (1) \n                and inserting the following:\n            ``(1) A governmental entity that is seeking a warrant under \n        section 2703 may include in the application for the warrant a \n        request, which the court shall grant, for an order delaying the \n        notification required under section 2703(i) for a period of not \n        more than 90 days, if the court determines that there is reason \n        to believe that notification of the existence of the warrant \n        may have an adverse result described in paragraph (2) of this \n        subsection.''; and\n                    (B) in subsection (b), in the matter preceding \n                paragraph (1), by striking ``under section \n                2703(b)(1)''; and\n            (5) in section 2711--\n                    (A) in paragraph (3)(B) by striking ``warrants; \n                and'' and inserting ``warrants;'';\n                    (B) in paragraph (4) by striking ``thereof.'' and \n                inserting ``thereof; and''; and\n                    (C) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(5) the term `United States person' means a citizen or \n        permanent resident alien of the United States, or an entity or \n        organization organized under the laws of the United States or a \n        State or political subdivision thereof.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) data localization requirements imposed by foreign \n        governments on data providers are--\n                    (A) incompatible with the borderless nature of the \n                Internet;\n                    (B) an impediment to online innovation; and\n                    (C) unnecessary to meet the needs of law \n                enforcement; and\n            (2) the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and \n        the United States Trade Representatives should pursue open data \n        flow policies with foreign nations."
