FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In some general elections the majority of voters split \n        their votes between two similar candidates letting a third \n        candidate, supported only by a minority of the electorate, win \n        the election, thus denying the will of a majority of the \n        voters.\n            (2) In other general elections the majority of voters split \n        their votes between two dissimilar candidates, letting a third \n        candidate, supported by an even smaller minority of the \n        electorate, determine the election victor, and again denying \n        the will of a majority of the voters.\n            (3) The simple plurality winner system used in most general \n        elections for Federal office creates an incentive for \n        candidates to engage in negative campaigning.\n            (4) The principle of majority rule is violated when the \n        majority does not choose the winner of an election, and denies \n        the winner a mandate to govern.\n            (5) A simple solution to this problem of non majority \n        winners is to require the winner of an election to earn a \n        majority of votes.\n            (6) Instant runoff voting, as used in Utah Republican Party \n        primaries, Ireland, Australia, and London, requires the winner \n        of an election to earn a majority of votes. Voters rank \n        candidates in case their favorite candidate is eliminated, and \n        the votes of the candidate's supporters count for their second \n        choice in a runoff round. This process continues until one \n        candidate earns a majority of votes.\n            (7) By allowing voters to rank candidates, rather than \n        choose just one, candidates are encouraged to engage in \n        positive campaigning in order to receive a higher ranking from \n        their opponents' supporters.\n            (8) There is increased interest in instant runoff voting. \n        For example, the system has been approved for use by voters in \n        San Francisco, California, beginning with the 2004 municipal \n        elections. In 1999, the New Mexico Senate passed legislation \n        providing for a ballot measure under which voters would be \n        allowed to implement instant runoff voting for Presidential \n        elections. In Vermont, legislation to enact instant runoff \n        voting for statewide offices, including the Presidential race, \n        has been endorsed by Common Cause, the League of Women Voters, \n        and the Grange. Additionally, the legislatures of States such \n        as Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington in 2001 debated \n        legislation to enact instant runoff voting for Presidential \n        elections, and the Speaker of the California Assembly has \n        introduced a bill to implement instant runoff voting in \n        elections to fill vacancies in Congress.\n            (9) In order to conduct an instant runoff election, voting \n        equipment must be compatible with ballots that allow voters to \n        rank candidates.\n            (10) A majority of states currently conduct two-round \n        runoff elections in some of their statewide, county, and \n        municipal elections. Two-round elections cost the states \n        millions of dollars each year and result in severe drop-offs in \n        voter turnout. Voting equipment that is compatible with ranked \n        ballots will give states, counties, and municipalities the \n        option of saving millions of dollars and boosting voter turnout \n        by consolidating two-round runoffs into one election.\n            (11) Consistent with the national underinvestment in voting \n        equipment, much of the Nation's voting equipment is not \n        currently compatible with ranked ballots.\n            (12) There are currently no Federal mandatory minimum \n        standards for voting equipment. Although the Federal Election \n        Commission has promulgated voluntary standards, these voluntary \n        standards do not include compatibility with ranked ballots.\n            (13) The operation of our current voting and election \n        system is run by approximately 13,000 separate and unequally \n        administered voting jurisdictions.\n            (14) National polls have shown that the American people \n        support a voting system that is unitary.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIRING USE OF INSTANT RUNOFF VOTING FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS \n              FOR FEDERAL OFFICE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each \nState shall conduct general elections for Federal office held in the \nState during 2008 and each succeeding year using an instant runoff \nvoting system, and shall ensure that the voting equipment and \ntechnology used to conduct the elections is compatible with such a \nsystem.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this Act, the following definitions apply:\n            (1) The term ``Federal office'' has the meaning given such \n        term in section 301(3) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of \n        1971 (2 U.S.C. 431(3)).\n            (2) The term ``instant runoff voting system'' means a \n        system for the election of candidates under which--\n                    (A) runoff counts of candidates are conducted in \n                rounds;\n                    (B) voters may rank candidates on the ballot \n                according to the order of preference;\n                    (C) if in any round no candidate receives a \n                majority of the votes cast, the candidate with the \n                fewest number of votes is eliminated and the remaining \n                candidates advance to the next round;\n                    (D) in each round, a voter shall be considered to \n                have cast one vote for the candidate the voter ranked \n                highest on the ballot who has not been eliminated; and\n                    (E) the runoff counts are carried out automatically \n                at the time the votes are cast and tabulated.\n            (3) The term ``State'' includes the District of Columbia, \n        the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the \n        United States Virgin Islands.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANTS TO STATES TO DEFRAY COSTS OF ADMINISTERING INSTANT \n              RUNOFF VOTING SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Grant Program.--There is established a program \nunder which the Election Assistance Commission (hereafter in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Commission'') shall make grants to eligible States \nto defray the costs of administering an instant runoff voting system, \nincluding the costs of purchasing voting equipment, software, and other \ntechnology necessary for such a system.\n    (b) Plan for Program.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Commission shall develop and make public a \nplan describing the criteria to be used in the solicitation and \napproval of applications for grants under this Act and the criteria to \nbe used in overseeing the use of funds provided under such grants, \nexcept that under such criteria the Commission may not require a State \nto match any portion of the amount awarded as a condition of \neligibility.\n    (c) Eligibility of States.--\n            (1) In general.--A State is eligible to receive a grant \n        under the program under this section if it submits to the \n        Commission (in such form and manner as the Commission may \n        require) an application containing such information and \n        assurances as the Commission may require.\n            (2) Deadline for application.--The Commission may not \n        consider an application for a grant under this section unless \n        the application is submitted prior to the expiration of the 60-\n        day period which begins on the date the Commission makes public \n        the plan developed under subsection (b).\n            (3) Deadline for response.--The Commission shall approve or \n        reject an application submitted under this subsection not later \n        than 120 days after receiving the application.\n            (4) Criteria for rejection.--The Commission may not reject \n        an application submitted under this subsection unless it finds \n        that--\n                    (A) the equipment, software, or other technology \n                used to administer elections in the State is not \n                compatible with an instant runoff voting system; or\n                    (B) the State does not provide for appropriate \n                education for voters, poll workers, and election \n                officials in the use of an instant runoff voting \n                system.\n    (d) Cap on Amount of Grant.--The amount of any grant awarded to a \nState under the program under this section may not exceed the product \nof--\n            (1) the number of residents in the State at the time the \n        grant is awarded (based on the most recent decennial census); \n        and\n            (2) $12.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out the program under this section--\n            (1) $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n            (2) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2006 and \n        each succeeding fiscal year.\n\nSEC. 5.
