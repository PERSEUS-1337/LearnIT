FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1)(A) Since 1994, the United States has imported over half \n        its oil.\n            (B) Without efforts to mitigate this dependence on foreign \n        oil, the percentage of oil imported is expected to grow to all-\n        time highs.\n            (C) This reliance on foreign oil presents a national \n        security risk, which Congress should address through policy \n        changes designed to increase the use of domestically-available \n        alternative transportation fuels.\n            (2)(A) The importing of a majority of the oil used in the \n        United States contributes negatively to the balance of trade of \n        the United States.\n            (B) Assuring the Nation's economic security demands the \n        development and promotion of domestically-available alternative \n        transportation fuels.\n            (3) More widespread use of alternative-fuels vehicles will \n        help alleviate any adverse environmental consequences that may \n        result from the Nation's dependence on oil as a transportation \n        fuel.\n            (4) In order to encourage the purchase of alternative fuel \n        vehicles by individuals and businesses, the installation of \n        alternative fueling infrastructure by fuel suppliers, and the \n        use of alternative fuels in business and personal \n        transportation, tax credits are temporarily needed to make \n        buying and operating alternative fuels vehicles economically \n        viable compared with conventional fuel vehicles.\n            (5)(A) In the short-term, United States alternative fuel \n        policy must be made fuel neutral.\n            (B) Fuel neutrality will foster private innovation and \n        commercialization using the most technologically feasible and \n        economic fuels available.\n            (C) This will allow market forces to decide the alternative \n        fuel winners and losers.\n\nSEC. 3.
