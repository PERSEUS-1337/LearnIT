PROHIBITION ON IMPORTS OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL.\n\n    No spent nuclear fuel may be imported into the United States \nunless--\n            (1) the Congress by law has approved a repository or \n        repositories with the capacity to store or dispose of all spent \n        nuclear fuel generated by commercial nuclear reactors in the \n        United States and from atomic energy defense activities;\n            (2) the appropriate Federal agency or agencies have \n        licensed such repository or repositories for the purpose \n        described in paragraph (1); and\n            (3) the repository or repositories are operating.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL SECURITY EXCEPTIONS.\n\n    (a) Proliferating Countries.--The prohibition contained in section \n2 shall not apply to imports of spent nuclear fuel from a country if--\n            (1) the President determines that such country--\n                    (A) is not a country authorized to possess nuclear \n                weapons under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n                Nuclear Weapons; and\n                    (B) is known or suspected to be producing or \n                developing nuclear weapons; and\n            (2) the President so notifies the Permanent Select \n        Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and \n        the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate at least 30 \n        days in advance of the arrival of the imported fuel into the \n        customs territory of the United States.\n    (b) Samples.--The prohibition contained in section 2 shall not \napply to samples of spent nuclear fuel imported for testing and \nevaluation for national security purposes.\n\nSEC. 4. GUIDELINES BY PORT AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE SAFE SHIPMENT OF \n              CERTAIN MATERIAL.\n\n    (a) In General.--Any port authority may--\n            (1) through a public comment process, establish reasonable \n        guidelines to ensure that the unloading, transfer, and shipment \n        of spent nuclear fuel at or through a port under its \n        jurisdiction is conducted in a manner that protects the public \n        health and safety and the environment at, and in the vicinity \n        of, such marine port; and\n            (2) require that any such unloading, transfer, or shipment \n        be in compliance with such guidelines.\n    (b) Descriptions of Guidelines.--Guidelines which a port authority \nmay establish include, but are not limited to, the following:\n            (1) Workers must be properly trained (to the satisfaction \n        of any union representing such workers) in the handling of the \n        spent nuclear fuel.\n            (2) A comprehensive response plan covering spent nuclear \n        fuel (including containment in case of fire, spill response, \n        and other contingencies) must be in place before spent nuclear \n        fuel can enter the port.\n            (3) Local communities must be informed of the unloading, \n        transfer, or shipment of the spent nuclear fuel, as well as \n        possible consequences. The guidelines may include and, if \n        requested by local communities in the immediate vicinity of the \n        port over which the port authority has jurisdiction, or local \n        communities through which spent nuclear fuel would pass when \n        transported by rail or motor vehicle from the port, should \n        include, reasonable standards for storage or parking of casks \n        or transport vehicles carrying spent nuclear fuel and \n        prohibitions against the movement of spent nuclear fuel from \n        the port at certain times or under certain weather, traffic, or \n        similar conditions that could increase the exposure of the \n        public to radiation or increase the risk of an accident \n        occurring during the movement of the spent nuclear fuel.\n            (4) Radiation exposure levels for workers may not exceed \n        standards for public exposure previously established by \n        regulation.\n    (c) Relation to Other Requirements.--(1) Subsection (a) shall apply \nonly to guidelines that are more protective of the public health and \nsafety and the environment than other applicable requirements \nestablished under Federal, State, or local law.\n    (2) The existence or enforcement of any requirements under any \nFederal, State, or local law governing the unloading, transfer, or \nshipment of spent nuclear fuel shall not preclude or preempt the \nadoption or enforcement of guidelines established under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5. LIABILITY.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall affect the liability or indemnification \nof the port in the handling of nuclear materials.\n\nSEC. 6.
