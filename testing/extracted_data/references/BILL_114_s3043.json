FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In June 2014, an internal audit conducted by the \n        Department of Veterans Affairs found more than 120,000 veterans \n        waited at least 90 days for appointments for health care or \n        never received appointments.\n            (2) One year following such audit, and despite the \n        Department handling more appointments than in previous years, \n        reports indicate that the number of veterans waiting 30 days or \n        more for health care increased by 50 percent.\n            (3) In 2008, the Inspector General of the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs estimated that 18 percent of outpatient \n        appointment slots went unfilled because of patient no-shows or \n        because facility personnel did not refill canceled \n        appointments.\n            (4) Wait times are not unique to the Department of Veterans \n        Affairs. The average wait time in the private sector is more \n        than 18 days, but private sector hospitals and health systems \n        are now leveraging technology to eliminate wait times and \n        ensure that every available appointment is used.\n            (5) In June 2015, the Institute of Medicine of the National \n        Academy of Sciences called for a patient-oriented scheduling \n        platform that allows patients to self-schedule care online at \n        any time.\n\nSEC. 3.
