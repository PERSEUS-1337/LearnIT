        participant's behalf (or to elect to have such \n                        contributions made at a different percentage),\n                            (ii) the participant has a reasonable \n                        period of time, after receipt of the notice \n                        described in clause (i) and before the first \n                        elective contribution is made, to make such \n                        election, and\n                            (iii) the notice explains how contributions \n                        made under the arrangement will be invested in \n                        the absence of any investment election by the \n                        participant.\n            (4) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect on \n        the date of the
