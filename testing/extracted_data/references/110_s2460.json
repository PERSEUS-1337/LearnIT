    "content": "SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF MORATORIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RULE RELATING \n              TO THE FEDERAL-STATE FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIP UNDER MEDICAID \n              AND SCHIP AND ON FINALIZATION OF A RULE RELATING TO THE \n              TREATMENT OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION UNDER MEDICAID; \n              MORATORIUM ON THE FINALIZATION OF THE OUTPATIENT MEDICAID \n              RULE MAKING SIMILAR CHANGE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A proposed rule was published on January 18, 2007, on \n        pages 2236 through 2248 of volume 72, Federal Register, and a \n        rule purporting to finalize that rule was published on May 29, \n        2007, on pages 29748 through 29836 of volume 72, Federal \n        Register (relating to parts 433, 447, and 457 of title 42, Code \n        of Federal Regulations). This rule would significantly change \n        the Federal-State financial partnership under the Medicaid and \n        the State Children's Health Insurance Programs by--\n                    (A) imposing a cost limit on payments made under \n                such programs to governmentally operated providers;\n                    (B) limiting the permissible sources of the non-\n                Federal shares required under such programs and the \n                types of entities permitted to contribute to such \n                shares; and\n                    (C) imposing new requirements on participating \n                providers and States under such programs.\n            (2) A proposed rule was published on May 23, 2007, on pages \n        28930 through 28936 of volume 72, Federal Register (relating to \n        parts 438 and 447 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations) \n        that would significantly change the scope of permissible \n        payments under Medicaid by removing the ability for States to \n        make payments related to graduate medical education.\n            (3) Permitting these rules to take effect would drastically \n        alter the Federal-State financial partnership in Medicaid and \n        the State Children's Health Insurance Programs, undermine the \n        discretion traditionally accorded States, and have a negative \n        impact on States, providers, and beneficiaries in the following \n        manner:\n                    (A) Implementation of the rule regarding the \n                Federal-State financial partnership would force \n                billions of dollars of payment reductions, thus \n                hampering the ability of impacted providers to provide \n                essential services including allowing those providers \n                to be ready and available for emergency situations and \n                to provide care to the increasing numbers of uninsured.\n                    (B) Implementation of the rule regarding graduate \n                medical education would force billions of dollars in \n                payment reductions to teaching hospitals, thus \n                hampering the ability of those providers to provide \n                essential services including the education of the next \n                generation of medical professionals despite a shortage \n                of medical professionals.\n            (4) By including a one-year moratorium in the U.S. Troop \n        Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq \n        Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007, Congress intended to \n        forestall administrative action to allow itself time to assess \n        the proposals and consider alternatives that would not \n        negatively impact States, providers, and beneficiaries.\n            (5) After Congressional approval of the moratorium \n        contained in the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina \n        Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007, \n        the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on May 25, 2007, \n        submitted for publication its final rule, which was not \n        significantly different from the January proposed regulation.\n            (6) The publication of a final rule in May regarding the \n        Federal-State financial partnership was not anticipated by \n        Congress and accelerates the negative impact on States, \n        providers, and beneficiaries, thus undermining the intent of \n        the moratorium passed by Congress.\n            (7) The publication of a proposed rule in May regarding \n        graduate medical education was not anticipated by Congress and \n        undermines the intent of the moratorium passed by Congress.\n            (8) A proposed rule was published on September 28, 2007, on \n        pages 55158 through 55166 of volume 72, Federal Register \n        (relating to parts 440 and 447 of title 42, Code of Federal \n        Regulations) that would significantly change the scope of \n        permissible payments under Medicaid by redefining outpatient \n        hospital services and dictating methodologies for calculation \n        of the outpatient services upper payment limit.\n            (9) Congress did not anticipate continued changes after the \n        moratorium to reduce State flexibility to make adequate \n        Medicaid payments.\n            (10) Expansion and extension of the moratorium is necessary \n        to effectuate Congressional intent.\n    (b) Extension of Prohibition.--Section 7002(a)(1) of the U.S. Troop \nReadiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability \nAppropriations Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-28) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``1 year'' and inserting ``2 years'';\n            (2) by inserting ``or (D)'' after ``described in \n        subparagraph (A)'' in subparagraph (B);\n            (3) by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (B);\n            (4) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (C) \n        and inserting ``; or''; and\n            (5) by inserting at the end the following:\n                    ``(D) finalize or otherwise implement provisions \n                contained in the proposed rule published on September \n                28, 2007, on pages 55158 through 55166 of volume 72, \n                Federal Register (relating to parts 440 and 447 of \n                title 42, Code of Federal Regulations).''."
