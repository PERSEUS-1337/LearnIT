FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Competition among State and local governments for new \n        and existing businesses has become the rule rather than the \n        exception.\n            (2) State and local governments are being forced to compete \n        against each other for businesses with scarce tax dollars that \n        would otherwise be used for essential public goods and \n        services.\n            (3) When State and local government competition takes the \n        form of preferential treatment for specific businesses, it \n        undermines our national economic union by distorting the \n        allocation of resources.\n            (4) There is a role for competition between States and \n        localities when it takes the form of general tax policies, \n        regulation structures, and public services because such \n        competition leads States and localities to provide better \n        service, cost effective regulation, sound tax policies, and \n        more efficient allocation of public and private goods.\n            (5) Federal program grants have been used by State and \n        local governments to subsidize business location decisions to \n        attract businesses from other States and localities.\n            (6) Proceeds from tax-exempt municipal bonds have been used \n        by one State or locality to attract business from other States \n        and localities.\n            (7) No single State or local government can unilaterally \n        withdraw from this competition. Only Congress with its \n        enumerated powers can end the economic distortions and the \n        public costs caused by economic distortions.\n\nSEC. 3. TAXATION OF VALUE OF TARGETED SUBSIDIES PROVIDED BY STATE AND \n              LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n(relating to miscellaneous excise taxes) is amended by inserting after \nchapter 44 the following new chapter:\n\n    ``CHAPTER 45--EXCISE TAX ON TARGETED STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT \n                         DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDIES\n\n                              ``Sec. 4986.
