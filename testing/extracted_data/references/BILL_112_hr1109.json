FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A host of growing challenges--international security, \n        global markets, immigration, world health, the environment, and \n        the emerging educational and material aspirations of the \n        world's poorest people--are fundamentally altering the \n        international landscape.\n            (2) Rapid technological advances and the information age \n        are shrinking the world, exponentially enlarging access of all \n        peoples to essential knowledge, concepts, and ideas, and \n        connecting Americans to their counterparts across the globe.\n            (3) The diversity of American workplaces, schools, and \n        communities increasingly parallels the world's diversity.\n            (4) Americans, in the performance of their citizenship \n        roles, are required to make informed judgments about the role \n        of the United States in the world, as well as the impact of \n        other nations and world regions on the United States.\n            (5) The place of the United States in the world will depend \n        on whether teachers, citizens, and policymakers of the United \n        States understand how international events shape the lives, \n        politics, economics, and security of the Nation.\n            (6) American-based multinational corporations, as well as \n        small businesses, increasingly need employees with knowledge of \n        foreign languages and cultures to market products to customers \n        domestically and around the globe, and to work effectively with \n        foreign employees and partners in other countries.\n            (7) It is the primary function of the Nation's schools to \n        prepare America's students to meet the requirements of the \n        workplace and to perform citizenship roles in dynamic and \n        rapidly changing domestic and global communities.\n            (8) Recent surveys consistently demonstrate the illiteracy \n        of young Americans in geography, economics, and world history, \n        as well as the low priority university students give to \n        learning about other countries and cultures.\n            (9) Only rarely do American high school or university \n        students elect to study geography, world history, international \n        relations, or global issues, or to obtain fluency in a foreign \n        language.\n            (10) School curricula and university programs of study are \n        not adequately aligned to new international and global \n        realities.\n            (11) State educational agencies and local educational \n        agencies must be encouraged to include international education \n        competency as part of teacher credentialing and licensing.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to raise student achievement in world history and \n        cultures, international and global studies, and foreign \n        languages by increasing the international education competence \n        and literacy of elementary school and secondary school \n        teachers; and\n            (2) to support programs that supplement student educational \n        achievement in world history, international and global studies, \n        and foreign languages.\n\nSEC. 3.
