FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The highest regard should be given to the health and \n        safety of the members of the United States Armed Forces.\n            (2) Depleted uranium, a toxic, carcinogenic, and \n        radioactive material with a half-life of 4,500,000,000 years, \n        is used as an ingredient in various munitions used by the \n        United States Armed Forces.\n            (3) Depleted uranium munitions were used by the United \n        States Armed Forces in 1991 during the Persian Gulf War and \n        during the conflicts in the former Federal Republic of \n        Yugoslavia (Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro) during the \n        1990s, with approximately 300 metric tons of depleted uranium \n        being used during the Persian Gulf War, approximately three \n        metric tons being used in Bosnia, and approximately nine metric \n        tons being used in Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro.\n            (4) Among the characteristics of depleted uranium munitions \n        are that--\n                    (A) they are pyrophoric, resulting in the munition \n                burning upon impact with a target; and\n                    (B) the impact of a depleted uranium munition on a \n                target creates aerosol particles, which can be inhaled.\n            (5) The United States has provided or sold depleted uranium \n        and depleted uranium munitions to allied nations, and the armed \n        forces of the United Kingdom used depleted uranium munitions \n        during the Persian Gulf War.\n            (6) Depleted uranium munitions have been used at numerous \n        United States military installations, proving grounds, and \n        testing facilities.\n            (7) No definitive cause has been established for the \n        various illnesses (commonly referred to as Gulf War Syndrome) \n        that affect approximately 130,000 members and former members of \n        the United States Armed Forces who served in Southwest Asia \n        during the Persian Gulf War.\n            (8) The Iraqi Government has claimed that depleted uranium \n        from depleted uranium munitions is affecting the health of \n        their people, although such claims have not been independently \n        verified.\n            (9) The United States Navy and the British Royal Navy are \n        phasing out use of depleted uranium munitions, and the Canadian \n        Navy has ceased using depleted uranium munitions.\n            (10) It has been reported that depleted uranium munitions \n        use has proliferated to more than 20 nations.\n            (11) The 1949 Geneva Convention specifically outlines the \n        precautions warring nations must take to avoid harming civilian \n        populations, and it would be a violation of the 1977 Protocol \n        to that Convention to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary \n        suffering to civilians, as depleted uranium munitions may \n        cause.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n     The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide for studies of--\n                    (A) the health effects resulting from exposure to \n                depleted uranium munitions by inhalation, ingestion, or \n                injection; and\n                    (B) environmental contamination caused by depleted \n                uranium at sites where depleted uranium was used in \n                conflict, development, testing, or training and at \n                sites where depleted uranium and depleted uranium \n                munitions were produced; and\n            (2) to require the cleanup and mitigation of depleted \n        uranium contamination at sites of depleted uranium munition use \n        and production in the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. STUDY OF HEALTH EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO DEPLETED URANIUM.\n\n    (a) Study.--The Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and \nDisease Registry and the Director of the Center for Disease Control and \nPrevention shall jointly conduct a comprehensive study of the health \neffects of exposure to depleted uranium munitions on uranium-exposed \nveterans and on children of uranium-exposed veterans who were born \nafter the exposure of the uranium-exposed veterans to depleted uranium.\n    (b) Uranium-Exposed Veterans.--In this section, the term ``uranium-\nexposed veteran'' means a member or former member of the United States \nArmed Forces who handled, came in contact with, or had the likelihood \nof contact with depleted uranium munitions while on active duty, \nincluding members and former members who--\n            (1) were exposed to smoke from fires resulting from the \n        burning of vehicles containing depleted uranium munitions or \n        fires at depots at which depleted uranium munitions were \n        stored;\n            (2) worked within environments containing depleted uranium \n        dust or residues from depleted uranium munitions;\n            (3) were within a structure or vehicle while it was struck \n        by a depleted uranium munition;\n            (4) climbed on or entered equipment or structures struck by \n        a depleted uranium munition; or\n            (5) were medical personnel who provided initial treatment \n        to members of the Armed Forces described in paragraph (1), (2), \n        (3), or (4).\n    (c) Public Health Assessment.--The Directors also shall jointly \nconduct a public health assessment of persons who are thought to have \nan epidemiological link--\n            (1) to any United States military installation or facility \n        at which depleted uranium munitions have been, or currently \n        are, used; and\n            (2) any production facility in the United States at which \n        depleted uranium or depleted uranium munitions are currently, \n        or have been, produced.\n    (d) Report.--Not later than two years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Directors shall submit to Congress a report \non the results of the study under subsection (a) and the assessment \nunder subsection (c). The Directors shall include in the report a list \nof diseases or conditions that are found to exist within the \npopulations specified in subsection (a) and their rate of occurrence \ncompared to the general population.\n\nSEC. 5.
