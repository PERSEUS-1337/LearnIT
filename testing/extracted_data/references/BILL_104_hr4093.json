FINDINGS, DECLARATION, AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Expanded East Coast Plan of the Federal Aviation \n        Administration has resulted in significantly increased levels \n        of aircraft noise over New Jersey;\n            (2) over the past 30 years, and especially since the \n        implementation of the Expanded East Coast Plan, relentless \n        noise from aircraft departing from Newark International Airport \n        has adversely affected the residents of northwestern Staten \n        Island, New York;\n            (3) the Federal Aviation Administration has stalled, \n        obfuscated, resisted, and delayed any meaningful attempt to \n        mitigate the aircraft noise problem in New Jersey created by \n        the Administration through implementation of the Expanded East \n        Coast Plan; and\n            (4) the efforts of the Federal Aviation Administration to \n        mitigate aircraft noise levels on Staten Island have been \n        inadequate.\n    (b) Declaration.--Congress declares that the Federal Aviation \nAdministration should remedy the problem it has created, to the maximum \nextent practicable, by formulating and implementing plans to mitigate \naircraft noise over certain areas of New Jersey and Staten Island.\n    (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to compel the \nAdministrator to mitigate aircraft noise over certain areas of New \nJersey and Staten Island.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION IN AIRCRAFT NOISE OVER NEW JERSEY.\n\n    Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration \n(hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Administrator'') shall \ndevelop and publish, without compromising safety, a comprehensive plan \nto reduce aircraft generated noise in New Jersey by 6 decibels (yearly \nday-night average sound level) for at least 80 percent of the people \nresiding within 18 nautical miles of Newark International Airport, \nrelative to the noise values reported in the Federal Aviation \nAdministration document, ``Environmental Impact Statement, Runway 11 \nILS at Newark International Airport (September 16, 1993)'', and \nexcluding regions where aircraft-generated noise exceeds 65 decibels \n(yearly day-night average sound level).\n\nSEC. 4. REDUCTION IN AIRCRAFT NOISE OVER STATEN ISLAND.\n\n    Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the Administrator shall develop and publish a plan to investigate \nand test southbound departure procedures from runway 22 of Newark \nInternational Airport that will fully utilize, without compromising \nsafety, all of the allowable and available climbout airspace and that \nwill result in a minimum 25 percent decrease in aircraft noise on the \nground in northwestern Staten Island. The Administrator shall also \ninvestigate a straight-out southbound departure from runway 22.\n\nSEC. 5. OTHER MEASURES.\n\n    (a) Remediation Efforts.--The Administrator shall undertake such \nremediation efforts as may be necessary to mitigate aircraft noise \nwithin the sound level contour described in section 3 pursuant to part \n150 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.\n    (b) Nonapplicability of EIS Requirement.--In carrying out the \nactivities under this Act, the Administrator shall not be required to \nprepare an environmental impact statement in accordance with the \nNational Environment Policy Act of 1969 or any other law.\n\nSEC. 6. PROCEDURE.\n\n    (a) Standing.--In order to ensure compliance with this Act by the \nAdministrator--\n            (1) the New Jersey Citizens for Environmental Research, and\n            (2) a group to be designated by the Staten Island Borough \n        President,\nshall have standing in United States district court to compel the \nAdministrator to comply with this Act.\n    (b) Venue.--The venue for any such action shall be the United \nStates district court in Newark, New Jersey.\n    (c) Attorney's Fees.--\n            (1) Award.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n        Administrator shall pay court costs and reasonable attorney \n        fees incurred by the organizations referred to in subsection \n        (a) with respect to an action to compel the Administrator to \n        comply with this Act. Punitive damages may not be awarded.\n            (2) Limitation.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the judge \n        imposes a sanction under rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n        Procedure on an attorney, law firm, or party in the plaintiff's \n        case or if the suit is dismissed by a judge on a motion by the \n        defendants for summary judgment.\n\nSEC. 7. IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n    (a) Deadlines.--The Federal Aviation Administration shall begin \nimplementation of--\n            (1) the plan described in section 3 on or before 90th day \n        after the date of publication of the plan;\n            (2) the plan described in section 4 on or before 90th day \n        after the date of publication of the plan; and\n            (3) the plan described in section 3 or 4 on or before 90th \n        day after the date of any judicial order or settlement \n        agreement which is issued or entered into in response to a \n        civil action brought in accordance with section 6(a) and which \n        requires the implementation of such plan.\n    (b) Limitation.--No plan described in section 3 or 4 shall have the \neffect of reducing aircraft arrivals to or departures from Newark \nInternational Airport."
