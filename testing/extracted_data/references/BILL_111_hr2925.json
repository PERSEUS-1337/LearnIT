FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Two models of community programs for the uninsured have \n        emerged as effective in generating community support and \n        funding in urban and rural areas; in providing effective care \n        and coverage for the uninsured; in avoiding displacement of \n        private coverage; and in avoiding duplication of other Federal \n        programs for the uninsured.\n            (2) These community models have demonstrated community-wide \n        economic benefit. Employers in the community experience less \n        health care cost-shifting, in addition to increased \n        productivity and employee retention. With greater emphasis on \n        preventive and chronic care, a community's uninsured population \n        becomes less of a financial burden on State and local budgets.\n            (3) These community models have demonstrated potential \n        national solutions for certain uninsured populations, including \n        the working uninsured. Such lessons learned from these models \n        include, for example, the level of subsidy necessary to get \n        small employers to purchase coverage for their employees, how \n        to effectively market access programs to the uninsured, and how \n        to effectively manage chronic care among lower-income \n        populations.\n            (4) These community models have succeeded in raising much \n        of the funding necessary to function, but have lacked financial \n        stability and would enjoy greater success with a stable partial \n        funding stream from the Federal Government.\n            (5) These community models, if involved in a Federal \n        partnership, have the ability and willingness to be accountable \n        for a return on investment for Federal funding, and to \n        disseminate expertise to like-minded communities.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS FOR MULTI-SHARE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROJECTS FOR \n              UNINSURED WORKING INDIVIDUALS.\n\n    Subpart I of part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 254b et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 330M.
