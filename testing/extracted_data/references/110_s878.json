    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Oil Industry Merger Antitrust \nEnforcement Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) American consumers are suffering from excessively high \n        prices for gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and other energy \n        products.\n            (2) These excessively high energy prices have been caused, \n        at least in substantial part, by undue concentration among \n        companies involved in the production, refining, distribution, \n        and retail sale of oil, gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and \n        other petroleum-related products.\n            (3) There has been a sharp consolidation caused by mergers \n        and acquisitions among oil companies over the last decade, and \n        the antitrust enforcement agencies (the Federal Trade \n        Commission and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division) \n        have failed to employ the antitrust laws to prevent this \n        consolidation, to the detriment of consumers and competition. \n        This consolidation has caused substantial injury to competition \n        and has enabled the remaining oil companies to gain market \n        power over the sale, refining, and distribution of petroleum-\n        related products.\n            (4) The demand for oil, gasoline, and other petroleum-based \n        products is highly inelastic so that oil companies can easily \n        utilize market power to raise prices.\n            (5) Maintaining competitive markets for oil, gasoline, \n        natural gas, and other petroleum-related products is in the \n        highest national interest.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) ensure vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws in \n        the oil industry;\n            (2) restore competition to the oil industry and to the \n        production, refining, distribution, and marketing of gasoline \n        and other petroleum-related products; and\n            (3) prevent the accumulation and exercise of market power \n        by oil companies.\n\nSEC. 3. BURDEN OF PROOF.\n\n    Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) is amended by adding at \nthe end the following:\n    ``In any civil action brought against any person for violating this \nsection in which the plaintiff--\n            ``(1) alleges that the effect of a merger, acquisition, or \n        other transaction affecting commerce may be to substantially \n        lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, in the \n        business of exploring for, producing, refining, or otherwise \n        processing, storing, marketing, selling, or otherwise making \n        available petroleum, oil, or natural gas, or products derived \n        from petroleum, oil, or natural gas; and\n            ``(2) establishes that a merger, acquisition, or \n        transaction is between or involves persons competing in the \n        business of exploring for, producing, refining, or otherwise \n        processing, storing, marketing, selling, or otherwise making \n        available petroleum, oil, or natural gas, or products derived \n        from petroleum, oil, or natural gas;\nthe burden of proof shall be on the defendant or defendants to \nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that the merger, \nacquisition, or transaction at issue will not substantially lessen \ncompetition or tend to create a monopoly.''.\n\nSEC. 4. ENSURING FULL AND FREE COMPETITION.\n\n    (a) Review.--The Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust \nDivision of the Department of Justice shall jointly review and revise \nall enforcement guidelines and policies, including the Horizontal \nMerger Guidelines issued April 2, 1992 and revised April 8, 1997, and \nthe Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines issued June 14, 1984, and modify \nthose guidelines in order to--\n            (1) specifically address mergers and acquisitions in oil \n        companies and among companies involved in the production, \n        refining, distribution, or marketing of oil, gasoline, natural \n        gas, heating oil, or other petroleum-related products; and\n            (2) ensure that the application of these guidelines will \n        prevent any merger and acquisition in the oil industry, when \n        the effect of such a merger or acquisition may be to \n        substantially lessen competition, or to tend to create a \n        monopoly, and reflect the special conditions prevailing in the \n        oil industry described in subsection (b).\n    (b) Special Conditions.--The guidelines described in subsection (a) \nshall be revised to take into account the special conditions prevailing \nin the oil industry, including--\n            (1) the high inelasticity of demand for oil and petroleum-\n        related products;\n            (2) the ease of gaining market power in the oil industry;\n            (3) supply and refining capacity limits in the oil \n        industry;\n            (4) difficulties of market entry in the oil industry; and\n            (5) unique regulatory requirements applying to the oil \n        industry.\n    (c) Competition.--The review and revision of the enforcement \nguidelines required by this section shall be completed not later than 6 \nmonths after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (d) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of \nthe Department of Justice shall jointly report to the Committee on the \nJudiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House \nof Representatives regarding the review and revision of the enforcement \nguidelines mandated by this section.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Oil industry.--The term ``oil industry'' means \n        companies and persons involved in the production, refining, \n        distribution, or marketing of oil or petroleum-based products.\n            (2) Petroleum-based product.--The term ``petroleum-based \n        product'' means gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating \n        oil, natural gas, or other products derived from the refining \n        of oil or petroleum."
