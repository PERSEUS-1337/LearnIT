    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Act for Lyme Education and Research \nand Tick-Borne Diseases'' or the ``ALERT Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States alone has 82 species of ticks causing \n        at least 10 major diseases, which are Lyme disease, \n        anaplasmosis, human monocytic ehrlichosis, babesiosis, tick \n        paralysis, relapsing fever, tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted \n        fever, Colorado tick fever, and southern tick-associated rash \n        illness (STARI) (also known as Masters' disease). New tick \n        species continue to be classified, and new diseases continue to \n        emerge.\n            (2) Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease \n        in the United States today.\n            (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, only 10 percent of cases that meet its surveillance \n        criteria are reported; thus, an estimated 200,000 to 240,000 \n        new cases occur each year.\n            (4) Tests to detect serum antibodies for Lyme disease can \n        yield a high number of false-positive and false-negative \n        results. False-negative results may delay diagnosis and \n        treatment, which may lead to chronic, more debilitating, \n        persistent and costly disease.\n            (5) The diagnosis and treatment picture of Lyme disease and \n        other tick-borne diseases can be complicated because more than \n        one tick-borne disease can be acquired by the bite of the same \n        tick.\n            (6) If it is not diagnosed and treated early, Lyme disease \n        can lead to chronic illness and can affect every system in the \n        body, including the central nervous system. Diagnosis is \n        complicated because Lyme disease can mimic diseases such as \n        meningitis, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, Alzheimer's \n        disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, and psychiatric illness.\n            (7) According to a study by the National Institutes of \n        Health, patients with persistent Lyme disease suffer physical \n        disability equivalent to that of congestive heart failure, \n        severe pain equivalent to post-operative pain, and profound \n        fatigue similar to multiple sclerosis.\n\nSEC. 3. GOALS.\n\n    (a) Five-Year Plan.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nacting as appropriate through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health, \nshall establish a plan that, for the five fiscal years following the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, provides for activities to be \ncarried out during such fiscal years toward achieving the goals \ndescribed in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (b). The plan \nshall, as appropriate to such goals, provide for the coordination of \nprograms and activities regarding Lyme disease and other tick-borne \ndiseases that are conducted or supported by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Goals.--\n            (1) First goal: diagnostic test.--The first goal under \n        subsection (a) shall be--\n                    (A) to develop a sensitive and definitive test for \n                the diagnosis of Lyme disease capable of distinguishing \n                active infection from past infection;\n                    (B) to improve efficient utilization of diagnostic \n                testing currently available to account for the multiple \n                clinical manifestations of both acute and chronic Lyme \n                disease; and\n                    (C) to provide for the rapid evaluation and \n                adoption of emerging test methods.\n            (2) Second goal: surveillance and reporting of lyme disease \n        and other tick-borne diseases.--The second goal under \n        subsection (a) shall be--\n                    (A) to accurately determine the prevalence of Lyme \n                disease and other tick-borne diseases in the United \n                States;\n                    (B) to evaluate the feasibility of developing a \n                reporting system for collecting data on physician-\n                diagnosed cases that do not meet the surveillance \n                criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and \n                Prevention in order to more accurately gauge disease \n                outbreaks and incidence; and\n                    (C) to evaluate the feasibility of creating a \n                national uniform reporting system to include mandatory \n                reporting by laboratories in each State.\n            (3) Third goal: prevention of lyme disease and other tick-\n        borne diseases and complications due to delayed diagnosis and \n        treatment.--The third goal under subsection (a) shall be--\n                    (A) for the Director of the Agency for Healthcare \n                Research and Quality, in coordination with the Director \n                of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and \n                the Director of the National Institutes of Health, to \n                provide and promote access to a comprehensive, up-to-\n                date clearinghouse of peer-reviewed information on Lyme \n                and other tick-borne diseases;\n                    (B) to provide for public education by expanding \n                the Community Based Education Programs of the Centers \n                for Disease Control and Prevention to include expansion \n                of information access points available to the public;\n                    (C) to create a physician education program that \n                includes the full spectrum of scientific research on \n                Lyme and other tick-borne diseases; and\n                    (D) for the Secretary to sponsor scientific \n                conferences on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, \n                including reporting and consideration of the full \n                spectrum of clinically-based knowledge, with the first \n                of such conferences held within 24 months after the \n                date of the enactment of this Act and with further \n                conferences held as determined appropriate by the \n                Secretary.\n            (4) Fourth goal: clinical outcomes research.--The fourth \n        goal under subsection (a) shall be--\n                    (A) to establish epidemiological research goals to \n                determine the long term course of illness for Lyme \n                disease; and\n                    (B) to establish treatment outcomes research goals \n                to determine the effectiveness of different treatment \n                modalities.\n\nSEC. 4.
