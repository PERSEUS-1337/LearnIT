FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) assisting in meeting the essential needs of the United \n        States for adequate supplies of electrical products and \n        equipment is in the national interest;\n            (2) ensuring a uniform Federal scheme of regulation of \n        restrictions in the use of certain substances in electrical \n        products and equipment in interstate and foreign commerce is \n        crucial to the economic, environmental, and social well-being \n        of the people of the United States in the global marketplace;\n            (3) potential disparities among State laws and implementing \n        regulations that may be enacted by the several States regarding \n        the restriction of the use of substances in electrical products \n        and equipment could create barriers to interstate commerce, \n        domestic and foreign trade, and distort competition, and may \n        thereby have a direct impact on the establishment and \n        functioning of global markets; and\n            (4) technological and industrial innovation for electrical \n        products and equipment can offer an improved standard of \n        living, increased public and private sector productivity, and \n        creation of new industries and employment opportunities, while \n        providing for environmentally compatible production, use, and \n        end of life disposition of such equipment.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to enhance the economic, \nenvironmental, and social well-being of the people of the United States \nin the global marketplace by--\n            (1) ensuring efficient technological development and \n        innovation in the manufacture of electrical products and \n        equipment through the prevention of potential disparities among \n        State laws and implementing regulations that may be enacted by \n        the several States regarding the restriction of the use of \n        toxic substances in electrical products and equipment that \n        could create barriers to interstate commerce, domestic and \n        foreign trade, and distort global competition; and\n            (2) applying the regulatory and law enforcement process and \n        penalties of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 to \n        establish uniform Federal regulation and enforcement of toxic \n        substances in electrical products and equipment.\n\nSEC. 4.
