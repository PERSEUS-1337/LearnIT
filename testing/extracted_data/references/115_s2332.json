    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Kennedy-King Establishment Act of \n2018''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) on April 4, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was scheduled to \n        give a speech in Indianapolis, Indiana, during the campaign of \n        Mr. Kennedy for the Presidency of the United States;\n            (2) just before giving the prepared remarks, Mr. Kennedy \n        was informed of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, \n        Jr., before the news became widely known publicly;\n            (3) Mr. Kennedy changed the prepared remarks to inform the \n        large gathering of the death of Dr. King in a manner that \n        called for a nonviolent reaction to the violent death;\n            (4) the call of Mr. Kennedy for nonviolence in a moment of \n        unbearable pain helped temper the reaction of people in \n        Indianapolis to the assassination of Dr. King, such that, while \n        many other cities erupted in violence and rioting, Indianapolis \n        did not suffer riots or bloodshed in the days after the \n        assassination of Dr. King;\n            (5) the speech of Mr. Kennedy on the volatile occasion has \n        been described as one of the great addresses of the 20th \n        century, calling for unity in a time of great unrest;\n            (6) the heartfelt leadership of Mr. Kennedy and call for \n        nonviolence in the face of violence, prior to the assassination \n        of Mr. Kennedy, continues to be a model for people of the \n        United States;\n            (7) the park site at which the speech was held was \n        established in 1961 and has served the community as a gathering \n        place for social movements and engagement, which is the reason \n        why the site was selected as the location for the speech of Mr. \n        Kennedy;\n            (8) a memorial sculpture, known as ``Landmark for Peace'', \n        honoring Mr. Kennedy and Dr. King was erected on the site in \n        1994 to commemorate the events of April 4, 1968, and the \n        message of nonviolence taught by Mr. Kennedy and Dr. King;\n            (9) the improvised remarks of Mr. Kennedy to a stricken \n        community continue to resonate today and the site continues to \n        inspire social engagement with the words of Mr. Kennedy, ``Why \n        don't we make a monument to peace where all of us can live \n        together, not with walls coming up but with walls tearing down, \n        so we can go forward together?''; and\n            (10) the site of the speech given by Mr. Kennedy on April \n        4, 1968, should be preserved as a national treasure, and the \n        preservation of the site is most fitting on the 50th \n        anniversary of the speech.\n\nSEC. 3.
