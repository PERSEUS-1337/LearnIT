The Secretary shall thereupon appoint a panel of \n        arbitrators, composed of 5 members, 1 designated by each party \n        to the dispute, and 3 neutral arbitrators to be designated by \n        agreement between the 2 other members. If those 2 members are \n        unable to agree on the neutral arbitrators within 5 days after \n        their designation, the Secretary shall ask the American \n        Arbitration Association to submit within 3 days a list of 11 \n        arbitrators who are members of the National Academy of \n        Arbitrators and are qualified and willing to serve. At a \n        special meeting called by the Secretary, each member designated \n        by a party shall alternately strike a name from the list until \n        3 names remain, who shall be the mutually designated neutral \n        arbitrators. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise \n        interested in any organization of employees or any air carrier. \n        The compensation and expenses of the panel members shall be \n        fixed by the Secretary and shall be borne equally by each party \n        to the dispute. A panel shall be created separately for each \n        declared transportation emergency, and it shall investigate \n        promptly the facts as to the dispute.\n            ``(3) Required filings.--Within 10 days after the date on \n        which the 3 neutral arbitrators are appointed, each party to \n        the dispute shall file with the panel a document containing the \n        following:\n                    ``(A) The name, affiliation, and address of the \n                party submitting the filing.\n                    ``(B) A statement that the employee organization \n                involved is either certified or recognized.\n                    ``(C) The number of employees in the negotiating \n                unit, together with a list of the job titles \n                represented in that unit.\n                    ``(D) A statement of the currently applicable rates \n                of pay, rules, and working conditions.\n                    ``(E) A clear and concise history of negotiations \n                leading to the impasse, including the number and dates \n                of the negotiation sessions.\n                    ``(F) A list of all issues in dispute concerning \n                changes in rates of pay, rules, and working conditions \n                not adjusted by the parties in conference, and the \n                party's position on those issues.\n                    ``(G) The complete, written terms of the party's \n                final offer on those issues, including the text of the \n                party's proposed agreement on the changes in rates of \npay, rules, and working conditions.\n                    ``(H) A clear and concise statement of any other \n                relevant facts and any supporting documentation.\n            ``(4) Opportunity for presentations.--Within 15 days after \n        the date on which the document required by paragraph (3) is \n        filed by both parties, the panel shall afford each party an \n        opportunity to make oral and written presentations on its \n        filing and to respond to questions.\n            ``(5) Selection by panel; applicable factors.--Within 30 \n        days after date on which the document required by paragraph (3) \n        is filed by both parties, the panel shall, by a majority vote, \n        select either the offer in its entirety concerning rates of \n        pay, rules, and working conditions presented by the carrier or \n        carriers involved or the offer in its entirety concerning rates \n        of pay, rules, and working conditions presented by the employee \n        organization involved.
