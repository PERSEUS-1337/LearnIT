    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Strategic and Critical \nMinerals Policy Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the availability of minerals and metals is essential \n        for economic growth, national security, technological \n        innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply \n        chain;\n            (2) the exploration, production, processing, use, and \n        recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic \n        well-being, security, and general welfare of the Nation;\n            (3) the industrialization of China and India has driven \n        demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, sparking a period of \n        resource nationalism exemplified by China's reduction and \n        stoppage of exports of rare-earth mineral elements necessary \n        for telecommunications, military technologies, medical devices, \n        agricultural production, and renewable energy technologies;\n            (4) the United States has vast mineral resources but is \n        becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources;\n            (5) 25 years ago the United States was dependent on foreign \n        sources for 30 nonfuel mineral materials, 6 of which were \n        entirely imported to meet the Nation's requirements and another \n        16 of which were imported to meet more than 60 percent of the \n        Nation's needs;\n            (6) by 2010, United States import dependence for nonfuel \n        mineral materials more than doubled from 30 to 67 commodities, \n        18 commodities were imported entirely to meet the Nation's \n        requirements, and another 25 commodities required imports of \n        more than 50 percent;\n            (7) the United States lacks a coherent national policy to \n        assure the availability of minerals essential to manufacturing, \n        national economic well-being and security, agricultural \n        production, and global economic competitiveness; and\n            (8) the Nation's ability to compete and innovate requires \n        proper planning and preparation today to meet tomorrow's \n        mineral needs.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) In General.--It is the continuing policy of the United States \nto promote an adequate and stable supply of minerals to maintain our \nNation's economic well-being, security, and manufacturing, industrial, \nenergy, agricultural, and technological capabilities.\n    (b) Policy Goals.--Implementation of the policy set forth in \nsubsection (a) requires that the Federal Government coordinate the \nFederal departments and agencies responsible for ensuring that supply, \nto--\n            (1) facilitate the availability, development, and \n        production of domestic mineral resources to meet national \n        needs, including the demands of the Nation's manufacturing and \n        agricultural industries;\n            (2) promote and encourage the development of economically \n        and environmentally sound, safe, and stable domestic mining, \n        minerals, metals, processing, and minerals recycling \n        industries;\n            (3) establish an assessment capability for identifying the \n        mineral demands, supply, and needs of our Nation; and\n            (4) minimize duplication, needless paperwork, and delays in \n        the administration of Federal and State laws and regulations, \n        and issuance of permits and authorizations necessary to \n        explore, develop, and produce minerals and construct and \n        operate mineral-related facilities.\n\nSEC. 4. SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR REPORT ON ACCESS AND AUTHORIZATIONS \n              FOR MINERAL DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior, through the \nBureau of Land Management and the United States Geological Survey, and \nin consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture (through the Forest \nService Mineral and Geology Management Division), the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of Commerce, and the heads of other appropriate \nFederal agencies, shall prepare, submit to Congress, and make available \nto the public a report that includes--\n            (1) an inventory of the nonfossil-fuel mineral potential of \n        lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management \n        and the Forest Service and an identification of all such lands \n        that have been withdrawn, segregated, or otherwise restricted \n        from mineral exploration and development;\n            (2) an assessment of--\n                    (A) the mineral requirements to meet current and \n                emerging national security, economic, industrial \n                manufacturing, technological, agricultural, and social \n                needs;\n                    (B) the Nation's reliance on foreign sources to \n                meet those needs;
