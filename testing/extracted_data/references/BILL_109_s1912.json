FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the ongoing panzootic of highly pathogenic avian \n        influenza strain H5N1 in Asia and Eurasia is a threat to global \n        human health and the global poultry industry;\n            (2) the HPAI virus is capable of causing massive avian die-\n        offs, and response can easily involve the culling of tens of \n        millions of domestic poultry or domestic waterfowl, resulting \n        in significant economic losses;\n            (3) the fatality rate due to infection in humans may be 30 \n        to 50 percent or more;\n            (4) recent outbreaks in 2005 of H5N1 in waterfowl in \n        western China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Romania, and Turkey suggest \n        that the virus may have entered the Central Asian Flyway and \n        may consequently spread throughout central and southern Asia, \n        Europe, and Africa, as well as spanning the Arctic to reach \n        North America;\n            (5) it has long been known that wild birds are a reservoir \n        host for avian influenza viruses worldwide;\n            (6) the 1918 pandemic, the most lethal of the 3 pandemics \n        that killed over 40,000,000 people worldwide, was caused by an \n        influenza virus that initially jumped directly from birds to \n        humans and subsequently evolved an ability to transmit from \n        human-to-human;\n            (7) this precedent for an avian influenza virus to transmit \n        directly from birds to humans, then spread among humans, \n        significantly raises the concern about the current H5N1 \n        influenza strain;\n            (8) increased surveillance, including on migratory birds, \n        is critical to controlling avian influenza;\n            (9) the capacity to proactively detect the threats could \n        result in significantly improved disease prediction and \n        prevention capabilities;\n            (10) international wildlife health surveillance does not \n        clearly fall under the jurisdiction of any Federal or \n        international agency;\n            (11) there is a continued inability to share real-time data \n        across the human, agricultural, wildlife, and veterinary \n        agencies on zoonotic threats;\n            (12) while surveillance at domestic poultry and domestic \n        waterfowl production facilities and farms is an immediate and \n        on-going monitoring need and is being supported through \n        relevant agencies, surveillance in wild bird populations that \n        may have been exposed to the virus has now become a critical \n        component to determine the spread of the virus, implement \n        control measures, and protect human, livestock, and wildlife \n        health;\n            (13) monitoring and surveillance of wild migratory and \n        resident water birds are critically important to identifying \n        all strains of influenza viruses in wild birds as a library of \n        possible genotypes, determining their role in spread of the \n        virus, and anticipating where outbreaks may occur to enhance \n        preparedness; and\n            (14) improving surveillance of wildlife health around the \n        world would close significant jurisdictional and scientific \n        gaps in current global influenza preparedness.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a Global Network for Avian \nInfluenza Surveillance--\n            (1) to more rapidly and efficiently detect, verify, and \n        report on the presence of infectious diseases, such as highly \n        pathogenic avian influenza, in migratory birds and resident \n        waterfowl around the world;\n            (2) to use information on viral strains found during \n        surveillance of wild birds to better delineate any mutations in \n        the virus that may be detectable within wild bird populations;\n            (3) to use information on when and where HPAI and other \n        pathogens of concern are identified in migratory birds--\n                    (A) to better guide preparedness in the United \n                States and around the world; and\n                    (B) to carry out a comprehensive migratory bird \n                disease surveillance initiative that will provide \n                regions, countries, and specific locations with early \n                warning information that will help target resources \n                toward enhancement of poultry biosecurity and \n                surveillance, heightened public health vigilance, and \n                related areas;\n            (4) to create an open access database within which \n        information on HPAI and other pathogens of interest identified \n        in migratory birds can be shared as close to real time as \n        possible;\n            (5) to protect the health and safety of United States \n        citizens and officials traveling or living abroad; and\n            (6) to protect the economic interests of the United States \n        and its partners from threats to health, agriculture, and \n        natural resources.\n\nSEC. 4.
