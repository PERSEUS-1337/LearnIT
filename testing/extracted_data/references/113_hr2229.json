FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n        individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a Social \n        Security account number in order to pay taxes or to qualify for \n        old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under \n        title II of the Social Security Act.\n            (2) Many Government agencies and private entities also use \n        Social Security account numbers as identifiers to track \n        individual records or as information that an individual must \n        present to verify his or her identity. Thus, Social Security \n        account numbers are routinely collected, recorded, and \n        transferred by public and private entities.\n            (3) As an unintended consequence of these uses, Social \n        Security account numbers have become one of the tools that can \n        be used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the \n        privacy of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned.\n            (4) According to the Social Security Administration's \n        Inspector General, 16 percent of the 99,000 fraud cases it \n        investigated in the 1-year period ending September 30, 2006, \n        involved the misuse of Social Security account numbers.\n            (5) The Social Security account number is also a key piece \n        of information used in the perpetration of identity theft. In \n        calendar year 2006, over 240,000 individuals reported to the \n        Federal Trade Commission that they had been the victims of an \n        identity theft. Identity theft is a serious crime that can \n        cause substantial financial losses and force victims to spend \n        significant time restoring the accuracy of their credit \n        records.\n            (6) Social Security account numbers are publicly displayed \n        by some Government entities. In most jurisdictions throughout \n        the United States, State and local law requires that certain \n        documentary records, such as business filings, property \n        records, and birth and marriage certificates, be made available \n        to the general public. Some of these records contain personally \n        identifiable information of individuals, including Social \n        Security account numbers. Increasingly, State and local \n        recordkeepers are displaying public records on the Internet, \n        where these records are widely accessible at no cost or for a \n        minimal fee. There are known instances of criminals using \n        personally identifiable information from online public records \n        to commit identity theft.\n            (7) Private information resellers also routinely record and \n        transfer individuals' Social Security account numbers and other \n        personally identifiable information. In a 2006 study, the \n        Government Accountability Office (GAO) was able to purchase \n        truncated or full Social Security account numbers from 5 of 21 \n        Internet information resellers that were surveyed.\n            (8) The GAO has concluded, based on available evidence, \n        that unauthorized access to personal data such as Social \n        Security account numbers is a frequent occurrence. A survey of \n        17 Federal agencies by the Committee on Oversight and \n        Government Reform of the House of Representatives found that \n        these agencies suffered more than 788 data breaches from \n        January 2003 through July 2006.\n            (9) In many instances, public and private entities seek to \n        protect Social Security account numbers from abuse by \n        truncating a portion of each number. However, because \n        truncation methods are not uniform, it is possible to obtain a \n        full Social Security account number by reconstructing the \n        number based on partial information obtained from different \n        sources.\n            (10) In a report issued in June 2007, the GAO found that \n        truncated Social Security account numbers in Federal documents \n        stored as public records remain vulnerable to misuse, in part \n        because different truncation methods used by the public and \n        private sectors permit the reconstruction of full Social \n        Security account numbers. Federal entities such as the \n        Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the \n        Judicial Conference of the United States truncate by displaying \n        the last 4 digits of the Social Security account number. In \n        contrast, the GAO found that information resellers sometimes \n        sell records containing Social Security account numbers that \n        are truncated to display the first 5 digits.\n            (11) The first 5 digits of an individual's Social Security \n        account number are assigned based on the location in which the \n        account number was issued and the order in which the account \n        number was issued. The last 4 digits of an individual's Social \n        Security account number are randomly generated, creating a \n        unique account number for each individual. Many public and \n        private entities ask consumers to supply the last 4 digits of \n        Social Security account numbers as a way to verify consumers' \n        identities, providing an additional reason for identity thieves \n        to seek to acquire these digits.\n            (12) The GAO reported in 2006 that it had been unable to \n        identify any industry standards or guidelines for truncating \n        Social Security account numbers. Moreover, the GAO could not \n        identify any consensus among Government officials about which \n        method for truncation better protects Social Security account \n        numbers from abuse.\n            (13) The GAO has stated that standardizing the truncation \n        of Social Security account numbers would better protect these \n        numbers from misuse. Since 2005, the GAO has on multiple \n        occasions recommended the establishment of uniform standards \n        for truncation of Social Security account numbers.\n            (14) Given the Social Security Administration's role in \n        assigning Social Security account numbers, the Commissioner of \n        Social Security may be in the best position to determine \n        whether and how truncation should be standardized.\n            (15) The truncation of Social Security account numbers, \n        even by Federal Government agencies, is not comprehensively \n        required or regulated. Currently, the Social Security \n        Administration does not have the legal authority to regulate \n        the use of Social Security account numbers by other entities.\n            (16) Because the Federal Government created and maintains \n        the system of required Social Security account numbers, and \n        because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n        exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n        for the Federal Government to take steps to curb the abuse of \n        Social Security account numbers.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO ISSUE UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR THE METHOD FOR \n              TRUNCATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Commissioner of Social Security shall issue \nuniform standards--\n            (1) for the method for truncation of Social Security \n        account numbers in order to facilitate the protection of such \n        numbers from being used in the perpetration of fraud or \n        identity theft; and\n            (2) for the method for encryption (or other method of \n        securing from disclosure) of Social Security account numbers \n        transmitted by means of the Internet.\nSuch uniform standards shall not apply with respect to a Social \nSecurity account number of a deceased individual.\n    (b) Requirements.--\n            (1) In general.--In establishing the uniform standards \n        required under subsection (a), the Commissioner of Social \n        Security shall consider the matters described in paragraph (2) \n        and consult with, at a minimum, the heads of the following \n        Federal agencies:\n                    (A) The Department of Justice.\n                    (B) The Federal Trade Commission.\n                    (C) The Department of the Treasury.\n            (2) Specific considerations.--For purposes of paragraph \n        (1), the matters described in this paragraph are the following:\n                    (A) The extent to which various methods for \n                truncation of Social Security account numbers will \n                assist in the prevention of fraud and identity theft, \n                taking into account the following:\n                            (i) The risk that a truncated Social \n                        Security account number can be combined with \n                        other personally identifiable information to \n                        derive or acquire a complete Social Security \n                        account number.\n                            (ii) The risk that the numerical digits not \n                        masked in the truncation process will reveal \n                        personally identifiable information about an \n                        individual.\n                            (iii) The risk that a truncated Social \n                        Security account number can be used to derive \n                        or acquire from other sources a full Social \n                        Security account number.\n                    (B) The methods in use for the truncation of Social \n                Security account numbers by the Federal Government, \n                State and local governments, and private entities and \n                the extent of use of each method by the Federal \n                Government, State and local governments, and private \n                entities.\n                    (C) The reasons why Social Security account numbers \n                are collected and recorded by the Federal Government, \n                State and local governments, and private entities.\n                    (D) The effect of each proposed method for \n                truncation on the uses for Social Security account \n                numbers by the Federal Government, State and local \n                governments, and private entities.\n                    (E) Any comments regarding proposed methods for \n                truncation submitted to the Commissioner from--\n                            (i) experts on privacy and data security, \n                        consumer advocacy groups, and identity theft \n                        assistance organizations;\n                            (ii) the Federal Government or State or \n                        local governments, including State Attorneys \n                        General;\n                            (iii) representatives of private entities \n                        that transfer, display, record, or otherwise \n                        utilize Social Security account numbers on a \n                        regular basis;\n                            (iv) the Comptroller General of the United \n                        States; and\n                            (v) any other appropriate entities.\n\nSEC. 4.

GAO REPORT.\n\n    Not later than 18 months after the effective date of the \nregulations issued by the Commissioner of Social Security under section \n6, the Comptroller General of the United States shall report to \nCongress on the extent to which the uniform standards required under \nsection 3 have resulted in the adoption of such standards by private \nentities, and whether these standards are likely to provide greater \nprotection against fraud and identity theft than the practices adhered \nto prior to such date. The report shall include--\n            (1) a recommendation regarding--\n                    (A) whether such standards should be mandatory for \n                State and local governments and private entities, and \n                if so, under what circumstances; and\n                    (B) whether making such standards mandatory for \n                such entities (with respect to each circumstance \n                identified under subparagraph (A)) would help prevent \n                fraud, identity theft, and unauthorized access to \n                consumers' personally identifiable information; and\n            (2) recommendations for such additional legislation or \n        administrative action as the Comptroller General determines \n        appropriate to further reduce the risks of fraud, identity \n        theft, and unauthorized access resulting from the transfer, \n        sale, display, recording, or other utilization of Social \n        Security account numbers.\n\nSEC. 8.
