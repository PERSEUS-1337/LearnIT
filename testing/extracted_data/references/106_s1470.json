FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Agency for \n        Toxic Substances and Disease Registry believe that the \n        possibility of terrorist and criminal attacks on chemical \n        plants poses a serious threat to human health, safety, and the \n        environment;\n            (2) limiting public access to chemical accident information \n        does not address the underlying problem of the vulnerability of \n        chemical plants to criminal attack; on the contrary, providing \n        public access to chemical accident information may create \n        substantial incentives to reduce such vulnerability;\n            (3) there are significant opportunities to prevent criminal \n        attack on chemical plants by employing inherently safer \n        technologies in the manufacture and use of chemicals; such \n        technologies may offer industry substantial savings by reducing \n        the need for site security, secondary containment, buffer \n        zones, mitigation, and liability insurance;\n            (4) chemical plants have a general duty to design and \n        maintain safe facilities to prevent criminal activity that may \n        result in harm to human health, safety and the environment; and\n            (5) if the Attorney General determines that chemical plants \n        have not taken adequate actions to protect themselves from \n        criminal attack, the Attorney General must establish a program \n        to ensure that such actions are taken.\n\nSEC. 3. PREVENTION OF CRIMINAL RELEASES.\n\n    (a) Purpose and General Duty.--Section 112(r)(1) of the Clean Air \nAct (42 U.S.C. 7412(r)(1)) is amended by striking the second sentence \nand inserting the following: ``Each owner and each operator of a \nstationary source that produces, processes, handles, or stores such a \nsubstance has a general duty in the same manner and to the same extent \nas the duty imposed under section 5 of the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 654) to identify hazards that may result \nfrom an accidental release or criminal release using appropriate hazard \nassessment techniques, to ensure design and maintenance of safe \nfacilities taking such actions as are necessary to prevent accidental \nreleases and criminal releases, and to minimize the consequences of any \naccidental release or criminal release that does occur.''.\n    (b) Definitions.--Section 112(r)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n7412(r)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as \n        subparagraphs (E) and (F), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:\n                    ``(B) Criminal release.--The term `criminal \n                release' means--\n                            ``(i) a release of a regulated substance \n                        from a stationary source into the environment \n                        that is caused, in whole or in part, by a \n                        criminal act;
