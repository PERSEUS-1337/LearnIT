NANOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n    Chapter X of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n391 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 1013. NANOTECHNOLOGY REGULATORY SCIENCE PROGRAM.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of the Nanotechnology Regulatory Science Act of 2011, the \nSecretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, shall \nestablish within the Food and Drug Administration a program for the \nscientific investigation of nanomaterials included or intended for \ninclusion in products regulated under this Act, to address the \npotential toxicology of such materials, the effects of such materials \non biological systems, and interaction of such materials with \nbiological systems.\n    ``(b) Program Purposes.--The purposes of the program established \nunder subsection (a) shall be to--\n            ``(1) assess scientific literature and data on general \n        nanomaterials interactions with biological systems and on \n        specific nanomaterials of concern to Food and Drug \n        Administration;\n            ``(2) in cooperation with other Federal agencies, develop \n        and organize information using databases and models that will \n        facilitate the identification of generalized principles and \n        characteristics regarding the behavior of classes of \n        nanomaterials with biological systems;\n            ``(3) promote intramural Food and Drug Administration \n        programs and participate in collaborative efforts, to further \n        the understanding of the science of novel properties at the \n        nanoscale that might contribute to toxicity;\n            ``(4) promote and participate in collaborative efforts to \n        further the understanding of measurement and detection methods \n        for nanomaterials;\n            ``(5) collect, synthesize, interpret, and disseminate \n        scientific information and data related to the interactions of \n        nanomaterials with biological systems;\n            ``(6) build scientific expertise on nanomaterials within \n        such Administration, including field and laboratory expertise, \n        for monitoring the production and presence of nanomaterials in \n        domestic and imported products regulated under this Act;\n            ``(7) ensure ongoing training, as well as dissemination of \n        new information within the centers of such Administration, and \n        more broadly across such Administration, to ensure timely, \n        informed consideration of the most current science;\n            ``(8) encourage such Administration to participate in \n        international and national consensus standards activities; and\n            ``(9) carry out other activities that the Secretary \n        determines are necessary and consistent with the purposes \n        described in paragraphs (1) through (8).\n    ``(c) Program Administration.--\n            ``(1) Program manager.--In carrying out the program under \n        this section, the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of \n        Food and Drugs, shall designate a program manager who shall \n        supervise the planning, management, and coordination of the \n        program.\n            ``(2) Duties.--The program manager shall--\n                    ``(A) develop a detailed strategic plan for \n                achieving specific short- and long-term technical goals \n                for the program;\n                    ``(B) coordinate and integrate the strategic plan \n                with activities by the Food and Drug Administration and \n                other departments and agencies participating in the \n                National Nanotechnology Initiative; and\n                    ``(C) develop intramural Food and Drug \n                Administration programs, contracts, memoranda of \n                agreement, joint funding agreements, and other \n                cooperative arrangements necessary for meeting the \n                long-term challenges and achieving the specific \n                technical goals of the program.\n    ``(d) Reports.--Not later than March 15, 2014, the Secretary shall \nsubmit to Congress a report on the program carried out under this \nsection. Such report shall include--\n            ``(1) a review of the specific short- and long-term goals \n        of the program;\n            ``(2) an assessment of current and proposed funding levels \n        for the program, including an assessment of the adequacy of \n        such funding levels to support program activities; and\n            ``(3) a review of the coordination of activities under the \n        program with other departments and agencies participating in \n        the National Nanotechnology Initiative.\n    ``(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out this section, $15,000,000 for fiscal year \n2013, $16,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, and $17,000,000 for fiscal year \n2015.
