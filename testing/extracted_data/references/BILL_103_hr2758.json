FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of \n        approximately 45 percent in the last 3 years, on account of the \n        end of its subsidization by the former Soviet Union, the \n        extreme decline in trade between Cuba and the countries of the \n        former Soviet Bloc, and the policy of the Russian Government \n        and the countries of the former Soviet Bloc to conduct economic \n        relations with Cuba on strictly commercial terms.\n            (2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban \n        people has substantially deteriorated, and continues to \n        deteriorate, as a result of this economic decline and the \n        refusal of the Castro regime to adopt any economic or political \n        reforms that would lead to democracy, a market economy, or an \n        economic recovery.\n            (3) As long as no such economic or political reforms are \n        adopted by the Cuban Government, the economic condition of the \n        country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not improve in \n        any significant way.\n            (4) The Castro regime has made it abundantly clear that it \n        will not engage in any substantive economic or political \n        reforms that would lead to democracy, a market economy, or an \n        economic recovery.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY TOWARD A TRANSITION GOVERNMENT AND A DEMOCRATIC \n              GOVERNMENT IN CUBA.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to support the self-determination of the Cuban people;\n            (2) to recognize that the self-determination of the Cuban \n        people is a sovereign and national right of the citizens of \n        Cuba which must be exercised free of interference by the \n        government of any other country;\n            (3) to encourage the Cuban people to empower themselves \n        with a government which reflects the self-determination of the \n        Cuban people;\n            (4) to recognize the potential for a difficult transition \n        from the current regime in Cuba that may result from the \n        initiatives taken by the Cuban people for self-determination in \n        response to the intransigence of the Castro regime in not \n        allowing any substantive political or economic reforms, and to \n        be prepared to provide the Cuban people with humanitarian, \n        developmental, and other economic assistance;\n            (5) in solidarity with the Cuban people, to provide \n        emergency relief assistance to a transition government in Cuba, \n        and long term assistance to a democratic government in Cuba, \n        governments that result from an expression of the self-\n        determination of the Cuban people;\n            (6) that such assistance is intended to facilitate a \n        peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba and the consolidation \n        of democracy in Cuba;\n            (7) that such assistance be delivered to the Cuban people \n        through a transition government in Cuba, through a democratic \n        government in Cuba, or through United States, international, or \n        indigenous nongovernmental organizations;\n            (8) to encourage other countries to provide similar \n        assistance, and work cooperatively with such countries to \n        coordinate such assistance;\n            (9) to ensure that emergency relief is rapidly implemented \n        and distributed to the people of Cuba upon the institution of a \n        transition government in Cuba;\n            (10) not to provide favorable treatment or influence on \n        behalf of any individual or entity in the promotion of the \n        choice by the Cuban people of their future government;\n            (11) to assist a transition government in Cuba and a \n        democratic government in Cuba to prepare the Cuban military \n        forces for a new role in a democracy;\n            (12) to be prepared to enter into negotiations with a \n        democratic government in Cuba either to return the United \n        States Naval Base at Guantanamo to Cuba or to renegotiate the \n        present agreement under mutually agreeable terms;\n            (13) to lift the economic embargo on Cuba when the \n        President determines that there exists a democratic government \n        in Cuba; and\n            (14) to assist a democratic government in Cuba to \n        strengthen and stabilize its national currency.\n\nSEC. 4.
