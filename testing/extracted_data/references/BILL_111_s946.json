FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the critical electric infrastructure of the United \n        States and Canada has more than $1,000,000,000,000 in asset \n        value, more than 200,000 miles of transmission lines, and more \n        than 800,000 megawatts of generating capability, serving over \n        300,000,000 people;\n            (2) the effective functioning of electric infrastructure is \n        highly dependent on computer-based control systems that are \n        used to monitor and manage sensitive processes and physical \n        functions;\n            (3)(A) control systems are becoming increasingly connected \n        to open networks, such as corporate intranets and the Internet; \n        and\n            (B) according to the United States Computer Emergency \n        Readiness Team of the Department of Homeland Security, the \n        transition towards widely used technologies and open \n        connectivity exposes control systems to the ever-present cyber \n        risks that exist in the information technology world in \n        addition to control system specific risks;\n            (4) malicious actors pose a significant risk to the \n        electric infrastructure;\n            (5) the Federal Bureau of Investigation has identified \n        multiple sources of threats to the critical electric \n        infrastructure, including foreign nation states, domestic \n        criminals and hackers, and disgruntled employees;\n            (6) foreign electric infrastructure has been repeatedly \n        subject to cyber attack;\n            (7) the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United \n        States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack reported in 2008 that \n        an electromagnetic pulse attack could cause significant damage \n        or disruption to critical electric infrastructure and other \n        critical infrastructure, due to the widespread use of \n        supervisory control and data acquisition systems;\n            (8) the Control Systems Security Program of the Department \n        of Homeland Security is designed to increase the reliability, \n        security, and resilience of control systems by--\n                    (A) developing voluntary cyber risk reduction \n                products;\n                    (B) supporting the Industrial Control Systems \n                Computer Emergency Response Team of the Department of \n                Homeland Security in developing vulnerability \n                mitigation recommendations and strategies; and\n                    (C) coordinating and leveraging activities for \n                improving the critical infrastructure security posture \n                of the United States;\n            (9) in the interest of national and homeland security, a \n        statutory mechanism is necessary to protect the critical \n        electric infrastructure against cyber security threats; and\n            (10) on May 21, 2008, in testimony before the Committee on \n        Homeland Security of the House of Representatives, Joseph \n        Kelliher, then-Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n        Commission, stated that the Commission is in need of additional \n        legal authorities to adequately protect the electric power \n        system against cyber attack.\n\nSEC. 3. INVESTIGATION OF CYBER COMPROMISE OF CRITICAL ELECTRIC \n              INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n    (a) In General.--Pursuant to section 201 of the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121), the Secretary of Homeland Security, working \nwith other national security and intelligence agencies, shall conduct \nan investigation to determine if the security of Federally owned \nprogrammable electronic devices and communication networks (including \nhardware, software, and data) essential to the reliable operation of \ncritical electric infrastructure have been compromised.\n    (b) Focus.--The investigation under this section shall focus on--\n            (1) the extent of compromise;\n            (2) the identification of attackers;\n            (3) the method of penetration;\n            (4) the ramifications of the compromise on future \n        operations of critical electric infrastructure;\n            (5) the secondary ramifications of the compromise on other \n        critical infrastructure sectors and the functioning of civil \n        society;\n            (6) the ramifications of the compromise on national \n        security, including war fighting capability; and\n            (7) recommended mitigation activities.\n    (c) Report.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the \nappropriate committees of Congress (including the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity of the House of Representatives and the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee of the Senate) a report on findings of \nthe investigation, including (at the option of the Secretary) a \nclassified annex.\n\nSEC. 4. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n    Part II of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824 et seq.) is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 224.
