CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and \n        Preservation District is one of the most significant places in \n        the country dedicated to African-American history;\n            (2) the Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and \n        Preservation District receives the largest number of visitors \n        compared to any other historic site in the State of Georgia and \n        is the 3rd most visited historic site in the National Park \n        Service in the country;\n            (3) the lack of a comprehensive, international context \n        within which to interpret African-American history and culture \n        impedes the ability of all Americans, particularly African-\n        Americans, to understand themselves and their relationship to \n        America's past and its future;\n            (4) African-American history is complex and requires the \n        integration of diverse experiences of African-Americans ranging \n        from slavery and freedom--to cultural, scientific and athletic \n        endeavors, through the continued struggles for full \n        participation in our society--to reinforce the positive self-\n        image of African-Americans and to develop pride in their past \n        and hope for their future;\n            (5) the expansion of a national museum on African-American \n        history and culture, which will include a wide array of \n        collections from an eclectic group of African-Americans, will \n        help all Americans, and those who visit our country from \n        abroad, better understand and appreciate the significant \n        contributions made by African-Americans to American as well as \n        world history;\n            (6) the African-American Panoramic Experience Museum is \n        located in Atlanta, Georgia, at the gateway to and part of the \n        Martin Luther King, Junior, Historic Site and Preservation \n        District.
