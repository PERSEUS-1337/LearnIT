FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The average American child watches 8,000 murders and \n        100,000 acts of violence on television before finishing \n        elementary school.\n            (2) Many of the poorest and potentially most vulnerable \n        groups in our society are the heaviest viewers of television.\n            (3) Television violence is often presented without context \n        or judgment as to its acceptability.\n            (4) Most of the violence on television is presented during \n        times when children are likely to be viewing.\n            (5) The 1972 Surgeon General's Report, Television and \n        Growing Up: The Impact of Televised Violence, found that there \n        was a significant and consistent correlation between television \n        viewing and aggressive behavior and a direct, causal link \n        between exposure to televised violence and subsequent \n        aggressive behavior on the part of the viewer.\n            (6) The 1982 National Institute of Mental Health report, \n        Television and Behavior: Ten Years of Scientific Progress and \n        Implications for the Eighties, found that ``violence on \n        television does lead to aggressive behavior by children and \n        teenagers who watch the programs,'' and that some viewers learn \n        to be passive victims.\n            (7) Numerous other studies establish a causal connection \n        between watching violence on television and increasingly \n        violent behavior of children.\n            (8) There has been a proliferation of television talk shows \n        that, in a race for ratings, air ever more outrageous programs \n        dealing with rape, incest, and other sensitive topics in a \n        manner that seeks to sensationalize and shock rather than \n        educate and inform. Although the impact on the hundreds of \n        thousands of children who view these programs has yet to be \n        fully documented, the programs have raised strong concerns \n        among psychologists.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT.\n\n    Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by adding at \nthe end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 714. COMPILATION AND PUBLICATION OF COMPLAINTS CONCERNING \n              VIOLENT PROGRAMMING.\n\n    ``(a) Establishment of Facility for the Collection of Comments and \nComplaints.--The Commission shall, within 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this section, establish a toll-free number for the \ncollection of comments, suggestions, and complaints from the public \nconcerning the transmission by broadcast stations or cable systems of \nprogramming containing depictions of violence and other patently \noffensive material. The Commission shall take such steps as may be \nnecessary to publicize such number and the Commission's functions under \nthis section.\n    ``(b) Publication of Data Concerning Complaints.--The Commission \nshall publish in the Federal Register, on a quarterly basis, a summary \nof the comments, suggestions, and complaints received pursuant to \nsubsection (a) during the preceding period.
