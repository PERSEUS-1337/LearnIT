FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Together, the misuse of heroin and opioids account for \n        approximately 25,000 deaths in the United States per year.\n            (2) Drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in \n        the United States in 2013, and among people 25 to 64 years old, \n        drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle fatalities \n        in 2013.\n            (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, in the United States, fatal opioid-related drug \n        overdose rates have more than quadrupled since 1990 and have \n        never been higher. Each day in the United States, 46 people die \n        from an overdose of prescription painkillers. Nearly 2,000,000 \n        Americans aged 12 or older either abused or were dependent on \n        opioids in 2013.\n            (4) Naloxone is a safe and effective antidote to all \n        opioid-related overdoses, including heroin and fentanyl, and is \n        a critical tool in preventing fatal opioid overdoses in both \n        health care and at-home settings.\n            (5) The opioid overdose antidote naloxone has reversed more \n        than 26,000 overdose cases between 1996 and 2014, according to \n        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSEC. 3.
