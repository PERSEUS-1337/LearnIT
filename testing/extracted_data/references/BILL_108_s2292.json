FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Acts of anti-Semitism in countries throughout the world, \n    including some of the world's strongest democracies, have increased \n    significantly in frequency and scope over the last several years.\n        (2) During the last 3 months of 2003 and the first 3 months of \n    2004, there were numerous instances of anti-Semitic violence around \n    the world, including the following incidents:\n            (A) In Putrajaya, Malaysia, on October 16, 2003, former \n        Prime Minister Mahatir Mohammad told the 57 national leaders \n        assembled for the Organization of the Islamic Conference that \n        Jews ``rule the world by proxy'', and called for a ``final \n        victory'' by the world's 1.3 billion Muslims, who, he said, \n        ``cannot be defeated by a few million Jews.''.\n            (B) In Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15, 2003, simultaneous \n        car bombs exploded outside two synagogues filled with \n        worshippers, killing 24 people and wounding more than 250 \n        people.\n            (C) In Australia on January 5, 2004, poison was used to \n        ignite, and burn anti-Semitic slogans into, the lawns of the \n        Parliament House in the state of Tasmania.\n            (D) In St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 15, 2004, \n        vandals desecrated approximately 50 gravestones in a Jewish \n        cemetery, painting the stones with swastikas and anti-Semitic \n        graffiti.\n            (E) In Toronto, Canada, over the weekend of March 19 \n        through March 21, 2004, vandals attacked a Jewish school, a \n        Jewish cemetery, and area synagogues, painting swastikas and \n        anti-Semitic slogans on the walls of a synagogue and on \n        residential property in a nearby, predominantly Jewish, \n        neighborhood.\n            (F) In Toulon, France, on March 23, 2004, a Jewish \n        synagogue and community center were set on fire.\n        (3) Anti-Semitism in old and new forms is also increasingly \n    emanating from the Arab and Muslim world on a sustained basis, \n    including through books published by government-owned publishing \n    houses in Egypt and other Arab countries.\n        (4) In November 2002, state-run television in Egypt broadcast \n    the anti-Semitic series entitled ``Horseman Without a Horse'', \n    which is based upon the fictitious conspiracy theory known as the \n    Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The Protocols have been used \n    throughout the last century by despots such as Adolf Hitler to \n    justify violence against Jews.\n        (5) In November 2003, Arab television featured an anti-Semitic \n    series, entitled ``Ash-Shatat'' (or ``The Diaspora''), which \n    depicts Jewish people hatching a plot for Jewish control of the \n    world.\n        (6) The sharp rise in anti-Semitic violence has caused \n    international organizations such as the Organization for Security \n    and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elevate, and bring renewed \n    focus to, the issue, including the convening by the OSCE in June \n    2003 of a conference in Vienna dedicated solely to the issue of \n    anti-Semitism.\n        (7) The OSCE convened a conference again on April 28-29, 2004, \n    in Berlin, to address the problem of anti-Semitism with the United \n    States delegation led by former Mayor of New York City, Ed Koch.\n        (8) The United States Government has strongly supported efforts \n    to address anti-Semitism through bilateral relationships and \n    interaction with international organizations such as the OSCE, the \n    European Union, and the United Nations.\n        (9) Congress has consistently supported efforts to address the \n    rise in anti-Semitic violence. During the 107th Congress, both the \n    Senate and the House of Representatives passed resolutions \n    expressing strong concern with the sharp escalation of anti-Semitic \n    violence in Europe and calling on the Department of State to \n    thoroughly document the phenomenon.\n        (10) Anti-Semitism has at times taken the form of vilification \n    of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and incitement against \n    Israel.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n     It is the sense of Congress that--\n        (1) the United States Government should continue to strongly \n    support efforts to combat anti-Semitism worldwide through bilateral \n    relationships and interaction with international organizations such \n    as the OSCE, the European Union, and the United Nations; and\n        (2) the Department of State should thoroughly document acts of \n    anti-Semitism that occur around the world.\n\nSEC. 4. REPORTS.\n\n    Not later than November 15, 2004, the Secretary of State shall \nsubmit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \nCommittee on International Relations of the House of Representatives a \none-time report on acts of anti-Semitism around the world, including a \ndescription of--\n        (1) acts of physical violence against, or harassment\n    of, Jewish people, and acts of violence against, or vandalism of, \n    Jewish community institutions, such as schools, synagogues, or \n    cemeteries, that occurred in each country;\n        (2) the responses of the governments of those countries to such \n    actions;\n        (3) the actions taken by such governments to enact and enforce \n    laws relating to the protection of the right to religious freedom \n    of Jewish people;\n        (4) the efforts by such governments to promote anti-bias and \n    tolerance education; and\n        (5) instances of propaganda in government and nongovernment \n    media that attempt to justify or promote racial hatred or incite \n    acts of violence against Jewish people.\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE TO MONITOR AND COMBAT \nANTI-SEMITISM.\n    The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is amended by \nadding after section 58 (22 U.S.C. 2730) the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 59.
