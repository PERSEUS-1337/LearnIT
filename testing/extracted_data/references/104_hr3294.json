FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Principle 9 of the Declaration of the Rights of the \n        Child proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on \n        November 20, 1959, states that ``. . .the child shall not be \n        admitted to employment before an appropriate minimum age; he \n        shall in no case be caused or permitted to engage in any \n        occupation or employment which would prejudice his health or \n        education, or interfere with his physical, mental, or moral \n        development. . .''.\n            (2) Article 2 of the International Labor Convention No. 138 \n        Concerning Minimum Age For Admission to Employment states that \n        ``The minimum age specified in pursuance of paragraph 1 of this \n        article shall not be less than the age of compulsory schooling \n        and, in any case, shall not be less than 15 years.''.\n            (3) According to the International Labor Organization, an \n        estimated 200,000,000 children under the age of 15 are working \n        in the world, many in dangerous industries like mining and \n        fireworks.\n            (4) Children under the age of 15 constitute approximately \n        11 percent of the workforce in some Asian countries, 17 percent \n        of the workforce in parts of Africa, and a reported 12 to 26 \n        percent of the workforce in many countries in Latin America.\n            (5) The number of children under the age of 15 who are \n        working, and the scale of their suffering, increases every \n        year, despite the existence of more than 20 international labor \n        organization conventions on child labor and laws in many \n        countries which purportedly prohibit the employment of underage \n        children.\n            (6) In many countries, children under the age of 15 lack \n        either the legal standing or means to protect themselves from \n        exploitation in the workplace.\n            (7) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n        countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is attributable \n        to unemployment and underemployment, precarious incomes, low \n        living standards, and insufficient education and training \n        opportunities among adult workers.\n            (8) The employment of children under the age of 15 commonly \n        deprives such children of the opportunity for basic education \n        and also denies gainful employment to millions of adults.\n            (9) The employment of children under the age of 15, often \n        at drastically low wages, undermines the stability of families \n        and ignores the importance of increasing jobs, aggregated \n        demand, and purchasing power among adults as a catalyst to the \n        development of internal markets and the achievement of broad-\nbased, self-reliant economic development in many developing countries.\n\nSEC. 3.
