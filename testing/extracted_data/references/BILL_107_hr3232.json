FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the three Presidential elections since 1988, most \n        States have awarded their electoral votes to a candidate who \n        earned less than half the popular vote in that State.\n            (2) In many elections, the majority of voters split their \n        votes between two similar candidates, letting a third candidate \n        supported by only a minority of the electorate win the \n        election.\n            (3) The principle of majority rule is violated when the \n        majority does not choose the winner of an election.\n            (4) A simple solution to this problem of non majority \n        winners is to require the winner of an election to earn a \n        majority of votes.\n            (5) Instant runoff voting, as used in Ireland, Australia, \n        and London, requires the winner of an election to earn a \n        majority of votes. Voters rank candidates in case their \n        favorite candidate is eliminated, and the votes of the \n        candidate's supporters count for their second choice in a \n        runoff round. This process continues until one candidate earns \n        a majority of votes.\n            (6) There is increased interest in instant runoff voting. \n        For example, Alaskans in 2002 will vote on whether to adopt \n        instant runoff voting for Presidential elections in 2004. In \n        1999, the New Mexico Senate passed legislation providing for a \n        ballot measure under which voters would be allowed to implement \n        instant runoff voting for Presidential elections. In Vermont, \n        legislation to enact instant runoff voting for statewide \n        offices, including the Presidential race, has been endorsed by \n        Common Cause, the League of Women Voters, and the Grange. \n        Additionally, the legislatures of States such as Maine, \n        Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington in 2001 debated legislation \n        to enact instant runoff voting for Presidential elections, and \n        the Speaker of the California Assembly has introduced a bill to \n        implement instant runoff voting in elections to fill vacancies \n        in Congress.\n            (7) In order to conduct an instant runoff election, voting \n        equipment must be compatible with ranked ballots.\n            (8) Consistent with the national underinvestment in voting \n        equipment, much of the Nation's voting equipment is not \n        currently compatible with ranked ballots.\n            (9) There are currently no Federal mandatory minimum \n        standards for voting equipment. Although the Federal Election \n        Commission has promulgated voluntary standards, these voluntary \n        standards do not include compatibility with ranked ballots.\n\nSEC. 3. FUNDING FOR STATES IMPLEMENTING INSTANT RUNOFF VOTING FOR \n              PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Grant Program.--There is established a program \nunder which the Federal Election Commission (hereafter in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Commission'') shall make grants to eligible States \nwhich have adopted an instant runoff voting system for presidential \nelections to defray the costs of administering such a system, including \nthe costs of purchasing voting equipment, software, and other \ntechnology necessary for such a system.\n    (b) Plan for Program.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Commission shall develop and make public a \nplan describing the criteria to be used in the solicitation and \napproval of applications for grants under this Act and the criteria to \nbe used in overseeing the use of funds provided under such grants, \nexcept that under such criteria the Commission may not require a State \nto match any portion of the amount awarded as a condition of \neligibility.\n    (c) Eligibility of States.--\n            (1) In general.--A State is eligible to receive a grant \n        under the program under this section if it submits to the \n        Commission (in such form and manner as the Commission may \n        require) an application containing such information and \n        assurances as the Commission may require.\n            (2) Deadline for application.--The Commission may not \n        consider an application for a grant under this section unless \n        the application is submitted prior to the expiration of the 60-\n        day period which begins on the date the Commission makes public \n        the plan developed under subsection (b).\n            (3) Deadline for response.--The Commission shall approve or \n        reject an application submitted under this subsection not later \n        than 120 days after receiving the application.\n            (4) Criteria for rejection.--The Commission may not reject \n        an application submitted under this subsection unless it finds \n        that--\n                    (A) the equipment, software, or other technology \n                used to administer elections in the State is not \n                compatible with an instant runoff voting system; or\n                    (B) the State does not provide for appropriate \n                education for voters, poll workers, and election \n                officials in the use of an instant runoff voting \n                system.\n    (d) Cap on Amount of Grant.--The amount of any grant awarded to a \nState under the program under this section may not exceed the product \nof--\n            (1) the number of residents in the State at the time the \n        grant is awarded (based on the most recent decennial census); \n        and\n            (2) $12.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to carry out the program under this section--\n            (1) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2002; and\n            (2) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2003 and \n        each succeeding fiscal year.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIRING STATES TO USE VOTING EQUIPMENT COMPATIBLE WITH \n              INSTANT RUNOFF VOTING FOR FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each \nState shall administer elections for Federal office using voting \nequipment and technology which is compatible with an instant runoff \nvoting system.\n    (b) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall apply with respect to the \nregularly scheduled general election for Federal office held during \n2004 and each succeeding election for Federal office.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Instant Runoff Voting System.--In this Act, the term ``instant \nrunoff voting system'' means a system for the election of candidates \nunder which--\n            (1) voters may rank candidates on the ballot according to \n        the order of preference;\n            (2) runoff counts of candidates are conducted in rounds;\n            (3) if in any round no candidate receives a majority of the \n        votes cast, the candidate with the fewest number of votes is \n        eliminated and the remaining candidates advance to the next \n        round;\n            (4) in each round, a voter shall be considered to have cast \n        one vote for the candidate the voter ranked highest on the \n        ballot who has not been eliminated; and\n            (5) the runoff counts are carried out automatically at the \n        time the votes are cast and tabulated.\n    (b) State.--In this Act, the term ``State'' includes the District \nof Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and \nthe United States Virgin Islands.\n\nSEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.\n\n    Nothing in this Act may be construed to supersede or conflict with \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973aa et seq.) or the \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.)."
