FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) About 3,000,000 women per year in the United States \n        have an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and approximately \n        1,186,000 of these pregnancies end in elective abortion.\n            (2) Abortion can have severe and long-term effects on the \n        mental and emotional well-being of women. Women often \n        experience sadness and guilt following abortions with no one to \n        console them. They may have difficulty in bonding with new \n        babies, become overprotective parents, or develop problems in \n        their relationships with their spouses. Problems such as eating \n        disorders, depression, and suicide attempts have also been \n        traced to past abortions.\n            (3) Negative emotional reactions associated with abortion \n        include, depression, bouts of crying, guilt, intense grief or \n        sadness, emotional numbness, eating disorders, drug and alcohol \n        abuse, suicidal urges, anxiety and panic attacks, anger, rage, \n        sexual problems or promiscuity, lowered self esteem, nightmares \n        and sleep disturbances, flashbacks, and difficulty with \n        relationships.\n            (4) Women who aborted a first pregnancy are four times more \n        likely to report substance abuse compared to those who suffered \n        a natural loss of their first pregnancy, and are five times \n        more likely to report subsequent substance abuse than women who \n        carried to term.\n            (5) Research shows that the more women attempt to cope with \n        abortion using means of avoidance, mental disengagement, or \n        denial, the more likely the women are to report post-abortion \n        distress, intrusive thoughts, and dissatisfaction.\n            (6) Women who experience a lack of social support and \n        strong feelings of ambivalence are statistically more likely to \n        suffer severe negative emotional reactions to an abortion.\n            (7) Depression and other maladjustments to abortion can be \n        prolonged by the failure of the medical community, loved ones, \n        and society to recognize the complexity of post-abortion \n        reactions.\n            (8) Many women submit to an abortion in violation of their \n        own moral beliefs or maternal desires in order to satisfy the \n        demands of others.\n            (9) Women who submit to an abortion because of social \n        pressure are more likely to suffer from psychological distress \n        in subsequent years.\n            (10) Post-abortion depression is a treatable disorder if \n        promptly diagnosed by a trained provider and attended to with a \n        personalized regimen of care including social support, therapy, \n        medication, and when necessary, hospitalization.\n            (11) While there have been many studies regarding the \n        emotional aftermath of abortion, very little research has been \n        sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n      TITLE I--RESEARCH ON POST-ABORTION DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOSIS\n\nSEC. 101.
