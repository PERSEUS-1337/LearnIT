FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) of injury-related deaths, drowning is the second \n        leading cause of death in children aged 1 to 14 in the United \n        States;\n            (2) many children die due to pool and spa drowning and \n        entrapment, such as Virginia Graeme Baker, who at age 7 drowned \n        by entrapment in a residential spa;\n            (3) in 2003, 782 children ages 14 and under died as a \n        result of unintentional drowning;\n            (4) adult supervision at all aquatic venues is a critical \n        safety factor in preventing children from drowning; and\n            (5) research studies show that the installation and proper \n        use of barriers or fencing, as well as additional layers of \n        protection, could substantially reduce the number of childhood \n        residential swimming pool drownings and near drownings.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL SWIMMING POOL AND SPA DRAIN COVER STANDARD.\n\n    (a) Consumer Product Safety Rule.--The provisions of subsection (b) \nshall be considered to be a consumer product safety rule issued by the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission under section 9 of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).\n    (b) Drain Cover Standard.--Effective 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act, each swimming pool or spa drain cover \nmanufactured, distributed, or entered into commerce in the United \nStates shall conform to the entrapment protection standards of the \nASME/ANSI A112.19.8 performance standard, or any successor standard \nregulating the same.\n\nSEC. 4.
