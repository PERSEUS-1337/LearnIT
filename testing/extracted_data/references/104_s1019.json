    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Whirling Disease Response Act of \n1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Madison River is a world-renowned, blue-ribbon \n        trout river in Montana, over which the State has principal \n        management authority;\n            (2) rainbow trout populations in the upper reaches of the \n        Madison River have declined from 3,300 fish per mile in 1991 to \n        300 fish per mile in 1994;\n            (3) these sharp declines have occurred simultaneously with \n        the detection of whirling disease, which is caused by myxobolus \n        cerebralis, a parasite that induces significant deformity in \n        trout and can affect the stability of wild trout populations;\n            (4) because cold water sport fisheries provide tremendous \n        economic and recreational benefits to the United States, it is \n        in the public interest to devote resources to mitigate and \n        control the spread and impact of whirling disease on trout \n        populations in the Madison River and other rivers in the United \n        States;\n            (5) because Montana is the only State in the continental \n        United States that manages fluvial cold water sport fisheries \n        as wild, naturally reproducing populations and, therefore, the \n        impacts of myxobolus cerebralis can be observed without \n        confounding influences related to propagation and stocking \n        activities, it is desirable to locate Federal activities \n        dedicated to the study of whirling disease in Montana;\n            (6) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is the \n        Federal agency with appropriate expertise and responsibility to \n        work collaboratively with the State of Montana to address \n        whirling disease; and\n            (7) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Fish \n        Technology Center in Bozeman, Montana, is the appropriate \n        office to assist the State in the testing of fish affected by \n        whirling disease.\n\nSEC. 3. WHIRLING DISEASE REPORT.\n\n    (a) Preliminary Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Director of the United States Fish and \nWildlife Service shall submit a preliminary report to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on \nResources of the House of Representatives that--\n            (1) summarizes Federal efforts and findings as of the date \n        of the report with respect to whirling disease and other fish \n        parasites and pathogens;\n            (2) identifies gaps in scientific information with respect \n        to whirling disease and other fish parasites and pathogens; and\n            (3) recommends interim management initiatives that can be \n        carried out by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to \n        assist the State of Montana and other States in curbing the \n        spread of whirling disease, and other fish parasites and \n        pathogens, in the Madison River and to other rivers and \n        minimizing the impacts of the disease, parasites, and \n        pathogens.\n    (b) Final Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Director of the United States Fish and \nWildlife Service shall submit a final report to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on \nResources of the House of Representatives that--\n            (1) provides the summary and identification described in \n        paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) as of the date of \n        submission of the final report;\n            (2) identifies likely causes for the spread of whirling \n        disease, and other fish parasites and pathogens, throughout the \n        western United States; and\n            (3) recommends initiatives, and provides information \n        concerning scientific design for the initiatives, that can be \n        carried out by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to \n        assist the State of Montana and other States in curbing the \n        spread of whirling disease, and other fish parasites and \n        pathogens, in the Madison River and to other rivers and \n        minimizing the impacts of the disease, parasites, and \n        pathogens.\n\nSEC. 4. WHIRLING DISEASE DIAGNOSIS.\n\n    The United States Fish and Wildlife Service shall make funds \navailable to the Fish Technology Center in Bozeman, Montana, to permit \ncontinued field and laboratory studies, including research, diagnostic \nservices and testing of infected fish, that will lead to measures that \nmitigate and control whirling disease in the Madison River and other \nrivers.\n\nSEC. 5. WHIRLING DISEASE RESEARCH STATION.\n\n    The United States Fish and Wildlife Service shall make funds \navailable to the Fish Technology Center in Bozeman, Montana, to \nconstruct a complete containment facility in which whirling disease, \nand other fish parasites and pathogens, can be studied without danger \nof watershed contamination.\n\nSEC. 6. WHIRLING DISEASE COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    The United States Fish and Wildlife Service shall make funds \navailable for cooperative studies with State, local, and private \nentities to study whirling disease, and other fish parasites and \npathogens, at the Fish Technology Center in Bozeman, Montana.\n\nSEC. 7. ENNIS FISH HATCHERY.\n\n    The United States Fish and Wildlife Service shall make funds \navailable for modifications at the Ennis, Montana, fish hatchery to \nprevent the introduction and spread of whirling disease or other \nfishborne diseases in the Madison River.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary \nto carry out this Act, to remain available until expended."
