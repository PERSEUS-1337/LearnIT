CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The cost and burden of regulations have risen to \n        historic highs.\n            (2) The number of people writing Federal regulations has \n        grown dramatically from 106,000 in 1989 to 122,440 in 1992--a \n        15 percent increase in just 3 years.\n            (3) The Federal Government currently has 125,000 \n        bureaucrats working on 5,000 regulations promulgated by 59 \n        different Federal agencies.\n            (4) The 1993 regulatory output of the Federal Government \n        numbered 69,688 pages of regulations, with the Code of Federal \n        Regulations taking up 21 feet of shelf space.\n            (5) The Office of the Federal Register, the publisher of \n        the journal of Federal agency rule making, now teaches classes \n        to assist manufacturers in reading new regulations and \n        proposals.\n            (6) The total cost of administering the Federal regulatory \n        apparatus in fiscal year 1993 was $11,300,000,000.\n            (7) It is estimated that the total cost of regulation of \n        manufacturing approximated, and in some studies exceeded, \n        aggregate after-tax manufacturing profits.\n            (8) The cost of regulatory compliance drains funds for \n        research, job creation, training, wages, and employment \n        benefits.\n            (9) In a February 1993 survey of leading manufacturing \n        chief executive officers, government mandates, including \n        regulations, were identified as the government policies which \n        have done the most to harm United States manufacturing \n        employment in the past 5 years.\n            (10) The vast scope, rigid construction, and costly impact \n        of State and Federal regulatory schemes has created the \n        perception of a hostile climate for manufacturing.\n\nSEC. 3.
