    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``United Arab Emirates Human Rights \nAccountability Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan is the brother of \n        United Arab Emirates (hereinafter in this section referred to \n        as ``UAE'') president and Abu Dhabi Emir Sheikh Khalifa bin \n        Zayed al-Nahayan.\n            (2) On April 22, 2009, ABC Nightline broadcast a few \n        minutes of videotape documenting the severest forms of torture \n        and abuse of an Afghan grain dealer, Mohammed Shah Poor, \n        inflicted by Sheikh Issa assisted by other uniformed \n        individuals acting under color of authority.\n            (3) During Mr. Poor's ordeal, Sheikh Issa repeatedly \n        insisted that his and his cronies actions be videotaped, \n        reportedly for his later enjoyment of the extreme suffering of \n        his victim, who miraculously survived the attack.\n            (4) Excerpts of this video have been circulated on YouTube \n        and longer footage was submitted in a United States civil court \n        in 2009.\n            (5) Around 2004, the matter was brought to the attention of \n        the UAE Ministry of Interior, which is headed by another of \n        Sheikh Issa's brothers. The Interior Ministry failed to \n        investigate this matter, and when ABC News brought it again to \n        their attention, the Ministry replied that the incidents were \n        not part of a pattern of behavior and that the police had \n        correctly followed procedures.\n            (6) Human Rights Watch stated, regarding this incident: \n        ``The UAE government's failure to prosecute those involved in \n        this undisputed incident of torture and abuse at the hands of a \n        royal family member and the police is an appalling miscarriage \n        of justice. What's even more shocking is the government's \n        insistence that it investigated and found no violation of UAE \n        laws.''.\n            (7) Only after an international outcry regarding the lack \n        of action by UAE law enforcement and legal authorities and a \n        hearing of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in the U.S. \n        House of Representatives on Wednesday, May 13, 2009, did Sheikh \n        Issa finally have to face charges before a UAE court.\n            (8) On January 10, 2010, the UAE court acquitted Sheikh \n        Issa of the charges of rape, endangering life and causing \n        bodily harm. According to Sheikh Issa's attorney, the court \n        accepted their defense that Sheikh Issa had been under the \n        influence of drugs.\n            (9) In addition, the UAE court convicted Bassam and Ghassan \n        Nabulsi, sentenced in absentia to five years each in prison. \n        Bassam and Ghassan Nabulsi were former business partners of \n        Sheikh Issa, who had filmed the attack and kept the video tape \n        and ultimately brought a civil suit in the United States \n        against Sheikh Issa during which they submitted the film.\n\nSEC. 3.
