REFERENCE.\n\n    Whenever in this Act a section or other provision is amended, such \namendment shall be considered to be made to that section or other \nprovision of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 \nU.S.C. 9858 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Two-thirds of mothers with children under 6 years of \n        age are in the workforce.\n            (2) More than 10 percent of children under the age of 6 \n        have a disability; children living in low-income communities \n        have a higher incidence of disability.\n            (3) The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n        requires early intervention services to be provided to infants \n        and toddlers with disabilities in a natural environment, \n        typically the child's home or a child care setting.\n            (4) The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n        requires special education preschool services to be delivered \n        in the least restrictive environment, with a preschooler's \n        nondisabled peers.\n            (5) The General Accounting Office reports that the ``supply \n        of infant care, care for special needs children, and care \n        during nonstandard hours has been more limited than the overall \n        supply''. There is even less care for those children who live \n        in low-income communities.\n            (6) Children with disabilities or special health care needs \n        are barred from many child care programs due to myth, \n        stereotype, and fear about disability and because staff lack \n        sufficient training to meet the needs of such children.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to increase the supply of \nquality child care for children with disabilities.\n\nSEC. 3. APPLICATION AND PLAN.\n\n    Section 658E(c) (42 U.S.C. 9858c(c)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (2)(H)--\n                    (A) by striking ``, and families'' and inserting \n                ``, families''; and\n                    (B) by inserting before the final period ``, and \n                families that have children with disabilities''; and\n            (2) in paragraph (3)(B)--\n                    (A) by striking ``size) and to'' and inserting \n                ``size), to''; and\n                    (B) by inserting before the final period ``, and to \n                children with disabilities''.\n\nSEC. 4.
