FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that:\n            (1) Computer science is transforming industry, creating new \n        fields of commerce, driving innovation, and bolstering \n        productivity.\n            (2) There are more than 550,000 technology jobs unfilled in \n        the United States as of May of 2016. It is projected that there \n        will be 1,400,000 new jobs in the technology sector by 2020; \n        however, 70 percent of those jobs will be unfulfilled at the \n        rate American universities are producing qualified graduates.\n            (3) Knowledge of computer science and use of technology is \n        increasingly essential for all individuals, not just those \n        working or planning to work in the technology sector.\n            (4) Providing students with computer science education in \n        elementary school and secondary school is critical for student \n        success, and strengthening the workforce of a 21st century \n        economy.\n            (5) While an estimated 90 percent of parents want computer \n        science taught in their children's schools, just 25 percent of \n        all elementary schools and secondary schools offer high-quality \n        computer science instruction that includes programming and \n        coding.\n            (6) African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and \n        Pacific Islanders are disproportionately underrepresented in \n        the technology sector. For example, African-Americans and \n        Latinos make up 27 percent of the United States workforce, but \n        make up only 13.8 percent of the science and engineering \n        workforce, and only 11 percent of computer science \n        professionals.\n            (7) While underrepresented minority students overall face \n        an opportunity gap in STEAM education, women of color \n        particularly face an achievement gap in science and engineering \n        education. In 2012, while women received 48.8 percent of all \n        bachelor's degrees in science and engineering majors, women of \n        color received only 15.7 percent (Black: 5.3 percent; Latino: \n        5.5 percent; Native American or Alaska Native: 0.3 percent, and \n        Asian or Pacific Islander: 4.6 percent).\n            (8) Women overall face challenges in accessing computer \n        science education. Only 18 percent of all bachelor's degrees \n        awarded in computer science in 2012 went to women, and women of \n        color received only 6.6 percent (Black: 3.0 percent; Latino: \n        1.7 percent; Native American or Alaska Native: 0.1 percent, and \n        Asian or Pacific Islander: 1.8 percent).\n            (9) Disparities in enrollment and academic achievement \n        start early. In 2015, only 22 percent of students taking the AP \n        Computer Science exam were women, and just 13 percent were \n        African-American or Latino.\n            (10) Nationwide, only 184 Native American students took the \n        AP Computer Science exam in 2015. This means that while Native \n        Americans make up about 1.1 percent of the U.S. student \n        population, they made up less than half a percent of students \n        who took AP Computer Science exams in 2015.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Computational thinking.--The term ``computational \n        thinking'' aims to capture the wide range of creative processes \n        that go into formulating problems and their solutions in such a \n        way that the solutions can be carried out by a computer, and \n        may involve some understanding of software and hardware design, \n        logic and the use of abstraction and representation, algorithm \n        design, algorithm expression, problem decomposition, \n        modularity, programming paradigms and languages, issues of \n        information security and privacy, the application of \n        computation across a wide range of disciplines, and the \n        societal impact of computing. Programming is a hands-on, \n        inquiry-based way in which computational thinking may be \n        learned.\n            (2) Computer science education.--The term ``computer \n        science education'' includes any of the following: \n        computational thinking; software design; hardware architecture \n        and organization; theoretical foundations; use of abstraction \n        and representation in problem solving; logic; algorithm design \n        and implementation; the limits of computation; programming \n        paradigms and languages; parallel and distributed computing; \n        information security and privacy; computing systems and \n        networks; graphics and visualization; databases and information \n        retrieval; the relationship between computing and mathematics; \n        artificial intelligence; applications of computing across a \n        broad range of disciplines and problems; and the social impacts \n        and professional practices of computing.\n            (3) Eligible tribal school.--The term ``eligible Tribal \n        school'' means--\n                    (A) a school operated by the Bureau of Indian \n                Education;\n                    (B) a school operated pursuant to the Indian Self-\n                Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n                450 et seq.); or\n                    (C) a tribally controlled school (as defined in \n                section 5212 of the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of \n                1988 (25 U.S.C. 2511)).\n            (4) Institution of higher education.--The term \n        ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given the \n        term in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n        U.S.C. 1002).\n            (5) Local educational agency.--The term ``local educational \n        agency'' has the meaning given the term in section 8101 of the \n        Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n        8101).\n            (6) Poverty line.--The term ``poverty line'' has the \n        meaning given the term in section 8101 of the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8101).\n            (7) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Education.\n            (8) Steam.--The term ``STEAM'' means the subjects of \n        science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics, \n        including computer science.\n\nSEC. 4.
