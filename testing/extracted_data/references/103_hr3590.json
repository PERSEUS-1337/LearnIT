FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) The commercialization of technology and industrial \n        innovation are central to the economic, environmental, and \n        social well-being of citizens of the United States.\n            (2) The Government can help United States business to speed \n        the development of new products and processes by entering into \n        Cooperative Research and Development Agreements which make \n        available the assistance of the Federal laboratories to the \n        private sector, but the commercialization of technology and \n        industrial innovation in the United States depends largely upon \n        actions by business.\n            (3) Government action to claim a right of ownership to any \n        invention or other intellectual property developed under a \n        Cooperative Research and Development Agreement can inhibit the \n        establishment of such agreements with business and can prevent \n        the commercialization of technology and industrial innovation \n        by business.\n            (4) The commercialization of technology and industrial \n        innovation in the United States will be enhanced if the \n        ownership of any invention or other intellectual property \n        developed under a Cooperative Research and Development \n        Agreement belongs to a company or companies incorporated in the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
