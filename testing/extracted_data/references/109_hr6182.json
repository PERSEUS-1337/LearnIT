    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse And Patient \nSafety & Protection Act of 2006''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Direct-care registered nurses rank 10th among all \n        occupations for musculoskeletal disorders, sustaining injuries \n        at a higher rate than laborers, movers, and truck drivers. In \n        2004, nurses sustained 8,800 musculoskeletal disorders, most of \n        which (over 7,000) were back injuries. The leading cause of \n        these injuries in health care are the result of patient \n        lifting, transferring, and repositioning injuries.\n            (2) The physical demands of the nursing profession lead \n        many nurses to leave the profession. Fifty two percent of \n        nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38 percent suffer from \n        pain severe enough to require leave from work. Many nurses and \n        other health care providers suffering back injury do not return \n        to work.\n            (3) Patients are not at optimum levels of safety while \n        being lifted, transferred, or repositioned manually. Mechanical \n        lift programs can substantially reduce skin tears suffered by \n        patients, allowing patients a safer means to progress through \n        their care.\n            (4) The development of assistive patient handling equipment \n        and devices has essentially rendered the act of strict manual \n        patient handling unnecessary as a function of nursing care.\n            (5) Application of assistive patient handling technology \n        fulfills an ergonomic approach within the nursing practice by \n        designing and fitting the job or workplace to match the \n        capabilities and limitations of the human body.\n            (6) A growing number of health care facilities have \n        incorporated patient handling technology and have reported \n        positive results. Injuries among nursing staff have \n        dramatically declined since implementing patient handling \n        equipment and devices. As a result, the number of lost work \n        days due to injury and staff turnover has declined. Cost-\n        benefit analyses have also shown that assistive patient \n        handling technology successfully reduces workers' compensation \n        costs for musculoskeletal disorders.\n            (7) Establishing a safe patient handling standard for \n        direct-care registered nurses and other health care providers \n        is a critical component in increasing patient safety, \n        protecting nurses, and addressing the nursing shortage.\n\nSEC. 2. FEDERAL SAFE PATIENT HANDLING STANDARD.\n\n    Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this \ntitle, the Secretary of Labor, acting through the Director of \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, shall establish a \nFederal Safe Patient Handling Standard to prevent musculoskeletal \ndisorders for direct-care registered nurses and other health care \nproviders working in health care facilities. This standard shall \nrequire the elimination of manual lifting of patients by direct-care \nregistered nurses and other health care providers, through the use of \nmechanical devices, except during a declared state of emergency. The \nstandard shall include a musculoskeletal injury prevention plan, which \nwill include hazard identification and risk assessments in relation to \npatient care duties and patient handling. The standard shall require:\n            (1) all health care facilities comply with the standard;\n            (2) health care facilities to purchase, use, and maintain \n        safe lift mechanical devices;\n            (3) input from direct-care registered nurses and \n        organizations representing direct-care registered nurses in \n        implementing the standard;\n            (4) a program to identify problems and solutions regarding \n        safe patient handling;\n            (5) a system to report, track, and analyze trends in \n        injuries, as well as make injury data available to the public;\n            (6) training for staff on safe patient handling policies, \n        equipment, and devices at least on an annual basis. Training \n        will also include hazard identification, assessment and control \n        of musculoskeletal hazards in patient care areas, this would \n        include interactive classroom based and hands on training by a \n        knowledgeable person or staff; and\n            (7) annual evaluations of safe patient handling efforts, as \n        well as new technology, handling procedures, and engineering \n        controls. Documentation of this process shall include equipment \n        selection and evaluation.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENT FOR HEALTH CARE FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) Safe Patient Handling Plan.--In accordance with the standard \nrequired under section 2, and not later than 6 months after such \nstandard is published, health care facilities shall develop and \nimplement a safe patient handling plan that--\n            (1) provides adequate, appropriate, and quality delivery of \n        health care services that protects patient safety and prevents \n        musculoskeletal disorders for direct-care registered nurses and \n        other health care providers;\n            (2) is consistent with the requirements of the Federal Safe \n        Patient Handling Standard (as established in section 2);\n            (3) provides for input by direct-care registered nurses and \n        organizations representing direct-care registered nurses in \n        implementing the plan; and\n            (4) ensures that safe lifting mechanical devices shall only \n        be used by direct care registered nurses and other health care \n        providers.\n    (b) Posting, Records, and Auditing.--\n            (1) Posting requirements.--Not later than 6 months after \n        the standard required under section 2 is published, a health \n        care facility shall post, in each unit of the facility, a \n        uniform notice in a form specified by the Secretary in \n        regulation that--\n                    (A) explains the Federal Safe Patient Handling \n                Standard issued under section 2;\n                    (B) includes information regarding safe patient \n                handling polices and training; and\n                    (C) explains procedure to report patient handling-\n                related injuries.\n            (2) Audits.--The Secretary shall require the Occupational \n        Safety and Health Administration to conduct unscheduled audits \n        to ensure--\n                    (A) implementation of the safe patient handling \n                plan in accordance with this title; and\n                    (B) compliance with reporting and reviewing \n                findings for continual improvements to the safe patient \n                handling plan.\n\nSEC. 4. PROTECTION OF DIRECT-CARE REGISTERED NURSES AND OTHER \n              INDIVIDUALS.\n\n    (a) Refusal of Assignment.--A direct-care registered nurse or other \nhealth care provider may refuse to accept an assignment in a health \ncare facility if--\n            (1) the assignment would violate the standard establish \n        under section 2; or\n            (2) the direct-care registered nurse or other health care \n        provider is not prepared by education, training, or experience \n        to fulfill the assignment without compromising the safety of \n        any patient or jeopardizing the license of the nurse.\n    (b) Retaliation for Refusal of Assignment Barred.--\n            (1) No discharge, discrimination, or retaliation.--No \n        health care facility shall discharge, discriminate, or \n        retaliate in any manner with respect to any aspect of \n        employment, including discharge, promotion, compensation, or \n        terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, against a \n        direct-care registered nurse or other health care provider \n        based on his or her refusal of a work assignment under \n        subsection (a).\n            (2) No filing of complaint.--No health care facility shall \n        file a complaint or a report against a direct-care registered \n        nurse or other health care provider with the appropriate State \n        professional disciplinary agency because of his or her refusal \n        of a work assignment under subsection (a).\n    (c) Complaint to Secretary.--A direct-care registered nurse, health \ncare provider, or other individual may file a complaint with the \nSecretary against a health care facility that violates this Act or a \nstandard established under this Act.
