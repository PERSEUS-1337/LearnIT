FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly \\1/3\\ of American women (31 percent) report \n        being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend \n        at some point in their lives, and about 1200 women are murdered \n        every year by their intimate partner, nearly 3 each day.\n            (2) 85 percent of violent victimizations are experienced by \n        women.\n            (3) 37 percent of all women who sought care in hospital \n        emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were injured by a \n        current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend.\n            (4) In addition to injuries sustained during violent \n        episodes, physical and psychological abuse are linked to a \n        number of adverse physical health effects including arthritis, \n        chronic neck or back pain, migraine and other frequent \n        headaches, stammering, problems with vision, and sexually \n        transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.\n            (5) Medical services for abused women cost an estimated \n        $857,300,000 every year.\n            (6) Each year, at least 6 percent of all pregnant women, \n        about 240,000 pregnant women, in this country are battered by \n        the men in their lives. This battering leads to complications \n        of pregnancy, including low weight gain, anemia, infections, \n        and first and second trimester bleeding.\n            (7) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to \n        be victims of homicide than to die of any other cause, and \n        evidence exists that a significant proportion of all female \n        homicide victims are killed by their intimate partners.\n            (8) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely \n        to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including \n        depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are also \n        more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run \n        away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit \n        sexual assault crimes.\n            (9) Fifty percent of men who frequently assault their wives \n        frequently assault their children. The United States Advisory \n        Board on Child Abuse and Neglect suggests that domestic \n        violence may be the single major precursor to child abuse and \n        neglect fatalities in this country.\n            (10) Currently, about 10 percent of primary care physicians \n        routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during new patient \n        visits and nine percent routinely screen during periodic \n        checkups.\n            (11) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness \n        of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of \n        pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a \n        10-minute intervention that was proven highly effective in \n        increasing the safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable \n        research does not yet exist to support the effectiveness of \n        screening men.\n            (12) 70 to 81 percent of the patients studied reported that \n        they would like their health care providers to ask them \n        privately about intimate partner violence.\n\nSEC. 3. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION GRANTS.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399O.
