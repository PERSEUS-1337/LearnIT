FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) People in the United States lack important privacy \n        protections.\n            (2) The opportunities for an individual to secure \n        employment, insurance, and credit, to obtain medical care, and \n        to participate in electronic commerce are endangered by the \n        potential for misuse of certain personal information.\n            (3) Because markets work through trust, predictability, and \n        stability, privacy protections should help businesses gain the \n        trust of consumers and compliment existing practices.\n            (4) 84 percent of Internet users are concerned about \n        businesses and people they do not know obtaining personal \n        information about them.\n            (5) Nearly 80 percent of online consumers have at some time \n        abandoned e-commerce transactions due to privacy concerns, \n        resulting in an estimated loss to companies of $12.4 billion in \n        2000.\n            (6) In order to protect the privacy of individuals in the \n        Information Age, it is necessary and appropriate for public \n        officials to take steps to safeguard this essential freedom.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assure that personal \ninformation about an individual consumer in the United States is \nproperly protected and that any use of such information by others is \nconsistent with the prior consent of the consumer.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.\n\n    (a) Limitations on Disclosure of Personal Information.--An \ninformation recipient shall not disclose to any other person personal \ninformation collected or obtained from or about a consumer, unless--\n            (1) such disclosure is made after the consumer has been \n        provided with a clear and concise description of the extent and \n        circumstances under which such a disclosure may occur;\n            (2) such disclosure does not exceed the scope of the \n        consumer's prior consent, which shall be--\n                    (A) in the case of disclosure of personal \n                information, granted tacitly or affirmatively by the \n                consumer after receiving the description required by \n                paragraph (1); or\n                    (B) in the case of disclosure of sensitive personal \n                information, granted affirmatively by the consumer \n                after receiving the description required by paragraph \n                (1); and\n            (3) the consent granted under paragraph (2) has not \n        subsequently been withdrawn by the consumer.\n    (b) Limitation on Collection of Optional Information.--An \ninformation recipient may not require a consumer to provide, as a \ncondition of entering into or completing a transaction with the \ninformation recipient, personal information that is not necessary to \ncomplete the transaction.\n    (c) Limitation on Refusal to Transact.--An information recipient \nmay not terminate or refuse to enter into a transaction with a consumer \nbecause the consumer has not granted, or has withdrawn, the consent \nrequired by subsection (a), except when the sole purpose of the \ntransaction is the acquisition of such information for disclosure.\n    (d) Reasonable Access to Personal Information.--An information \nrecipient shall provide to a consumer about whom personal information \nhas been obtained reasonable access to the consumer's personal \ninformation.\n\nSEC. 4. EXCEPTIONS.\n\n    Section 3 does not apply to the disclosure of personal \ninformation--\n            (1) as necessary to effect, administer, or enforce a \n        transaction requested or authorized by the consumer;\n            (2) to protect the confidentiality or security of personal \n        information;\n            (3) to prevent or investigate fraud, an unauthorized \n        transaction, a claim, or other liability;\n            (4) to collect a debt or dishonored item;\n            (5) for the purpose of a securitization or secondary market \n        sale (including servicing rights);\n            (6) for the purposes of legal process;\n            (7) for law enforcement purposes;\n            (8) for governmental regulatory purposes;\n            (9) as otherwise authorized or required under a Federal \n        law; or\n            (10) if the Federal Trade Commission has made a finding \n        that such a disclosure is consistent with the purposes of this \n        Act and in the public interest.\n\nSEC. 5.
