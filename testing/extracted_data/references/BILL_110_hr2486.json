CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING IRAQI REFUGEES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) President George W. Bush, asserting a grave and \n        immediate threat to the United States from Iraqi weapons of \n        mass destruction (WMD), asked Congress to provide an \n        authorization for the use of military force against Iraq if \n        Iraq did not comply with international disarmament \n        requirements.\n            (2) Passed by Congress, President Bush signed H.J. Res. \n        114, To Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against \n        Iraq, into law on October 16, 2002, becoming Public Law 107-\n        243.\n            (3) On March 20, 2003, at the direction of President Bush, \n        United States Armed Forces, together with Coalition partners, \n        initiated Operation Iraqi Freedom pursuant to Public Law 107-\n        243, and within 30 days the government of Saddam Hussein was \n        removed from power.\n            (4) In keeping with United States obligations under the \n        Geneva Conventions, customary international law, and a \n        subsequent mandate by the United Nations Security Council, as \n        the principle occupying power, the United States took temporary \n        responsibility for Iraq, establishing first the Office for \n        Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, and subsequently, \n        the Coalition Provisional Authority.\n            (5) As the principle occupying power, the United States \n        enacted a broad institutional transformation in Iraq in order \n        to establish a new and democratic Iraqi Government.\n            (6) Under United States direction and control, Iraqis \n        adopted a transitional national assembly, adopted a new \n        constitution, conducted parliamentary elections, and \n        established a new government that remains incapable of \n        establishing and maintaining law and order.\n            (7) During the United States occupation and subsequent to \n        the return of sovereignty to Iraq, ``[s]everal thousand'' \n        Iraqis in Iraq have come to work for the United States \n        Government and Armed Forces, according to Ellen Sauerbrey, \n        Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and \n        Migration.\n            (8) The ongoing instability and chaos, violence, and \n        ethnic, religious, and sectarian conflict in Iraq have prompted \n        nearly 4,000,000 Iraqis to become refugees or internally \n        displaced persons.\n            (9) Iraqis who have assisted or worked for the United \n        States are widely considered to be ``collaborators'' by other \n        Iraqis, and they face a real and persistent fear of \n        persecution, physical harm, or death, to themselves and their \n        families.\n            (10) There is currently no facility within Iraq where \n        refugees or displaced persons can register with either the \n        United States Government or with the United Nations High \n        Commission for Refugees.\n            (11) The internally displaced Iraqi population is estimated \n        by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to \n        be 1,900,000, with that number growing by 50,000 each month.\n            (12) The Iraqi refugee population of approximately \n        2,000,000 has imposed tremendous costs on countries neighboring \n        Iraq, many of which are poor and struggling with other large \n        refugee populations within their borders.\n            (13) The United States has admitted only 692 Iraqi refugees \n        since 2003.\n            (14) The special immigrant visa program for Iraqi and \n        Afghan translators working for the United States Armed Forces \n        established under section 1059 of the National Defense \n        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 has a six year waiting \n        list.\n            (15) Paula Dobriansky, Undersecretary of State for \n        Democracy and Global Affairs, announced on February 14, 2007, \n        that the United States intended to process 7,000 refugee \n        referrals from UNHCR ``in the near term''.\n            (16) Subsequently, Assistant Secretary Sauerbrey \n        acknowledged that, because of security screening issues, \n        ``under the best of circumstances ... perhaps half of the \n        number that we actually are addressing in the fiscal year that \n        we'll be ready--travel ready before the end of September.''.\n            (17) Between May 1, 1975, and December 20, 1975, at the \n        direction of President Gerald Ford, the United States \n        Government and United States Armed Forces facilitated the \n        movement to the United States of over 131,000 South Vietnamese \n        political refugees.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD IRAQI REFUGEES.\n\n            (1) The United States accepts responsibility for the \n        welfare and safety of Iraqis, and their immediate family \n        members, who, as a consequence of working for or assisting the \n        United States Government or United States Armed Forces, have \n        become internally displaced or refugees, or have developed a \n        well-grounded fear of persecution or physical harm.\n            (2) The United States will assist all Iraq refugees, \n        including internally displaced Iraqis, to an extent \n        commensurate with the overall level of United States \n        expenditures and effort in Iraq, and acknowledges that actions \n        by the United States contributed to the refugee problem that \n        developed subsequent to the United States-led invasion of Iraq \n        in 2003.\n            (3) The United States will assist all Iraq refugees, \n        including internally displaced Iraqis, independent of United \n        States efforts to pacify Iraq and assist Iraq with its \n        redevelopment and reconstruction.\n\nSEC. 4.
