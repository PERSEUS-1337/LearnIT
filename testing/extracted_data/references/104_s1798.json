FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal reclamation program has been in existence \n        for over 90 years, with an estimated taxpayer investment of \n        over $70,000,000,000;\n            (2) the program has had and continues to have an enormous \n        effect on the water resources and aquatic environments of the \n        western States;\n            (3) irrigation water made available from Federal water \n        projects in the West is a very valuable resource for which \n        there are increasing and competing demands;\n            (4) the justification for providing water at less than full \n        cost was to benefit and promote the development of small family \n        farms and exclude large corporate farms, but this purpose has \n        been frustrated over the years due to inadequate implementation \n        of subsidy and acreage limits;\n            (5) below-cost water prices tend to encourage excessive use \n        of scarce water supplies in the arid regions of the West, and \n        reasonable price increases to the wealthiest western farmers \n        would provide an economic incentive for greater water \n        conservation;\n            (6) the Federal Government has increasingly applied \n        eligibility tests based on income for Federal entitlement and \n        subsidy programs, measures that are consistent with the \n        historic approach of the reclamation program's acreage \n        limitations that seek to limit water subsidies to smaller \n        farms; and\n            (7) including a means test based on gross income in the \n        reclamation program will increase the effectiveness of carrying \n        out the family farm goals of the Federal reclamation laws.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 202 of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 \n(43 U.S.C. 390bb) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (7), (8), (9), (10), and \n        (11) as paragraphs (9), (10), (11), (12), and (13), \n        respectively;\n            (2) in paragraph (6) by striking ``owned or operated under \n        a lease which'' and inserting ``owned, leased, or operated by \n        an individual or legal entity and which'';\n            (3) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following:\n            ``(7) Legal entity.--The term `legal entity' includes a \n        corporation, association, partnership, trust, joint tenancy, or \n        tenancy in common, or any other entity that owns, leases, or \n        operates a farm operation for the benefit of more than 1 \n        individual under any form of agreement or arrangement.\n            ``(8) Operator.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `operator'--\n                            ``(i) means an individual or legal entity \n                        that operates a single farm operation on a \n                        parcel (or parcels) of land that is owned or \n                        leased by another person (or persons) under any \n                        form of agreement or arrangement (or agreements \n                        or arrangements); and\n                            ``(ii) if the individual or legal entity--\n                                    ``(I) is an employee of an \n                                individual or legal entity, includes \n                                the individual or legal entity; or\n                                    ``(II) is a legal entity that \n                                controls, is controlled by, or is under \n                                common control with another legal \n                                entity, includes each such other legal \n                                entity.\n                    ``(B) Operation of a farm operation.--For the \n                purposes of subparagraph (A), an individual or legal \n                entity shall be considered to operate a farm operation \n                if the individual or legal entity is the person that \n                performs the greatest proportion of the decisionmaking \n                for and supervision of the agricultural enterprise on \n                land served with irrigation water.''; and\n            (4) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(14) Single farm operation.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The term `single farm operation' \n                means the total acreage of land served with irrigation \n                water for which an individual or legal entity is the \n                operator.\n                    ``(B) Rules for determining whether separate \n                parcels are operated as a single farm operation.--\n                            ``(i) Equipment- and labor-sharing \n                        activities.--The conduct of equipment- and \n                        labor-sharing activities on separate parcels of \n                        land by separate individuals or legal entities \n                        shall not by itself serve as a basis for \n                        concluding that the farming operations of the \n                        individuals or legal entities constitute a \n                        single farm operation.\n                            ``(ii) Performance of certain services.--\n                        The performance by an individual or legal \n                        entity of an agricultural chemical application, \n                        pruning, or harvesting for a farm operation on \n                        a parcel of land shall not by itself serve as a \n                        basis for concluding that the farm operation on \n                        that parcel of land is part of a single farm \n                        operation operated by the individual or entity \n                        on other parcels of land.''.\n    (b) Identification of Owners, Lessees, and Operators and of Single \nFarm Operations.--The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (43 U.S.C. 39aa et \nseq.) is amended by inserting after section 201 the following:\n\n``SEC. 201A.
