FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the report ``Quality Counts 99'', by \n        Education Week, 36 States require the publishing of annual \n        report cards on individual schools, but the content of the \n        report cards varies widely.\n            (2) The content of most of the report cards described in \n        paragraph (1) does not provide parents with the information the \n        parents need to measure how their school or State is doing \n        compared with other schools and States.\n            (3) Ninety percent of taxpayers believe that published \n        information about individual schools would motivate educators \n        to work harder to improve the schools' performance.\n            (4) More than 60 percent of parents and 70 percent of \n        taxpayers have not seen an individual report card for their \n        area school.\n            (5) Dissemination of understandable information about \n        schools can be an important tool for parents and taxpayers to \n        measure the quality of the schools and to hold the schools \n        accountable for improving performance.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide parents, taxpayers, and \neducators with useful, understandable school report cards.\n\nSEC. 4.
