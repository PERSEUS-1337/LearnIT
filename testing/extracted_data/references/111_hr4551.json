FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) No statutory health care program existed for members of \n        the uniformed services who entered service prior to December 7, \n        1956, and retired after serving a minimum of 20 years.\n            (2) Statutes enacted in 1956 allowed those who entered \n        service on or after December 7, 1956, and retired after serving \n        a minimum of 20 years or by reason of a service-connected \n        disability to medical and dental care in any facility of the \n        uniformed services, subject to the availability of space and \n        facilities and the capabilities of the medical and dental \n        staff.\n            (3) Recruiters, re-enlistment counselors, and officers at \n        all levels of the uniformed services, and other government \n        officials, as agents of the United States Government, continued \n        to allow members who entered the uniformed services to believe \n        they would be entitled to fully paid lifetime health care upon \n        retirement, despite enactment of statutes in 1956, subsequent \n        statutes, and the issuance of regulations that defined and \n        limited the availability of medical care to retired members of \n        the uniformed services.\n            (4) After 5 rounds of base closures between 1988 and 1995 \n        and further drawdowns of remaining military medical treatment \n        facilities, access to ``space available'' health care in a \n        military medical treatment facility is difficult for many \n        military retirees and virtually nonexistent for some.\n            (5) Although provisions in the Floyd D. Spence National \n        Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into \n        law by Public Law 106-398) extended coverage under the TRICARE \n        program to medicare eligible military retirees age 65 and \n        older, those provisions did not address the health care needs \n        of military retirees under the age of 65.\n            (6) The United States should make good on the promises \n        recruiters made in good faith and reestablish high quality \n        health care for all retired members of the uniformed services.\n\nSEC. 3. COVERAGE OF MILITARY RETIREES UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES \n              HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Coverage for Retirees and Dependents.--\n            (1) Section 1108 of title 10, United States Code, is \n        amended to read as follows:\n``Sec. 1108.
