DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The terms ``Upper Mississippi River Basin'' and \n        ``Basin'' mean the watershed portion of the Upper Mississippi \n        River and Illinois River basins, from Cairo, Illinois, to the \n        headwaters of the Mississippi River, in the States of \n        Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri. The \n        designation includes the Kaskaskia watershed along the Illinois \n        River and the Meramec watershed along the Missouri River.\n            (2) The terms ``Upper Mississippi River Stewardship \n        Initiative'' and ``Initiative'' mean the activities authorized \n        or required by this Act to monitor nutrient and sediment loss \n        in the Upper Mississippi River Basin.\n            (3) The term ``sound science'' refers to the use of \n        accepted and documented scientific methods to identify and \n        quantify the sources, transport, and fate of nutrients and \n        sediment and to quantify the effect of various treatment \n        methods or conservation measures on nutrient and sediment loss. \n        Sound science requires the use of documented protocols for data \n        collection and data analysis, and peer review of the data, \n        results, and findings.\n\nSEC. 3.
