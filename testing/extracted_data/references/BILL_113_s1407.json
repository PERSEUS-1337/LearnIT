FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Computer science is transforming industry, creating new \n        fields of commerce, driving innovation in all fields of \n        science, and bolstering productivity in established economic \n        sectors.\n            (2) The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that there will \n        be 9,200,000 jobs in the fields of science, technology, \n        engineering, and mathematics by the year 2020. Half of these, \n        or 4,600,000 jobs, will be in computing.\n            (3) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2012, \n        the national median annual salary was $45,790, and the average \n        annual salary in computer and mathematical occupations was \n        $80,180.\n            (4) Elementary and secondary computer science education \n        gives students a deeper knowledge of the fundamentals of \n        computing, yielding critical thinking skills that will serve \n        students throughout their lives in numerous fields.\n            (5) Students who take the College Board's AP computer \n        science examination are 8 times more likely to major in \n        computer science in college. Unfortunately, the College Board \n        reports that in 2012, less than 3,000 of the 40,000 high \n        schools in the United States offered AP computer science \n        examinations.\n            (6) Only 14 States allow computer science courses to count \n        toward secondary school core graduation requirements, chilling \n        student interest in computer science courses.\n            (7) The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) has \n        found that many States do not have a certification or licensure \n        process for computer science teachers. Where processes do \n        exist, they often have no connection to rigorous computer \n        science content.\n            (8) Computer science education has been encumbered by \n        confusion regarding the related but distinct concepts of \n        computer science education, technology education, and the use \n        of technology in education.\n            (9) The Association for Computing Machinery and the CSTA \n        have established a clear 4-part, grade-appropriate framework of \n        standards for computer science education to guide State reform \n        efforts.\n            (10) With the growing importance of computing in society, \n        the need for students to understand the fundamentals of \n        computing, and the significant challenges elementary and \n        secondary computer science education faces, broad support for \n        computer science education is needed to catalyze reform.\n\nSEC. 3. REFERENCES.\n\n    Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an \namendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal \nof, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to \nbe made to a section or other provision of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 4.
