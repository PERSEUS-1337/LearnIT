FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) certain scattered parcels of Federal land in Gilpin \n        County, Colorado, are administered by the Secretary of the \n        Interior as part of the Royal Gorge Resource Area, Canon City \n        District, Bureau of Land Management;\n            (2) these land parcels, which comprises approximately 133 \n        separate tracts of land, and range in size from approximately \n        38 acres to much less than an acre have been identified as \n        suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management through \n        its resource management planning process and are appropriate \n        for disposal; and\n            (3) even though the Federal land parcels in Gilpin County, \n        Colorado, are scattered and small in size, they nevertheless by \n        virtue of their proximity to existing communities appear to \n        have a fair market value which may be used by the Federal \n        Government to exchange for lands which will better lend \n        themselves to Federal management and have higher values for \n        future public access, use and enjoyment, recreation, the \n        protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife and fish and \n        wildlife habitat, and the protection of riparian lands, \n        wetland, scenic beauty and other public values.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize, direct, \nfacilitate and expedite the land exchange set forth herein in order to \nfurther the public interest by disposing of Federal lands with limited \npublic utility and acquire in exchange therefor lands with important \nvalues for permanent public management and protection.\n\nSEC. 2. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The exchange directed by this Act shall be \nconsummated if within 90 days after enactment of this Act, Lake Gulch, \nInc., a Colorado Corporation (as defined in section 4 of this Act) \noffers to transfer to the United States pursuant to the provisions of \nthis Act the offered lands or interests in land described herein.\n    (b) Conveyance by Lake Gulch.--Subject to the provisions of section \n3 of this Act, Lake Gulch shall convey to the Secretary of the Interior \nall right, title, and interest in and to the following offered lands--\n            (1) certain lands comprising approximately 40 acres with \n        improvements thereon located in Larimer County, Colorado, and \n        lying within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park as \n        generally depicted on a map entitled ``Circle C Church Camp'', \n        dated August 1994, which shall upon their acquisition by the \n        United States and without further action by the Secretary of \n        the Interior be incorporated into Rocky Mountain National Park \n        and thereafter be administered in accordance with the laws, \n        rules and regulations generally applicable to the National Park \n        System and Rocky Mountain National Park;\n            (2) certain lands located within and adjacent to the United \n        States Bureau of Land Management San Luis Resource Area in \n        Conejos County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 3,993 \n        acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Quinlan \n        Ranches Tract'', dated August 1994; and\n            (3) certain lands located within the United States Bureau \n        of Land Management Royal Gorge Resource Area in Huerfano \n        County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 4,700 acres and \n        are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Bonham Ranch-\n        Cucharas Canyon'', dated June 1995: Provided, That it is the \n        intention of Congress that such lands may remain available for \n        the grazing of livestock as determined appropriate by the \n        Secretary in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and \n        regulations: Provided further, That if the Secretary determines \n        that certain of the lands acquired adjacent to Cucharas Canyon \n        hereunder are not needed for public purposes they may be sold \n        in accordance with the provisions of section 203 of the Federal \n        Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and other applicable \n        law.\n    (c) Substitution of Lands.--If one or more of the precise offered \nland parcels identified above is unable to be conveyed to the United \nStates due to appraisal or other problems, Lake Gulch and the Secretary \nmay mutually\n agree to substitute therefor alternative offered lands acceptable to \nthe Secretary.\n    (d) Conveyance by the United States.--(1) Upon receipt of title to \nthe lands identified in subsection (a) the Secretary shall \nsimultaneously convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, and interest of \nthe United States, subject to valid existing rights, in and to the \nfollowing selected lands--\n            (A) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n        Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n        Meridian, Section 18, Lots 118-220, which comprise \n        approximately 195 acres and are intended to include all \n        federally owned lands in section 18, as generally depicted on a \n        map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994;\n            (B) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n        Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n        Meridian, Section 17, Lots 37, 38, 39, 40, 52, 53, and 54, \n        which comprise approximately 96 acres, as generally depicted on \n        a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994; \n        and\n            (C) certain unsurveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n        Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 73 West, Sixth Principal \n        Meridian, Section 13, which comprise approximately 11 acres, \n        and are generally depicted as parcels 302-304, 306, and 308-326 \n        on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n        1994: Provided, however, That a parcel or parcels of land in \n        section 13 shall not be transferred to Lake Gulch if at the \n        time of the proposed transfer the parcel or parcels are under \n        formal application for transfer to a qualified unit of local \n        government. Due to the small and unsurveyed nature of such \n        parcels proposed for transfer to Lake Gulch in section 13, and \n        the high cost of surveying such small parcels, the Secretary is \n        authorized to transfer such section 13 lands to Lake Gulch \n        without survey based on such legal or other description as the \n        Secretary determines appropriate to carry out the basic intent \n        of the map cited in this subparagraph.\n    (2) If the Secretary and Lake Gulch mutually agree, and the \nSecretary determines it is in the public interest, the Secretary may \nutilize the authority and direction of this Act to transfer to Lake \nGulch lands in sections 17 and 13 that are in addition to those precise \nselected lands shown on the map cited herein, and which are not under \nformal application for transfer to a qualified unit of local \ngovernment, upon transfer to the Secretary of additional offered lands \nacceptable to the Secretary or upon payment to the Secretary by Lake \nGulch of cash equalization money amounting to the full appraised fair \nmarket value of any such additional lands. If any such additional lands \nare located in section 13 they may be transferred to Lake Gulch without \nsurvey based on such legal or other description as the Secretary \ndetermines appropriate as long as the Secretary determines that the \nboundaries of any adjacent lands not owned by Lake Gulch can be \nproperly identified so as to avoid possible future boundary conflicts \nor disputes. If the Secretary determines surveys are necessary to \nconvey any such additional lands to Lake Gulch, the costs of such \nsurveys shall be paid by Lake Gulch but shall not be eligible for any \nadjustment in the value of such additional lands pursuant to section \n206(f)(2) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (as \namended by the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988) (43 \nU.S.C. 1716(f)(2)).\n    (3) Prior to transferring out of public ownership pursuant to this \nAct or other authority of law any lands which are contiguous to North \nClear Creek southeast of the City of Black Hawk, Colorado in the County \nof Gilpin, Colorado, the Secretary shall notify and consult with the \nCounty and City and afford such units of local government an \nopportunity to acquire or reserve pursuant to the Federal Land Policy \nand Management Act of 1976 or other applicable law, such easements or \nrights-of-way parallel to North Clear Creek as may be necessary to \nserve public utility line or recreation path needs: Provided, however, \nThat any survey or other costs associated with the acquisition or \nreservation of such easements or rights-of-way shall be paid for by the \nunit or units of local government concerned.\n\nSEC. 3.
