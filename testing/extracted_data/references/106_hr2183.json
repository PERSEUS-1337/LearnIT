and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c)(1) A church plan meets the requirements of this subsection \nif--\n            ``(A) the plan is established and maintained by a church or \n        a convention or association of churches, including an \n        organization described in section 3(33)(C)(i);\n            ``(B) such church, convention or association of churches, \n        or organization has engaged in substantial operations for more \n        than 5 years in connection with the administration or funding \n        of 1 or more employee benefit plans; and\n            ``(C) such church, convention or association of churches, \n        or organization has filed with the Secretary before the end of \n        each plan year to which this subsection applies an affidavit of \n        a fiduciary attesting that the plan (including any trust \n        forming a part of the plan) meets the requirements of this \n        subsection, specifying the name of the plan, the address of the \n        principal place of business of the plan, the name of the plan \n        administrator, the address of the plan administrator, the total \n        number of participants, and providing such additional \n        information as the Secretary may determine by regulation may be \n        provided without significant burden to the plan.\nThe Secretary shall consult with the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners in issuing regulations under subparagraph (C).\n    ``(2) The requirements of this subsection shall be construed so as \nto maintain a rebuttable presumption against the superseding of State \nlaw.\n    ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term `church plan' \nexcludes any other entity, irrespective of any affiliation with the \nplan (or with a trust forming a part of the plan), to the extent that \nsuch entity's principle purpose or function is other than the \nadministration or funding of benefits under an employee benefit plan \nfor the employees of a church or convention or association of churches.\n    ``(4) Except as specifically provided in paragraph (5), nothing in \nthis subsection shall be construed to affect any State law--\n            ``(A) to the extent that it applies to an insurance \n        company, or insurer, including a health maintenance \n        organization or provider service organization; or\n            ``(B) which is enacted for the purpose of the regulation of \n        the business of insurance, except to the extent that such law \n        is applied directly to a church plan meeting the requirements \n        of this subsection (or any trust forming a part of the plan).\n    ``(5) This title shall supersede any provision of State law which, \nsolely because a church plan meeting the requirements of this \nsubsection (or a trust forming a part of such plan) does not comply \nwith a State law otherwise superseded by this title, prohibits--\n            ``(A) an agent or broker, otherwise authorized to engage in \n        the sale of insurance within a State, from engaging in a sale \n        of insurance in connection with a church plan meeting the \n        requirements of this subsection (or a trust forming a part of \n        such a plan);\n            ``(B) an insurer, otherwise authorized to engage in the \n        sale of stop-loss insurance, from issuing a stop-loss policy in \n        connection with a church plan meeting the requirements of this \n        subsection (or a trust forming a part of such a plan); or\n            ``(C) a service provider, otherwise authorized to engage in \n        the provision of services within a State, from providing \n        services in connection with a church plan meeting the \n        requirements of this subsection.\n    ``(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to--\n            ``(A) alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or \n        supersede any other law of the United States or any rule or \n        regulation issued under any such law;\n            ``(B) alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or \n        supersede any law of any State, or any rule or regulation \n        issued under any such law, unless specifically so provided in \n        this subsection;\n            ``(C) alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or \n        supersede any State law to the extent that it imposes \n        requirements on policies or contracts of insurance purchased by \n        church plans meeting the requirements of this subsection;
