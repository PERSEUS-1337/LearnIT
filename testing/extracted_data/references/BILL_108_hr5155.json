FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Prescription drugs are increasingly expensive and \n        unaffordable for the patients that need them. The Congressional \n        Budget Office estimates that drug costs have risen at a 19.1 \n        percent annual rate over the last eight years and projects that \n        they will rise at a 10.1 percent rate annual over the next \n        decade. Drug prices are far higher in the United States than in \n        any other developed country because it is the only country that \n        grants pharmaceutical companies a monopoly in the market, based \n        on patent protection, without any corresponding restriction on \n        prices.\n            (2) New pharmaceuticals are decreasing in number and \n        quality. In 2002, 17 new drugs classified as new compounds were \n        approved by the Food and Drug Administration (``FDA''), down \n        from 24 in 2001 and 27 in 2000. The vast majority of new drugs \n        are not breakthrough cures, but rather copycat drugs. According \n        to the FDA, more than 70 percent of new drugs approved in the \n        last decade do not constitute qualitative improvements over \n        existing treatments.\n            (3) Pharmaceutical manufacturers have distorted the quality \n        of drug research in many instances, such as with the drug \n        Celebrex. Often due to the influence of the funding source, \n        drug research has been shown to suffer from concealed and \n        distorted findings, bias, conflicts of interest, and secrecy.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND \n              DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    Part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 \net seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following subpart:\n\n     ``Subpart 19--National Institute for Biomedical Research and \n                              Development\n\n                       ``purpose of the institute\n\n    ``Sec. 464z-1.
