FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) 1 out of every 10 jobs in the United States, or about \n        13,000,000, is related to automobiles.\n            (2) The automotive sector represents the largest \n        manufacturing base in the United States and each automobile \n        assembly plant generates about 5 jobs among suppliers and the \n        surrounding community.\n            (3) Automobile parts manufacturers account for 4,500,000 \n        private industry jobs, including nearly 2,000,000 indirect jobs \n        in industries ranging from steel and plastics to technical \n        services.\n            (4) Automobile dealerships employ 1,100,000 workers and \n        account for 18 percent of all retail sales in the United \n        States.\n            (5) In 2005, 16,900,000 new automobiles were sold in the \n        United States, but in 2008, only 13,200,000 new automobiles \n        were sold.\n            (6) This loss of 3,700,000 new automobile sales, at an \n        average price of $28,400, directly removed $105,000,000,000 \n        from the economy.\n            (7) Economic multiplier effects of between 3 and 7 percent \n        mean that this decline of new automobile sales translates into \n        a $315,000,000,000 to $735,000,000,000 loss to the economy of \n        the United States.\n            (8) Only 1,345,885 vehicles were sold in the United States \n        during January and February of 2009, representing a 39 percent \n        decrease from January and February of 2008.\n            (9) The best way to help the United States automobile \n        industry and manufacturing base recover is to set a goal of \n        selling 15,000,000 new automobiles in 2009 in order to restart \n        the United States economy.\n\nSEC. 3. NEW AUTOMOBILE VOUCHER PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Department of the \nTreasury a program to be known as the ``New Automobile Voucher \nProgram'', through which the Secretary shall--\n            (1) authorize the issuance of a voucher, subject to the \n        specifications described in subsection (b), to a dealer for \n        each person or eligible fleet operator who purchases an \n        eligible new automobile from such dealer, which voucher shall \n        be applied towards such purchase;\n            (2) allow any dealer to participate in the Program if the \n        dealer agrees to--\n                    (A) apply a voucher towards the purchase of an \n                eligible new automobile as partial payment for each \n                eligible person or eligible fleet operator at the time \n                of purchase; and\n                    (B) comply with all applicable requirements under \n                this Act and regulations promulgated by the Secretary \n                to carry out this Act;\n            (3) establish a Web-based electronic system to process the \n        vouchers at the point of sale;\n            (4) certify that the Program is operational; and\n            (5) make payments to dealers for vouchers applied by such \n        dealers under paragraph (2) in accordance with the provisions \n        of this section.\n    (b) Program Specifications.--\n            (1) Vouchers per person.--Not more than 1 voucher may be \n        issued for any person, unless such person is an eligible fleet \n        operator.\n            (2) Vouchers per eligible new automobile.--Not more than 1 \n        voucher may be applied to each eligible new automobile.\n            (3) Offset.--A dealer--\n                    (A) shall credit the amount of the voucher being \n                applied toward the purchase of an eligible new \n                automobile; and\n                    (B) may not offset the amount of the voucher \n                against any other rebate or discount otherwise being \n                offered by the dealer or manufacturer.\n            (4) Combination with other incentives permitted.--\n        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the availability or \n        use of a Federal or State tax incentive or a State-issued \n        voucher for the purchase of an eligible new automobile shall \n        not limit the value or issuance of a voucher under the Program \n        for any eligible person or eligible fleet operator.\n            (5) Voucher.--\n                    (A) Paperless voucher.--Any voucher issued under \n                this section shall be issued electronically through a \n                Web-based electronic system.\n                    (B) Value of voucher during the initial period.--A \n                voucher issued under the Program during the initial \n                period may be applied to offset the purchase price of \n                an eligible new automobile by $5,000.\n                    (C) Value of voucher during the secondary period.--\n                A voucher issued under the Program during the secondary \n                period may be applied to offset the purchase price of \n                an eligible new automobile by $2,500.\n            (6) Prompt fulfillment of redemption requests required.--\n        The Secretary shall provide for the payment of all vouchers \n        submitted to the Secretary for redemption in accordance with \n        the provisions of this Act not later than 10 days after such \n        submission, or within such lesser period as the Secretary \n        determines to be practicable.\n    (c) Rulemaking.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations to \nimplement the Program, including the enforcement of the penalties \ndescribed in section 4.\n    (d) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this Act or any other provision of law \nlimits the authority of Congress or the Secretary to terminate or limit \nthe Program or the issuance of vouchers under the Program.\n\nSEC. 4.
