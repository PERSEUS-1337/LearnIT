FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Article I, section 9, of the United States Constitution \n        makes Congress responsible for all money drawn from the United \n        States Treasury.\n            (2) The United States national debt now exceeds \n        $12,600,000,000,000.\n            (3) The Federal budget deficit is projected to amount to \n        $1,300,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and the annual deficits \n        will average nearly $1,000,000,000,000 for the next decade, \n        according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n            (4) Each American's share of the United States national \n        debt amounts to more than $41,000.\n            (5) The United States national debt increases more than \n        $4,000,000,000 each day.\n            (6) Foreign investors held 48 percent of the United States' \n        outstanding public debt at the end of 2009, including \n        $776,400,000,000 the United States owes to Communist China.\n            (7) For the first time ever, the Federal budget deficit has \n        been singled out as the most important issue facing the future \n        of the country, according to a Gallup poll conducted between \n        March 4 and March 7, 2010.\n            (8) Eighty-three percent of Americans say the size of the \n        Federal budget deficit is due to the unwillingness of \n        politicians to cut Government spending and just 11 percent \n        think the Government spends taxpayers' money wisely, according \n        to a national survey conducted between February 2 and February \n        3, 2010, by Rasmussen Reports.\n            (9) More than twice as many United States adults (58 \n        percent) say that debt owed to China is a more serious threat \n        to the long-term security and well-being of the United States \n        than is terrorism from radical Islamic terrorists (27 percent), \n        according to a Zogby Interactive survey conducted between \n        February 17 and February 19, 2010.\n            (10) For the reasons specified in paragraphs (1) through \n        (9)--\n                    (A) Congress should make balancing the Federal \n                budget an urgent priority to protect the national \n                security, financial stability, and standard of living \n                of the United States;\n                    (B) because Congress has long refused to make the \n                tough decisions necessary to cut wasteful spending, \n                reducing the national debt limit is the only sure way \n                to force Congress to live within its means; and\n                    (C) the pay for members of Congress, who are \n                constitutionally responsible for the money drawn from \n                the United States Treasury and the debt that results \n                from excessive spending, should not be increased until \n                Congress has balanced the Federal budget.\n\nSEC. 3.
