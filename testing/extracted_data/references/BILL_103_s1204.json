FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the interest of the United States to maximize \n        economic return from the growing trade in cruise ship sailings \n        to and from Alaska by encouraging the use of United States \n        berthing and repair facilities, labor, supplies, and other \n        services, as well as the growth of new enterprises such as the \n        carriage of passengers on luxury cruises between ports in \n        Alaska.\n            (2) In promoting additional economic benefits to the United \n        States from the cruise ship industry, there is a need to ensure \n        that existing employment and economic activity associated with \n        the Alaska Marine Highway System, United States-flag tour boats \n        operating from Alaska ports, and similar efforts are protected \n        from adverse impacts.\n            (3) Cruise ship sailings to Alaska comprise a vital and \n        growing segment of the United States travel industry. The \n        number of passengers entering or leaving Alaska via cruise ship \n        increased by 14 percent in the last two years alone, and is \n        expected to continue increasing at a similar or higher rate.\n            (4) No United States-flag cruise ships are presently \n        available to enter the Alaska trade. Thus, all cruise ships \n        carrying passengers to and from Alaska destinations are \n        foreign-flag vessels which are precluded, under current law, \n        from carrying passengers from other United States ports to \n        ports in Alaska, and from carrying passengers between ports in \n        Alaska.\n            (5) The City of Vancouver, British Columbia receives \n        substantial economic benefit through providing services to \n        cruise ships in the Alaska trade, including direct and indirect \n        employment of 2,435 persons in 1992, and direct and indirect \n        payments for goods and services of $119,700,000.\n            (6) The transfer of cruise ship-based economic activity \n        from Vancouver, British Columbia to United States ports could, \n        at 1992 spending levels, yield additional Federal Government \n        revenues of $97,600,000 per annum, and additional State and \n        local government revenues of $29,700,000.\n\nSEC. 2. FOREIGN FLAG CRUISE VESSELS.\n\n    (a) Waiver.--Notwithstanding provisions of section 8 of the Act of \nJune 19, 1886 (46 U.S.C. 289), or any other provision of law, \npassengers may be transported in foreign-flag cruise vessels between \nports in Alaska and between ports in Alaska and other United States \nports, except as otherwise provided by this section.\n    (b) Coastwise Trade.--Upon a showing satisfactory to the Secretary \nof Transportation, by the owner or charterer of a United States cruise \nvessel, that service aboard such vessel qualified to engage in the \ncoastwise trade is being offered or advertised pursuant to a \nCertificate of Financial Responsibility for Indemnification of \nPassengers for Nonperformance of Transportation (46 App. U.S.C. 817e) \nfrom the Federal Maritime Commission for service in the coastwise trade \nbetween ports in Alaska or between ports in Alaska and other ports in \nthe United States, or both, the Secretary shall notify the owner or \noperator of one or more foreign-flag cruise vessels transporting \npassengers under authority of this section, if any, that he shall, \nwithin one year from the date of notification, terminate such service. \nCoastwise privileges granted to any owner or operator of a foreign-flag \ncruise vessel under this section shall expire on the 365th day \nfollowing receipt of the Secretary's notification.\n    (c) Notification.--Notifications issued by the Secretary under \nsubsection (b) of this section shall be issued to the owners or \noperators of foreign-flag cruise vessels--\n            (1) in the reverse of the order in which foreign-flag \n        cruise vessels  entered the coastwise service under this \n        section determined by the date of the vessels' first coastwise \n        sailing; and\n            (2) in the minimum number as to ensure that the passenger-\n        carrying capacity thereby removed from coastwise service \n        exceeds the passenger-carrying capacity of the United States \n        cruise vessel which is entering the service.\n    (d) Termination.--If, at the expiration of the 365-day period \nspecified in subsection (b) of this section, the United States cruise \nvessel that has offered service has not entered the coastwise passenger \ntrade between ports in Alaska or between ports in Alaska and other \nports in the United States, then the termination of service required by \nsubsection (b) shall not take effect until 90 days following the entry \ninto trade by the United States vessel.\n    (e) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the term--\n            (1) ``cruise vessel'' means a vessel of greater than 5,000 \n        deadweight tons which provides a full range of luxury \n        entertainment, personal care and food services for its \n        passengers; and\n            (2) ``foreign-flag cruise vessels'' does not apply to \n        vessels which regularly carry for hire both passengers and \n        vehicles or other cargo.\n    (f) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as \naffecting or otherwise modifying the authority contained in the Act of \nJune 30, 1961 (46 U.S.C. 289b) authorizing the transportation of \npassengers and merchandise in Canadian vessels between ports in Alaska \nand the United States."
