SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Security Assessment Feasibility for \nEquipment Testing and Evaluation of Capabilities for our Homeland Act'' \nor the ``SAFE TECH Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Administration.--The term ``Administration'' means the \n        Transportation Security Administration.\n            (2) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nSEC. 3. THIRD PARTY TESTING OF SECURITY SCREENING TECHNOLOGY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation with the \nUnder Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of \nHomeland Security, shall develop a program to enable a vendor of \ntransportation security screening technology to obtain testing, \nincluding as an alternative to the Administration's testing process \nunder paragraph (9) of section 114(f) of title 49, United States Code, \nby an appropriate third party, as determined by the Administrator, in \nconsultation with the Under Secretary, of such technology before \nprocurement or development of such technology.\n    (b) Detection Testing.--\n            (1) In general.--The third party testing program authorized \n        under subsection (a) shall include detection testing to \n        evaluate the performance of a security screening technology \n        relating to the probability of detection, the probability of \n        false alarm, and other indicators that such technology is able \n        to meet the Administration's mission needs for detection of--\n                    (A) explosives; and\n                    (B) prohibited items.\n            (2) Coordination with final processes.--To the extent \n        practicable, and without compromising the integrity of the \n        Administration's testing process under paragraph (9) of section \n        114(f) of title 49, United States Code, or the Department of \n        Homeland Security's oversight of such testing process, or \n        increasing costs to the Administration, the Administrator shall \n        coordinate the third party detection testing under paragraph \n        (1) with any associated subsequent final Department of Homeland \n        Security testing.\n            (3) International partnerships.--To the extent practicable \n        and permissible under law, and in accordance with national \n        security interests of the United States, the Administrator \n        shall--\n                    (A) share with appropriate international partners \n                detection testing information and standards; and\n                    (B) coordinate with such appropriate international \n                partners to align such testing information and \n                standards to maximize the capability to detect \n                explosives and other threats.\n    (c) Alternative Testing Factors.--Third party testing under \nsubsection (a) may include as an alternative, at the discretion of the \nAdministrator, the testing at the TSA Systems Integration Facility of \nthe Administration, including testing for--\n            (1) health and safety factors;\n            (2) operator interface;\n            (3) human factors;\n            (4) environmental factors;\n            (5) throughput;\n            (6) reliability, maintainability, and availability factors; \n        and\n            (7) interoperability.\n    (d) Testing Framework.--The Administrator, in consultation with the \nUnder Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of \nHomeland Security, shall--\n            (1) establish a framework for the third party testing under \n        this section to determine if the security screening technology \n        that is the subject of such testing satisfies the \n        Administration's requirements before such technology may enter \n        or re-enter, as applicable, operational testing at an airport \n        or other transportation facility; and\n            (2) use phased implementation to allow the Administration \n        and the third party concerned to establish best practices.\n    (e) Prioritization of Third Party Testing.--The Administrator may \nprioritize, when appropriate, the field testing of security screening \ntechnology and equipment by third parties.\n    (f) Eligible Entities.--\n            (1) United states ownership.--An entity providing third \n        party testing under the program developed pursuant to \n        subsection (a) shall be owned and controlled by a citizen of \n        the United States.\n            (2) Waiver.--The Administrator may waive the requirement \n        specified in paragraph (1) with respect to an entity that is a \n        United States subsidiary of a parent company that has \n        implemented a foreign ownership, control, or influence \n        mitigation plan that has been approved by the Defense Security \n        Service of the Department of Defense prior to seeking to engage \n        in third party testing. The Administrator has complete \n        discretion to reject any proposal from a company to provide \n        testing under subsection (a) that requires a waiver under this \n        paragraph.\n            (3) Conflicts of interest.--The Administrator shall ensure, \n        to the extent possible, that an entity providing third party \n        testing under this section does not have a contractual, \n        business, or other pecuniary interest (exclusive of any such \n        testing) in--\n                    (A) the security screening technology subject to \n                such testing; or the\n                    (B) vendor of such technology.\n\nSEC. 4. RECIPROCAL RECOGNITION OF SECURITY STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Administrator, in coordination with the \nEuropean Civil Aviation Conference, shall continue development of a \nvalidation process for the reciprocal recognition of security \nvalidation processes for recognition of security screening technologies \nor certification authorities for deployment.\n    (b) Requirement.--The validation process under subsection (a) shall \nensure that the certification process of each participating \ninternational security partner or recognized certification authority \ncomplies with Administration standards.\n\nSEC. 5.
