ROLLOVER OF AMOUNTS RECEIVED IN AIRLINE CARRIER BANKRUPTCY.\n\n    (a) General Rules.--\n            (1) Rollover of airline payment amount.--If a qualified \n        airline employee receives any airline payment amount and \n        transfers any portion of such amount to a traditional IRA \n        within 180 days of receipt of such amount (or, if later, within \n        180 days of the date of the enactment of this Act), then such \n        amount (to the extent so transferred) shall be treated as a \n        rollover contribution described in section 402(c) of the \n        Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A qualified airline employee \n        making such a transfer may exclude from gross income the amount \n        transferred, in the taxable year in which the airline payment \n        amount was paid to the qualified airline employee by the \n        commercial passenger airline carrier.\n            (2) Transfer or amounts attributable to airline payment \n        amount following rollover to roth ira.--A qualified, airline \n        employee who has contributed an airline payment amount to a \n        Roth IRA that is treated as a qualified rollover contribution \n        pursuant to section 125 of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer \n        Recovery Act of 2008, may transfer to a traditional IRA, in a \n        trustee-to-trustee transfer, all or any part of the \n        contribution (together with any net income allocable to such \n        contribution), and the transfer to the traditional IRA will be \n        deemed to have been made at the time of the rollover to the \n        Roth IRA, if such transfer is made within 180 days of the date \n        of the enactment of this Act. A qualified airline employee \n        making such a transfer may exclude from gross income the \n        airline payment amount previously rolled over to the Roth IRA, \n        to the extent an amount attributable to the previous rollover \n        was transferred to a traditional IRA, in the taxable year in \n        which the airline payment amount was paid to the qualified \n        airline employee by the commercial passenger airline carrier. \n        No amount so transferred to a traditional IRA may be treated as \n        a qualified rollover contribution with respect to a Roth IRA \n        within the 5-taxable year period beginning with the taxable \n        year in which such transfer was made.\n            (3) Extension of time to file claim for refund.--A \n        qualified airline employee who excludes an amount from gross \n        income in a prior taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) may \n        reflect such exclusion in a claim for refund filed within the \n        period of limitation under section 6511(a) of such Code (or, if \n        later, April 15, 2013).\n            (4) Overall limitation on amounts transferred to \n        traditional iras.--\n                    (A) In general.--The aggregate amount of airline \n                payment amounts which may be transferred to 1 or more \n                traditional IRAs under paragraphs (1) and (2) with \n                respect to any qualified employee for any taxable year \n                shall not exceed the excess (if any) of--\n                            (i) 90 percent of the aggregate airline \n                        payment amounts received by the qualified \n                        airline employee during the taxable year and \n                        all preceding taxable years, over\n                            (ii) the aggregate amount of such transfers \n                        to which paragraphs (1) and (2) applied for all \n                        preceding taxable years.\n                    (B) Special rules.--For purposes of applying the \n                limitation under subparagraph (A)--\n                            (i) any airline payment amount received by \n                        the surviving spouse of any qualified employee, \n                        and any amount transferred to a traditional IRA \n                        by such spouse under subsection (d), shall be \n                        treated as an amount received or transferred by \n                        the qualified employee, and\n                            (ii) any amount transferred to a \n                        traditional IRA which is attributable to net \n                        income described in paragraph (2) shall not be \n                        taken into account.\n            (5) Covered executives not eligible to make transfers.--\n        Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply to any transfer by a \n        qualified airline employee

preceding taxable year the qualified airline \n        employee held a position described in subparagraph (A) or (B) \n        of section 162(m)(3) with the commercial passenger airline \n

\nCode of 1986 and section 209 of the Social Security Act, an airline \npayment amount shall not fail to be treated as a payment of wages by \nthe commercial passenger airline carrier to the qualified airline \nemployee in the taxable year of payment because such amount is excluded \nfrom the qualified airline employee's gross income under subsection \n(a).\n    (c) Definitions and Special
