FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 3,000,000 reports of child abuse and \n        neglect must be investigated each year.\n            (2) Approximately 1,000,000 of these reports are confirmed \n        and require ongoing intervention.\n            (3) On any given day in the United States, more than \n        500,000 children are being served outside their homes by the \n        child welfare system.\n            (4) These children are served in more than 150,000 foster \n        homes and more than 5,000 residential programs.\n            (5) The child welfare workforce crisis has developed as the \n        result of the following 3 major factors:\n                    (A) Overall low levels of unemployment and the \n                resulting increase in competition for workers in all \n                sectors of the economy.\n                    (B) The increasing numbers of children and families \n                needing service coupled with the decreasing numbers of \n                workers in the employment pool.\n                    (C) The relatively low pay and difficult working \n                conditions that exist in many child welfare agencies.\n            (6) The vacancy rate in State child welfare agencies is 8.1 \n        percent, and 14.3 percent for private agencies.\n            (7) The overall turnover rate in child welfare agencies has \n        doubled since 1991, to 13.9 percent in public agencies and to \n        46.5 percent in private agencies.\n            (8) The child welfare workforce crisis is real and is \n        already compromising the ability of the child welfare system to \n        effectively provide essential services to its children and \n        families. In addition, analysis of trends indicates that the \n        situation will worsen over the next decade. It is clear that \n        steps must be taken now to encourage more workers to enter the \n        child welfare services field and to improve the salaries, \n        working conditions, and training of workers who provide these \n        critically important services.\n\nSEC. 2.
