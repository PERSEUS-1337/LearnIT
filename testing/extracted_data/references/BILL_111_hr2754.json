FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nurse-managed health clinics (referred to in this \n        section as ``NMHCs'') offer their patients primary care and \n        wellness services based on the nursing model, which emphasizes \n        the protection, promotion, and optimization of health along \n        with the prevention of illness, and the alleviation of \n        suffering in conjunction with diagnosis and treatment. Nurses \n        are advocates and educators providing care for individuals, \n        families, communities, and populations.\n            (2) More than 200 NMHCs are currently in operation across \n        the United States. Such clinics record over 2,000,000 client \n        encounters annually.\n            (3) NMHCs offering primary care services meet the Institute \n        of Medicine's definition of safety-net provider by providing \n        care regardless of their patients' ability to pay. A \n        substantial share of the patient mix is made up of uninsured \n        individuals, Medicaid recipients, State Children's Health \n        Insurance Program recipients, and other vulnerable populations. \n        A recent study funded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n        Services reported that more than 45 percent of the payor mix \n        for NMHCs is uninsured, and 37 percent are Medicaid recipients.\n            (4) NMHC patients are very diverse. According to recent \n        data, 46 percent of NMHC patients are Caucasian, 29 percent are \n        African-American, and another 20 percent are Latino.\n            (5) Approximately 133,000,000 people in the United States \n        (45 percent of the population) have at least 1 chronic disease. \n        These diseases account for 81 percent of hospital admissions, \n        91 percent of all prescriptions filled, and 76 percent of all \n        physician visits. About 75 percent of health care spending in \n        the United States is related to chronic care. Chronic disease \n        management programs have the potential to reduce costs and \n        improve outcomes for chronically ill patients. NMHCs providing \n        wellness services strengthen the health care safety-net by \n        expanding access to chronic disease management services for \n        geriatric and medically underserved populations.\n            (6) NMHCs offering primary care provide a medical home for \n        medically underserved individuals, and are viable partners with \n        the Federal Government to reduce health disparities. They \n        provide a full range of health care services, including primary \n        care, wellness services, and behavioral health care to the \n        residents of rural and urban underserved communities. Because \n        NMHCs are often located in public housing developments, senior \n        living arrangements, schools, and community centers, they help \n        remove barriers preventing access to care and are instrumental \n        in addressing and eliminating the factors contributing to \n        health disparities.\n            (7) NMHCs offering wellness services reinforce the medical \n        home concept by providing a critical first level of care for \n        populations living in rural areas with limited access to \n        physicians and other primary care providers. NMHC patients \n        participating in wellness services are connected to a medical \n        home through established referral networks.\n            (8) As new strategies for increasing health coverage are \n        implemented, utilization of nurse-managed health clinics \n        offering both primary care and wellness services will help meet \n        the increased demand arising from newly covered individuals \n        while alleviating current primary care physician shortages.\n            (9) In spite of their numerous benefits, NMHCs of all types \n        have limited access to both Federal and State funding. \n        Initially, many NMHCs were established through grants from the \n        Division of Nursing of the Health Resources and Services \n        Administration (referred to in this paragraph as the ``Division \n        of Nursing''). Soon after their inception, NMHC directors \n        recognized their patients had a desperate need for primary care \n        and wellness services, a need that continues. To meet that \n        need, NHMCs across the country have expanded their mission to \n        focus on increasing access to primary care and wellness \n        services the medically underserved populations, while still \n        maintaining their role as clinical sites for nursing education. \n        Available sources of Division of Nursing grant funding cannot \n        accommodate the increased cost associated with caring for the \n        uninsured and medically underserved populations that has \n        accompanied the expanding focus of nurse-managed care. As a \n        result, 50 percent of the NMHCs established between 1993 and \n        2007 have had to close. Such clinics frequently are the only \n        source of health care for their patients, and such closures \n        have left thousands without health care.\n            (10) In recognition of the growing needs of NMHCs, in \n        Senate Report 109-103, Congress called on the Bureau of Primary \n        Health Care (BPHC) to ``consider establishing a grant program . \n        . . that would support the establishment or expansion of nurse \n        practice arrangements commonly referred to as nurse-managed \n        health centers . . .''. The goal of this Act is to comply with \n        the language of such Senate Report by establishing a grant \n        program within BPHC that is a better fit for the changing role \n        of NMHCs. The program will give NMHCs access to a stable source \n        of funding, further enabling them to expand primary care and \n        wellness services in underserved communities, while reducing \n        the level of health disparities that vulnerable populations \n        throughout the Nation face.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to fund the development \nand operation of nurse-managed health clinics to--\n            (1) provide comprehensive and accessible primary health \n        care and wellness services to vulnerable populations living in \n        the Nation's medically underserved communities; and\n            (2) reduce the level of health disparities experienced by \n        vulnerable populations.\n\nSEC. 3.
