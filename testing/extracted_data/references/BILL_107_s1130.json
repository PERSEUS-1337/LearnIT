FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) economic prosperity is closely linked to an affordable \n        and ample energy supply;\n            (2) environmental quality is closely linked to energy \n        production and use;\n            (3) population, worldwide economic development, energy \n        consumption, and stress on the environment are all expected to \n        increase substantially in the coming decades;\n            (4) the few energy options with the potential to meet \n        economic and environmental needs for the long-term future must \n        be pursued aggressively now, as part of a balanced national \n        energy plan;\n            (5) fusion energy is a long-term energy solution that is \n        expected to be environmentally benign, safe, and economical, \n        and to use a fuel source that is practically unlimited;\n            (6) the National Academy of Sciences, the President's \n        Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology, and the \n        Secretary of Energy Advisory Board have each recently reviewed \n        the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and each strongly supports \n        the fundamental science and creative innovation of the program, \n        and has confirmed that progress toward the goal of producing \n        practical fusion energy has been excellent;\n            (7) each of these reviews stressed the need for the Fusion \n        Energy Sciences Program to move forward to a magnetic fusion \n        burning plasma experiment, capable of producing substantial \n        fusion power output and providing key information for the \n        advancement of fusion science;\n            (8) the National Academy of Sciences has also called for a \n        broadening of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program research base \n        as a means to more fully integrate the fusion science community \n        into the broader scientific community; and\n            (9) the Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is inadequate \n        to support the necessary science and innovation for the present \n        generation of experiments, and cannot accommodate the cost of a \n        burning plasma experiment constructed by the United States, or \n        even the cost of key participation by the United States in an \n        international effort.\n\nSEC. 3. PLAN FOR FUSION EXPERIMENT.\n\n    (a) Plan for United States Fusion Experiment.--The Secretary of \nEnergy (in this Act referred to as ``the Secretary''), on the basis of \nfull consultation with, and the recommendation of, the Fusion Energy \nSciences Advisory Committee (in this Act referred to as ``FESAC''), \nshall develop a plan for United States construction of a magnetic \nfusion burning plasma experiment for the purpose of accelerating \nscientific understanding of fusion plasmas. The Secretary shall request \na review of the plan by the National Academy of Sciences, and shall \ntransmit the plan and the review to the Congress by July 1, 2004.\n    (b) Requirements of Plan.--The plan described in subsection (a) \nshall--\n            (1) address key burning plasma physics issues; and\n            (2) include specific information on the scientific \n        capabilities of the proposed experiment, the relevance of these \n        capabilities to the goal of practical fusion energy, and the \n        overall design of the experiment including its estimated cost \n        and potential construction sites.\n    (c) United States Participation in an International Experiment.--In \naddition to the plan described in subsection (a), the Secretary, on the \nbasis of full consultation with, and the recommendation of, FESAC, may \nalso develop a plan for United States participation in an international \nburning plasma experiment for the same purpose, whose construction is \nfound by the Secretary to be highly likely and where United States \nparticipation is cost effective relative to the cost and scientific \nbenefits of a domestic experiment described in subsection (a). If the \nSecretary elects to develop a plan under this subsection, he shall \ninclude the information described in subsection (b), and an estimate of \nthe cost of United States participation in such an international \nexperiment. The Secretary shall request a review by the National \nAcademies of Sciences and Engineering of a plan developed under this \nsubsection, and shall transmit the plan and the review to the Congress \nno later than July 1, 2004.\n    (d) Authorization of Research and Development.--The Secretary, \nthrough the Fusion Energy Sciences Program, may conduct any research \nand development necessary to fully develop the plans described in this \nsection.\n\nSEC. 4. PLAN FOR FUSION ENERGY SCIENCES PROGRAM.\n\n    Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary, in full consultation with FESAC, shall develop and \ntransmit to the Congress a plan for the purpose of ensuring a strong \nscientific base for the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and to enable \nthe experiment described in section 3. Such plan shall include as its \nobjectives--\n            (1) to ensure that existing fusion research facilities and \n        equipment are more fully utilized with appropriate measurements \n        and control tools;\n            (2) to ensure a strengthened fusion science theory and \n        computational base;\n            (3) to encourage and ensure that the selection of and \n        funding for new magnetic and inertial fusion research \n        facilities is based on scientific innovation and cost \n        effectiveness;\n            (4) to improve the communication of scientific results and \n        methods between the fusion science community and the wider \n        scientific community;\n            (5) to ensure that adequate support is provided to optimize \n        the design of the magnetic fusion burning plasma experiments \n        referred to in section 3; and\n            (6) to ensure that inertial confinement fusion facilities \n        are utilized to the extent practicable for the purpose of \n        inertial fusion energy research and development.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for the \ndevelopment and review of the plans described in this Act and for \nactivities of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program $320,000,000 for \nfiscal year 2002 and $335,000,000 for fiscal year 2003."
