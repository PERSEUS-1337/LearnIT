Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Promoting small hydroelectric power projects.\nSec. 4. Promoting conduit hydropower projects.\nSec. 5. FERC authority to extend preliminary permit terms.\nSec. 6. Promoting hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed \n                            loop pumped storage projects.\nSec. 7.

Authorization of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the hydropower industry currently employs approximately \n        300,000 workers across the United States;\n            (2) hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable \n        electricity in the United States;\n            (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, hydropower \n        resources, including pumped storage facilities, provide--\n                    (A) nearly 7 percent of the electricity generated \n                in the United States; and\n                    (B) approximately 100,000 megawatts of electric \n                capacity in the United States;\n            (4) only 3 percent of the 80,000 dams in the United States \n        generate electricity, so there is substantial potential for \n        adding hydropower generation to nonpowered dams; and\n            (5) by utilizing currently untapped resources, the United \n        States could add approximately 60,000 megawatts of new \n        hydropower capacity by 2025, which could create 700,000 new \n        direct jobs over the next 14 years.\n\nSEC. 3. PROMOTING SMALL HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS.\n\n    Subsection (d) of section 405 of the Public Utility Regulatory \nPolicies Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2705) is amended by striking ``5,000'' \nand inserting ``10,000''.\n\nSEC. 4.

FERC AUTHORITY TO EXTEND PRELIMINARY PERMIT TERMS.\n\n    Section 5 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 798) is amended--\n            (1) by designating the first, second, and third sentences \n        as subsections (a), (c), and (d), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (a) (as so designated) \n        the following:\n    ``(b) Extension.--The Commission may extend the term of a \npreliminary permit once for not more than 2 additional years if the \nCommission finds that the permittee has carried out activities under \nthe permit in good faith and with reasonable diligence.''.\n\nSEC. 6. PROMOTING HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT AT NONPOWERED DAMS AND CLOSED \n              LOOP PUMPED STORAGE PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--To improve the regulatory process and reduce \ndelays and costs for hydropower development at nonpowered dams and \nclosed loop pumped storage projects, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (referred to in this section as the ``Commission'') shall \ninvestigate the feasibility of the issuance of a license for hydropower \ndevelopment at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects \nin a 2-year period (referred to in this section as a ``2-year \nprocess''). Such a 2-year process shall include any prefiling licensing \nprocess of the Commission.\n    (b) Workshops and Pilots.--The Commission shall--\n            (1) not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, hold an initial workshop to solicit public comment \n        and recommendations on how to implement a 2-year process;\n            (2) develop criteria for identifying projects featuring \n        hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop \n        pumped storage projects that may be appropriate for licensing \n        within a 2-year process;\n            (3) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n        this Act, develop and implement pilot projects to test a 2-year \n        process, if practicable; and\n            (4) not later than 3 years after the date of implementation \n        of the final pilot project testing a 2-year process, hold a \n        final workshop to solicit public comment on the effectiveness \n        of each tested 2-year process.\n    (c) Memorandum of Understanding.--The Commission shall, to the \nextent practicable, enter into a memorandum of understanding with any \napplicable Federal or State agency to implement a pilot project \ndescribed in subsection (b).\n    (d) Reports.--\n            (1) Pilot projects not implemented.--If the Commission \n        determines that no pilot project described in subsection (b) is \n        practicable because no 2-year process is practicable, not later \n        than 240 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n        Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce \n        of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and \n        Natural Resources of the Senate a report that--\n                    (A) describes the public comments received as part \n                of the initial workshop held under subsection (b)(1); \n                and\n                    (B) identifies the process, legal, environmental, \n                economic, and other issues that justify the \n                determination of the Commission that no 2-year process \n                is practicable, with recommendations on how Congress \n                may address or remedy the identified issues.\n            (2) Pilot projects implemented.--If the Commission develops \n        and implements pilot projects involving a 2-year process, not \n        later than 60 days after the date of completion of the final \n        workshop held under subsection (b)(4), the Commission shall \n        submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \n        Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n        Resources of the Senate a report that--\n                    (A) describes the outcomes of the pilot projects;\n                    (B) describes the public comments from the final \n                workshop on the effectiveness of each tested 2-year \n                process; and\n                    (C)(i) outlines how the Commission will adopt \n                policies under existing law (including regulations) \n                that result in a 2-year process;\n                    (ii) outlines how the Commission will issue new \n                regulations to adopt a 2-year process; or\n                    (iii) identifies the process, legal, environmental, \n                economic, and other issues that justify a determination \n                of the Commission that no 2-year process is \n                practicable, with recommendations on how Congress may \n                address or remedy the identified issues.\n\nSEC. 7. DOE STUDY OF PUMPED STORAGE AND POTENTIAL HYDROPOWER FROM \n              CONDUITS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy shall conduct a study--\n            (1) of the potential megawatts of hydropower that may be \n        obtained from conduits (as defined by the Secretary) in the \n        United States; and\n            (2) of land, including identification of land, that is \n        well-suited for pumped storage sites and is located near \n        existing or potential sites of intermittent renewable energy \n        resource development, such as wind farms.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report that describes \nthe results of the study conducted under subsection (a), including any \nrecommendations.\n\nSEC. 8.
