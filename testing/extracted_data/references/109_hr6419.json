    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Convention on the Physical Protection of \n        Nuclear Material'' means the Convention on the Physical \n        Protection of Nuclear Material, signed at New York and Vienna \n        March 3, 1980.\n            (2) The term ``design-basis threat'' means a profile of the \n        type, composition, and capabilities of an adversary.\n            (3) The term ``formula quantities of strategic special \n        nuclear material'' means uranium-235 (contained in uranium \n        enriched to 20 percent or more in the U-235 isotope), uranium-\n        233, or plutonium in any combination in a total quantity of \n        5,000 grams or more computed by the formula, grams = (grams \n        contained U-235) + 2.5 (grams U-233 + grams plutonium), as set \n        forth in the definitions of ``formula quantities'' and \n        ``strategic special nuclear material'' in section 73.2 of title \n        10, Code of Federal Regulations.\n            (4) The term ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'' means the \n        Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n        Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into \n        force March 5, 1970 (21 UST 483).\n            (5) The term ``nuclear weapon'' means any device utilizing \n        atomic energy, exclusive of the means for transporting or \n        propelling the device (where such means is a separable and \n        divisible part of the device), the principal purpose of which \n        is for use as, or for the development of, a weapon, a weapon \n        prototype, or a weapon test device.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The possibility that terrorists may acquire and use a \n        nuclear weapon against the United States is an urgent threat to \n        the security of our nation and the world.\n            (2) Existing programs intended to secure, monitor, and \n        reduce nuclear stockpiles, redirect nuclear scientists, and \n        interdict nuclear smuggling have made substantial progress, but \n        additional efforts are needed to reduce the threat of nuclear \n        terrorism as much as possible.\n            (3) The September 2006 ``National Strategy for Combating \n        Terrorism'' issued by the White House states, ``Weapons of mass \n        destruction in the hands of terrorists is one of the gravest \n        threats we face.''\n            (4) United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said \n        that a nuclear terror attack ``would not only cause widespread \n        death and destruction, but would stagger the world economy and \n        thrust tens of millions of people into dire poverty''.\n            (5) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) \n        reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with \n        the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international \n        peace and security caused by terrorist acts and directs that \n        all countries, in accordance with their national procedures, \n        shall adopt and enforce effective laws that prohibit any non-\n        state actor from manufacturing, acquiring, possessing, \n        developing, transporting, transferring, or using nuclear, \n        chemical, or biological weapons and their means of delivery, in \n        particular for terrorist purposes, and to prohibit attempts to \n        engage in any of the foregoing activities, participate in them \n        as an accomplice, or assist or finance them.\n            (6) The Director General of the International Atomic Energy \n        Agency, Dr. Mohammed El Baradei, has said that it is a ``race \n        against time'' to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear \n        weapon.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the threat of nuclear terror is the most horrific \n        threat the United States faces;\n            (2) the United States must take a comprehensive approach to \n        reducing this danger, including additional efforts to identify \n        and eliminate terrorist groups that aim to acquire nuclear \n        weapons, to ensure that nuclear weapons and formula quantities \n        of strategic special nuclear material around the world are \n        secure and accounted for to a degree sufficient to defeat the \n        threat that terrorists and criminals have shown they can pose, \n        and to increase the ability to find and stop terrorist efforts \n        to manufacture nuclear explosives or to transport nuclear \n        explosives and materials anywhere in the world;\n            (3) within such a comprehensive strategy, a high priority \n        must be placed on ensuring that all nuclear weapons and formula \n        quantities of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are \n        secure and accounted for;\n            (4) the President should make the prevention of a nuclear \n        terrorist attack on the United States of the highest priority;\n            (5) the President should accelerate programs, requesting \n        additional funding as appropriate, to prevent nuclear \n        terrorism, including combating nuclear smuggling and securing \n        formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material \n        wherever they may be;\n            (6) the International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital \n        role in coordinating international efforts to protect nuclear \n        materials and combat nuclear smuggling and should be funded \n        appropriately to fulfill that role; and\n            (7) legislation sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar, Senator \n        Pete Domenici, and former Senator Sam Nunn has resulted in \n        groundbreaking programs to ensure that nuclear weapons do not \n        fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\nSEC. 5.
