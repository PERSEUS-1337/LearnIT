FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Stateless vessels forfeited to the United States for \n        engaging in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are of \n        little inherent economic value, and have no useful commercial \n        fishing purpose other than engaging in this type of pirate \n        fishing.\n            (2) The environmental harm of allowing vessels seized for \n        illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing to return to such \n        fishing activities far outweighs any damage to the environment \n        caused by sinking or otherwise disposing of such vessels at \n        appropriate depths and distances from shore after proper \n        decontamination procedures and disposal site selection have \n        been followed.\n            (3) Maritime threats to the United States increasingly \n        involve asymmetrical warfare and the Navy and Coast Guard need \n        to be prepared for such threats.\n            (4) Using vessels forfeited for engaging in illegal, \n        unreported, or unregulated fishing in live-fire sinking \n        exercises represents an important opportunity for the Armed \n        Forces to prepare for such asymmetrical maritime warfare.\n            (5) Since the oils and hazardous and toxic substances \n        aboard such vessels pose a threat to the marine environment, \n        and since such vessels are essentially abandoned assets, it is \n        appropriate to use the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to \n        prevent pollution and pay for decontamination costs for such \n        vessels.\n\nSEC. 3.
