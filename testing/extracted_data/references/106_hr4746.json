FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) a well-developed system of transportation and \n        infrastructure is critical to the economic well being, health, \n        and welfare of the United States;\n            (2) a national emergency exists that threatens the survival \n        of essential rail transportation infrastructure, especially \n        infrastructure serving rural areas of the country;\n            (3) a failure to address the growing crisis will result in \n        rail line abandonments which will add to highway costs and \n        congestion, thus increasing highway traffic that will lead to a \n        degradation of safety, increase environmental damage, and \n        further economically disadvantage rural areas of the country;\n            (4) traditional funding techniques are unable to keep pace \n        with the rail infrastructure investment needs in rural areas, \n        including the requirement to upgrade track and bridges, to \n        ensure safety, and to accommodate 286,000 pound freight cars;\n            (5) the requirement that railroads pay a 4.3-cent diesel \n        fuel excise tax into the general fund of the Treasury, while \n        similar taxes on competing modes of transportation improve the \n        infrastructures for those competing modes, is inequitable; and\n            (6) a temporary Federal program utilizing the proceeds of \n        the 4.3-cent railroad fuel tax to address the national \n        emergency and preserve freight rail service is in the national \n        interest as long as the 4.3-cent diesel tax on railroads is in \n        existence.\n\nSEC. 3.
