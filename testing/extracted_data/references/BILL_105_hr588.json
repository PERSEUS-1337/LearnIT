After the two routes \n        rejoin in Denver, Colorado, the route continues through \n        Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California. The trail is generally \n        described in Volume 2 of the National Park Service feasibility \n        study dated June 1995 which shall be on file and available for \n        public inspection in the office of the Director of the National \n        Park Service, Department of the Interior, the District of \n        Columbia.
