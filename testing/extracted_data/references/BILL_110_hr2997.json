USER FEES REGARDING INSPECTIONS OF IMPORTED FOOD SAFETY.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Assessment.--Beginning in fiscal year 2008, the \n        Secretary and the Commissioner shall jointly assess and collect \n        fees on food imported into the United States.\n            (2) Purpose of fees.--The purpose of fees under paragraph \n        (1) is to defray increases in the costs of the resources \n        allocated for inspecting imported food in order to comply with \n        section 4 over the costs of the resources allocated for \n        inspecting imported food in fiscal year 2007 multiplied by the \n        adjustment factor. Increases referred to in the preceding \n        sentence include increases in such costs for an additional \n        number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of \n        Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services to \n        be engaged in carrying out such section.\n            (3) Amount of fee; collection.--A fee under paragraph (1) \n        shall be assessed on each line item of food, as defined by the \n        Secretary and the Commissioner by regulation. The amount of the \n        fee shall be based on the number of line items, and may not \n        exceed $20 per line item, notwithstanding subsection (b). The \n        liability for the fee constitutes a personal debt due to the \n        United States, and such liability accrues on the date on which \n        the food is imported into the United States. The Secretary and \n        the Commissioner may coordinate with and seek the cooperation \n        of other agencies of the Federal Government regarding the \n        collection of such fees.\n    (b) Total Fee Revenues.--The total fee revenues collected under \nsubsection (a) for a fiscal year shall be the amount appropriated under \nsubsection (f)(3).\n    (c) Adjustments.--\n            (1) Inflation adjustment.--With respect to the amount of \n        total fee revenues referred to in subsection (b), the amount \n        authorized in subsection (f)(3) for a fiscal year shall be \n        adjusted by the Secretary and the Commissioner (and as adjusted \n        shall be published in the Federal Register) to reflect the \n        greater of--\n                    (A) the total percentage change that occurred \n                during the preceding fiscal year in the Consumer Price \n                Index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city \n                average); or\n                    (B) the total percentage change for such fiscal \n                year in basic pay under the General Schedule in \n                accordance with section 5332 of title 5, United States \n                Code, as adjusted by any locality-based comparability \n                payment pursuant to section 5304 of such title for \n                Federal employees stationed in the District of \n                Columbia.\n            (2) Annual fee adjustment.--Not later than 60 days after \n        the end of each fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2008, \n        the Secretary and the Commissioner, subject to not exceeding \n        the maximum fee amount specified in subsection (a)(3), shall \n        adjust the amounts that otherwise would under subsection (a) be \n        assessed as fees during the fiscal year in which the adjustment \n        occurs so that the total revenues collected in such fees for \n        such fiscal year equal the amount applicable pursuant to \n        subsection (b) for the fiscal year.\n    (d) Fee Waiver or Reduction.--The Secretary and the Commissioner \nshall grant a waiver from or a reduction of a fee assessed under \nsubsection (a) where the Secretary and the Commissioner find that the \nfee to be paid will exceed the anticipated present and future costs \nincurred by the Secretary and the Commissioner in carrying out section \n4 (which finding may be made by the Secretary and the Commissioner \nusing standard costs).\n    (e) Assessment of Fees.--\n            (1) Limitation.--Fees may not be assessed under subsection \n        (a) for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2008 unless \n        the amount appropriated for salaries and expenses of the \n        Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration \n        for such fiscal year is equal to or greater than the amount \n        appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug \n        Administration for fiscal year 2008 multiplied by the \n        adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved, \n        except that in making determinations under this paragraph for \n        the fiscal years involved there shall be excluded any amounts \n        collected as fees for purposes of funding the inspection of \n        food or other items being imported.\n            (2) Authority.--If the Secretary and the Commissioner do \n        not assess fees under subsection (a) during any portion of a \n        fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in \n        such fiscal year the Secretary and the Commissioner may assess \n        such fees, the Secretary and the Commissioner may assess and \n        collect such fees, without any modification in the rate of the \n        fees, at any time in such fiscal year notwithstanding the \n        provisions of subsection (a)(3) relating to the time at which \n        fees are to be paid.\n    (f) Crediting and Availability of Fees.--\n            (1) In general.--Fees collected for a fiscal year pursuant \n        to subsection (a) shall be credited to the appropriation \n        accounts for salaries and expenses of the Department of \n        Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration and shall be \n        available in accordance with appropriation Acts until expended \n        without fiscal year limitation. Such sums as may be necessary \n        may be transferred from the Department of Agriculture and the \n        Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses \n        appropriation accounts without fiscal year limitation to such \n        appropriation accounts for salaries and expenses with such \n        fiscal year limitation.
