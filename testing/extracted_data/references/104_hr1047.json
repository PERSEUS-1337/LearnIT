If the disclosure \n        is made directly to the head of the Federal or State agency, \n        the head of the Federal or State agency shall apply the factors \n        described in subsection (a) in rebutting the presumption. A \n        decision made by the head of the Federal agency under this \n        paragraph shall constitute a final agency action.\n    (e) Statutory Construction.--Except as expressly provided in this \nsection, nothing in this section is intended to affect the authority of \na Federal or State agency responsible for administering a Federal \nenvironmental law to carry out any requirement of the law associated \nwith information disclosed in a voluntary disclosure."
