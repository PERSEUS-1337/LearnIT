    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Within hours after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, \n        the Imperial Japanese forces launched an attack on the \n        Philippines, cutting off vital lines of communication to United \n        States and Filipino troops assigned to the United States Army \n        Forces in the Far East under the command of General Douglas \n        MacArthur.\n            (2) On December 8th, 1941, the 200th Coast Artillery \n        Regiment, successors to the New Mexico National Guardsmen who \n        made up part of the famed ``Rough Riders'' of the Spanish-\n        American War, were the ``first to fire''.\n            (3) Despite being cut off from supply lines and \n        reinforcements, the United States and Philippine Forces quickly \n        executed a plan to delay the Japanese invasion and defend the \n        Philippines against the Japanese invasion.\n            (4) By April 1942, troops from the United States and the \n        Philippines had bravely and staunchly fought off enemy attacks \n        in Bataan for more than 4 months under strenuous conditions \n        that resulted in widespread starvation and disease.\n            (5) By maintaining their position and engaging the enemy \n        for as long as they did, the troops at Bataan were able to \n        redefine the momentum of the war, delaying the Japanese \n        timetable to take control of the southeast Pacific for needed \n        war materials. Because of the Bataan defenders' heroic actions, \n        United States and Allied forces throughout the Pacific had time \n        to regroup and prepare for the successful liberation of the \n        Pacific and the Philippines.\n            (6) On April 9, 1942, Major General Edward King, his troops \n        suffering from starvation and a lack of supplies, surrendered \n        the soldiers from the United States and the Philippines into \n        enemy hands.\n            (7) Over the next week, troops from the United States and \n        the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 \n        miles without any food, water, or medical care in what came to \n        be known as the ``Bataan Death March''.\n            (8) During this forced march, thousands of soldiers died, \n        either from starvation, lack of medical care, sheer exhaustion, \n        or abuse by their captors.\n            (9) Conditions at the prisoner of war camps were appalling, \n        leading to increased disease and malnutrition among the \n        prisoners.\n            (10) The prisoners at Camp O'Donnell would die at a rate of \n        nearly 400 per day because of its poor conditions.\n            (11) On June 6, 1942, the prisoners from the United States \n        were transferred to Camp Cabanatuan, north of Camp O'Donnell.\n            (12) Nearly 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino Prisoners of War \n        died at Camp O'Donnell, and survivors were gradually paroled \n        from September through December 1942.\n            (13) Between September of 1942 and December of 1944, \n        American prisoners of war who survived the horrific death march \n        were shipped north for forced labor aboard ``hell ships'' and \n        succumbed in great numbers because of the abysmal conditions. \n        Many of the ships were mistakenly targeted by allied Naval \n        forces because the Japanese military convoys were not properly \n        labeled as carrying prisoners of war. The sinking of the Arisan \n        Maru alone, claimed nearly 1,800 American lives.\n            (14) The prisoners who remained in the camps suffered from \n        continued mistreatment, malnutrition, lack of medical care, and \n        horrific conditions until they were liberated in 1945.\n            (15) The veterans of Bataan represented the best of America \n        and the Philippines. They hailed from diverse locales across \n        both countries and represented a true diversity of Americans.\n            (16) Over the subsequent decades, these prisoners formed \n        support groups, were honored in local and State memorials, and \n        told their story to all people of the United States.\n            (17) The United States Navy has continued to honor their \n        history and stories by naming 2 ships after the battle \n        including 1 ship still in service, USS Bataan (LHD-5), in \n        memory of their valor and honorable resistance against Imperial \n        Japanese forces.\n            (18) Many of the survivors of Bataan have now passed away, \n        and those who remain continue to tell their story.\n            (19) The people of the United States and the Philippines \n        are forever indebted to these men for--\n                    (A) the courage and tenacity they demonstrated \n                during the first 4 months of World War II fighting \n                against enemy soldiers; and\n                    (B) the perseverance they demonstrated during 3 \n                years of capture, imprisonment, and atrocious \n                conditions, while maintaining dignity, honor, \n                patriotism, and loyalty.\n\nSEC. 2.
