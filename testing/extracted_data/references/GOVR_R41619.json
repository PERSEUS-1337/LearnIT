    "content": "National Security Letters (NSLs) are roughly comparable to administrative subpoenas. Intelligence agencies issue them for intelligence gathering purposes to telephone companies, Internet service providers, consumer credit reporting agencies, banks, and other financial institutions, directing the recipients to turn over certain customer records and similar information. The 111 th Congress saw a number of proposals to amend NSL authority. None were enacted, but S. 193 , introduced early in the 112 th Congress by Senator Leahy, would carry forward in large measure the provisions approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 111 th . S. 193 would also have extended three USA PATRIOT Act-related amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) then scheduled to expire earlier this year. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported out an amended version of S. 193 on April 6, 2011. Thereafter, Congress extended the FISA amendments separately. Senator Leahy then reintroduced the reported version of S. 193 as S. 1125 , stripped of the FISA extension provisions. Representative Conyers introduced companion legislation in the House ( H.R. 1805 ). Senator Paul offered several bills that address many of the same issues ( S. 1050 , S. 1070 , S. 1073 , S. 1075 ).  S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 would repeal one of NSL's authorizing statutes, section 627 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681v); return the others, as of December 31, 2013, to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form; amend the judicial review procedure to reflect judicial constructions; and adjust the audit and reporting requirements. S. 1073 would require the Attorney General to issue minimization procedures for NSLs. S. 1075 would permit issuance of a NSL only upon the order of a FISA court judge. S. 1050 and S. 1070 would combine the two proposals and require minimization procedures and FISA court orders for NSLs. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, the NSL statutes were four. One, 18 U.S.C. 2709, obligated communications providers to supply certain customer information upon the written request of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or a senior FBI headquarters official. When customer identity, length of service, and toll records were sought, the letters had to certify (1) that the information was relevant to a foreign counterintelligence investigation and (2) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe the information pertained to a foreign power or its agents. When only customer identity and length of service records (but not toll records) were sought, the letters had to certify (1) again that the information was relevant to a foreign counterintelligence investigation, but (2) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the customer information pertained to use of the provider's facilities to communicate with foreign powers, their agents, or those engaged in international terrorism or criminal clandestine intelligence activities. In like manner a second statute, Section 1114(a)(5) of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, obligated financial institutions to provide the FBI with customers' financial records upon written certification of the FBI Director or his designee (1) that the records were sought for foreign counterintelligence purposes and (2) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the records were those of a foreign power or its agents. And so it was with a third, Section 626 of the Fair Credit Report Act, which obligated consumer credit reporting agencies to provide customer identification, and the names and addresses of financial institutions at which a designated consumer maintained accounts. Here too, the obligation was triggered by written certification of the FBI Director or his designee (1) that the information was necessary for a foreign counterintelligence investigation, and (2) that specific and articulable facts gave reason to believe that the consumer was either a foreign power, a foreign official, or the agent of a foreign power and was engaged in international terrorism or criminal clandestine intelligence activities. The fourth, Section 802 of the National Security Act, was a bit different. It reached a wider range of potential recipients at the demand of a large group of federal officials, but for a more limited purpose. It rested the obligation to provide consumer reports, together with financial information and records, upon consumer reporting agencies, financial agencies, and financial institutions, or holding companies. The requirement was triggered by the certification of senior officials of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, but confined to information pertaining to federal employees with access to classified information and being sought for clearance purposes and inquiries into past or potential security leaks. Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act altered the FBI's NSL authority under Section 2709, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act in several ways: it expanded issuing authority to include the heads of FBI field offices (special agents in charge (SACs)); it eliminated the requirement of specific and articulable facts demonstrating a nexus to a foreign power or its agents; it required instead that the information was sought for or relevant to various national security investigations; and it directed that no NSL related investigation of a \"U.S. person\" (American citizen or foreign resident alien) be predicated exclusively on First Amendment protected activities. The National Security Act NSL section remained unchanged, but Section 358(g) of the USA PATRIOT Act added a new Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL Section 627, 15 U.S.C. 1681v. The new section obligated consumer reporting agencies to provide consumer information and reports to a federal agency \"authorized to conduct investigations of, or intelligence or counterintelligence activities or analysis related to, international terrorism.\" Senior federal agency officials were empowered to issue the NSL with a certification that the information was \"necessary for the agency's conduct or such investigation, activity, or analysis.\" Several of the USA PATRIOT Act's intelligence gathering provisions were temporary and originally set to expire after five years. The NSL statutes were not among them, but Congress amended the statutes in the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006 nonetheless. The NSL statute amendments were driven both by sensitivity to an Administration desire for more explicit enforcement authority and by judicial developments which had raised questions as to the statutes' constitutional vitality as then written. The statutes then came with open-ended nondisclosure provisions which barred recipients from disclosing the fact or content of the NSL\u2014ever or to anyone. Yet, they featured neither a penalty provision should the confidential requirement be breached nor in most cases an enforcement mechanism should an NSL obligation be ignored (the original Fair Credit Report Act statute alone had an explicit judicial enforcement component). The amendments: created a judicial enforcement mechanism and a judicial review procedure for both the requests and accompanying nondisclosure requirements; established specific penalties for failure to comply with the nondisclosure requirements; made it clear that the nondisclosure requirements did not preclude a recipient from consulting an attorney; provided a process to ease the nondisclosure requirement; expanded congressional oversight; and called for Inspector General's audits of use of NSL authority. The Department of Justice Inspector General reports, one released in March of 2007, the second in March of 2008, and the third in January of 2010, were less than totally favorable. The first report noted that FBI use of NSLs had increased dramatically, expanding from 8,500 requests in 2000 to 47,000 in 2005, IG Report I at 120. During the three years under review, the percentage of NSLs used to investigate Americans (\"U.S. persons\") increased from 39% in 2003 to 53% in 2005. A substantial majority of the requests involved records relating to telephone or e-mail communications, Id. The report and the subsequent report a year later provided a glimpse at how the individual NSL statutes were used and why they were considered valuable. In case of the 18 U.S.C. 2709, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) NSL statute, the reports explained that: Through national security letters, an FBI field office obtained telephone toll billing records and subscriber information about an investigative subject in a counterterrorism case. The information obtained identified the various telephone numbers with which the subject had frequent contact. Analysis of the telephone records enabled the FBI to identify a group of individuals residing in the same vicinity as the subject. The FBI initiated investigations on these individuals to determine if there was a terrorist cell operating in the city. Headquarters and field personnel told us that the principal objective of the most frequently used type of NSL \u2013 ECPA NSLs seeking telephone toll billing records, electronic communication transactional records, or subscriber information (telephone and e-mail) \u2013 is to develop evidence to support applications for FISA orders. The Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) NSL statute, 12 U.S.C. 3414(a)(5), also affords authorities access to a wide range of information (bank transaction records v. telephone transaction records) as demonstrated by the instances where it proved useful: The FBI conducted a multi-jurisdictional counterterrorism investigation of convenience store owners in the United States who allegedly sent funds to known Hawaladars (persons who use the Hawala money transfer system in lieu of or parallel to traditional banks) in the Middle East. The funds were transferred to suspected Al Qaeda affiliates. The possible violations committed by the subjects of these cases included money laundering, sale of untaxed cigarettes, check cashing fraud, illegal sale of pseudoephedrine (the precursor ingredient used to manufacture methamphetamine), unemployment insurance fraud, welfare fraud, immigration fraud, income tax violations, and sale of counterfeit merchandise. The FBI issued national security letters for the convenience store owners' bank account records. The records showed that two persons received millions of dollars from the subjects and that another subject had forwarded large sums of money to one of these individuals. The bank analysis identified sources and recipients of the money transfers and assisted in the collection of information on targets of the investigation overseas. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL statutes, 15 U.S.C. 1681u (FCRAu) and 1681v (FCRAv) can be even more illuminating: \"The supervisor of a counterterrorism squad told us that the FCRA NSLs enable the FBI to see 'how their investigative subjects conduct their day-to-day activities, how they get their money, and whether they are engaged in white collar crime that could be relevant to their investigations.'\" Overall, the report notes that the FBI used the information gleaned from NSLs for a variety of purposes, \"to determine if further investigation is warranted; to generate leads for other field offices, Joint Terrorism Task Forces, or other federal agencies; and to corroborate information developed from other investigative techniques.\" Moreover, information supplied in response to NSLs provides the grist of FBI analytical intelligence reports and various FBI databases. The report was somewhat critical, however, of the FBI's initial performance: [W]e found that the FBI used NSLs in violation of applicable NSL statutes, Attorney General Guidelines, and internal FBI policies. In addition, we found that the FBI circumvented the requirements of the ECPA NSL statute when it issued at least 739 \"exigent letters\" to obtain telephone toll billing records and subscriber information from three telephone companies without first issuing NSLs. Moreover, in a few other instances, the FBI sought or obtained telephone toll billing records in the absence of a national security investigation, when it sought and obtained consumer full credit reports in a counterintelligence investigation, and when it sought and obtained financial records and telephone toll billing records without first issuing NSLs. Id . at 124. More specifically, the report found that: a \"significant number of NSL-related possible violations were not being identified or reported\" as required; the only FBI data collection system produced \"inaccurate\" results; the FBI issued over 700 exigent letters acquiring information in a manner that \"circumvented the ECPA NSL statute and violated the Attorney General's Guidelines ... and internal FBI policy;\" the FBI's Counterterrorism Division initiated over 300 NSLs in a manner that precluded effective review prior to approval; 60% of the individual files examined showed violations of FBI internal control policies; the FBI did not retain signed copies of the NSLs it issued; the FBI had not provided clear guidance on the application of the Attorney General's least-intrusive-feasible-investigative-technique standard in the case of NSLs; the precise interpretation of toll billing information as it appears in the ECPA NSL statute is unclear; SAC supervision of the attorneys responsible for review of the legal adequacy of proposed NSLs made some of the attorneys reluctant to question the adequacy of the underlying investigation previously approved by the SAC; there was no indication that the FBI's misuse of NSL authority constituted criminal conduct; personnel both at FBI headquarters and in the field considered NSL use indispensable; and information generated by NSLs was fed into a number of FBI systems. IG Report I at 121-24. Prior to enactment of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the Supreme Court held that customers had no Fourth Amendment protected privacy rights in the records the telephone company maintained relating to their telephone use. Where a recognized expectation of privacy exists for Fourth Amendment purposes, the Amendment's usual demands such as those of probable cause, particularity, and a warrant may be eased in the face of exigent circumstances. For example, the Fourth Amendment requirement that officers must knock and announce their purpose before forcibly entering a building to execute a warrant can be eased in the presence of certain exigent circumstances such as the threat of the destruction of evidence or danger to the officers. Satisfying Fourth Amendment requirements, however, does not necessarily satisfy statutory prohibitions. The ECPA prohibits communications service providers from supplying information concerning customer records unless one of the statutory exceptions applies. There are specific exceptions for disclosure upon receipt of a grand jury subpoena or an NSL. A service provider who knowingly or intentionally violates the prohibition is subject to civil liability, but there are no criminal penalties for the breach. The Inspector General found that contrary to assertions that \"the FBI would obtain telephone records only after it served NSLs or grand jury subpoenas, the FBI obtained telephone bill records and subscriber information prior to serving NSLs or grand jury subpoenas\" by using \"exigent letters.\" The FBI responded that it had barred the use of exigent letters, but emphasized that the term \"exigent letter\" does not include emergency disclosures under the exception now found in 18 U.S.C. 2702(c)(4). Thus, the FBI might request that a service provider invoke that exception to the record disclosure bar \"if the provider reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person justifies disclosure of the information,\" 18 U.S.C. 2702(c)(4). Moreover, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel subsequently advised the FBI in a classified memorandum that \"under certain circumstances the ECPA does not prohibit electronic communications service providers from disclosing certain call detail records to the FBI on a voluntary basis without legal process or a qualifying emergency under Section 2702.\"  The second IG Report reviewed the FBI's use of national security letter authority during calendar year 2006 and the corrective measures taken following the issuance of the IG's first report. The second report concluded that: \"the FBI's use of national security letters in 2006 continued the upward trend ... identified ... for the period covering 2003 through 2006; \"the percentage of NSL requests generated from investigations of U.S. persons continued to increase significantly, from approximately 39% of all NSL requests issued in 2003 to approximately 57% of all NSL requests issued in 2006;\" the FBI and DOJ are committed to correcting the problems identified in IG Report I and \"have made significant progress in addressing the need to improve compliance in the FBI's use of NSLs;\" [and] \"it [was] too early to definitively state whether the new systems and controls developed by the FBI and the Department will eliminate fully the problems with NSLs that we identified,\" IG Report II at 8-9. The third IG Report examined the FBI's use of exigent letters and other informal means of acquiring communication service providers' customer records in lieu of relying on NSL authority during the period from 2003 to 2007. The IG's Office discovered that \"the FBI's use of exigent letters became so casual, routine, and unsupervised that employees of all three communications service providers sometimes generated exigent letters for FBI personnel to sign and return to them.\"  Some of the informality was apparently the product of proximity. In order to facilitate cooperation, communications providers had assigned employees to FBI offices. In addition to a relaxed exigent letter process, the on-site feature gave rise to a practice of sneak peeks, that is, of providing the FBI with \"a preview of the available information for a targeted phone number, without documentation of any justification for the request.\" \"In fact, at times the service providers' employees simply invited FBI personnel to view the telephone records on their computer screens. One senior FBI counterterrorism official described the culture of casual requests for telephone records by observing, 'It [was] like having the ATM in your living room.'\"  Not surprisingly, the IG's review  found widespread use by the FBI of exigent letters and other informal requests for telephone records. These other requests were made ... without first providing legal process or even exigent letters. The FBI also obtained telephone records through improper 'sneak peeks,' community of interest \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and hot-number \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Many of these practices violated FBI guidelines, Department policy, and the ECPA statute. In addition, we found that the FBI also made inaccurate statements to the FISA Court related to its use of exigent letters. Although critical of the FBI's initial response and recommending further steps to prevent reoccurrence, the IG's Report concluded that \"the FBI took appropriate action to stop the use of exigent letters and to address the problems created by their use.\" The current secrecy and judicial review provisions applicable to NSLs must be read in light of the Second Circuit's John Doe, Inc. v. Mukasey decision, 549 F.3d 861 (2d Cir. 2008). Under the NSL statutes, secrecy is not absolutely required. Instead, NSL recipients are bound to secrecy only upon the certification of the requesting agency that disclosure of the request or response may result in a danger to national security; may interfere with diplomatic relations or with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation; or may endanger the physical safety of an individual. A recipient may disclose the request to those necessary to comply with the request and to an attorney the recipient consults for related legal advice or assistance. In doing so, the recipient must advise them of the secrecy requirements. Aside from its attorney the recipient must also identify, at the requesting agency's election, those to whom it has disclosed the request. Under the statute, 18 U.S.C. 3511, a recipient may petition the court to modify or extinguish any NSL secrecy requirement within a year of issuance. Thereafter, it may petition to have the veil of secrecy lifted, although it may resubmit a rejected request only once a year. Section 3511 provides that the court may modify or set aside the restriction if it finds \"no reason to believe that disclosure may\" endanger national security or personal safety or interfere with diplomatic relations or a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation. The section, however, binds the court to the assertion of a senior executive branch official that such an adverse consequence is possible . In addition to authority to review and set aside NSL nondisclosure requirements, the federal courts also enjoy jurisdiction to review and enforce the underlying NSL requests. Under Section 3511, recipients may petition and be granted an order modifying or setting aside an NSL, if the court finds that compliance would be unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise unlawful. The \"unreasonable or oppressive\" standard is used for grand jury and other subpoenas issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Rules afford protection against undue burdens and protect privileged communications. Compliance with a particular NSL might be unduly burdensome in some situations, but the circumstances under which NSLs are used suggest few federally recognized privileges. The Rules also impose a relevancy requirement, but in the context of a grand jury investigation a motion to quash will be denied unless it can be shown that \"there is no reasonable possibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce information relevant\" to the investigation. The authority to modify or set aside an NSL that is \"unlawful\" affords the court an opportunity to determine whether the NSL in question complies with the statutory provisions under which it was issued. Section 3511 also vests the court with authority to enforce the NSL against a recalcitrant recipient. Failure to comply with the court's order thereafter is punishable as contempt of court. A breach of a confidentiality requirement committed knowingly and with the intent to obstruct an investigation or related judicial proceedings is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organization). The Second Circuit has concluded that the procedure can survive First Amendment scrutiny only if it involves the following: notice to NSL recipients that they may contest any secrecy order; expeditious government petition for judicial review of a secrecy order upon recipient request; government burden to establish the validity of its narrowly tailored secrecy order; no conclusive weight may be afforded governmental assertions; and recipients may apply or reapply annually for judicial review where the government's burden remains the same. On remand, the district upheld continuation of the nondisclosure order under the procedure suggested by the Second Circuit. Three provisions governing foreign intelligence investigations sunset on June 1, 2015. The NSL provisions are not among them. None of the NSL statutes are scheduled to expire. S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 would change that. They would repeal Section 627 effective December 31, 2013, and on that date would return the others to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form. They would establish a transition provision under which the law prior to December 31, 2013, would continue to apply with respect to investigations or offenses begun prior to that date.  The USA PATRIOT Act expanded existing authority under 18 U.S.C. 2709, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It also created new NSL authority in the form of Section 627 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681v). It did not expand the reach of the National Security Act NSL statute. A return to the state of the law prior to enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act would have the effect of eliminating the amendments it made in the pre-existing NSL statutes as well as any subsequent amendments, and of repealing Section 627. In general terms for the three pre-existing NSL statutes, the USA PATRIOT Act: expanded issuing authority to include the heads of FBI field offices (special agents in charge (SACs)); eliminated the requirement of specific and articulable facts demonstrating a nexus to a foreign power or its agents; required instead that the information was sought for or relevant to various national security investigations; and directed that no NSL related investigation of a \"U.S. person\" (American citizen or foreign resident alien) be predicated exclusively on First Amendment protected activities. This means that: NSLs are more readily available to FBI field agents at a lower level of supervisory control; NSLs can be used to obtain information pertaining to individuals two, three, or more steps removed from the foreign power or agent of a foreign power that is the focus of the investigation; and NSL-related investigations may not be predicated solely on the basis of activities protected by the First Amendment. A return to the state of the law prior to the effective date of the USA PATRIOT Act would mean that NSLs would need to be approved by the FBI Director or a senior FBI headquarters official, and they would have to be based on specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the information sought pertains to a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. A witness at an earlier congressional hearing indicated that the \"specific and articulable\" facts standard grew out of the standards employed in counterintelligence investigations and did not always translate well in a counterterrorism context: My point is that the \"specific and articulable facts\" standard was particularly suited to the counterintelligence operations of the era in which it was created. A FBI counterintelligence investigation involved examining a linear connection between a foreign intelligence officer (about whom much was known) and his contacts (potential spies). The information known about the intelligence officer was specific in nature, and could be readily used to meet the NSL legal standards.... Unlike the traditional linear counterintelligence case, in which the foreign agent tried to recruit the domestic spy using infrequent and highly secure forms of communication, many counterterrorism cases involved complex networks generating a much larger volume of communication and financial transactions. In counter-terrorism cases, the starting point was often not a clearly identifiable agent of a foreign power (as in counterintelligence); indeed, the relevant \"foreign power\" was itself an imperfectly understood terrorist organization that might defy precise definition. As a consequence, counter-terrorism investigators often had a far more difficult time meeting the \"specific and articulable facts\" standard. The language precluding NSL-related investigations grounded exclusively on the exercise of First Amendment rights would also have disappeared. It is at best unclear, however, that the First Amendment unaided does not embody a comparable prohibition. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, the NSL statutes strictly prohibited recipients from disclosing the request to anyone, ever. Yet, they afforded recipients no explicit means to challenge or seek limited release from the nondisclosure requirement, even for such narrow purposes as consulting their attorneys for advice on their obligations to comply. On the other hand, they provided the FBI with no explicit remedy should recipients violate the nondisclosure requirement.  In the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act, Congress addressed the issue in three ways. First, it amended the federal obstruction of justice statute to outlaw unjustified disclosures. Second, it amended the NSL statutes to make it clear that a recipient remained free to seek the advice of counsel before complying. These amendments, unlike the obstruction of justice amendment, would disappear should the NSL statutes return to their earlier versions. Congress's third response, however, would mitigate impact of the disappearance. Third, Congress created a nonexpiring statutory section for review of NSLs, 18 U.S.C. 3511.  By and large, Section 3511 governs judicial review of NSL nondisclosure requirements. When implemented as required by the Second Circuit's decision in John Doe, Inc. v. Mukasey , 549 F.3d 861 (2d Cir. 2008), and at the election of the recipient, the government has the burden of persuading the court of the validity of the gag order under the same standards as found in the expired portions of the NSL statutes. Although S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 would amend Section 3511, they each reinforce rather than erode the recipient protections of Section 3511 as discussed infra . Section 627, the NSL statute created in the USA PATRIOT Act, is arguably the most sweeping of the NSL statutes. It offers the most extensive array of information (all information pertaining to a consumer held by a consumer credit reporting agency) to the widest range of requesters (any federal agency \"authorized to conduct investigations of, or intelligence or counterintelligence activities or analysis relating to, international terrorism\"). Its repeal might be seen to facilitate oversight, since it would centralize authority to issue NSLs in the FBI (other than in the case of employee security investigations under the National Security Act). Moreover, the Justice Department IG reported that both the FBI and consumer reporting agencies had experienced difficulty distinguishing between authority under 1681u and 1681v. In contrast, the National Security Act NSL statute, left unamended by the USA PATRIOT Act, is arguably the least intrusive. It reaches only information pertaining to federal employees who have consented to their disclosure. The Minority Views in the Senate Judiciary Committee report objected to a return of the NSL statutes to their earlier versions: S. 193 rescinds these valuable tools by, starting in 2013, requiring the government to follow the cumbersome pre-PATRIOT Act NSL standard. Prior to the PATRIOT Act, not only did the requested records have to be relevant to an investigation, but the FBI also had to have specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the information requested pertained to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, such as a terrorist or spy. This pre-PATRIOT Act requirement kept the FBI from using NSLs to develop evidence at the early stages of an investigation, which is precisely when they are the most useful, and often prevented investigators from acquiring records that were relevant to an ongoing international terrorism or espionage investigation. It makes little sense to roll back the sensible NSL reforms that were made as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. Criminal investigators have long been able to use administrative or grand jury subpoenas to obtain records, so long as they are relevant to their investigation.  Each of the NSL statutes has a nondisclosure provision. They state that the issuing agency may prohibit recipients from disclosing the request\u2014to anyone other than their attorney and those necessary to comply with the request, ever. In order to activate the authority, agency officials must certify that disclosure may endanger national security, endanger individual safety, or may interfere with diplomatic relations or with a criminal, counterintelligence, or counterterrorism investigation. The statutes declare that a federal district court may modify or set aside an NSL secrecy requirement on the petition of a recipient, if it concludes that there is no reason to believe that disclosure might result in any such danger or interference. If the petition for review is filed more than a year after issuance of the NSL, the agency must either terminate the gag order or recertify the need for its continuation. They make no explicit provision for disclosure to the party to whom the information pertains. The Second Circuit in John Doe, Inc. v. Mukasey held that these provisions only survive First Amendment scrutiny if the agency petitions for judicial review and convinces the court that the agency proposed order is narrowly crafted to meet to the statutorily identified adverse consequences of disclosure. S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 would modify the statutory provisions governing the issuance and judicial review of NSL nondisclosure orders. It would codify a procedure comparable in many respects to that which the Second Circuit identified as constitutionally acceptable. The agency issuing the NSL would have made the initial determination of whether to include a nondisclosure provision in the NSL and that determination would be subject to judicial review. It would leave unchanged the concerns a requesting official might rely upon in order to impose a nondisclosure order: reason to believe disclosure may endanger national security or individual safety or interfere with diplomatic relations or a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation.  The agency would have to notify the recipient of the right to judicial review and petition for review within 30 days of a recipient's request for judicial review. The agency's application for judicial approval or review would have to include a statement of facts giving reason to believe that disclosure might result in one of the statutory list of adverse consequences \u2013 endanger national security or individual safety or interfere with diplomatic relations or with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation. Should the court feel the agency had met its burden after giving agency certification \"substantial weight,\" it would be required to issue a nondisclosure order.  S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 would amend each of the NSL statutes to require agency certifying officials to place a written statement in the agency's records documenting the specific facts that support the belief that the information sought in the NSL is relevant to a qualified investigation.  Minimization is one of the ways that legislation in the 112 th Congress differs from the legislation approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in the previous Congress. S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 do not mention minimization. The change is apparently a response to intervening Justice Department action. Senator Paul's bills include specific NSL minimization proposals.  \"Minimization,\" in this context, refers to limitations on what information is acquired; how it is acquired; how it is maintained; who has access to it within the capturing agency and under what circumstances; to whom and under what circumstances it is disclosed beyond the capturing agency; how long it is preserved; and when and under what circumstances it is expunged. Minimization standards are drawn with an eye to the purposes for which information is acquired; the authority under which it is acquired; the legitimate interests which may be affected by its acquisition, use, or disclosure; and the governmental interests served by its acquisition, maintenance, use, and disclosure. Minimization standards ordinarily reinforce statutory and regulatory limitations that attend the use of possibly invasive means of acquiring information. For example, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides fairly rigorous statutory procedures that must be honored before electronic surveillance or physical searches may be authorized in a national security context. It also supplies statutory conditions under which information acquired using those techniques may be used, and both judicial and legislative oversight procedures. As an additional safeguard, it also calls for the creation and implementation of minimization procedures to protect private information relating to Americans consistent with the U.S. foreign intelligence interests. Section 119(f) of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act directed the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to report to the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees on the feasibility of NSL minimization procedures \"to ensure the protection of the constitutional rights of United States persons.\" The Inspector General's reports noted the need for minimization standards or their regulatory equivalent: In our first NSL report, the OIG noted the proviso in the Attorney General's NSI Guidelines that national security investigations should use the \"least intrusive collection techniques feasible\" to carry out the investigations. The OIG reported that we found no clear guidance on how Special Agents should reconcile the Attorney General guidelines' limitations with the expansive authority provided in the NSL statutes. Our concerns over the lack of formal guidance were magnified because of the volume of NSLs generated by the FBI each year and because the information collected is retained for long periods in databases available to many authorized law enforcement personnel. The Justice Department convened a working group to study and make recommendations concerning possible NSL minimization standards in response to its statutory obligation and the Inspector General's initial report.  Attorney General Holder reported in a letter dated December 9, 2010, to Senator Leahy as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that the Attorney General had \"approved Procedures for the Collection, Use and Storage of Information Derived from National Security Letters on October 1, 2010\" and that, \"[t]he FBI's current practice is consistent with the procedures and the FBI is working on formal policy to implement them. In addition DOJ and ODNI [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] will shortly complete work on a joint report to Congress on NSL 'minimization' as required by the PATRIOT Reauthorization Act of 2005.\"  The Senate Judiciary Committee report noted that, in light of the Attorney General's action, S. 193 replaced a call for the promulgation of minimization standards with a section that would direct the \"Attorney General to periodically review the procedures, taking the privacy rights and civil liberties of Americans into consideration.\" S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 adopt the same approach. Senator Paul's proposals would continue to call upon the Attorney General to promulgate minimization standards. His proposals, however, emphasize the need for standards that address when NSL-generated information should be disposed of, for example, \"including procedures to ensure that information obtained that is outside the scope of such National Security Letter or request, is returned or destroyed.\"  Some of the NSL statutes provide for periodic reports to various congressional committees. In addition, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act instructed the Attorney General to prepare, in unclassified form, an annual report to Congress on the number of NSLs issued in the previous year. The same legislation directed the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to audit and report on the use of NSL authority for calendar years 2002 through 2006. S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 would expand each of these requirements. Existing law requires a public report of the number of times the Justice Department has used NSL requests for information concerning Americans. S. 1125 a n d H.R. 1805 would demand twice yearly reports to include the number of requests sought for information on those who not the subject of investigations. They would also call for audits by the Justice Department's Inspector General for the years 2007 through 2013, comparable to those which the IG conducted earlier. * * * (a) ....
