In selecting entities to receive such assistance, the \nDirector shall ensure that the project proposed by an entity has \nscientific and technical merit and that any resulting intellectual \nproperty shall vest in a United States entity that can commercialize \nthe technology in a timely manner. Each external project shall involve \nat least one small or medium-sized business and the Director shall give \npriority to joint ventures between small or medium-sized businesses and \neducational institutions. Any grant shall be for a period not to exceed \n3 years.\n    (c) Competitions.--The Director shall solicit proposals annually to \naddress areas of national need for high-risk, high-reward \ntelecommunications research, as identified by the Director.\n    (d) Annual Report.--Each year the Director shall issue an annual \nreport describing the program's activities, including include a \ndescription of the metrics upon which grant funding decisions were made \nin the previous fiscal year, any proposed changes to those metrics, \nmetrics for evaluating the success of ongoing and completed grants, and \nan evaluation of ongoing and completed grants. The first annual report \nshall include best practices for management of programs to stimulate \nhigh-risk, high-reward telecommunications research.\n    (e) Administrative Expenses.--No more than 5 percent of the finding \navailable to the program may be used for administrative expenses.\n    (f) High-Risk, High-Reward Telecommunications Research Defined.--In \nthis section, the term ``high-risk, high-reward telecommunications \nresearch'' means research that--\n            (1) has the potential for yielding results with far-ranging \n        or wide-ranging implications;\n            (2) addresses critical national needs related to \n        measurement standards and technology; and\n            (3) is too novel or spans too diverse a range of \n        disciplines to fare well in the traditional peer review \n        process.\n\nSEC. 4. ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR ALL AMERICANS.\n\n    The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nshall continue to support research and support standards development in \nadvanced information and communications technologies focused on \nenhancing or facilitating the availability and affordability of \nadvanced communications services to all Americans, in order to \nimplement the Institute's responsibilities under section 2(c)(12) of \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. \n272(c)(12)). The Director shall support intramural research and \ncooperative research with institutions of higher education (as defined \nin section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n1001(a)) and industry.\n\nSEC. 5. ADVANCED INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH.\n\n    (a) Information and Communications Technology Research.--The \nDirector of the National Science Foundation shall establish a program \nof basic research in advanced information and communications \ntechnologies focused on enhancing or facilitating the availability and \naffordability of advanced communications services to all Americans.
