If \n        the independent public accountant making such report shall fail \n        to receive a copy of such notice within the required one-\n        business-day period, the independent public accountant shall--\n                    ``(A) resign from the engagement; or\n                    ``(B) furnish to the Commission a copy of its \n                report (or the documentation of any oral report given) \n                within the next business day following such failure to \n                receive notice.\n            ``(4) Report after resignation.--An independent public \n        accountant electing resignation shall, within the one business \n        day following a failure by an issuer to notify the Commission \n        under paragraph (3), furnish to the Commission a copy of the \n        accountant's report (or the documentation of any oral report \n        given).\n    ``(c) Auditor Liability Limitation.--No independent public \naccountant shall be liable in a private action for any finding, \nconclusion, or statement expressed in a report made pursuant to \nparagraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b), including any rules promulgated \npursuant thereto.\n    ``(d) Civil Penalties in Cease-and-Desist Proceedings.--If the \nCommission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in a \nproceeding instituted pursuant to section 21C of this title, that an \nindependent public accountant has willfully violated paragraph (3) or \n(4) of subsection (b) of this section, then the Commission may, in \naddition to entering an order under section 21C, impose a civil penalty \nagainst the independent public accountant and any other person that the \nCommission finds was a cause of such violation. The determination \nwhether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, \nshall be governed by the standards set forth in section 21B of this \ntitle.\n    ``(e) Preservation of Existing Authority.--Except for subsection \n(d), nothing in this section limits or otherwise affects the authority \nof the Commission under this title.\n    ``(f) Definitions.--As used in this section, the term `illegal act' \nmeans any action or omission to act that violates any law, or any rule \nor regulation having the force of law.''.\n    (b) Effective Dates.--As to any registrant that is required to file \nselected quarterly financial data pursuant to item 302(a) of Regulation \nS-K (17 CFR 229.302(a)) of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the \namendments made by subsection (a) of this section shall apply to any \nannual report for any period beginning on or after January 1, 1996.
