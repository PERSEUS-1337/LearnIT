FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the number of rental dwelling units available for lower \n        income families is insufficient, and the physical condition of \n        a substantial portion of such dwelling units is inadequate;\n            (2) new construction of rental dwelling units is occurring \n        primarily in higher income areas;\n            (3) Federal housing assistance programs, such as rent \n        subsidies, vouchers, and other rental and mortgage assistance, \n        too frequently assist middle and higher income families and do \n        not meet the demand for housing by lower income families;\n            (4) such Federal housing assistance programs are not cost \n        effective, due to a lack of suitable rental dwelling units \n        available for lower income families; and\n            (5) a significant number of families are paying more than \n        25 percent of their monthly income for rent.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to ensure that all families in the United States have \n        access to rental dwelling units at rents that are not more than \n        25 percent of their monthly income, and that such rental \n        dwelling units are decent, safe, and sanitary;\n            (2) to ensure that all funds for housing assistance by the \n        Federal Government benefit lower income families by requiring \n        the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to propose that \n        Federal housing assistance be limited to lower income families;\n            (3) to encourage the establishment of a public housing \n        system that consists of--\n                    (A) projects located throughout metropolitan and \n                rural areas;\n                    (B) low-density projects, to the extent \n                practicable; and\n                    (C) dwelling units that are visually \n                indistinguishable from comparable privately owned \n                dwelling units;\n            (4) to provide for the revitalization of the housing \n        construction industry and related industries; and\n            (5) to remedy the discriminatory practices of construction \n        unions by providing for the establishment of special procedures \n        for employing individuals to construct and revitalize public \n        housing.\n\nSEC. 3.

REVITALIZATION OF PUBLIC HOUSING.\n\n    Section 14(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended \nby adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(3)(A) To the extent approved in appropriation Acts and subject \nto subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall make available and contract to \nmake available financial assistance under this subsection, in addition \nto the financial assistance made available under paragraphs (1) and \n(2). In making assistance available under this paragraph, the Secretary \nshall give particular preference to public housing agencies requesting \nsuch assistance for public housing projects that the Secretary \ndetermines would likely have been subject to demolition or disposition \nunder section 18, as such section was in effect before the date of the \nenactment of the Jesse Gray Housing Act.\n    ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the aggregate amount of \nbudget authority that may be obligated for contracts for annual \ncontributions is increased on October 1 of each of the years 1993 \nthrough 2002 by the amount necessary to provide for the revitalization \nof 100,000 dwelling units in public housing during each of the fiscal \nyears 1994 through 2003, respectively.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
