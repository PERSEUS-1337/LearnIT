FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Federal grants to State and local governments predate \n        the Constitution. Early grants included land grants for public \n        schools and universities. Later, Congress created financial \n        grants to the States with matching requirements and conditions, \n        including grants for highway construction, vocational \n        education, public health, and maternity care.\n            (2) During the Nixon Administration, the emphasis of \n        Federal grants-in-aid programs was shifted from categorical \n        grants to block grants and general revenue sharing, which sent \n        funds to State and local governments with virtually no \n        programmatic requirements. Revenue sharing is not a new or \n        radical proposal.\n            (3) Despite this long history of assistance to State and \n        local governments, the Federal Government is not providing \n        sufficient aid to the States in their current fiscal crisis. \n        The State fiscal crisis is twice as severe as the crisis in the \n        early 1990s, with States carrying fiscal year 2004 budget \n        deficits totaling roughly $100,000,000,000. Yet continuing \n        decreases in Federal taxes for the wealthiest Americans leave \n        significantly fewer Federal revenues to help the States provide \n        basic services for their residents.\n            (4) To meet residents' needs, States have been forced to \n        increase income, property, and sales taxes for middle-income \n        and working families, in addition to raising taxes on \n        businesses. States also have had to cut funding for health \n        care, education, child care, public safety, and other programs. \n        At least 18 States have planned or are considering cuts in \n        spending on elementary and secondary education, resulting in \n        shortened school years and teacher layoffs. Cuts in State aid \n        have caused many colleges and universities to lay off faculty \n        and raise tuition.\n            (5) Federal spending for the war and occupation of Iraq is \n        further straining the Federal Government's ability to aid the \n        States, undermining financial assistance for education, public \n        housing, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and \n        other important programs.\n            (6) Defense appropriations will grow rapidly and \n        uncontrollably, continuing to crowd out spending for vital \n        human needs at the Federal and State levels. Homeland security \n        is directly threatened by cuts in police, fire, and hospital \n        budgets.\n            (7) The Federal Government must help the States to avert \n        greater fiscal damage because it has more economic tools \n        available than the States. Unlike the Federal Government, 49 \n        States have some form of a balanced budget requirement, forcing \n        States to reduce expenditures, increase revenues, or use both \n        of these options to close their budget gaps.\n            (8) To live up to its historic obligations and provide \n        relief at a time of economic disaster, the Federal Government \n        immediately should enact a program of emergency targeted \n        revenue sharing, with assistance for schools and education \n        given first priority.\n\nSEC. 3.
