FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) a single cup of MTBE, equal to the quantity found in 1 \n        gallon of gasoline oxygenated with MTBE, renders all of the \n        water in a 5,000,000-gallon well undrinkable;\n            (2) the physical properties of MTBE allow MTBE to pass \n        easily from gasoline to air to water, or from gasoline directly \n        to water, but MTBE does not--\n                    (A) readily attach to soil particles; or\n                    (B) naturally degrade;\n            (3) the development of tumors and nervous system disorders \n        in mice and rats has been linked to exposure to MTBE and \n        tertiary butyl alcohol and formaldehyde, which are 2 metabolic \n        byproducts of MTBE;\n            (4) reproductive and developmental studies of MTBE indicate \n        that exposure of a pregnant female to MTBE through inhalation \n        can--\n                    (A) result in maternal toxicity; and\n                    (B) have possible adverse effects on a developing \n                fetus;\n            (5) the Health Effects Institute reported in February 1996 \n        that the studies of MTBE support its classification as a \n        neurotoxicant and suggest that its primary effect is likely to \n        be in the form of acute impairment;\n            (6) people with higher levels of MTBE in the bloodstream \n        are significantly more likely to report more headaches, eye \n        irritation, nausea, dizziness, burning of the nose and throat, \n        coughing, disorientation, and vomiting as compared with those \n        who have lower levels of MTBE in the bloodstream;\n            (7) available information has shown that MTBE significantly \n        reduces the efficiency of technologies used to remediate water \n        contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons;\n            (8) the costs of remediation of MTBE water contamination \n        throughout the United States could run into the billions of \n        dollars;\n            (9) although several studies are being conducted to assess \n        possible methods to remediate drinking water contaminated by \n        MTBE, there have been no engineering solutions to make such \n        remediation cost-efficient and practicable;\n            (10) the remediation of drinking water contaminated by \n        MTBE, involving the stripping of millions of gallons of \n        contaminated ground water, can cost millions of dollars per \n        municipality;\n            (11) the average cost of a single industrial cleanup \n        involving MTBE contamination is approximately $150,000;\n            (12) the average cost of a single cleanup involving MTBE \n        contamination that is conducted by a small business or a \n        homeowner is approximately $37,000;\n            (13) the reformulated gasoline program under section 211(k) \n        of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(k)) has resulted in \n        substantial reductions in the emissions of a number of air \n        pollutants from motor vehicles, including volatile organic \n        compounds, carbon monoxide, and mobile-source toxic air \n        pollutants, including benzene;\n            (14) in assessing oxygenate alternatives, the Blue Ribbon \n        Panel of the Environmental Protection Agency determined that \n        ethanol, made from domestic grain and potentially from recycled \n        biomass, is an effective fuel-blending component that--\n                    (A) provides carbon monoxide emission benefits and \n                high octane; and\n                    (B) appears to contribute to the reduction of the \n                use of aromatics, providing reductions in emissions of \n                toxic air pollutants and other air quality benefits;\n            (15) the Department of Agriculture concluded that ethanol \n        production and distribution could be expanded to meet the needs \n        of the reformulated gasoline program in 4 years, with \n        negligible price impacts and no interruptions in supply; and\n            (16) because the reformulated gasoline program is a source \n        of clean air benefits, and ethanol is a viable alternative that \n        provides air quality and economic benefits, research and \n        development efforts should be directed to assess infrastructure \n        and meet other challenges necessary to allow ethanol use to \n        expand sufficiently to meet the requirements of the \n        reformulated gasoline program as the use of MTBE is phased out.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency should provide \ntechnical assistance, information, and matching funds to help local \ncommunities--\n            (1) test drinking water supplies; and\n            (2) remediate drinking water contaminated with methyl \n        tertiary butyl ether.\n\nSEC. 3.
