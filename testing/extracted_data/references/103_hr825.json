FINDINGS.\n\nThe Congress finds that--\n            (1) heart disease and strokes lead to about 2\\1/2\\ times as \n        many deaths among Black Americans (between the ages of 25 and \n        44) as among White Americans;\n            (2) diabetes is twice as prevalent among Mexican- and \n        Puerto Rican-Americans as among White Americans;\n            (3) Black and Hispanic women account for 73 percent of the \n        reported cases of AIDS among American women, and the death rate \n        from AIDS is 9 times higher among Black women than among White \n        women;\n            (4) between 1983 and 1985, when the infant mortality rate \n        among Whites was 9.0 deaths per 1,000 live births, the infant \n        mortality rate among Blacks was 18.7 and 13.9 among Native \n        Americans, with similar disparities among rates of low-\n        birthweight babies;\n            (5) in 1988, when the rates of death resulting from \n        homicides was 8 per 100,000 among young (ages 15 to 24) White \n        males, the rate among young Black males was 59 per 100,000, and \n        the rates for young Hispanic and Native American males was \n        roughly 2 to 3 times that of young White males;\n            (6) biomedical research, including clinical trials for \n        pharmaceuticals, often has failed to include minorities in the \n        population being studied or tested, even when it is certain \n        that minorities will be among the population subject to the \n        medical condition or receiving the treatment or pharmaceutical \n        that is being studied or tested;\n            (7) the percentages of medical professionals, especially \n        physicians, who are minorities are significantly lower than \n        their representation in the general population; and\n            (8) the ratio of physicians to inhabitants of neighborhoods \n        that are heavily populated by minorities (or low-income \n        residents) is often much lower than the ratio of physicians to \n        inhabitants of predominantly White neighborhoods.\n\nSEC. 3.
