FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Preschool years are a critical time for determining \n        whether or not an individual will develop obesity later in \n        life.\n            (2) The Journal of Clinical Pediatrics reports that the \n        ``tipping point'' in obesity often occurs before 2 years of \n        age, and sometimes as early as 3 months, when the child is \n        learning how much and what to eat.\n            (3) Aerobic fitness and healthy eating patterns support \n        enhanced behavioral, emotional, and academic performance in \n        school.\n            (4) More than 21 percent of preschool children are \n        overweight or obese.\n            (5) A 2009 preschool study found that 89 percent of a \n        preschooler's day is sedentary.\n            (6) The amount of time children spend outdoors is dwindling \n        rapidly, as evidenced by studies showing that children enjoy \n        half the outdoor time they did just 20 years ago. Meanwhile, \n        children are spending nearly 8 hours per day in front of \n        electronic media.\n            (7) Studies indicate that children who are overweight at \n        age 5 are more likely to be more overweight at age 9.\n            (8) Rates of obesity are higher for African-American, \n        Latino, Native American, and Native Alaskan children than the \n        overall population of the children in the United States.\n            (9) Children who are obese have a greater likelihood of \n        being obese in adulthood and developing heart disease, \n        diabetes, and other chronic conditions.\n            (10) In 2005, 61 percent of children from birth through age \n        6 who were not yet in kindergarten (about 12,000,000 children) \n        received some form of child care on a regular basis from \n        persons other than their parents.\n            (11) A 2008 survey by the National Association of Child \n        Care Resource and Referral Agencies reported that 93 percent of \n        parents thought existing health and safety standards for child \n        care should be improved.\n            (12) Child care centers, family child care homes, and other \n        early learning environments should serve as settings where \n        children adopt healthy eating habits and have opportunities for \n        age appropriate physical activity.\n            (13) Age-appropriate physical activity in the outdoors, in \n        particular, can produce immense physical, mental and emotional \n        health benefits, including addressing childhood obesity, \n        decreasing symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity \n        disorder, improving motor skills, stimulating brain \n        development, increasing creativity and quality sleep, and \n        reducing the risk of developing myopia.\n            (14) The governmental, nonprofit, and private sectors came \n        together to launch Let's Move Child Care, a voluntary effort to \n        work with child care providers to help children get off to a \n        healthy start through healthy eating, physical activity, and \n        screen time reduction strategies. Learning collaboratives that \n        build upon these key elements will assist providers and parents \n        in giving children the foundation they need for a healthy life.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) establish a 3-year pilot program in 5 States \n        representing a diversity of rural and urban environments that \n        will support child care collaboratives designed to reduce the \n        prevalence of overweight/obesity among children from birth to \n        age 5 in child care settings through dissemination of available \n        tools and curricula and implementation of emerging best \n        practices;\n            (2) enhance the focus of child care centers and family \n        child care homes serving the population of children from birth \n        to age 5 on the healthy development of children through \n        evidence-based or data-informed policies and practices to \n        improve healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time \n        limits; and\n            (3) upon completion of the 3-year period, terminate the \n        pilot program and disseminate the best practices and lessons \n        learned from the pilot program through other systems, programs, \n        or partnerships.\n\nSEC. 3.
