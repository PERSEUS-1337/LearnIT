FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2011, the President set a goal of bringing next \n        generation wireless broadband Internet access service to at \n        least 98 percent of Americans within 5 years.\n            (2) The Federal Communications Commission's National \n        Broadband Plan sets a minimum target of delivering universal, \n        affordable broadband Internet access service with actual \n        download speeds of at least 4 megabits per second and actual \n        upload speeds of at least 1 megabit per second.\n            (3) The 4 largest wireless service providers advertise 4G \n        service using different wireless mobile broadband technologies, \n        including LTE (Long Term Evolution), WiMAX (Worldwide \n        Interoperability for Microwave Access), and HSPA+ (Evolved High \n        Speed Packet Access).\n            (4) Although the International Telecommunication Union has \n        expanded its definition of 4G service to include these \n        technologies, theoretical peak speeds and actual speeds \n        experienced by consumers vary widely across technologies and \n        service providers.\n            (5) In 2010, the United States wireless industry generated \n        almost $160 billion in revenue, with approximately $50 billion \n        of this total derived from wireless data.\n            (6) Consumers need accurate information before selecting a \n        provider of wireless mobile broadband service.\n            (7) Providers and other sellers of advanced wireless mobile \n        broadband service should be required to make accurate and \n        reasonable disclosures of the terms and conditions of such \n        service in order to give consumers the necessary information to \n        make informed decisions about such service and to promote \n        greater transparency in the market.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIRED DISCLOSURES OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ADVANCED \n              WIRELESS MOBILE BROADBAND SERVICE.\n\n    (a) Sale to Consumers.--\n            (1) In general.--A person who sells advanced wireless \n        mobile broadband service directly to a consumer shall \n        accurately disclose the terms and conditions of such service by \n        displaying such terms and conditions consistently, clearly, and \n        prominently in all marketing materials for such service, at the \n        point of sale of such service, and (in the case of postpaid \n        advanced wireless mobile broadband service) in all bills for \n        such service. The terms and conditions disclosed shall include \n        the information described in subsection (c).\n            (2) Special rules for prepaid service.--\n                    (A) Off-the-shelf transactions.--Paragraph (1) does \n                not apply in the case of a transaction in which both--\n                            (i) the consumer receives a device that \n                        allows the consumer to access a specified \n                        quantity of prepaid advanced wireless mobile \n                        broadband service; and\n                            (ii) the consumer's interaction with the \n                        agents of the person from whom the consumer \n                        makes the purchase is such that the average \n                        consumer would not expect such agents to have \n                        expertise regarding the terms and conditions of \n                        such service.\n                    (B) Packagers of prepaid service.--A person who \n                packages prepaid advanced wireless mobile broadband \n                service for ultimate sale to a consumer in a \n                transaction described in subparagraph (A) shall \n                accurately disclose the terms and conditions of such \n                service by displaying such terms and conditions \n                consistently, clearly, and prominently in all marketing \n                materials for such service and on the packaging of the \n                device described in clause (i) of such subparagraph. \n                The terms and conditions disclosed shall include the \n                information described in subsection (c).\n    (b) Sale to Resellers.--A person who sells advanced wireless mobile \nbroadband service wholesale to another person for ultimate sale to \nconsumers shall disclose to such other person the information necessary \nto permit such other person to comply with subsection (a).\n    (c) Information Described.--The information described in this \nsubsection is the following:\n            (1) The guaranteed minimum transmit and receive data rates \n        for Internet protocol packets to and from on-network hosts for \n        the service, expressed in megabits per second. For purposes of \n        the preceding sentence, a minimum data rate is not guaranteed \n        unless it is available for a percentage of the time in a \n        calendar month to be established by the Commission.\n            (2) The reliability rating of the service. The Commission \n        shall establish a standard method that shall be used to \n        calculate the reliability rating of the service, which shall be \n        based on the data session start success percentage (network \n        accessibility) and the data session completion success \n        percentage (network retainability) of the service.\n            (3) The price of the service stated in terms of--\n                    (A) in the case of service that is priced based on \n                the volume of data sent or received, the price per unit \n                of data sent or received; or\n                    (B) in the case of service for which a flat rate is \n                charged for service over a given time period--\n                            (i) the flat rate; and\n                            (ii) a detailed description of any limits \n                        on the use of such service over such time \n                        period, by volume of data sent or received or \n                        otherwise.\n            (4) Any other charges that the consumer of the service will \n        incur that are not included in the price as stated pursuant to \n        paragraph (3).\n            (5) The network management policies of the service with \n        respect to Internet protocol packets to and from on-network \n        hosts, including the following:\n                    (A) Any business practices or technical mechanisms \n                employed by the service provider, other than standard \n                best-effort delivery, that allocate capacity or \n                prioritize traffic differently on the basis of the \n                source of the applications, content, or services.\n                    (B) Any limits or prohibitions on the use of \n                certain applications or services.\n                    (C) Any traffic shaping or throttling mechanisms \n                that affect the service as a result of exceeding \n                certain usage limits.\n            (6) The technology used to provide the service, such as LTE \n        (Long Term Evolution), WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for \n        Microwave Access), or HSPA+ (Evolved High Speed Packet Access).\n            (7) The uniform resource locator of a website (together \n        with a brief description of the contents of the website) on \n        which is located the following:\n                    (A) The complete terms of service, acceptable use \n                policy, and any other documentation related to the \n                network management policies of the service provider.\n                    (B) A map of the coverage area of the service.
