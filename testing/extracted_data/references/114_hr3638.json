FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is the policy of the United States to ensure that \n        all Americans are afforded just and reasonable communications \n        services, including those families that pay rates for inmate \n        telephone and video service.\n            (2) Telephone and video calls are the primary methods by \n        which individuals correspond and maintain contact with family \n        members who are incarcerated in correctional institutions.\n            (3) Except for emergency purposes, family members are not \n        allowed to call people incarcerated in correctional \n        institutions, and incarcerated persons are typically allowed to \n        call family members and other pre-approved individuals only \n        through facilities physically located on the premises of \n        correctional institutions.\n            (4) Inmate telephone and video service in correctional \n        institutions often is limited to collect calling.\n            (5) Regardless of whether the prisoners' calls are placed \n        collect or through a debit account, the prisoners' family \n        members typically pay for the calls, either through their \n        telephone bills, in the case of collect calls received from \n        prisoners, or by making deposits directly into prisoners' debit \n        accounts.\n            (6) It is clear from various studies that maintaining \n        frequent and meaningful communications between people who are \n        incarcerated and family members is key to the successful social \n        reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals. Such \n        contact reduces recidivism and facilitates rehabilitation, \n        which in turn reduces crime and the future costs of \n        imprisonment.\n            (7) Frequent communication between incarcerated persons and \n        family members is burdened, and in some cases, prevented, by \n        excessive inmate telephone and video service rates. Excessive \n        inmate telephone and video service rates thus weaken the family \n        and community ties that are necessary for successful reentry \n        into society by persons who were formerly incarcerated and the \n        reduction in crime resulting from successful reentry.\n            (8) Innocent citizens are paying excessive telephone and \n        video service charges simply due to having a family member or \n        loved one who is incarcerated.\n            (9) The rates for calls from correctional institutions are \n        some of the highest rates in the United States, with some per-\n        minute charges reaching $1 and service or connection charges of \n        $3.00 per call.\n            (10) Information compiled by the Congress and the Federal \n        Communications Commission shows that the high rates are due in \n        part to the lack of competition between companies that provide \n        long distance inmate telephone and video service to \n        correctional institutions.\n            (11) There are no competitive forces providing incentives \n        for those carriers to lower prices or operate efficiently \n        because, unlike the mass market, only one carrier is typically \n        permitted to provide long distance inmate telephone and video \n        service within each correctional institution.\n            (12) High calling rates also are due in part to commissions \n        that carriers pay to correctional institution administrators \n        for the exclusive right to provide long distance inmate \n        telephone and video service in a correctional facility. In some \n        cases, such commissions can account for as much as 60 percent \n        of the total revenues received from the use of prison \n        payphones.\n            (13) The collection of such commissions by correctional \n        institution administrators and State departments of correction \n        based upon interstate telecommunications revenues is a burden \n        on interstate commerce.\n            (14) Due to the lack of competition for telephone and video \n        services within correctional institutions, families of people \n        in prison, many of whom have low incomes, cannot choose the \n        long distance carrier with the lowest calling rates and must \n        pay the excessive rates charged by the carrier having the \n        exclusive right to provide long distance service to the \n        correctional institution from which the call originates.\n            (15) The Commission has the expertise and authority to \n        regulate inmate telephone and video service. Because parties to \n        Commission rulemaking proceedings have raised issues regarding \n        its authority to implement meaningful relief for excessive \n        inmate telephone and video service rates, Congress finds it \n        necessary and appropriate to reaffirm that the Commission has \n        the authority to implement the types of relief set forth in \n        this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS ON THE PROVISION OF INMATE TELEPHONE AND VIDEO \n              SERVICE.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 226(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 \n(47 U.S.C. 226(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(10) The term `ancillary fee' includes any charge or fee \n        that is imposed on a user of inmate telephone and video service \n        in addition to the per-minute rate and connection charge.\n            ``(11) The term `collect' or `collect call' means a \n        telephone call or video call from a person incarcerated in a \n        correctional institution that is billed to the subscriber \n        receiving the call.\n            ``(12) The term `commission' means a fee or other payment \n        by a provider of inmate telephone and video service to an \n        administrator of a correctional institution, department of \n        correction, or similar entity, based upon, or partly upon, \n        inmate telephone and video service revenue.\n            ``(13) The term `debit account' means the payment of inmate \n        telephone and video service through a prepaid card or other \n        account of a prisoner, which can be accessed only through an \n        access code, personal identification number, or similar \n        identifier.\n            ``(14) The term `inmate telephone and video service' \n        includes the provision of telephone and video service enabling \n        persons incarcerated in correctional institutions to originate \n        calls at payphones, telephones, or video kiosks that are \n        designated for the personal use of prisoners, regardless of \n        whether the calls are collect, paid through a debit account, or \n        paid through any other means.\n            ``(15) The term `provider of inmate telephone and video \n        service' means any common carrier that provides inmate \n        telephone and video service or any other person determined by \n        the Commission to be providing inmate telephone and video \n        service.''.\n    (b) Regulations.--Section 226 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \nU.S.C. 226) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (i) as subsection (k);
