    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThis act shall be known and may be cited as the Mental Health Justice Act.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares the following:\n(a) Exposure to violence increases the risk of developing a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Children in underserved communities are more likely to be exposed to violence than other children.\n(b) Ten times as many people with mental illness are in prisons and jails today than are in mental health treatment facilities.\n(c) Correctional facilities spend two to three times more money on adults with mental illnesses than they do on people who do not live with a mental illness.\n(d) Despite overall decreasing prison populations, California\u2019s prisons are experiencing increasing demand for mental health treatment services as prison inmates require mental health treatment at higher rates. This number is anticipated to continue to increase in the next five years and beyond.\n(e) In California, the annual prison cost for an inmate in the general population is $51,000, while the annual community housing and outpatient treatment costs for a person with mental illness are 60 percent less at $20,412.\n(f) Nearly half of all prisoners in California are mentally ill and have received psychiatric treatment within the past year. This number has almost doubled in the last 15 years, making jails and prisons the de facto mental health system.\n(g) Individuals with mental illnesses tend to stay longer in prison or jail and, when released, are at a higher risk of returning to prison or jail than those without these illnesses.\n(h) Mental health court participants have a significantly lower (47 percent) recidivism rate compared to similar defendants in traditional court.\n(i) Mental health courts allow for the consideration of a defendant\u2019s mental health status during court proceedings and have shown to save $7 in costs for every $1 spent.\n(j) According to the United States Supreme Court, conditions in California prisons exacerbate mental health issues significantly. Offenders with mental illness are often subjected to higher rates of physical and sexual trauma, forced restraints, solitary confinement, and overmedication while incarcerated. Those who are kept in isolation are at higher risk for psychiatric injury, self-harm, and suicide.\n(k) A defendant\u2019s mental illness should inform case processing and the nature of any criminal charges, in alignment with public safety and a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\n(l) California must increase diversion programs to redirect defendants with mental illness away from prisons and jails, which exacerbate mental illnesses, impede treatment, and increase costs, and toward proven mental health treatment services.\nSEC. 2.\nSEC. 3.\nChapter 16 (commencing with Section 1425) is added to Title 10 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  16. Mental Health Treatment\n1425.\n(a)If a defendant has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been convicted of, an offense that will result in a sentence to state prison or county jail, the defendant or the prosecutor may submit evidence that the defendant suffers from a diagnosable mental illness that was a substantial factor that contributed to the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. The evidence shall be filed after the defendant\u2019s plea or conviction, but before his or her sentencing.\n(b)If evidence is submitted pursuant to subdivision (a), the court shall consider that evidence in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s sentencing.\n(c)Upon consideration of the evidence submitted pursuant to subdivision (a), notwithstanding any other law, if the court determines that it is in the best interests of public safety, the court may order one or more of the following:\n(1)(A)That the defendant serve, if the defendant agrees, all or a part of his or her sentence in a residential mental health treatment facility instead of in the state prison or county jail, unless that placement would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n(B)This paragraph does not apply to a defendant subject to Section 1170.12.\n(2)The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or county jail authority, as applicable, to place the defendant in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail system, respectively, at a level of care determined to be appropriate by the department\u2019s mental health staff or county mental health staff, within 30 days, of the defendant\u2019s placement in the state prison or county jail.\n(3)The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the county jail authority, as applicable, regardless of the type of crime committed to prepare a postrelease mental health treatment plan six months prior to the defendant\u2019s release to parole or postrelease community supervision.
