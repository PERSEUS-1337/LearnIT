FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Autism is widely recognized as an urgent national \n        healthcare crisis. According to the Centers for Disease Control \n        and Prevention, the prevalence rate of autism is 0.75 percent, \n        or one in every 150 children born today.\n            (2) Based on statistics from the Department of Education \n        and other governmental agencies, autism is growing at the rate \n        of ten to 17 percent per year. At this rate, the estimates of \n        the prevalence of autism could reach 4,000,000 Americans in the \n        next decade.\n            (3) While no known cure for autism exists, the general \n        agreement is that early diagnosis followed by appropriate \n        intervention can improve outcomes for later years for most \n        children with autism.\n            (4) The National Council on Disability reported that \n        students with autism should be provided with the opportunities \n        and encouragement necessary to achieve the same general \n        outcomes that are viewed as essential for all students. \n        However, the special characteristics of students with autism \n        indicate certain outcomes that require increased emphasis. In \n        particular, educational programs for these individuals should \n        include as objectives the development of social competence and \n        independence in the performance of life skills.\n            (5) The limited access to successful evidence-based \n        services for children with autism is a major impediment to the \n        implementation of quality services in public schools. Without \n        these programs, successful interventions are not provided as \n        part of a child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). As a \n        result, individuals and families who wish to access services \n        are often only able to do so through incurring significant non-\n        reimbursable costs.\n            (6) The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) \n        guarantees a continuum of education and service options in the \n        least restrictive environment for students with disabilities. \n        However, meeting these requirements is challenging because many \n        regular educators do not have education or practical experience \n        with instruction of children with autism, and even experienced \n        special education teachers may need additional preparation to \n        work effectively with students who have autism.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Autism.--The term ``autism'' means an autism spectrum \n        disorder or a related developmental disability that is the \n        result of a neurological disorder affecting the normal \n        functioning of the brain and impacting development in the areas \n        of social interaction and communication skills.\n            (2) Cost-effectiveness.--The term ``cost-effectiveness'' \n        describes an alternative that effectively balances costs and \n        benefits delivering maximum benefits for the investment costs.\n            (3) Evidence-based.--The term ``evidence-based'' means \n        research that applies rigorous, systematic, and objective \n        procedures to obtain valid knowledge relevant to autism \n        instruction, and includes research that employs experimental, \n        quasi-experimental, and qualitative research methods involving \n        rigorous data analyses that are adequate to test the stated \n        hypotheses and justify the general conclusions drawn.\n            (4) Intervention.--The term ``intervention'' means the \n        application of a structured, individualized approach to skill-\n        development for children with autism.\n            (5) Learning models.--The term ``learning models'' means \n        any complimentary learning techniques designed to improve \n        classroom learning for students with autism, incorporating \n        curricula, courses, lessons, books, and workbooks.\n            (6) Professional development needs.--The term \n        ``professional development needs'' means job-embedded, ongoing \n        professional development that helps teachers, administrators, \n        and school leaders identify the potential indicators of autism, \n        and implement proven strategies to improve the quality of \n        learning for individuals with autism.\n            (7) Promising best practices.--The term ``promising best \n        practices'' means any technique, method, process, activity, \n        incentive, or reward with demonstrated success in the learning \n        environment.\n            (8) Services.--The term ``services'' means any \n        complementary interventions or therapies done on an individual \n        basis or integrated into an educational program, in an effort \n        to help increase communication skills, develop social \n        interaction, promote pro-social behavior, increase academic \n        achievement, and provide a sense of accomplishment.\n            (9) State.--The term ``State'' means any of the 50 States, \n        the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n            (10) Task force.--The term ``Task Force'' means the \n        Empowering Children with Autism through Education Task Force \n        established by the Secretary of Education under section 4(a).\n\nSEC. 4.
