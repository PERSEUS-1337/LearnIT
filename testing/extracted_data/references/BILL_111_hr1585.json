FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in \n        the United States.\n            (2) Researchers estimate that medical costs of the obesity \n        epidemic may total as much as $147,000,000,000 annually.\n            (3) The prevalence of overweight in children between the \n        ages of 6 and 11 years increased from 4.0 percent between 1971 \n        to 1974 to 17.5 percent between 2001 to 2004, and the \n        prevalence of overweight in adolescents between the ages of 12 \n        and 19 years increased from 6.1 percent to 17.0 percent.\n            (4) Recent studies indicating that 17 percent of 6 to 11 \n        year-olds and 17.6 percent of 12 to 19 year-olds are considered \n        obese. Furthermore, 33 percent of 6 to 11 year-olds and 34 \n        percent of 12 to 19 year-olds are overweight; these rates have \n        roughly doubled since 1980.\n            (5) Of all United States deaths from major chronic disease, \n        23 percent are linked to sedentary lifestyles that now begin at \n        childhood.\n            (6) Overweight adolescents have a 70 to 80 percent chance \n        of becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for \n        chronic disease, disability, and death.\n            (7) A decline in physical activity has contributed to the \n        unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity.\n            (8) The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \n        published by the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        recommend that children engage in 60 minutes or more of \n        physical activity each day.\n            (9) In a 2005 Government Accountability Office report on \n        key strategies to include in programs designed to target \n        childhood obesity, ``increasing physical activity'' was \n        identified as the most important component in any such program.\n            (10) Part of the decline in physical activity has been in \n        our Nation's schools, where physical education programs have \n        been cut back in the past 2 decades.\n            (11) The national standard for physical education \n        frequency, as outlined in the Physical Activity Guidelines for \n        Americans, is 150 minutes per week in elementary school and 225 \n        minutes per week in middle school and high school.\n            (12) Only 3.8 percent of elementary schools, 7.9 percent of \n        middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high schools provide daily \n        physical education or its equivalent for the entire school \n        year, and 22 percent of schools do not require students to take \n        any physical education at all.\n            (13) Among children ages 9 to 13, 61.5 percent do not \n        participate in any organized physical activity during out-of-\n        school hours.\n            (14) Regular physical activity is associated with a \n        healthier, longer life and a lower risk of cardiovascular \n        disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and some \n        cancers.\n            (15) Research suggests a strong correlation between \n        children's fitness and their academic performance as measured \n        by grades in core subjects and standardized test scores.\n            (16) Approximately 81 percent of adults believe daily \n        physical education should be mandatory in schools.\n\nSEC. 3.
