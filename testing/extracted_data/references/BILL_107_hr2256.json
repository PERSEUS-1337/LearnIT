FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Immigration is a Federal responsibility.\n            (2) The Immigration and Naturalization Service does not \n        take into custody all aliens who are unlawfully present in the \n        United States.\n            (3) Section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n        1395dd) and State laws require that, if any individual (whether \n        or not lawfully present in the United States) comes to a \n        hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an \n        emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either, \n        within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for \n        such further medical examination and such treatment as may be \n        required to stabilize the medical condition, or, if \n        appropriate, for transfer of the individual to another medical \n        facility.\n            (4) The Southwest border region is ill-equipped to absorb \n        the expense of providing health care to undocumented aliens \n        because it ranks last in the country in terms of per capita \n        income.\n            (5) The Southwest border region has been designated as a \n        health professional shortage area under section 332 of the \n        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e).\n            (6) The unreimbursed costs associated with caring for \n        undocumented aliens are severely threatening the financial \n        stability of health care providers in Arizona.\n\nSEC. 3. REIMBURSEMENT TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL \n              CARE RENDERED TO CERTAIN ALIENS.\n\n    Section 322 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 249) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d)(1) The Secretary shall establish and implement a 5-year pilot \nprogram under which funds made available under paragraph (6) are used \nto reimburse providers for items and services described in section \n411(b)(1) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1621(b)(1)) provided in Arizona to \naliens described in paragraph (3), and to reimburse suppliers of \nemergency ambulance services furnished to such aliens for which the \ntransportation originates in Arizona (where the use of other methods of \ntransportation is contraindicated by the alien's condition), if payment \nmay not be made to reimburse the provider or supplier under any Federal \nprogram or law other than this subsection (such as title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act), any State or local program or law, any group or \nindividual health plan, or any insurance policy.\n    ``(2) As part of the pilot program, in a case in which an alien \ndescribed in paragraph (3) arrived at a hospital in Arizona and the \nhospital provided for such medical examination and treatment of the \nalien as the hospital determined was required to stabilize an emergency \nmedical condition (within the meaning of section 1867(e)(1) of the \nSocial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd(e)(1))), the Secretary shall use \nfunds made available under paragraph (6) to reimburse the hospital for \nany transportation costs paid by the hospital to return the alien to \nthe United States border, if--\n            ``(A) the hospital requested the Attorney General to take \n        the alien into custody after such stabilization;\n            ``(B) such request was denied within 24 hours after its \n        receipt, or the Attorney General gave no response to it within \n        such period; and\n            ``(C) the hospital determined that discharging the alien \n        without providing for such transportation might pose a threat \n        to the health or safety of the alien (or, with respect to a \n        pregnant alien, the health or safety of the alien or her unborn \n        child).\n    ``(3) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien--\n            ``(A) is not lawfully present in the United States and not \n        detained by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement \n        authority; or\n            ``(B) is paroled into the United States under section \n        212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n        1182(d)(5)) for less than one year in order to receive \n        treatment for an emergency medical condition.\n    ``(4) During the period in which the pilot program is operating, \nthe Secretary shall submit annual reports to the Congress on its \noperation. Each report shall contain at least the following \ninformation:\n            ``(A) The number of aliens to whom assistance was rendered \n        for which payment was made under this subsection during the \n        previous year.\n            ``(B) The nationality of such aliens.\n            ``(C) The average cost per alien of such assistance.\n            ``(D) The total annual amount paid to each provider or \n        supplier of assistance.\n            ``(E) The feasibility and estimated cost of expanding the \n        pilot program to items and services provided anywhere in the \n        Southwest border region of the United States.\n    ``(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize \nany reduction in the funds payable to any person under any Federal \nprogram or law other than this subsection (such as title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act), any State or local program or law, any group or \nindividual health plan, or any insurance policy.\n    ``(6) To the extent provided in appropriations Acts, from amounts \nmade available to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for \nenforcement and border affairs for each of the 5 fiscal years following \nthe fiscal year in which the Border Hospital Survival and Illegal \nImmigrant Care Act is enacted, the Attorney General may transfer to the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services such amounts as may be necessary to carry out \nthis subsection, not to exceed $50,000,000 for each such year.''."
