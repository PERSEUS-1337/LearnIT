    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Incentives to Educate American \nChildren Act of 2011'' or the ``I Teach Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) As a result of retirements and decreasing retention of \n        beginning teachers, classrooms are filled with less experienced \n        teachers. The most common number of years of teaching \n        experience for public school teachers has decreased from 15 \n        years experience in 1987-1988 to just 1 year teaching \n        experience in the most recent data for 2007-2008. Students \n        deserve teachers with more experience and training.\n            (2) Recent research confirms that additional years of \n        teaching experience at the same grade level (up to 20 years) \n        add a direct positive impact on student achievement.\n            (3) The most recent data (2007-2008) from the National \n        Center for Education Statistics find 32 percent of America's \n        public schools are in rural school districts, and the increased \n        transportation costs these school districts face mean they have \n        less money for instructional costs and salaries. Department of \n        Education data show that rural school districts have the lowest \n        base salaries for starting teachers and this continues as \n        teachers move to the top of the local salary range. Rural \n        schools face these challenges in all States.\n            (4) A 2009 study by the Education Trust reports that high \n        poverty high schools are twice as likely not to have teachers \n        certified in their fields than low poverty schools. The same \n        study found the percentage of first year teachers to be higher \n        in high poverty schools in cities, suburbs, and small towns. \n        Rural schools have first year teacher rates above the national \n        average regardless of poverty rate.\n            (5) The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards \n        was founded in 1987 as a follow up to the landmark 1983 report, \n        ``A Nation at Risk'', by the Carnegie Task Force on Teaching. \n        The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is an \n        independent, nonprofit, and nonpartisan organization the \n        mission of which is to establish high and rigorous standards \n        for what accomplished teachers should know and be able to do.\n            (6) Nearly 91,000 teachers from all 50 States and the \n        District of Columbia have completed certification by the \n        National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, where \n        certification is a rigorous assessment process for teachers.\n            (7) In 2008, the National Research Council (NRC) of the \n        National Academies affirmed that students taught by National \n        Board certified teachers make higher gains on achievement tests \n        than those taught by teachers who have not applied for or have \n        not achieved certification.\n            (8) A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute found \n        that public school teachers earn significantly less than other \n        college graduates. The study found teachers were paid on \n        average only 77 percent as much as other college graduates and \n        the disparity is growing.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To encourage teachers, through a refundable tax credit, \n        to work in public elementary and secondary schools located in \n        rural areas or schools with high poverty.\n            (2) To provide an additional tax credit to teachers who \n        achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \n        Teaching Standards in order to recruit and retain highly \n        qualified teachers in public elementary and secondary schools.\n\nSEC. 3.
