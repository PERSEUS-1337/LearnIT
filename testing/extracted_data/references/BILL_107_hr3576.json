FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the national interest that all citizens, \n        including active-duty service members, be allowed to vote in \n        Federal elections.\n            (2) Since 1977, active-duty service members serving \n        overseas or on the United States mainland have been excluded \n        from fully participating and voting in both general and runoff \n        Federal elections in American Samoa due to several factors, \n        including local law that requires active duty military members \n        to register in person, limited air and mail service between the \n        U.S. mainland and American Samoa, and delays in the preparation \n        of new ballots in the case of runoff elections.\n            (3) American Samoa law requiring uniformed service voters \n        to register to vote in person is contrary to the Uniformed and \n        Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ff et \n        seq.).\n            (4) The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act \n        has been in effect for over 15 years, and American Samoa has \n        not addressed this discrepancy between Federal and territorial \n        law, despite notice that the discrepancy exists.\n            (5) It is necessary to take additional action to ensure \n        that the votes of uniformed voters are counted in Federal \n        elections conducted in American Samoa and that active duty \n        service members (including reservists called to active duty) do \n        not need to appear in person to register to vote.\n            (6) It is necessary to state that the Uniformed and \n        Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act supersedes American Samoa \n        law and American Samoa must comply with this Federal law.\n            (7) It is also in the national interest that, to the extent \n        possible, Members of the United States House of Representatives \n        and non-voting Delegates be elected in the first week of \n        November in even-numbered years.\n            (8) Since 1980, when the first election for the \n        Congressional Delegate from American Samoa was held, there have \n        been several general elections at which there was no final \n        resolution of who was elected as the Delegate for the next \n        Congress, and run-off elections were required.\n            (9) When the outcome of the Delegate election is not \n        resolved until a runoff election is held, a final determination \n        of who the Delegate will be is not made known until late \n        November.\n            (10) A delayed outcome may place a newly elected Delegate \n        in a more junior position to other Members of Congress elected \n        on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November in an \n        election year.\n            (11) When more than 2 candidates file to run for election \n        for the office of Delegate, holding a primary election to \n        reduce the number of candidates to 2 will greatly increase the \n        likelihood that the general election will produce a candidate \n        who receives a majority of the votes cast.\n\nSEC. 2. PRIMARY ELECTION REQUIRED.\n\n    Section 2(a) of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide that the \nTerritory of American Samoa be represented by a nonvoting Delegate to \nthe United States House of Representatives, and for other purposes'', \napproved October 31, 1978 (48 U.S.C. 1732(a)) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n    ``(2) In any general election year when 3 or more eligible \nindividuals file by the first Tuesday of July as candidates for the \noffice of Delegate, a primary election shall be held on the first \nTuesday of August of that general election year. If the primary \nelection results in 1 candidate receiving more than 50 percent of the \nvotes cast, then that candidate shall be the only candidate on the \nballot for the general election for Delegate that year. If the primary \nelection results in no candidate receiving more than 50 percent of the \nvotes cast, then the 2 candidates receiving the most votes cast shall \nbe on the ballot for the general election year. If there is a tie for \nthe 2 candidates receiving the most votes, the names of the 2 \ncandidates shall be listed on the ballot for that general election \nyear.\n    ``(3) Candidates for the office of Delegate to the United States \nHouse of Representatives must file their candidacy not later than the \nfirst Tuesday of July each year that a general election referred to in \nparagraph (1) is scheduled to be held.''.\n\nSEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n    Section 4 of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide that the \nTerritory of American Samoa be represented by a nonvoting Delegate to \nthe United States House of Representatives, and for other purposes'', \napproved October 31, 1978 (48 U.S.C. 1734), is amended by inserting \n``in a general Federal election'' after ``ties between candidates''.\n\nSEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on January 1, \n2003."
