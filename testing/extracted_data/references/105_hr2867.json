FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The ancient Silk Road, once the economic lifeline of \n        Central Asia and the South Caucasus, traversed much of the \n        territory now within the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, \n        Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \n        Uzbekistan.\n            (2) Economic interdependence spurred mutual cooperation \n        among the peoples along the Silk Road and restoration of the \n        historic relationships and economic ties between those peoples \n        is an important element of ensuring their sovereignty as well \n        as the success of democratic and market reforms.\n            (3) The development of strong political and economic ties \n        between countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia and \n        the West will foster stability in the region.\n            (4) The development of open market economies and open \n        democratic systems in the countries of the South Caucasus and \n        Central Asia will provide positive incentives for international \n        private investment, increased trade, and other forms of \n        commercial interactions with the rest of the world.\n            (5) The Caspian Sea Basin, overlapping the territory of the \n        countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia, contains \n        proven oil and gas reserves that may exceed $4,000,000,000,000 \n        in value.\n            (6) The region of the South Caucasus and Central Asia will \n        produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities to reduce the \n        dependence of the United States on energy from the volatile \n        Persian Gulf region.\n            (7) United States foreign policy and international \n        assistance should be narrowly targeted to support the economic \n        and political independence of the countries of the South \n        Caucasus and Central Asia.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States in the countries of the \nSouth Caucasus and Central Asia--\n            (1) to promote and strengthen independence, sovereignty, \n        and democratic government;\n            (2) to assist actively in the resolution of regional \n        conflicts;\n            (3) to promote friendly relations and economic cooperation;\n            (4) to help promote market-oriented principles and \n        practices;\n            (5) to assist in the development of the infrastructure \n        necessary for communications, transportation, and energy and \n        trade on an East-West axis in order to build strong \n        international relations and commerce between those countries \n        and the stable, democratic, and market-oriented countries of \n        the Euro-Atlantic Community; and\n            (6) to support United States business interests and \n        investments in the region.\n\nSEC. 4. UNITED STATES EFFORTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN GEORGIA, \n              AZERBAIJAN, AND TAJIKISTAN.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the President should use all \ndiplomatic means practicable, including the engagement of senior United \nStates Government officials, to press for an equitable, fair, and \npermanent resolution to the conflicts in Georgia and Azerbaijan and the \ncivil war in Tajikistan.\n\nSEC. 5.
