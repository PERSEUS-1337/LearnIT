FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) According to the United States Census Bureau, 45.7 \n        million people were uninsured in 2007.\n            (2) According to a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund, \n        the number of underinsured adults aged 19 to 64 has jumped 60 \n        percent over the last 4 years, from 16,000,000 in 2003 to \n        25,000,000 in 2007.\n            (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention (CDC), approximately 45 percent of Americans have at \n        least one chronic condition.\n            (4) Forty-four States currently allow insurance companies \n        to deny coverage for, limit coverage for, or charge increased \n        premiums for a preexisting condition.\n            (5) Over 26 million people were enrolled in private \n        individual market health plans in 2007. Under the Health \n        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), \n        these individuals have no protections against pre-existing \n        condition exclusions or waiting periods.\n            (6) When a child or adult has a 63-day gap in insurance \n        coverage, pre-existing condition exclusions, such as limiting \n        coverage or instituting a waiting period, can be placed on them \n        when they become insured under a new health insurance policy.\n            (7) Eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions for all \n        is a vital safeguard to ensuring that all Americans have access \n        to health care when in need.\n            (8) According to a Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard School \n        of Public Health public opinion poll, 58 percent of Americans \n        strongly favor the Federal Government requiring health \n        insurance companies to cover anyone who applies for health \n        coverage, even if they have a prior illness.\n\nSEC. 3.
