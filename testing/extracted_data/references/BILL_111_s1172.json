FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) municipal solid waste, a plentiful resource, can be a \n        substantial source of clean, renewable energy;\n            (2) by collecting methane produced by landfills and \n        converting the methane into productive energy, landfills can \n        contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas \n        emissions;\n            (3) clean energy policy of the United States should fully \n        recognize and support the ability of landfills to provide clean \n        energy and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas \n        emissions;\n            (4) further investment is needed to promote new \n        technologies and develop new processes for the conversion of \n        municipal solid waste into clean, renewable energy; and\n            (5) investment in municipal solid waste clean energy \n        projects can create jobs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and \n        lessen the dependence of the United States on foreign oil.\n\nSEC. 3.

REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH LANDFILLS.\n\n    (a) Additionality.--Under any legislation enacted after the date of \nenactment of this Act to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases that \nincludes a cap-and-trade system, a landfill gas control measure that \nreduces the emission of a greenhouse gas at a level greater than \nrequired under Federal, State, or local laws (including regulations) \nused for that reduction shall be considered to meet additionality \ncriteria under that legislation.\n    (b) Domestic Offsets.--If a landfill gas control measure described \nin subsection (a) meets criteria under legislation described in that \nsubsection to qualify as a domestic offset, the domestic offset shall \nbe at a level that is equal to the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted \nthat is less than the baseline quantity of the greenhouse gases \nemitted."
