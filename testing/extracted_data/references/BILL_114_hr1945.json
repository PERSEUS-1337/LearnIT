FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) poaching of African elephants and rhinoceros has \n        increased dramatically since 2006, and has reached levels that \n        threaten the continued existence of many elephant and \n        rhinoceros populations;\n            (2) poaching of African elephants and rhinoceros is being \n        driven by increased demand for ivory and rhinoceros horn in \n        Asia, which has caused ivory and rhinoceros horn prices to rise \n        exponentially in recent years;\n            (3) high prices have drawn organized criminal elements into \n        the illegal trade of ivory and rhinoceros horn, and it is \n        widely recognized that transnational crime rings involved in \n        trafficking in drugs, guns, and humans are also responsible for \n        trafficking in large quantities of poached ivory and rhinoceros \n        horn from Africa to Asia;\n            (4) there is significant evidence that terrorist and \n        insurgent groups in Africa, including groups with ties to Al \n        Qaeda, are financing their operations through the sale of \n        illegal ivory and rhinoceros horn;\n            (5) the elephant and rhinoceros poaching crisis has become \n        so severe, and the tactics of poachers so sophisticated, that \n        traditional approaches to conservation law enforcement intended \n        to protect elephants and rhinoceros in their habitat in Africa \n        are failing;\n            (6) a number of countries that serve as major source, \n        transit, or destination points for illegal ivory and rhinoceros \n        horn have proven unable or unwilling to stop the product from \n        coming across their borders; and\n            (7) strategies to reduce demand for ivory and rhinoceros \n        horn through education and other nonbinding means are \n        necessary, but not sufficient, to conserve African elephant and \n        rhinoceros populations.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a means by \nwhich the United States can affect demand for and illegal trafficking \nof African elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn in other countries by \nrequiring those countries to enter into consultations with the United \nStates to end the illegal ivory and rhinoceros horn trade, as a \ncondition of continued access to United States markets for other \nnatural resource products.\n\n      TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION ACT\n\nSEC. 101. ILLEGAL TRADE DEFINED.\n\n    Section 2305 of the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n4244) is amended by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (13) as \nparagraphs (6) through (14), respectively, and by inserting after \nparagraph (4) the following:\n            ``(5) Illegal trade.--The term `illegal trade' means any \n        sale, purchase, barter, transit, or exchange of raw ivory or \n        worked ivory that was taken, traded, imported, or exported in \n        violation of the laws of an ivory-producing country, or of \n        international wildlife trade agreements, including CITES.''.\n\nSEC. 102. AMENDMENT TO FINDINGS IN AFRICAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION ACT.\n\n    Section 2003 of the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n4202) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(10) Poaching and trafficking of wildlife has become a \n        global crisis, funding organized criminal syndicates and \n        terrorist organizations and harming elephant populations and \n        local communities. African elephant ivory is at the center of \n        this crisis, and immediate action is necessary to eliminate the \n        demand for ivory and the profit incentive for poachers and \n        traffickers.''.\n\nSEC. 103. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    Section 2004 of the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n4203) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``and'' after the semicolon at the end of \n        paragraph (1);\n            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and \n        by inserting ``; and''; and\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(3) to prevent additional African elephant ivory from \n        entering global commerce, and to reduce demand for ivory that \n        is driving elephant poaching by limiting natural resources-\n        related trade with countries whose nationals are engaged in \n        illegal ivory trade.''.\n\nSEC. 104.
