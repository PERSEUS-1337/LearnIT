FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) American innovation, and the protection of that \n        innovation by the government, has been a critical component of \n        the economic growth of this Nation throughout the history of \n        the Nation;\n            (2) copyright-based industries represent one of the most \n        valuable economic assets of this country, contributing over 5 \n        percent of the gross domestic product of the United States and \n        creating significant job growth and tax revenues;\n            (3) the American intellectual property sector employs \n        approximately 4,300,000 people, representing over 3 percent of \n        total United States employment;\n            (4) the proliferation of organized criminal counterfeiting \n        enterprises threatens the economic growth of United States \n        copyright industries;\n            (5) the American intellectual property sector has invested \n        millions of dollars to develop highly sophisticated \n        authentication features that assist consumers and law \n        enforcement in distinguishing genuine intellectual property \n        products and packaging from counterfeits;\n            (6) in order to thwart these industry efforts, \n        counterfeiters traffic in, and tamper with, genuine \n        authentication features, for example, by obtaining genuine \n        authentication features through illicit means and then \n        commingling these features with counterfeit software or \n        packaging;\n            (7) Federal law does not provide adequate civil and \n        criminal remedies to combat tampering activities that directly \n        facilitate counterfeiting crimes; and\n            (8) in order to strengthen Federal enforcement against \n        counterfeiting of copyrighted works, Congress must enact \n        legislation that--\n                    (A) prohibits trafficking in, and tampering with, \n                authentication features of copyrighted works; and\n                    (B) permits aggrieved parties an appropriate civil \n                cause of action.\n\nSEC. 3.
