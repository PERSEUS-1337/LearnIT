FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Residents of Washington, DC pay Federal income tax, but \n        do not have voting members in the United States Congress.\n            (2) Article I, section 2, clause 1 of the United States \n        Constitution states that the ``House of Representatives shall \n        be composed of members chosen every second year by the people \n        of the several states.''.\n            (3) The Founding Fathers did not consider the proposed \n        district that would become Washington, DC a State under the \n        Constitution, as evidenced when Alexander Hamilton offered an \n        amendment to the Constitution during the New York ratification \n        to provide full congressional representation to Washington, DC, \n        but the convention rejected the amendment on July 22, 1788. \n        Thomas Tredwell stated at the same convention that the plan for \n        Washington, DC ``departs from every principle of freedom'' \n        because it did not give residents full representation in \n        Congress.\n            (4) Chief Justice Marshall held in Hepburn v. Ellzey in \n        1805 that the term ``states'' in article I, section 2, clause 1 \n        of the Constitution does not include Washington, DC for \n        representation purposes.\n            (5) Seven Supreme Court Justices affirmed Chief Justice \n        Marshall's Hepburn reasoning in National Mut. Ins. Co. of Dist. \n        of Col. v. Tidewater Transfer Co. in 1949.\n            (6) A Democrat-controlled Congress in 1978 attempted to \n        amend the Constitution to provide Washington, DC with full \n        congressional representation. The Committee on the Judiciary of \n        the House of Representatives reported the resolution and stated \n        that granting congressional representation to the District of \n        Columbia as it is presently constituted would require a \n        constitutional amendment, because ``statutory action alone will \n        not suffice''.\n            (7) Proposals to grant Washington, DC congressional \n        representation will inevitably be challenged in court, calling \n        into question the validity of any narrowly passed legislation \n        that a Washington, DC member votes on and leaving Washington, \n        DC residents in a continued state of flux over their status.\n            (8) Amending the Constitution requires two-thirds approval \n        by each house of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of \n        the States. In 1978, there was success in obtaining a favorable \n        vote from two-thirds of both the House and the Senate on a \n        constitutional amendment to provide Washington, DC with full \n        congressional representation, but the requirement for \n        ratification by three-fourths of the States could not be \n        obtained.\n            (9) An alternative to a potentially lengthy and difficult \n        constitutional amendment process is ceding Washington, DC back \n        to Maryland, just as an area of 31 square miles that was \n        originally ceded by Virginia was returned to that State by \n        Federal legislation in 1847, thereby ensuring that the portion \n        of Washington, DC in Virginia would have Senate and House \n        representation.\n            (10) In 1847, there was a desire to allow the District of \n        Columbia land on the west side of the Potomac River that was \n        not being used by the Federal Government to have its own proper \n        representation in Congress.\n            (11) Obtaining the desired representation for this portion \n        of Washington, DC would have required a constitutional \n        amendment unless the land were given back to Virginia.\n            (12) Instead of trying to pass a constitutional amendment, \n        Congress in 1847 legislatively ceded back to Virginia from the \n        District of Columbia the non-Federal land composed of 31 square \n        miles on the west side of the Potomac River.\n            (13) Accordingly, the District of Columbia would clearly \n        and constitutionally have 2 Senators and a Representative with \n        full voting rights by ceding the District of Columbia to \n        Maryland after Maryland's acceptance of such retrocession, \n        while maintaining the exclusive legislative authority and \n        control of Congress over the National Capital Service Area in \n        the District of Columbia.\n\nSEC. 3. RETROCESSION OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO MARYLAND.\n\n    (a) In General.--Upon the issuance of a proclamation by the \nPresident under section 8 and except as provided in subsection (b), the \nterritory ceded to Congress by the State of Maryland to serve as the \nDistrict constituting the permanent seat of the Government of the \nUnited States is ceded and relinquished to the State of Maryland.\n    (b) Continuation of Federal Control Over National Capital Service \nArea.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), the National Capital Service \nArea described in section 5 shall not be ceded and relinquished to the \nState of Maryland and shall continue to serve as the permanent seat of \nthe Government of the United States, and Congress shall continue to \nexercise exclusive legislative authority and control over such Area.\n\nSEC. 4. EFFECT ON JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS IN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\n    (a) Continuation of Suits.--No writ, action, indictment, cause, or \nproceeding pending in any court of the District of Columbia on the \neffective date of this Act shall abate as a result of the enactment of \nthis Act, but shall be transferred and shall proceed within such \nappropriate court of the State of Maryland as established under the \nlaws or constitution of the State of Maryland.\n    (b) Appeals.--An order or decision of any court of the District of \nColumbia for which no appeal has been filed as of the effective date of \nthis Act shall be considered an order or decision of a court of the \nState of Maryland for purposes of appeal from and appellate review of \nsuch order or decision in an appropriate court of the State of \nMaryland.\n\nSEC. 5. NATIONAL CAPITAL SERVICE AREA.\n\n    (a) Description.--The National Capital Service Area referred to in \nsection 3(b) is comprised of the principal Federal monuments, the White \nHouse, the United
