FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The rice industry in the State of Louisiana contributes \n        significantly to the economy of that State and the United \n        States, with an estimated annual value of approximately \n        $250,000,000 and an estimated average annual economic benefit \n        of approximately $1,000,000,000.\n            (2) For the 2002 crop of rice, rice producers in the State \n        of Louisiana suffered from the lowest rice prices in more than \n        50 years.\n            (3) Since most of the 2002 crop of rice in the State of \n        Louisiana was sold during the harvest season, the market-\n        derived income of producers from the sale of rice fell to \n        record low levels.\n            (4) The historically-low income of producers from the sale \n        of rice in the State of Louisiana, even when combined with \n        Federal income support, still is devastating to--\n                    (A) rice producers in the State;\n                    (B) the rice industry infrastructure of the State;\n                    (C) businesses that serve and depend on the rice \n                industry; and\n                    (D) communities in which rice producers and their \n                families reside and in which the rice industry \n                operates.\n            (5) Because of the significant reduction in total income \n        and the current costs of production, many rice producers of the \n        State of Louisiana will not cover the total expenses they \n        incurred to produce and harvest the 2002 crop.\n            (6) The historically-low prices of the 2002 crop of rice in \n        the State of Louisiana have contributed to a combined market \n        price and Federal support income level that is approximately \n        $2.42 per hundredweight less than the average combined market \n        price and Federal support income levels during the 1998 through \n        2001 period, which is approximately 22 percent below the \n        average income level for the State for the same time period.\n            (7) Due to the historically-low rice prices and reduced \n        income, rice producers in the State of Louisiana and their \n        families are faced with dire economic circumstances that are \n        crippling them and the communities in which they live and work.\n\nSEC. 3. ECONOMIC DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR LOUISIANA RICE PRODUCERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall use such sums \nas are necessary of funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to make \npayments, as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this \nAct, to producers of the 2002 crop of rice on farms located in the \nState of Louisiana, to assist producers as a result of the disastrous \neconomic conditions occurring with the 2002 crop of rice.\n    (b) Amount.--The amount of a payment made to producers on a farm \nunder this section shall be equal to the product obtained by \nmultiplying--\n            (1) the actual quantity of rice produced by the producers \n        on the farm during the 2002 crop year; and\n            (2) a payment rate of $2.42 per hundredweight.\n    (c) Payment Limitation.--\n            (1) In general.--The total amount of payments that a person \n        shall be entitled to receive under this section may not exceed \n        $40,000.\n            (2) Regulations.--The Secretary shall promulgate \n        regulations defining the term ``person'' for the purposes of \n        paragraph (1), which shall conform, to the maximum extent \n        practicable, to the regulations defining the term ``person'' \n        promulgated under section 1001 of the Food Security Act of 1985 \n        (7 U.S.C. 1308).
