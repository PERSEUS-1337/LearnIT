SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Our Federal Building \nWorkers and Visitors From Exposure to Deadly Smoke (PRO-FEDS) Act of \n1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) environmental tobacco smoke comes from secondhand smoke \n        exhaled by smokers and sidestream smoke emitted from the \n        burning of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes;\n            (2) since citizens of the United States spend up to 90 \n        percent of a day indoors, there is a significant potential for \n        exposure to environmental tobacco smoke from indoor air;\n            (3) exposure to environmental tobacco smoke occurs in \n        schools, public buildings, and other indoor facilities;\n            (4) recent scientific studies have concluded that exposure \n        to environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of lung cancer in \n        healthy nonsmokers and is responsible for acute and chronic \n        respiratory problems and other health impacts in sensitive \n        populations (including children);\n            (5) the health risks posed by environmental tobacco smoke \n        exceed the risks posed by many environmental pollutants \n        regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency; and\n            (6) according to information released by the Environmental \n        Protection Agency, environmental tobacco smoke results in a \n        loss to the economy of over $3,000,000,000 per year.\n\nSEC. 3.

The entity or individual may not \n        make any modification that violates the criteria for a waiver \n        under paragraph (1).\n    (d) Collective Bargaining Agreements.--\n            (1) In general.--In a Federal agency in which a labor \n        organization has been accorded recognition as a bargaining unit \n        pursuant to chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, the \n        Federal agency shall engage in collective bargaining pursuant \n        to section 7114 of title 5, United States Code, to ensure the \n        implementation of the requirements of this section that affect \n        work areas predominately occupied by the employees represented \n        by the labor organization by the date of the adoption, pursuant \n        to this section, of a nonsmoking policy applicable to the \n        Federal agency.\n            (2) Exemption.--\n                    (A) In general.--If, on the date of enactment of \n                this Act--\n                            (i) a bargaining unit referred to in \n                        paragraph (1) has in effect a collective \n                        bargaining agreement with respect to which a \n                        Federal agency is a party; and\n                            (ii) the collective bargaining agreement \n                        referred to in clause (i) includes provisions \n                        relating to smoking privileges that are in \n                        violation of the requirements of this section,\n                the head of the Federal agency may exempt work areas \n                predominately occupied by the employees subject to the \n                collective bargaining agreement from the nonsmoking \n                policy that the Federal agency is required to be \n                carried out under subsection (b).\n                    (B) Termination of exemption.--\n                            (i) In general.--An exemption referred to \n                        in subparagraph (A) shall terminate on the \n                        earlier of--\n                                    (I) the first expiration date \n                                (after the date of enactment of this \n                                Act) of the collective bargaining \n                                agreement containing the provisions \n                                relating to smoking privileges; or\n                                    (II) the date that is 1 year after \n                                the date of issuance of the guidelines.\n                            (ii) Implementation of nonsmoking policy \n                        after termination date.-- By the applicable \n                        date specified in clause (i)(II), the head of \n                        each Federal agency shall be required to \n                        enforce a nonsmoking policy that meets the \n                        requirements of the guidelines issued under \n                        subsection (a) in each work area under the \n                        jurisdiction of the head of the Federal agency, \n                        notwithstanding any collective bargaining \n                        agreement that contains provisions that are \n                        less restrictive than the nonsmoking policy.\n\nSEC. 5.
