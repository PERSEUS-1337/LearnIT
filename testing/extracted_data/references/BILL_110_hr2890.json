PHOTOVOLTAIC DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a program of grants \nto States to demonstrate advanced photovoltaic technology.\n    (b) Requirements.--\n            (1) Ability to meet requirements.--To receive funding under \n        the program under this section, a State must submit a proposal \n        that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that \n        the State will meet the requirements of subsection (f).\n            (2) Compliance with requirements.--If a State has received \n        funding under this section for the preceding year, the State \n        must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that it \n        complied with the requirements of subsection (f) in carrying \n        out the program during that preceding year, and that it will do \n        so in the future, before it can receive further funding under \n        this section.\n            (3) Funding allocation.--Each State submitting a qualifying \n        proposal shall receive funding under the program based on the \n        proportion of United States population in the State according \n        to the 2000 census. In each fiscal year, the portion of funds \n        attributable under this paragraph to States that have not \n        submitted qualifying proposals in the time and manner specified \n        by the Secretary shall be distributed pro rata to the States \n        that have submitted qualifying proposals in the specified time \n        and manner.\n    (c) Competition.--If more than $25,000,000 is available for the \nprogram under this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall \nallocate 75 percent of the total amount of funds available according to \nsubsection (b)(3), and shall award the remaining 25 percent on a \ncompetitive basis to the States with the proposals the Secretary \nconsiders most likely to encourage the widespread adoption of \nphotovoltaic technologies.\n    (d) Proposals.--Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment \nof this Act, and in each subsequent fiscal year for the life of the \nprogram, the Secretary shall solicit proposals from the States to \nparticipate in the program under this section.\n    (e) Competitive Criteria.--In awarding funds in a competitive \nallocation under subsection (c), the Secretary shall consider--\n            (1) the likelihood of a proposal to encourage the \n        demonstration of, or lower the costs of, advanced photovoltaic \n        technologies; and\n            (2) the extent to which a proposal is likely to--\n                    (A) maximize the amount of photovoltaics \n                demonstrated;\n                    (B) maximize the proportion of non-Federal cost \n                share; and\n                    (C) limit State administrative costs.\n    (f) State Program.--A program operated by a State with funding \nunder this section shall provide competitive awards for the \ndemonstration of advanced photo-voltaic technologies. Each State \nprogram shall--\n            (1) require a contribution of at least 60 percent per award \n        from non-Federal sources, which may include any combination of \n        State, local, and private funds, except that at least 10 \n        percent of the funding must be supplied by the State;\n            (2) endeavor to fund recipients in the commercial, \n        industrial, institutional, governmental, and residential \n        sectors;\n            (3) limit State administrative costs to no more than 10 \n        percent of the grant;\n            (4) report annually to the Secretary on--\n                    (A) the amount of funds disbursed;\n                    (B) the amount of photovoltaics purchased; and\n                    (C) the results of the monitoring under paragraph \n                (5);\n            (5) provide for measurement and verification of the output \n        of a representative sample of the photovoltaics systems \n        demonstrated throughout the average working life of the \n        systems, or at least 20 years; and\n            (6) require that applicant buildings must have received an \n        independent energy efficiency audit during the 6-month period \n        preceding the filing of the application.\n    (g) Unexpended Funds.--If a State fails to expend any funds \nreceived under subsection (b) or (c) within 3 years of receipt, such \nremaining funds shall be returned to the Treasury.\n    (h) Reports.--The Secretary shall report to Congress 5 years after \nfunds are first distributed to the States under this section--\n            (1) the amount of photovoltaics demonstrated;\n            (2) the number of projects undertaken;\n            (3) the administrative costs of the program;\n            (4) the amount of funds that each State has not received \n        because of a failure to submit a qualifying proposal, as \n        described in subsection (b)(3);\n            (5) the results of the monitoring under subsection (f)(5); \n        and\n            (6) the total amount of funds distributed, including a \n        breakdown by State.\n    (i) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated to the Secretary for the purposes of carrying out this \nsection--\n            (1) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n            (2) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2009;\n            (3) $45,000,000 for fiscal year 2010;\n            (4) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2011; and\n            (5) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2012."
