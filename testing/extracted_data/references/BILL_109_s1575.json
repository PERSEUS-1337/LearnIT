FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) has \n        helped to support students preparing to be nurse educators. \n        Yet, nursing schools nationwide are forced to deny admission to \n        individuals due to lack of qualified nurse faculty.\n            (2) According to the February 2004 Monthly Labor Review of \n        the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1,000,000 new and \n        replacement nurses will be needed by 2012.\n            (3) According to the American Association of Colleges of \n        Nursing, in the 2004-2005 academic year, 29,425 individuals, or \n        35 percent of the qualified applicants were not accepted into \n        nursing baccalaureate programs. 2,748 potential nursing \n        master's students and over 200 nurses qualified for admission \n        to doctoral programs were not accepted. Estimates from the \n        National League of Nursing indicate that over 123,000 qualified \n        applications could not be accommodated in associate degree, \n        diploma, and baccalaureate registered nurse educational \n        programs in 2004.\n            (4) Seventy-six percent of schools report insufficient \n        faculty as the primary reason for not accepting qualified \n        applicants. The primary reasons for lack of faculty are lack of \n        funds to hire new faculty, inability to identify, recruit and \n        hire faculty in the current competitive job market, and lack of \n        nursing faculty available in different geographic areas.\n            (5) Despite the fact that 75 percent of graduates of \n        doctoral nursing program enter education roles (versus about 5 \n        percent of graduates of nursing master's programs), the 93 \n        doctoral programs nationwide produce only 400 graduates. This \n        annual graduation rate is insufficient to meet current needs \n        for nurse faculty. In keeping with other professional academic \n        disciplines, nurse faculty at colleges and universities are \n        typically doctorally-prepared.\n            (6) With the average age of nurse faculty at retirement at \n        62.5 years of age and the average age of doctorally-prepared \n        faculty currently at 53.5 years, the health care system faces \n        unprecedented workforce and health access challenges with \n        current and future shortages of deans, nurse educators, and \n        nurses.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n    Part D of title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n296p et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 832.
