    "title": "A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize the poison center national toll-free number, national media campaign, and grant program to provide assistance for poison prevention, sustain the funding of poison centers, and enhance the public health of people of the United States.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Center Support, Enhancement, \nand Awareness Act of 2008''.\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) Poison control centers are the primary defense of the \n    United States against injury and deaths from poisoning. Twenty-four \n    hours a day, the general public as well as health care \n    practitioners contact their local poison control centers for help \n    in diagnosing and treating victims of poisoning. In 2007, more than \n    4,000,000 calls were managed by poison control centers providing \n    ready and direct access for all people of the United States, \n    including many underserved populations in the United States, with \n    vital emergency public health information and response.\n        (2) Poisoning is the second most common form of unintentional \n    death in the United States. In any given year, there will be \n    between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 poison exposures. Sixty percent of \n    these exposures will involve children under the age of 6 who are \n    exposed to toxins in their home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 \n    hospitalizations, 1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and more \n    than 26,000 fatalities in 2005.\n        (3) In 2008, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center \n    reported that poisonings from accidents and unknown circumstances \n    more than tripled in rate since 1990. In 2005, the last year for \n    which data are available, 26,858 people died from accidental or \n    unknown poisonings. This represents an increase of 20,000 since \n    1990 and an increase of 2,400 between 2004 and 2005. Fatalities \n    from poisoning are increasing in the United States in near epidemic \n    proportions. The funding of programs to reverse this trend is \n    needed now more than ever.\n        (4) In 2004, The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy \n    of Sciences recommended that ``Congress should amend the current \n    Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act Amendments of \n    2003 to provide sufficient funding to support the proposed Poison \n    Prevention and Control System with its national network of poison \n    centers. Support for the core activities at the current level of \n    service is estimated to require more than $100 million annually.''.\n        (5) Sustaining the funding structure and increasing \n    accessibility to poison control centers will promote the \n    utilization of poison control centers and reduce the inappropriate \n    use of emergency medical services and other more costly health care \n    services. The 2004 Institute of Medicine Report to Congress \n    determined that for every $1 invested in the Nation's poison \n    control centers $7 of health care costs are saved. In 2005, direct \n    Federal health care program savings totaled in excess of \n    $525,000,000 as the result of poison control center public health \n    services.\n        (6) More than 30 percent of the cost savings and financial \n    benefits of the Nation's network of poison control centers are \n    realized annually by Federal health care programs (estimated to be \n    more than $1,000,000,000), yet Federal funding support (as \n    demonstrated by the annual authorization of $30,100,000 in Public \n    Law 108-194) comprises less than 11 percent of the annual network \n    expenditures of poison centers.\n        (7) Real-time data collected from the Nation's certified poison \n    control centers can be an important source of information for the \n    detection, monitoring, and response for contamination of the air, \n    water, pharmaceutical, or food supply.\n        (8) In the event of a terrorist event, poison control centers \n    will be relied upon as a critical source for accurate medical \n    information and public health emergency response concerning the \n    treatment of patients who have had an exposure to a chemical, \n    radiological, or biological agent.\nSEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF POISON CONTROL CENTERS NATIONAL TOLL-FREE \nNUMBER.\n    Section 1271 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300d-71) \nis amended to read as follows:\n``SEC. 1271.
