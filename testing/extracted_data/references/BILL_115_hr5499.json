FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Stephen ``Steve'' Gleason was born March 19, 1977, in \n        Spokane, Washington to Mike and Gail Gleason.\n            (2) Steve attended Gonzaga Preparatory School for high \n        school where he excelled as both a football and baseball \n        player.\n            (3) In 1995, Steve enrolled at Washington State University \n        where he was a 2-sport athlete for the baseball and football \n        teams and helped the Cougars football team advance to the 1997 \n        Rose Bowl.\n            (4) In 2000, Steve signed a professional football contract \n        with the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League as \n        an undrafted free agent but later joined the New Orleans Saints \n        in November of that same season.\n            (5) Steve would go on to play 7 more seasons as a member of \n        the New Orleans Saints.\n            (6) Steve will always be remembered for his blocked punt on \n        September 25, 2006, against the Atlanta Falcons, the night the \n        Louisiana Superdome reopened for the first time after Hurricane \n        Katrina in a game the Saints would win 23 to 3.\n            (7) In January, 2011 Steve was diagnosed with amyotrophic \n        lateral sclerosis or ALS, considered a terminal neuro-muscular \n        disease.\n            (8) Following his diagnosis, Steve, with the loving support \n        of his wife, Michel, began a mission to show that patients can \n        not only live but thrive after a diagnosis of ALS and \n        established The Gleason Initiative Foundation also known simply \n        as ``Team Gleason''.\n            (9) At the time of his diagnosis, however, Steve said there \n        will be ``No White Flags'', which has become the mantra of Team \n        Gleason.\n            (10) The Gleason Initiative Foundation helps provide \n        individuals with neuromuscular diseases or injuries with \n        leading edge technology, equipment and services, raises global \n        awareness about ALS to find solutions and an end to the \n        disease, and has helped hundreds of people with ALS experience \n        life adventures they never thought possible after their \n        diagnosis.\n            (11) Steve's story and mission have been told by the NFL \n        Network, ESPN, HBO, ABC, CBS, CNN, and many local media \n        outlets, as well as in a 2016 documentary titled ``Gleason'', \n        which was heralded at the Sundance Film Festival and premiered \n        across the country with Variety calling the production ``an \n        emotional powerhouse''. The documentary won several awards, \n        including the 2016 Washington, D.C. Area Film Critics \n        Association Award for Best Documentary.\n            (12) Steve was named 1 of 2 Sports Illustrated's \n        Inspirations of the Year in 2014, has been a keynote speaker \n        for Microsoft and at 2 United Nations sponsored Social \n        Innovation Summits, and received the 2015 George S. Halas \n        Courage Award, given to a NFL player, coach or staff member who \n        overcomes the most adversity to succeed.\n            (13) Steve helped advocate for the Steve Gleason Act of \n        2015 (Public Law 114-40; 129 Stat. 441), and the Steve Gleason \n        Enduring Voices Act of 2017, H.R. 2465, 115th Congress (2017), \n        which permanently ensures people living with diseases such as \n        ALS have access to speech generating devices regardless of \n        their setting, whether at home or a healthcare institution.\n            (14) In 2014, Steve and Team Gleason hosted a global summit \n        to bring together researchers, patients, caregivers, and all \n        ALS stakeholders to create a plan to ultimately end ALS. That \n        summit resulted in the single largest coordinated and \n        collaborative ALS research project in the world, Answer ALS, \n        which brings together nearly two dozen research institutions, \n        1,000 patients and 20,000,000,000,000 data points that are \n        important to the project and that will define the unknown \n        pathways that will lead to treatments or finally a cure.\n            (15) In 2015, Steve and Microsoft worked together to create \n        a method for people who are completely paralyzed to navigate \n        their power wheelchairs with their eyes. Today, Steve, \n        Microsoft and all wheelchair manufacturers are working \n        collaboratively to make it widely available to all who need \n        this technology. Microsoft has also made eye tracking \n        technology part of all Windows 10 products across the globe.\n            (16) In 2011, 10 months after his diagnosis, Steve and \n        Michel made their most significant accomplishment, becoming \n        parents to their son Rivers.\n            (17) In addition to serving as advocates for all who are \n        suffering from other debilitating neurological diseases, Steve \n        and Michel Gleason continue to fight to find a solution for ALS \n        so they can share many years together and as parents to Rivers.\n\nSEC. 3.
