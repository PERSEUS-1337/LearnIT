    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Transforming Energy Now Act of \n2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States is dangerously dependent on foreign \n        oil;\n            (2) as of April 2006, the United States imported nearly 60 \n        percent of the oil used in the United States, and that \n        percentage is expected to increase to almost 70 percent by 2025 \n        unless the United States takes decisive action;\n            (3) approximately 2,500,000 barrels of oil per day are \n        imported from countries in the Persian Gulf region;\n            (4) oil imports comprise nearly 30 percent of the \n        dangerously high trade deficit of the United States;\n            (5) it is feasible to dramatically reduce the dependence of \n        the United States on foreign oil by increasing production and \n        commercialization of alternative liquid fuels;\n            (6) as of April 2006, only 4 percent of the total gasoline \n        sold was derived from renewable fuel, including 4,000,000,000 \n        gallons of ethanol production;\n            (7) at the current rate of renewable fuel production \n        growth, the United States will increase its production of \n        ethanol by approximately 1,000,000,000 gallons a year, \n        resulting in the annual production of 14,000,000,000 gallons of \n        ethanol in the United States by 2016;\n            (8) at the current increase of renewable fuel production \n        capacity, the United States will produce 10,000,000,000 gallons \n        of ethanol by 2012, easily surpassing the current renewable \n        fuels mandate required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005;\n            (9) an aggressive schedule of renewable fuels production \n        will lessen the United States dependence on foreign oil;\n            (10) 10 percent of the Nation's motor vehicle fuel supply \n        should be renewable by 2016; and\n            (11) setting a goal of 19,000,000,000 gallons of ethanol by \n        2016 would require an aggressive increase in renewable fuels \n        production without requiring significant ethanol imports.\n\nSEC. 3. ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL FUEL REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 211(o)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 \nU.S.C. 7545 (o)(2)(B)) is amended to read as follows:\n                    ``(B) Minimum percentage.--Motor vehicle fuel sold \n                or introduced into commerce in the United States \n                (except in noncontiguous States or territories) after \n                December 31, 2015, shall contain, in the aggregate, not \n                less than 10 percent renewable fuel, by volume.''.\n    (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations \nto carry out the amendment made by subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4. INCREASE IN ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLE REFUELING PROPERTY CREDIT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 30C(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 is amended by striking ``30 percent'' and inserting ``50 \npercent''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply to property placed in service after December 31, 2005, in taxable \nyears ending after such date.\n\nSEC. 5.
