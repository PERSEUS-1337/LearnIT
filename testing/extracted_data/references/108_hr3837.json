donated patent.\n                    (C) The valuation of property described in section \n                170(e)(7) of such Code shall take into account the \n                potential use of such property by any qualified donee, \n                including the value to be generated through further \n                technology development and commercialization by the \n                donee and

prescribe such regulations \nor other guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent the \navoidance of the purposes of paragraphs (1)(B)(iii) and (7) of section \n170(e) of such Code (as added by this section), including preventing--\n            (1) the circumvention of the reduction of the deduction \n        under such section by embedding or bundling the patent or \n        similar property as part of a charitable contribution of \n        property that includes the patent or similar property,\n            (2) the manipulation of the basis of the property to \n        increase the amount of the charitable deduction through the use \n        of related persons, pass-thru entities, or other \n        intermediaries, or through the use of any provision of law or \n        regulation (including the consolidated return regulations), and\n            (3) a donor from changing the form of the patent or similar \n        property to property of a form for which different deduction \n        rules would apply.\n    (e) Effective Date.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided by paragraph (2), the \n        amendments made by this section shall apply to contributions \n        made after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n            (2) Appraisals.--Subsection (c) shall apply to \n        contributions made after the date of adoption of regulations, \n        or date of issuance of guidance, required by subsection (c), \n        whichever is earlier."
