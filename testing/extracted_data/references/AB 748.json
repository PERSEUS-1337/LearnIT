In the event that a claim for the homeowners\u2019 exemption, veterans\u2019 exemption, or disabled veterans\u2019 exemption is not in effect, a claim for any of those exemptions for a single supplemental assessment for a change in ownership or new construction occurring on or after June 1, up to and including December 31, shall apply to that assessment; a claim for any of those exemptions for the two supplemental assessments for a change in ownership or new construction occurring on or after January 1, up to and including May 31, one for the current fiscal year and one for the following fiscal year, shall apply to those assessments. In either case, if granted, the claim shall remain in effect until title to the property changes, the owner does not occupy the home as his or her principal place of residence on the lien date, or the property is otherwise ineligible pursuant to Section 205, 205.5, or 218.\n(e) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), an additional exemption claim may not be required to be filed until the next succeeding lien date in the case in which a supplemental assessment results from the completion of new construction on property that has previously been granted exemption on either the current roll or the roll being prepared.\n(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), an additional exemption claim is not required to be filed in the instance where a supplemental assessment results from a change in ownership of property where the purchaser of the property owns and uses or uses, as the case may be, other property that has been granted the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization,\npublic school,\nfree public libraries, free museums, or welfare exemption on either the current roll or the roll being prepared and the property purchased is put to the same use.\n(2)

(c).\nSECTION 1.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 271 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:\n271.\n(a) Provided that an appropriate application for exemption is filed within 90 days from the first day of the month following the month in which the property was acquired or by February 15 of the following calendar year, whichever occurs first, any tax or penalty or interest imposed upon:\n(1) Property owned by any organization qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization, tribal housing, public school, or welfare exemption that is acquired by that organization during a given calendar year, after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year, when the property is of a kind that would have been qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization, tribal housing, public school, or welfare exemption if it had been owned by the organization on the lien date, shall be canceled or refunded.\n(2) Property owned by any organization that would have qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization, tribal housing, public school, or welfare exemption had the organization been in existence on the lien date, that was acquired by it during that calendar year after the lien date in that year but before the commencement of that fiscal year, and of a kind that presently qualifies for the exemption and that would have so qualified for that fiscal year had it been owned by the organization on the lien date and had the organization been in existence on the lien date, shall be canceled or refunded.\n(3) Property acquired after the beginning of any fiscal year by an organization qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization, tribal housing, public school, or welfare exemption and the property is of a kind that would have qualified for an exemption if it had been owned by the organization on the lien date, whether or not that organization was in existence on the lien date, shall be canceled or refunded in the proportion that the number of days for which the property was so qualified during the fiscal year bears to 365.\n(b) Eighty-five percent of any tax or penalty or interest thereon imposed upon property that would be entitled to relief under subdivision (a) or Section 214.01, except that an appropriate application for exemption was not filed within the time required by the applicable provision, shall be canceled or refunded provided that an appropriate application for exemption is filed after the last day on which relief could be granted under subdivision (a) or Section 214.01.\n(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), any tax or penalty or interest thereon exceeding two hundred fifty dollars ($250) in total amount shall be canceled or refunded provided it is imposed upon property entitled to relief under subdivision (b) for which an appropriate claim for exemption has been filed.\n(d) With respect to property acquired after the beginning of the fiscal year for which relief is sought, subdivisions (b) and (c) shall apply only to that pro rata portion of any tax or penalty or interest thereon that would have been canceled or refunded had the property qualified for relief under paragraph (3) of subdivision (a).\nSEC. 2.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 271.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:\n271.5.\n(a) In the event that property receiving the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans\u2019 organization, tribal housing, public school, or welfare exemption is sold or otherwise transferred, the exemption shall cease to apply on the date of that sale or transfer. A new exemption shall be available subject to the provisions of Section 271.\n(b) Termination of the exemption under this section shall result in an escape assessment of the property pursuant to Section 531.1.\nSEC. 3.\nSEC. 4.\nIf the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code."
