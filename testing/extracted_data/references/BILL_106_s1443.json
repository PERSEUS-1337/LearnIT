FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) elementary and secondary school children are being \n        subjected to unprecedented social stresses, including \n        fragmentation of the family, drug and alcohol abuse, violence, \n        child abuse, and poverty;\n            (2) an increasing number of elementary and secondary school \n        children are exhibiting symptoms of distress, such as substance \n        abuse, emotional disorders, violent outbursts, disruptive \n        behavior, juvenile delinquency, and suicide;\n            (3) between 1984 and 1994, the homicide rate for \n        adolescents doubled, while the rate of nonfatal violent crimes \n        committed by adolescents increased by almost 20 percent;\n            (4) according to the National Institute of Mental Health, \n        up to one in five children and youth have psychological \n        problems severe enough to require some form of professional \n        help, yet only 20 percent of youth with mental disorders or \n        their families receive help;\n            (5) the Institute of Medicine has identified psychological \n        counseling as the most serious school health need for the \n        normal development of our Nation's children and youth;\n            (6) school counselors, school psychologists, and school \n        social workers can contribute to the personal growth, \n        educational development, and emotional well-being of elementary \n        and secondary school children by providing professional \n        counseling, intervention, and referral services;\n            (7) the implementation of well designed school counseling \n        programs has been shown to increase students' academic success;\n            (8) the national average student-to-counselor ratio in \n        elementary and secondary schools is 531 to 1, and the average \n        student-to-psychologist ratio is 2300 to 1;\n            (9) it is recommended that to effectively address students' \n        mental health and development needs, schools have 1 full-time \n        counselor for every 250 students, 1 psychologist for every \n        1,000 students, and 1 school social worker for every 800 \n        students;\n            (10) the population of elementary and secondary school \n        students in the United States is expected to increase \n        dramatically during the 5 to 10 years beginning with 1999;\n            (11) the Federal Government can help reduce the risk of \n        academic, social, and emotional problems among elementary and \n        secondary school children by stimulating the development of \n        model school counseling programs; and\n            (12) the Federal Government can help reduce the risk of \n        future unemployment and assist the school-to-work transition by \n        stimulating the development of model school counseling programs \n        that include comprehensive career development.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to enhance the \navailability and quality of counseling services for elementary and \nsecondary school children by providing grants to local educational \nagencies to enable such agencies to establish or expand effective and \ninnovative counseling programs that can serve as national models.\n\nSEC. 3.
