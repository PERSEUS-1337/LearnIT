FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Arbitration Act (now enacted as chapter 1 \n        of title 9 of the United States Code) was intended to apply to \n        disputes between commercial entities of generally similar \n        sophistication and bargaining power.\n            (2) A series of United States Supreme Court decisions have \n        changed the meaning of the Act so that it now extends to \n        disputes between parties of greatly disparate economic power, \n        such as consumer disputes and employment disputes. As a result, \n        a large and rapidly growing number of corporations are \n        requiring millions of consumers and employees to give up their \n        right to have disputes resolved by a judge or jury, and instead \n        submit their claims to binding arbitration.\n            (3) Most consumers and employees have little or no \n        meaningful option whether to submit their claims to \n        arbitration. Few people realize, or understand the importance \n        of the deliberately fine print that strips them of rights; and \n        because entire industries are adopting these clauses, people \n        increasingly have no choice but to accept them. They must often \n        give up their rights as a condition of having a job, getting \n        necessary medical care, buying a car, opening a bank account, \n        getting a credit card, and the like. Often times, they are not \n        even aware that they have given up their rights.\n            (4) Private arbitration companies are sometimes under great \n        pressure to devise systems that favor the corporate repeat \n        players who decide whether those companies will receive their \n        lucrative business.\n            (5) Mandatory arbitration undermines the development of \n        public law for civil rights and consumer rights, because there \n        is no meaningful judicial review of arbitrators' decisions. \n        With the knowledge that their rulings will not be seriously \n        examined by a court applying current law, arbitrators enjoy \n        near complete freedom to ignore the law and even their own \n        rules.\n            (6) Mandatory arbitration is a poor system for protecting \n        civil rights and consumer rights because it is not transparent. \n        While the American civil justice system features publicly \n        accountable decision makers who generally issue written \n        decisions that are widely available to the public, arbitration \n        offers none of these features.\n            (7) Many corporations add to their arbitration clauses \n        unfair provisions that deliberately tilt the systems against \n        individuals, including provisions that strip individuals of \n        substantive statutory rights, ban class actions, and force \n        people to arbitrate their claims hundreds of miles from their \n        homes. While some courts have been protective of individuals, \n        too many courts have upheld even egregiously unfair mandatory \n        arbitration clauses in deference to a supposed Federal policy \n        favoring arbitration over the constitutional rights of \n        individuals.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Section 1 of title 9, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by amending the heading to read as follows:\n``Sec. 1.
