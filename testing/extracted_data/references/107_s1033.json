FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Great Lakes contain \\1/5\\ of the world's fresh \n        water supply;\n            (2) the Great Lakes basin is home to over 33,000,000 people \n        and is a vital source of safe drinking water for millions of \n        people;\n            (3) the Great Lakes support many wetlands, sand dunes, and \n        other fragile coastal habitats;\n            (4) those coastal habitats are home to many endangered and \n        threatened wildlife and plant species, including the piping \n        plover, Pitcher's thistle, and the dwarf lake iris;\n            (5) the Great Lakes are crucial to the economies of the \n        Great Lakes States for recreation, commercial shipping, and \n        industrial and agriculture uses; and\n            (6) oil and gas development beneath the water in any of the \n        Great Lakes could--\n                    (A) expose a valuable fresh water supply of the \n                United States to serious contamination; and\n                    (B) cause serious environmental damage to the water \n                and shoreline of the Great Lakes.\n\nSEC. 3.
