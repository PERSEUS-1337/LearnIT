SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the ability of the United States to attract foreign \n        direct investment is directly linked to the long-term economic \n        prosperity, global competitiveness, and security of the United \n        States;\n            (2) in order to remain the most attractive location for \n        foreign direct investment, Congress should be mindful of the \n        potential impact upon the ability of the United States to \n        attract foreign direct investment when evaluating proposed \n        legislation;\n            (3) it is a top national priority to enhance the \n        competitiveness, prosperity, and security of the United States \n        by--\n                    (A) removing unnecessary barriers to foreign direct \n                investment and the jobs that it creates throughout the \n                United States; and\n                    (B) promoting policies to ensure the United States \n                remains the premier global destination in which to \n                invest, hire, innovate, and manufacture their products;\n            (4) maintaining the United States commitment to open \n        investment policy encourages other countries to do the same and \n        enables the United States to open new markets abroad for United \n        States companies and their products; and\n            (5) while foreign direct investment can enhance the \n        economic strength of the United States, policies regarding \n        foreign direct investment should reflect national security \n        interests and should not disadvantage domestic investors or \n        companies.\n\nSEC. 4.
