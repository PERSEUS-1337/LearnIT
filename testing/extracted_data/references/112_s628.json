    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Railroad Right of Way \nExtension Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Freight trains provide an efficient, reliable, all-\n        weather transportation system that produce less greenhouse gas \n        emissions and are 70 percent more fuel efficient than trucks \n        for large loads. The American Association of Railroads reports \n        that a freight train can carry 457 ton-miles per gallon of \n        diesel fuel and are substantially more fuel efficient than \n        other forms of surface transportation.\n            (2) The Alaska Railroad Act (38 Stat. 305), which was \n        signed into law on March 12, 1914, authorized the construction \n        of a 1,000-mile rail line in the Territory of Alaska ``to best \n        aid in the development of the agricultural and mineral or other \n        resources of Alaska . . . and so as to provide transportation \n        of coal for the Army and Navy, transportation of troops, arms, \n        munitions of war, the mails, and for other governmental and \n        public purposes''.\n            (3) The Alaska Railroad, which was constructed between 1915 \n        and 1923, consists of only 467 miles of main line tracks. An \n        additional 533 miles of tracks could be constructed under the \n        original authorization.\n            (4) An 80-mile rail extension between North Pole and Delta \n        Junction--\n                    (A) would greatly benefit the Department of \n                Defense, which has large training areas south of the \n                Tanana River between Fairbanks and Delta Junction;\n                    (B) would provide access to the Joint Pacific Area \n                Range Complex, which is currently limited to ice roads \n                during winter;\n                    (C) would enable the United States Army to mobilize \n                military units to a staging area immediately south of \n                the Tanana River;\n                    (D) would enable the United States Air Force to \n                move large freight to the Fort Greely missile intercept \n                complete located near Delta Junction; and\n                    (E) would facilitate the economical movement of \n                commercial freight and passenger transportation, \n                including tourism.\n\nSEC. 3.
