ASSISTANCE FOR TESTING OF PRIVATE WELLS.\n\n    Part E of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 1459. ASSISTANCE FOR TESTING OF PRIVATE WELLS.\n\n    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            ``(1) more than 15,100,000 households in the United States \n        are served by private drinking water wells;\n            ``(2) while private well owners generally are responsible \n        for regular testing of drinking water wells for the presence of \n        contaminants, cases of serious or potentially widespread \n        groundwater contamination often require State health and \n        environmental agencies to conduct costly tests on numerous \n        drinking water well sites;\n            ``(3) many of those sites are included in the Comprehensive \n        Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information \n        System of the Environmental Protection Agency, through which \n        Federal funding is available for testing of private wells \n        during initial site assessments but not for subsequent regular \n        sampling to ensure that contaminants have not migrated to other \n        wells;\n            ``(4) many State governments do not have the resources to \n        provide regular, reliable testing of drinking water wells that \n        are located in proximity to areas of suspected groundwater \n        contamination;\n            ``(5) State fiscal conditions, already in decline before \n        the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are rapidly \n        approaching a state of crisis;\n            ``(6) according to the National Conference of State \n        Legislatures--\n                    ``(A) revenues in 43 States are below estimates; \n                and\n                    ``(B) 36 States have already planned or implemented \n                cuts in public services;\n            ``(7) as a result of those economic conditions, most States \n        do not have drinking water well testing programs in place, and \n        many State well testing programs have been discontinued, \n        placing households served by private drinking water wells at \n        increased risk; and\n            ``(8) the provision of Federal assistance, with a State \n        cost-sharing requirement, would establish an incentive for \n        States to provide regular testing of drinking water wells in \n        proximity to new and existing areas of suspected groundwater \n        contamination.\n    ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Administrator.--The term `Administrator' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, acting in \n        consultation with appropriate State agencies.\n            ``(2) Area of concern.--The term `area of concern' means a \n        geographic area in a State the groundwater of which may, as \n        determined by the State--\n                    ``(A) be contaminated or threatened by a release of \n                1 or more substances of concern;
