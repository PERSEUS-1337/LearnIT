    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) requires California to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020.\n(b) In January 2015, Governor Brown issued an executive order declaring a statewide goal of reducing petroleum use by 50 percent by 2030 in order to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.\n(c) To address the long-term goals of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases in California, the Legislature enacted the California Alternative and Renewable Fuel, Vehicle Technology, Clean Air and Carbon Reduction Act of 2007 (Chapter 8.9 (commencing with Section 44270) of Part 5 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code) that established the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program to provide up to $100 million in grants each year to help California establish and expand alternative and renewable fuel production and infrastructure.\n(d) As policies that reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and petroleum use go into effect, the job market will inevitably change, resulting in a greater emphasis on green jobs.\n(e) To ensure that the skills and technical training in existing industries are integrated into the new green economy, it is incumbent on the state to foster earn-and-learn pathways and additional training opportunities to transition workers from the carbon-based economy to jobs focused on alternative and renewable fuels to match growing demand.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 44272 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n44272.\n(a) The Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program is hereby created. The program shall be administered by the commission. The commission shall implement the program by regulation pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

The emphasis of this program shall be to develop and deploy technology and alternative and renewable fuels in the marketplace, without adopting any one preferred fuel or technology.\n(b) A project that receives more than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) in funds from the commission shall be approved at a noticed public meeting of the commission and shall be consistent with the priorities established by the investment plan adopted pursuant to Section 44272.5. Under this article, the commission may delegate to the commission\u2019s executive director, or his or her designee, the authority to approve either of the following:\n(1) A contract, grant, loan, or other agreement or award that receives seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) or less in funds from the commission.\n(2) Amendments to a contract, grant, loan, or other agreement or award as long as the amendments do not increase the amount of the award, change the scope of the project, or modify the purpose of the agreement.\n(c) The commission shall provide preferences to those projects that maximize the goals of the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program, based on the following criteria, as applicable:\n(1) The project\u2019s ability to provide a measurable transition from the nearly exclusive use of petroleum fuels to a diverse portfolio of viable alternative fuels that meet petroleum reduction and alternative fuel use goals.\n(2) The project\u2019s consistency with existing and future state climate change policy and low-carbon fuel standards.\n(3) The project\u2019s ability to reduce criteria air pollutants and air toxics and reduce or avoid multimedia environmental impacts.\n(4) The project\u2019s ability to decrease, on a life-cycle basis, the discharge of water pollutants or any other substances known to damage human health or the environment, in comparison to the production and use of California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline or diesel fuel produced and sold pursuant to California diesel fuel regulations set forth in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2280) of Chapter 5 of Division 3 of Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations.\n(5) The project does not adversely impact the sustainability of the state\u2019s natural resources, especially state and federal lands.\n(6) The project provides nonstate matching funds. Costs incurred from the date a proposed award is noticed may be counted as nonstate matching funds. The commission may adopt further requirements for the purposes of this paragraph. The commission is not liable for costs incurred pursuant to this paragraph if the commission does not give final approval for the project or the proposed recipient does not meet requirements adopted by the commission pursuant to this paragraph.\n(7) The project provides economic benefits for California by promoting California-based technology firms, jobs, and businesses.\n(8) The project uses existing or proposed fueling infrastructure to maximize the outcome of the project.\n(9) The project\u2019s ability to reduce on a life-cycle assessment greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10 percent, and higher percentages in the future, from current reformulated gasoline and diesel fuel standards established by the state board.\n(10) The project\u2019s use of alternative fuel blends of at least 20 percent, and higher blend ratios in the future, with a preference for projects with higher blends.\n(11) The project drives new technology advancement for vehicles, vessels, engines, and other equipment, and promotes the deployment of that technology in the marketplace.\n(12) The project\u2019s ability to transition workers to, or promote employment in, the alternative and renewable fuel and vehicle technology sector.\n(d) The commission shall rank applications for projects proposed for funding awards based on solicitation criteria developed in accordance with subdivision (c), and shall give additional preference to funding those projects with higher benefit-cost scores.\n(e) Only the following shall be eligible for funding:\n(1) Alternative and renewable fuel projects to develop and improve alternative and renewable low-carbon fuels, including electricity, ethanol, dimethyl ether, renewable diesel, natural gas, hydrogen, and biomethane, among others, and their feedstocks that have high potential for long-term or short-term commercialization, including projects that lead to sustainable feedstocks.\n(2) Demonstration and deployment projects that optimize alternative and renewable fuels for existing and developing engine technologies.\n(3) Projects to produce alternative and renewable low-carbon fuels in California.\n(4) Projects to decrease the overall impact of an alternative and renewable fuel\u2019s life-cycle carbon footprint and increase sustainability.\n(5) Alternative and renewable fuel infrastructure, fueling stations, and equipment.
