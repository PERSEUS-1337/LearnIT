SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) colorectal cancer screening tests (as defined in \n        section 1861(pp) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n        1395x(pp)) covered under the medicare program have been \n        severely underutilized, with the Comptroller General of the \n        United States reporting in 2000 that since coverage of such \n        tests was implemented, the percentage of beneficiaries under \n        the medicare program receiving either a screening or a \n        diagnostic colonoscopy has increased by only 1 percent;\n            (2) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should \n        encourage health care providers to use more effective screening \n        and diagnostic health care technologies in the area of \n        colorectal cancer screening;\n            (3) in recent years, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n        Services has subjected colorectal cancer screening tests to \n        some of the largest reimbursement reductions under the medicare \n        program;\n            (4) unlike other preventive screening tests covered under \n        the medicare program, health care providers must consult with \n        beneficiaries prior to furnishing a screening colonoscopy in \n        order to--\n                    (A) ascertain the medical and family history of the \n                beneficiary; and\n                    (B) inform the beneficiary of preparatory steps \n                that must be taken prior to the procedure; and\n            (5) reimbursement under the medicare program is not \n        currently available for the consultations described in \n        paragraph (4) despite the fact that reimbursement is provided \n        under such program for similar consultations prior to a \n        diagnostic colonoscopy.\n\nSEC. 3.
