FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (commonly known \n        as ``NATO'') remains a critical alliance for the United States \n        and a cost-effective, flexible means of providing security to \n        the most important allies of the United States.\n            (2) The regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin is \n        actively working to erode democratic systems of NATO member \n        states, including the United States.\n            (3) According to the report of the Office of the Director \n        of National Intelligence dated January 6, 2017, on the Russian \n        Federation's hack of the United States presidential election: \n        ``Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election \n        represent the most recent expression of Moscow's longstanding \n        desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order.''.\n            (4) As recently as May 4, 2017, the press reported a \n        massive cyber hack of French President Emmanuel Macron's \n        campaign, likely attributable to Russian actors.\n            (5) It is in the core interests of the United States to \n        enhance the offensive and defensive cyber capabilities of NATO \n        member states to deter and defend against Russian cyber and \n        influence operations.\n            (6) Enhanced offensive cyber capabilities would enable the \n        United States to demonstrate strength and deter the Russian \n        Federation from threatening NATO, while reassuring allies, \n        without a provocative buildup of conventional military forces.\n\nSEC. 3.
