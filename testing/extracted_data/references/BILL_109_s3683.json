Soledad Veterans Memorial (referred to in this \n        Act as the ``Memorial'') has proudly stood overlooking San \n        Diego, California, for more than 52 years as a tribute to the \n        members of the United States Armed Forces who sacrificed their \n        lives in defense of the United States;\n            (2) the Memorial was dedicated on April 18, 1954, as ``a \n        lasting memorial to the dead of the First and Second World Wars \n        and the Korean conflict'' and now serves as a memorial to \n        American veterans of all wars, including the War on Terrorism;\n            (3) the United States has a long history and tradition of \n        memorializing members of the Armed Forces who die in battle \n        with a cross or other religious emblem of faith, and a memorial \n        cross is fully integrated as the centerpiece of the \n        multifaceted Memorial, which is replete with secular symbols;\n            (4) the patriotic and inspirational symbolism of the \n        Memorial provides solace to the families and comrades of the \n        veterans it memorializes;\n            (5) the Memorial has been recognized by Congress as a \n        National Veterans Memorial and is considered a historically \n        significant national memorial;\n            (6) 76 percent of the voters of the city of San Diego \n        supported donating the Memorial to the United States, only to \n        have a California superior court judge invalidate that \n        election;\n            (7) the city of San Diego has diligently pursued every \n        possible legal recourse to preserve the Memorial in its \n        entirety for persons who have served in the Armed Forces and \n        who will serve and sacrifice in the future; and\n            (8) Congressional action is necessary to preserve the \n        Memorial because the city of San Diego is under a district \n        court order to remove the Memorial from city property by August \n        1, 2006.\n\nSEC. 2.
