PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to enable America's schools to use \ntheir computer hardware to increase student achievement and prepare \nstudents for the 21st century workplace.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Establishing computer literacy programs for students \n        will help ensure that our children are receiving the skills \n        needed for advanced education and for securing employment in \n        the 21st century.\n            (2) Computer literacy skills, such as information \n        gathering, critical analysis and communication with the latest \n        technology, build upon the necessary basics of reading, \n        writing, mathematics, and other core subject areas.\n            (3) According to a study conducted by the Educational \n        Testing Service (ETS), eighth grade mathematics students whose \n        teachers used computers for simulations and applications \n        outperformed students whose teachers did not use such \n        educational technology.\n            (4) Although an ever increasing amount of schools are \n        obtaining the latest computer hardware, schools will not be \n        able to take advantage of the benefits of computer-based \n        learning unless teachers are effectively trained in the latest \n        educational software applications.\n            (5) The Educational Testing Service (ETS) study showed that \n        students whose teachers received training in computers \n        performed better than other students. The study also found that \n        schools that provide teachers with professional development in \n        computers enjoyed higher staff morale and lower absenteeism \n        rates.\n            (6) Some of the most exciting applications in educational \n        technology are being developed not only by commercial software \n        companies, but also by secondary school and college students. \n        The fruit of this academic talent should be channeled more \n        effectively to benefit our Nation's elementary and secondary \n        schools.\n\nSEC. 4.
