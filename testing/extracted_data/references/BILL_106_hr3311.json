FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Effective regulatory programs provide important \n        benefits to the public, including protecting the environment, \n        worker safety, and public health. Regulatory programs also \n        impose significant costs on individuals, businesses, and State, \n        local, and tribal governments.\n            (2) Improving the ability of Federal agencies to use \n        scientific and economic analysis in developing regulations \n        should yield more effective protections while minimizing costs.\n            (3) Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are useful \n        tools to better inform agencies in developing regulations, \n        though such analyses do not replace good judgment and values.\n            (4) The evaluation of costs and benefits should involve all \n        relevant information, expressed in comparable terms.\n            (5) Cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment should be \n        presented with a clear statement of the analytical assumptions \n        and uncertainties, including an explanation of what is known \n        and not known and what the implications of alternative \n        assumptions might be.\n            (6) The public has a right to know about the costs and \n        benefits of regulations, the risks addressed, the risks \n        reduced, and the quality of scientific and economic analysis \n        used to support decisions. Such knowledge will promote the \n        quality, integrity, responsiveness, and acceptability of agency \n        actions.\n            (7) The Administrator of the Office of Information and \n        Regulatory Affairs should oversee regulatory activities to \n        raise the quality and consistency of cost-benefit analysis and \n        risk assessment among all agencies.\n            (8) The Federal Government should develop a better \n        understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of cost-benefit \n        analysis and risk assessment and conduct the research needed to \n        improve these analytical tools.\n\nSEC. 3.
