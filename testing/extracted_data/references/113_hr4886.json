FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The National Forest System features a world-class trail \n        system with over 158,000 miles of trails that provide world-\n        class opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, hunting, \n        mountain bicycling, motorized vehicles, and other outdoor \n        activities.\n            (2) According to the Government Accountability Office, the \n        Forest Service is only able to maintain about one-quarter of \n        National Forest System trails to the agency standard, and the \n        agency faces a trail maintenance backlog of $314,000,000, and \n        an additional backlog of $210,000,000 in annual maintenance, \n        capital improvements, and operations.\n            (3) The lack of maintenance on National Forest System \n        trails threatens access to public lands, and may cause \n        increased environmental damage, threaten public safety, and \n        increase future maintenance costs.\n            (4) Federal budget limitations require solutions to \n        National Forest System trail maintenance issues that make more \n        efficient use of existing resources.\n            (5) Volunteers, partners, and outfitters and guides play an \n        important role in maintaining National Forest System trails, \n        and a comprehensive strategy is needed to ensure that \n        volunteers and partners are used as effectively as possible.\n\nSEC. 3.
