SHORT TITLE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Pay Act of \n2009''.\n    (b) Reference.--Except as provided in section 8, whenever in this \nAct an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or \nrepeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be \nconsidered to be made to a section or other provision of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Wage rate differentials exist between equivalent jobs \n        segregated by sex, race, and national origin in Government \n        employment and in industries engaged in commerce or in the \n        production of goods for commerce.\n            (2) The existence of such wage rate differentials--\n                    (A) depresses wages and living standards for \n                employees necessary for their health and efficiency;\n                    (B) prevents the maximum utilization of the \n                available labor resources;\n                    (C) tends to cause labor disputes, thereby \n                burdening, affecting, and obstructing commerce;\n                    (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n                commerce; and\n                    (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition.\n            (3) Discrimination in hiring and promotion has played a \n        role in maintaining a segregated work force.\n            (4) Many women and people of color work in occupations \n        dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national \n        origin.\n            (5)(A) United States Census Bureau data shows that in 2007, \n        women in the United States working full-time, year-round earned \n        roughly 78 cents for every dollar earned by a man working full-\n        time, year-round.\n            (B) A 2003 study by the General Accountability Office found \n        that even when accounting for key factors generally known to \n        influence earnings such as race, marital status, age and number \n        of children as well as hours worked and time out of the \n        workforce, a 20 percent gap in pay remains which cannot be \n        accounted for but may be partially explained by women make less \n        who work in traditionally female dominated careers as well as \n        other discrimination in the workplace.\n            (6) Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n        prohibits discrimination in compensation for ``equal work'' on \n        the basis of sex.\n            (7) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n        discrimination in compensation based upon sex, race, and \n        national origin continue to exist more than 4 decades after the \n        passage of section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n        1938, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and the Civil Rights Act of \n        1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.). Elimination of such barriers \n        would have positive effects, including--\n                    (A) providing a solution to problems in the economy \n                created by discrimination through wage rate \n                differentials;\n                    (B) substantially reducing the number of working \n                women and people of color earning low wages, thereby \n                reducing the dependence on public assistance; and\n                    (C) promoting stable families by enabling working \n                family members to earn a fair rate of pay.\n\nSEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) is amended by adding at \nthe end the following:\n    ``(h)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no employer \nhaving employees subject to any provision of this section shall \ndiscriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are \nemployed, between employees on the basis of sex, race, or national \norigin by paying wages to employees in such establishment in a job that \nis dominated by employees of a particular sex, race, or national origin \nat a rate less than the rate at which the employer pays wages to \nemployees in such establishment in another job that is dominated by \nemployees of the opposite sex or of a different race or national \norigin, respectively, for work on equivalent jobs.\n    ``(B) Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall prohibit the payment of \ndifferent wage rates to employees where such payment is made pursuant \nto--\n            ``(i) a seniority system;\n            ``(ii) a merit system;\n            ``(iii) a system that measures earnings by quantity or \n        quality of production; or\n            ``(iv) a differential based on a bona fide factor other \n        than sex, race, or national origin, such as education, \n        training, or experience, except that this clause shall apply \n        only if--\n                    ``(I) the employer demonstrates that--\n                            ``(aa) such factor--\n                                    ``(AA) is job-related with respect \n                                to the position in question; or\n                                    ``(BB) furthers a legitimate \n                                business purpose, except that this item \n                                shall not apply if the employee \n                                demonstrates that an alternative \n                                employment practice exists that would \n                                serve the same business purpose without \n                                producing such differential and that \n                                the employer has refused to adopt such \n                                alternative practice; and\n                            ``(bb) such factor was actually applied and \n                        used reasonably in light of the asserted \n                        justification; and\n                    ``(II) upon the employer succeeding under subclause \n                (I), the employee fails to demonstrate that the \n                differential produced by the reliance of the employer \n                on such factor is itself the result of discrimination \n                on the basis of sex, race, or national origin by the \n                employer.\n    ``(C) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall issue \nguidelines specifying criteria for determining whether a job is \ndominated by employees of a particular sex, race, or national origin \nfor purposes of subparagraph (B)(iv).
