FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The State of Israel remains under grave threat and \n        frequent attack from missiles, rockets, and mortar shells fired \n        at Israeli civilian targets by militants from Foreign Terrorist \n        Organizations such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad on \n        its southern border and by Hezbollah on its northern border, \n        which have killed, wounded, or inflicted psychological trauma \n        on countless Israelis. Additionally, Israel faces a potential \n        ballistic missile threat from Iran and Syria.\n            (2) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation \n        Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) established the policy of \n        the United States to support the inherent right of Israel to \n        self-defense.\n            (3) The United States remains committed to Israel's \n        qualitative military edge, including its advantage over non-\n        state actors such as Hezbollah and Hamas, which boast \n        increasingly sophisticated and powerful weapons as a result of \n        support from Iran, Syria, and other state actors.\n            (4) The United States can help to advance its own vital \n        national security interests and the cause of Middle Eastern \n        peace and stability by supporting Israel's ability to defend \n        itself against missiles, rockets, and other threats.\n            (5) United States-Israel missile defense cooperation dates \n        back over two decades with great success, such as the Arrow \n        Weapon System, which is already protecting Israel. These \n        systems are life-saving, war-preventing and the technologies of \n        the cooperative programs belong to both the United States and \n        Israel.\n            (6) United States industries are equal partners in the \n        development of the cooperative systems, which creates \n        employment opportunities in the United States and Israel. All \n        technical milestones to date have been met on time.\n            (7) The David's Sling Weapon System (DSWS), in joint \n        development by the United States and Israel, is being designed \n        to intercept short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles, \n        long-range rockets, and cruise missiles.\n            (8) The David's Sling Weapon System successfully \n        intercepted an inert medium-range rocket in November 2012, and \n        defense officials expect the program to be fully operational as \n        planned on time.\n            (9) The Arrow 3 Weapon System, in joint development by the \n        United States and Israel, is being designed to intercept long-\n        range missiles in high altitude in order to minimize leakage \n        from a nuclear or chemical warhead.\n            (10) The Arrow 3 Weapon System completed a successful fly-\n        out test in February 2013 and July 2013.\n            (11) The Arrow Weapon System, in joint development between \n        the United States and Israel, has been operational since 2000 \n        and targets medium-range ballistic missiles.\n            (12) The Israeli Defense Forces report that the Iron Dome \n        anti-rocket defense system has achieved a success rate of more \n        than 85 percent, intercepting rockets bound for residential \n        neighborhoods, busy road junctions, shopping centers, and \n        crowded streets across Israel.\n            (13) The success of the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense \n        system during Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012 \n        averted massive Israeli casualties, thereby decreasing Israel's \n        need to conduct a ground-based attack against Gaza-based \n        terrorists, enhancing Israel's operational flexibility, and \n        preventing terrorists from plunging the region into crisis \n        whenever they choose.\n            (14) Israel has indicated that it is ready to share the \n        technology of the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system with the \n        United States, which would strengthen United States defense \n        capabilities.\n            (15) The Government of Israel currently has five \n        operational Iron Dome batteries deployed in the field, which \n        are far from sufficient to protect all of Israel's territory.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL FOR THE IRON DOME ANTI-\n              ROCKET DEFENSE SYSTEM AND AUTHORIZATION FOR COOPERATION \n              ON THE DAVID'S SLING, ARROW, AND ARROW 3 ANTI-MISSILE \n              DEFENSE SYSTEMS.\n\n    The President, acting through the Secretary of Defense and the \nSecretary of State, is authorized to provide assistance, upon request \nof the Government of Israel, for the procurement of the Iron Dome anti-\nrocket defense system, as well as authorization for cooperation on the \ndevelopment, maintenance, enhancement, and sustainment of the David's \nSling, Arrow, and Arrow 3 anti-missile defense systems, for the \npurposes of intercepting short-range, medium-range, and long-range \nrockets, missiles, and projectiles launched against Israel."
