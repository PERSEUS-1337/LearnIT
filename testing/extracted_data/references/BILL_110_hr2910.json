FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There is no more important cause than the defense of \n        the United States.\n            (2) Since 2003, nearly 1,300,000 members of the Armed \n        Forces have served in Iraq or Afghanistan and over 420,000 \n        members of the Armed Forces in the National Guard and Reserve \n        have been called to active duty.\n            (3) The men and women of the Armed Forces put their lives \n        on hold, leave their families, jobs, and postsecondary \n        education in order to serve the United States, and do so with \n        distinction.\n            (4) In 2005, 500,000 veterans claimed education benefits \n        from the Department of Veterans Affairs and approximately \n        47,000 of those veterans are members of the National Guard or \n        Reserve and recently returned from serving in the Armed Forces \n        in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n            (5) Many members of the Armed Forces depend on various \n        forms of financial aid in addition to their Montgomery GI Bill \n        benefits to help fund their college education.\n            (6) The 6 percent interest rate cap on all debts of members \n        of the Armed Forces called to active duty guaranteed by the \n        Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. App. 501 et seq.) \n        has been interpreted narrowly by the Secretary of Education not \n        to apply to Federal student loans.\n            (7) Members of the Armed Forces who return from deployment \n        overseas in the Armed Forces and who are unable to continue \n        immediately a program of education that they were forced to \n        discontinue because of such deployment are being forced to \n        begin making payments on their private students loans only 1 \n        month after such return.\n            (8) The transition from service in the Armed Forces in a \n        combat theater to a classroom is a difficult challenge and \n        should not be rushed merely to avoid paying back student loans.\n            (9) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, colleges \n        are not required to make reasonable accommodations for students \n        who are called to active duty in the Armed Forces, such as \n        tuition reimbursement and relaxation of requirements for \n        reenrollment.\n            (10) Members of the Armed Forces who return from deployment \n        overseas and attempt to reenroll in a program of education are \n        overwhelmed with bureaucracy.\n            (11) Studies have shown that symptoms of post-traumatic \n        stress disorder (PTSD) and other non-apparent injuries may take \n        up to a year to manifest.\n            (12) Members of the Armed Forces deserve to have at least a \n        full academic year to reintegrate into society before they are \n        required to begin paying back student loans.\n            (13) Members of the Armed Forces who fight to protect the \n        United States deserve a Government that fights to protect them.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to assist members of the Armed Forces who return from a \n        deployment to transition from military service to civilian life \n        and to undertake programs of education they were forced to \n        discontinue because of such deployment;\n            (2) to provide a 13-month transition period for such \n        members to reenroll in such a program of education and to begin \n        paying back student loans undertaken for such program of \n        education;\n            (3) to institute a 6 percent interest rate cap on student \n        loans of a member of the Armed Forces while such member is \n        deployed on active duty; and\n            (4) to require providers of programs of education to \n        provide reasonable accommodations to their students who are \n        members of the Armed Forces and who discontinue a program of \n        education because of a deployment.\n\nSEC. 3.
