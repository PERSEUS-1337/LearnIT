FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) childhood obesity increased threefold among children \n        and adolescents in the 30 years preceding the date of enactment \n        of this Act;\n            (2) about 12,000,000 children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 \n        are considered obese;\n            (3) obesity-related diseases cost the United States economy \n        more than $147,000,000,000 every year;\n            (4) both low levels of physical activity and an increase in \n        caloric intake have contributed to the unprecedented epidemic \n        of childhood obesity;\n            (5) overweight adolescents have a 70 to 80 percent chance \n        of becoming overweight adults, increasing the risk for chronic \n        disease, disability, and death;\n            (6) children and adolescents are--\n                    (A) not meeting dietary recommendations;\n                    (B) underconsuming important food groups and \n                nutrients needed for growth and development; and\n                    (C) overconsuming saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, \n                and added sugars;\n            (7) nutrition education and promotion helps foster a school \n        environment that--\n                    (A) supports healthy eating;\n                    (B) helps initiate and sustain healthy eating \n                behaviors;\n                    (C) increases acceptance and consumption of healthy \n                school meals;\n                    (D) increases participation in school meal \n                programs;\n                    (E) enhances school meal quality; and\n                    (F) supports development and implementation of \n                local wellness policies;\n            (8) nutrition education and promotion is a critical \n        component of most major health promotion and disease prevention \n        programs;\n            (9) research shows that school-based nutrition programs and \n        services both improve health and contribute to the academic \n        achievement of school children;\n            (10) research shows that fit children achieve more \n        academically and have better school attendance and fewer \n        disciplinary problems;\n            (11) a comprehensive study of local wellness policies \n        across the United States found that--\n                    (A) many policies were underdeveloped and \n                fragmented; and\n                    (B) the vast majority of students were enrolled in \n                a school district that did not--\n                            (i) require evaluation of the \n                        implementation or effectiveness of the wellness \n                        policy of the district; or\n                            (ii) include any provisions for reviewing \n                        and revising the wellness policy;\n            (12) the same study reported that between 5 and 6 percent \n        of students were enrolled in a school district that had \n        identified a potential source of funding to support \n        implementation of the wellness policy of the district;\n            (13) the nutrition education and promotion initiatives for \n        school children in effect as of the date of enactment of this \n        Act lack coordination, funding, and sustainability;\n            (14) the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans of the \n        Department of Health and Human Services recommend that children \n        engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity on most, and \n        preferably all, days of the week;\n            (15) children spend many waking hours at school and \n        therefore need to be active during the school day to meet the \n        recommendations of the Physical Activity Guidelines for \n        Americans; and\n            (16) as of the date of enactment of this Act--\n                    (A) only 3.8 percent of elementary schools, 7.9 \n                percent of middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high \n                schools provide daily physical education or the \n                equivalent for the entire school year; and\n                    (B) 22 percent of schools do not require students \n                to take any physical education at all.\n\nSEC. 3.
