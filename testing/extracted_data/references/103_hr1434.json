STUDY.\n\n    The Board shall engage the Institute of Medicine of the National \nAcademy of Sciences to conduct a study of prescription drug research \nand development and pricing practices, the difficulties many Americans \nhave in affording prescription drugs, and options for making \nprescription drugs available to all that need them. Such study shall--\n            (1) examine Federal incentives for research and development \n        and determine which incentives are most effective and what \n        changes would better encourage the development of low cost, \n        effective drugs,\n            (2) examine the Federal regulatory process and identify \n        ways it might be streamlined without jeopardizing consumer \n        safety,\n            (3) consider whether the authority of the Food and Drug \n        Administration should be enhanced and whether the funding for \n        such agency should be increased to improve Federal regulation \n        of drugs,\n            (4) consider steps the United States might take (including \n        possible trade sanctions) to protect manufacturers of drugs in \n        the United States from product pirating and other unfair trade \n        practices by foreign competitors,\n            (5) consider changes in the patent laws (including delaying \n        the start of a product's 17 years patent protection until after \n        the product has been approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and \n        Cosmetic Act) to allow manufacturers to charge lower prices and \n        still recoup their research and development costs,\n            (6) consider whether a Board review of non-prescription \n        drug prices would have a positive effect on consumer costs of \n        such drugs,\n            (7) consider mechanisms to assist consumers with the high \n        cost of prescription drugs (including providing reimbursement \n        under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for prescription \n        drugs at lower prices negotiated with manufacturers of drugs),\n            (8) examine Federal policies regarding the licensing of \n        drugs discovered and developed by federally funded researchers \n        and recommend actions that would allow the United States to \n        recoup its costs or to influence the pricing of such drugs, and\n            (9) examine the effects on retail pharmacies of disparities \n        in drug prices wherein the drug manufacturers charge hospitals, \n        mail order pharmacies, and health maintenance organizations \n        significantly lower prices than those charged wholesalers for \n        such drugs."
