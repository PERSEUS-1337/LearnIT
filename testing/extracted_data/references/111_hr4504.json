FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internet has been a tremendous force for freedom \n        and economic development worldwide.\n            (2) In recent years, Internet freedom has been compromised \n        by repressive regimes that use this technology to control the \n        free flow of information and to limit nonviolent political \n        debate.\n            (3) One of the most egregious violations of Internet \n        freedom has been the enforcement of arbitrary and politically \n        motivated censorship of search engines by repressive regimes \n        that often force search providers to censor search results \n        domestically and globally as a condition of doing business.\n            (4) Access to United States Web sites by search engines \n        around the world provides billions of dollars of market value \n        to the owners of these search engines.\n            (5) Search engines under the control of repressive regimes \n        receive the economic benefit of accessing United States Web \n        sites and use this access to provide an incomplete and \n        distorted view of the United States and the world.\n            (6) Repressive control and censorship of the Internet will \n        continue to be a significant international issue that requires \n        decisive action from the United States and other free \n        countries.\n            (7) The long-term future of the Internet as an unfettered \n        source of nonviolent free speech will depend on the worldwide \n        adoption of minimum standards of non-censorship.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the President should promptly establish interim minimum \n        standards of non-censorship for Internet search providers and \n        create programs to restrict access to domestic online \n        information by search providers determined to be censoring \n        nonviolent political speech;\n            (2) any long-term solution to the problem of the censorship \n        of nonviolent political speech on the Internet must include \n        minimum standards of non-censorship set by a coalition of free \n        countries; and\n            (3) the President should begin negotiations with free \n        countries to adopt minimum standards for non-censorship of \n        nonviolent political speech as a condition for access to the \n        Internet.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION REGULATION AGAINST \n              CENSORSHIP.\n\n    (a) Regulations Against Censorship Authorized.--The Commission may \ncommence a proceeding to adopt regulations to restrict repressive \nInternet search providers from accessing domestic online information.\n    (b) Web Site.--If the Commission adopts regulations under \nsubsection (a), the Commission shall develop, operate, and maintain a \npublic Web site that lists such repressive Internet search providers \nand the reasons for finding that such Internet search providers were \nrepressive.\n    (c) Enforcement Authorized.--The Commission may enforce the \nregulations under subsection (a) using any existing enforcement \nauthority to prevent Internet search providers and any other person or \nentity from colluding to evade such regulations.\n\nSEC. 5. DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL MINIMUM STANDARDS OF NON-\n              CENSORSHIP FOR THE INTERNET.\n\n    (a) International Agreements.--The Secretary of State, in \nconsultation with the Commission, shall seek to enter into agreements \nwith appropriate representatives of free countries to adopt minimum \nstandards to prevent censorship of nonviolent political speech on the \nInternet as a condition for connection to the Internet.\n    (b) Restriction of the Internet.--Not earlier than 1 year after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the Commission may commence a proceeding \nto adopt regulations to restrict or prevent foreign countries and other \nentities that operate outside of any agreements made pursuant to \nsubsection (a) from accessing domestic online information.\n\nSEC. 6.
