FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a variety of effective and appropriate judicial \n        remedies are available for the full redress of legal and \n        constitutional violations under existing law, and the \n        imposition, increase, levying or assessment of taxes by courts \n        is neither necessary nor appropriate for the full and effective \n        exercise of remedies imposed pursuant to Federal courts \n        jurisdiction;\n            (2) the imposition, increase, levying, or assessment of \n        taxes by judicial order is not an appropriate exercise of the \n        judicial power under the Constitution, and is incompatible with \n        the traditional principles of American law and government and \n        the basic American principle that taxation without \n        representation is tyranny because Federal courts are unelected \n        officials, not answerable to the popular will;\n            (3) Federal courts exceed the proper boundaries of their \n        limited jurisdiction and authority under the Constitution, and \n        impermissibly intrude on the legislative function in a \n        democratic system of government, when they issue orders \n        requiring or resulting in the imposition, increase, levying, or \n        assessment of new taxes or existing taxes;\n            (4) no court should enter an order, not should there be any \n        settlement, remedying a legal or constitutional violation, by \n        imposing, creating, increasing, levying, or assessing any tax \n        for the enforcement thereof, nor can the court enter an order, \n        nor can there be any settlement, which has the effect of \n        imposing, creating, increasing, levying, or assessing any tax;\n            (5) settlement agreements or orders entered by Federal \n        courts should be fashioned within the framework of current \n        budgetary restraints of any State or political subdivisions \n        thereof;\n            (6) the Congress retains the authority under article III, \n        sections 1 and 2, or the Constitution to limit and regulate the \n        jurisdiction of the inferior Federal courts, and such authority \n        includes the power to limit the remedial authority of such \n        courts;\n            (7) nothing contained herein shall otherwise validate, \n        approve, legalize, or encourage the imposition of a tax, levy, \n        or assessment by a Federal judge;\n            (8) notwithstanding these findings, the Congress \n        acknowledges that in certain circumstances, the Federal courts \n        have abrogated constitutional authority with regard to \n        judicially mandating a tax, levy or assessment to ascertain a \n        remedy, but that should the Federal courts continue on in such \n        a manner, the following rules shall be met prior to entering \n        any order or settlement remedying a Federal or State common \n        law, statutory or constitutional violation by imposing, \n        creating, increasing, levying or assessing any tax for the \n        enforcement thereof; nor shall there by any settlement or order \n        which has the effect of imposing, creating, increasing, levying \n        or assessing any tax:\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON FEDERAL COURT REMEDIES.\n\n    Section 1343 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new \n        subsection:\n    ``(b)(1) Notwithstanding any other law, there shall be no \nsettlement nor shall the district courts order any State, or political \nsubdivision of a State, to impose, increase, levy, or assess any tax; \nnor shall there be any settlement or order which has the effect of \nimposing, creating, increasing, levying or assessing any tax, for the \npurpose of enforcing any Federal or State common law, statutory, or \nconstitutional right or law unless the court finds by clear and \nconvincing evidence, that--\n            ``(A) there are no other means available to remedy the \n        deprivation of rights or laws, and the proposed imposition, \n        increase, levying, or assessment is narrowly tailored to remedy \n        the specific deprivation at issue;\n            ``(B) the tax will not contribute to or exacerbate the \n        deprivation intended to be remedied;\n            ``(C) the proposed tax will not result in a loss of revenue \n        for the political subdivision in which it is assessed, levied, \n        or collected;\n            ``(D) the proposed tax will not result in the loss or \n        depreciation of property values of the taxpayer so affected;\n            ``(E) the proposed tax will not conflict with the \n        applicable laws with respect to the maximum rate of taxation as \n        determined by the appropriate political subdivisions, and will \n        not exceed the lower of either--\n                    ``(i) the proposed taxation rate; or\n                    ``(ii) the total of aggregate taxes that may be \n                imposed--including taxes of other State and local units \n                of governmental bodies and for the purposes of \n                implementing such order may not exceed the Cost of \n                Living as measured by Section 215(i) of the Social \n                Security Act, plus five percent per annum; and,\n            ``(F) plans submitted by State and local authorities will \n        not effectively redress the deprivations at issue.\n    ``(2) A finding under paragraph (1) shall be subject to immediate \ninterlocutory de novo review and shall be reviewed at least annually.\n    ``(3) Notwithstanding any law or rule of procedure, any aggrieved \nperson, corporation, or unincorporated association residing or present \nin the political subdivision in which a tax is imposed under this \nsubsection shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding \nconcerning the tax. Such interveners shall have the right to present \nevidence and appear before the court to present oral and written \ntestimony, and to appeal any finding required to be made by this \naction, or any other action taken to impose, increase, or levy, or \nassess taxes to remedy deprivations of Federal or State rights.\n    ``(4) These findings by a district court as aforesaid shall apply \nto those situations wherein parties enter into an agreement with or \nwithout court approval and notwithstanding the fact that litigation has \nnot commenced.\n    ``(c) Termination.--Notwithstanding any law or rule of procedure, \nany imposition, increase, levy, or assessment of a tax shall--\n            ``(1) automatically terminate or expire after 1 year, from \n        the date of the imposition or from the date of the enactment of \n        this statute upon which the court shall make the findings \n        required by subsection (b); and\n            ``(2) terminate at any time if the court determines that \n        the deprivation rights has been cured to the extent \n        practicable.\n    ``(d) State Pre-emption.--Notwithstanding any law or rule of \nprocedure, this statute does not pre-empt State or political \nsubdivision from imposing such and further restrictions on the use of \nState and local taxes, levies, or assessments for the purposes set \nforth herein.\n    ``(e) State and Local Governmental Rights.--Nothing contained \nherein shall allow a Federal court to use a tax of any kind of a State \nor political subdivision for the purpose of funding such order, except \nto the extent, if any, and to the proportion, if any, that such taxes, \nlevies, or assessments may already be used for the funding of the \nobject of the order as allowed by State or political subdivision law. \nFurthermore, the Federal court has no jurisdiction to force, mandate, \nor compel a taxing body of a State or political subdivision to change \nor modify its tax laws so as to enlarge them to pay for an order by the \nFederal court.\n    ``(f) Findings.--Finding required to be made by this section shall \nbe completed by the court prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for \nthe political subdivision against which a tax imposition, increase, \nlevying, or assessment is ordered, and shall be transmitted to such \npolitical subdivision.\n    ``(g) Rules of Construction.--There is a presumption that the \nimposition, increase, levying, or assessment of taxes is not a narrowly \ntailored means of remedying deprivations of Federal or State rights.''\n    In the event the Supreme Court finds that the use of a judicial \ntax, levy, or assessment by a Federal judge is illegal or \nunconstitutional, nothing contained herein shall be construed to \notherwise make legal, validate, or approve of a judicial tax, levy, or \nassessment."
