FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The transportation, storage, and disposal of high-level \n        radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel is a matter of \n        national urgency that is the responsibility of this generation.\n            (2) The utility generators and owners of high-level \n        radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, together with their \n        customers, have met, and will continue to meet, their \n        obligations under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to \n        provide for the cost of siting, licensing, construction, and \n        operation of a Federal waste management system.\n            (3) Some utilities have now exhausted their spent nuclear \n        fuel pool storage capacity, a total of 26 nuclear power \n        reactors will reach their spent nuclear fuel pool storage \n        capacity by the end of 1998, and approximately 80 nuclear power \n        reactors will be without spent nuclear fuel pool storage \n        capacity by 2010. As a result, utility rate payers face \n        significant costs associated with expanding storage capacity at \n        reactor sites, and continued delay is unacceptable.\n            (4) Federal efforts to site, license, construct, and \n        operate disposal facilities in accordance with the provisions \n        of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 have not met the \n        timetables contemplated by such Act.\n            (5) The Secretary of Energy has a clear and unconditional \n        obligation to take possession of and title to high-level \n        radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel beginning not later \n        than January 31, 1998.\n            (6) Notwithstanding the passage of 12 years since enactment \n        of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the payment of more \n        than $8,400,000,000 into the Nuclear Waste Fund during such \n        period, and the additional programmatic direction provided by \n        the Congress in the 1987 amendments to such Act, the projected \n        date of commencement of operations at a repository is, under \n        the most optimistic of assumptions, 2010.\n            (7) Until a repository is operational, interim storage will \n        continue to be required for high-level radioactive waste and \n        spent nuclear fuel.\n            (8) In light of the obligation of the Secretary of Energy \n        to accept high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel \n        beginning not later than January 31, 1998, the Secretary must \n        establish an interim storage facility for such waste and spent \n        fuel by such date.\n    (b) Statement of Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the \nfollowing:\n            (1) To specify with certainty the obligation of the Federal \n        Government to take possession of and title to high-level \n        radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and provide for its \n        timely and safe transportation, storage, and disposal.\n            (2) To provide the Secretary of Energy with additional \n        incentives and means for succeeding in the siting, licensing, \n        construction, and operation of Federal facilities for the \n        storage and disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent \n        nuclear fuel.\n            (3) To require the Secretary of Energy to establish an \n        interim storage facility for high-level radioactive waste and \n        spent nuclear fuel of domestic origin by January 31, 1998, for \n        the purpose of fulfilling the obligation of the Federal \n        Government under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL OBLIGATION TO TAKE POSSESSION OF AND TITLE TO HIGH-\n              LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE AND SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL.\n\n    Section 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. \n10222(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(7)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or \nother law, the terms of the contracts entered into pursuant to this \nsection, or the commencement of operations of a repository, the \nSecretary shall, by not later than January 31, 1998, begin taking \npossession and providing for the removal from existing storage \nfacilities of the high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel \ncovered by such contracts.\n    ``(ii) A means of fulfilling the obligation set forth in clause (i) \nshall be the Federal Integrated Spent Fuel and High-Level Waste \nManagement Program established in section 162.\n    ``(B) The Secretary shall take possession and provide for the \nremoval of the high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel \nreferred to in subparagraph (A) in accordance with the acceptance \npriority ranking as required by the contracts entered into pursuant to \nthis section.\n    ``(C) As any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel \nreferred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) comes into the possession of, \nand is removed by, the Secretary, title to such waste or spent fuel \nshall transfer to the Secretary.''.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL INTEGRATED SPENT FUEL AND HIGH-LEVEL WASTE MANAGEMENT \n              PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle E of title I of the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10172 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new section:\n\n``federal integrated spent fuel and high-level waste management program\n\n    ``Sec. 162. (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish and \nadminister in accordance with this section a Federal Integrated Spent \nFuel and High-Level Waste Management Program as a means of fulfilling, \nin a safe, efficient, and cost-effective manner, the responsibility of \nthe Federal Government to take possession and provide for the removal \nfrom existing storage facilities of, and take title to, high-level \nradioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel as provided in section \n302(a)(7), and to provide for the management of high-level radioactive \nwaste and spent nuclear fuel in accordance with subsection (b).\n    ``(b) Components of Program.--The Federal Integrated Spent Fuel and \nHigh-Level Waste Management Program shall include the following \ncomponents:\n            ``(1) Development and use of a multipurpose canister system \n        or systems for the transportation, storage, and disposal of \n        spent nuclear fuel.\n            ``(2) Development of the transportation infrastructure \n        required to carry out the storage and disposal of high-level \n        radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the \n        Program.\n            ``(3) Establishment of an interim storage facility for \n        high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, consistent \n        with applicable licensing and environmental protection \n        requirements, by not later than January 31, 1998.\n            ``(4) Disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent \n        nuclear fuel in a repository developed under this Act.\n    ``(c) Progress Reports.--The Secretary shall submit to the \nCongress, not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \nthis section and annually thereafter, a comprehensive progress report \nwith specific details of how the Secretary is implementing the Federal \nIntegrated Spent Fuel and High-Level Waste Management Program.
