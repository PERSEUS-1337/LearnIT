    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Women Discharged From the Military \nDue to Pregnancy Relief Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In June 1948, Congress enacted the Women's Armed \n        Services Integration Act of 1948, which formally authorized the \n        appointment and enlistment of women in the regular components \n        of the United States Armed Forces.\n            (2) With the expansion of the Armed Forces to include \n        women, the possibility arose for the first time that members of \n        the Armed Forces could become pregnant.\n            (3) The response to such possibilities and actualities was \n        Executive Order 10240, signed by President Harry S. Truman in \n        1951, which granted the Armed Forces the authority to \n        involuntarily discharge a woman if she became pregnant, gave \n        birth to a child, or became a parent by adoption or a \n        stepparent.\n            (4) The Armed Forces responded to the Executive Order by \n        systematically discharging any woman in the Armed Forces who \n        became pregnant, regardless of whether the pregnancy was \n        intentional, unintentional, or the result of sexual abuse.\n            (5) Although the Armed Forces were required to offer women \n        who were involuntarily discharged due to pregnancy the \n        opportunity to request retention in the military, many of the \n        women who were involuntarily discharged were not offered such \n        opportunity.\n            (6) The Armed Forces did not provide required separation \n        benefits, counseling, or assistance to the service women who \n        were discharged due to pregnancy.\n            (7) It is documented that as many as 7,000 service women \n        were involuntarily discharged from the Armed Forces as a result \n        of pregnancy.\n            (8) There are reports that the practice of the Armed Forces \n        to systematically discharge pregnant women from the service \n        caused some women to seek abortions (illegal at the time) or to \n        put their children up for adoption, and that, in some cases, \n        some women committed suicide as a result of their involuntary \n        discharge from the Armed Forces.\n            (9) Such involuntary discharge from the Armed Forces on the \n        basis of pregnancy was challenged in Federal district court by \n        Stephanie Crawford in 1975, whose legal argument stated that \n        the practice of this type of discharge violated her \n        constitutional right to due process of law.\n            (10) The United States Court of Appeals for the Second \n        Circuit ruled in Stephanie Crawford's favor in 1976 and found \n        that the Executive Order and any regulations within the Armed \n        Forces that made discharge from the military services mandatory \n        due to pregnancy were unconstitutional.\n            (11) By 1976, all regulations that permitted discharge of a \n        servicewoman from the Armed Forces because of pregnancy or any \n        form of parenthood had been rescinded.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPRESSION OF CONGRESSIONAL REMORSE FOR POLICY OF INVOLUNTARY \n              DISCHARGES DUE TO PREGNANCY.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the women \nwho served in the United States Armed Forces before February 23, 1976, \nand who were involuntarily discharged due to pregnancy should not have \nbeen involuntarily discharged due to the physical status of pregnancy.\n    (b) Expression of Remorse.--Congress hereby expresses deep remorse \nfor the women who patriotically served in the Armed Forces, but were \nforced, by official United States policy, to endure unnecessary and \ndiscriminatory actions, including the violation of their constitutional \nright to due process of law, simply because they became pregnant while \na member of the Armed Forces.\n\nSEC. 4.
