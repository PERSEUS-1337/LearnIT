FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 1.6 million members of the Armed Forces have \n        been deployed in Afghanistan or Iraq for Operation Enduring \n        Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n            (2) The 2008 RAND Corporation report entitled ``Invisible \n        Wounds of War'' stated that ``With the possibility of more than \n        300,000 new cases of mental health conditions among OEF/OIF \n        veterans, a commensurate increase in treatment capacity is \n        needed.''.\n            (3) Combat stress refers to the expected and predictable \n        emotional, intellectual, physical, or behavioral reactions of \n        members of the Armed Forces who have been exposed to stressful \n        events in war or other military operations, and combat stress \n        is often associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, \n        anxiety, depression, alcohol or drug abuse, and readjustment \n        difficulties.\n            (4) Approximately 18.5 percent of the members of the Armed \n        Forces who have served in Afghanistan or Iraq are believed to \n        be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, \n        and the rate of suicide among veterans suffering from post-\n        traumatic stress disorder is a serious problem.\n            (5) Approximately 19.5 percent of the members of the Armed \n        Forces who have served in Afghanistan or Iraq report that they \n        experienced a traumatic brain injury during their deployment.\n            (6) It is estimated that only half of the veterans who need \n        treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain \n        injury actually seek treatment, and, of the veterans who \n        receive treatment, only slightly more than half receive \n        minimally adequate or better care.\n            (7) The Department of Veterans Affairs must be prepared to \n        provide lifetime care for veterans who were severely wounded \n        physically or psychologically in combat operations in \n        Afghanistan and Iraq.\n            (8) The inadequate number of licensed mental health \n        professionals trained to treat combat stress may have a \n        negative long-term impact on the quality of mental health care \n        for veterans.\n            (9) There are many challenges surrounding the hiring and \n        retention of trained mental health providers by the Department \n        of Veterans Affairs.\n            (10) The Health Professionals Educational Assistance \n        Program under chapter 76 of title 38, United States Code, \n        contains a number of scholarship, tuition reimbursement, and \n        education debt reduction programs that need to be better \n        utilized by the Department of Veterans Affairs to relieve the \n        shortage in the number of licensed mental health professionals \n        employed by the Department who have received specialized \n        training in the treatment of combat stress.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO \n              INCREASE NUMBER OF LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS \n              EMPLOYED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TRAINED TO \n              TREAT COMBAT STRESS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 7603 of title 38, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(e)(1) The purpose of this subsection is to establish a means to \nincrease the number of licensed mental health professionals employed by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs who have the specialized training \nnecessary to treat combat stress by providing a selection priority \nunder the following components of the Educational Assistance Program:\n            ``(A) The scholarship program provided for in subchapter II \n        of this chapter.\n            ``(B) The tuition reimbursement program provided for in \n        subchapter III of this chapter.\n            ``(C) The Selected Reserve member stipend program provided \n        for under subchapter V of this chapter.\n            ``(D) The employee incentive scholarship program provided \n        for in subchapter VI of this chapter.\n            ``(E) The education debt reduction program provided for in \n        subchapter VII of this chapter.\n    ``(2) In addition to the priority given under subsection (d) in \nselecting applicants for acceptance in the Educational Assistance \nProgram under subchapter II, III, V, or VI of this chapter, the \nSecretary shall give priority to the application of an individual who--\n            ``(A) is otherwise eligible to receive assistance under the \n        applicable subchapter;
