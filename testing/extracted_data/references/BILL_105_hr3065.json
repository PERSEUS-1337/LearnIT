FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The development of new and innovative environmental \n        technologies, including technologies for monitoring \n        environmental compliance, has been identified as a priority by \n        the Environmental Protection Agency (referred to in this Act as \n        the ``Agency'').\n            (2) Current Agency environmental monitoring requirements \n        typically specify the use of a particular analytical method \n        that must be precisely followed, including the use of specific \n        procedures and instrumentation. These requirements inhibit \n        introduction of new environmental monitoring technologies that \n        could prove more accurate, reliable, and cost-effective because \n        of time consuming and labor-intensive procedures for revising \n        regulations.\n            (3) The Agency is evaluating the barriers to the \n        introduction of new and innovative environmental monitoring \n        technologies and has begun the transition of converting from \n        the current analytical methods approach to a performance-based \n        measurement system.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) facilitate the development, introduction, and use of \n        new and innovative environmental monitoring technologies \n        through the conversion of the Agency's analytical methods to a \n        performance-based measurement system; and\n            (2) establish a deadline for the Agency to implement a \n        performance-based measurement system to cover all media and \n        multimedia environmental monitoring.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Agency'' means the Environmental Protection \n        Agency.\n            (2) The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of \n        the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (3) The term ``environmental monitoring technologies'' \n        means procedures or techniques associated with the performance, \n        technical capability, or environmental impact of an analytical \n        method.\n            (4) The term ``performance-based measurement system'' means \n        a system that ensures environmental monitoring data quality \n        assurance objectives are met, without prescribing particular \n        procedures, techniques, or instrumentation for meeting such \n        objectives.\n\nSEC. 4. PERFORMANCE-BASED MEASUREMENT SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--(1) No later than 18 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Administrator shall establish and begin \nimplementing a performance-based measurement system that will \nfacilitate the use of new environmental monitoring technologies, \nparticularly monitoring required to demonstrate compliance with laws \nand regulations.\n    (2) Notwithstanding the implementation of a performance-based \nmeasurement system, analytical methods existing on the date of \nenactment of this Act shall be deemed acceptable to the Administrator \nuntil such time as the Administrator determines that such methods are \nno longer acceptable.\n    (b) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to permit \nthe Agency to devise or endorse a process that permits or requires the \nrating or evaluation of one technology or instrument over another. \nNothing in this Act shall be construed to require the approval of a \nparticular environmental technology or instrument.\n    (c) Status.--A performance-based measurement system implemented \npursuant to this section shall be deemed to be equivalent to Agency \nanalytical methods existing on the date of enactment of this Act for \npurposes of compliance with all applicable environmental statutes and \nregulations.\n\nSEC. 5. PERFORMANCE-BASED MEASUREMENT SYSTEM ADVISORY COMMITTEE.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Administrator shall establish a \nPerformance-Based Measurement System Advisory Committee no later than \n90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Purposes.--The Performance-Based Measurement System Advisory \nCommittee shall--\n            (1) assist the Administrator in developing a plan for \n        implementation of a performance-based measurement system;\n            (2) advise the Administrator regarding how Agency policies, \n        regulations, standards, and procedures can be used to implement \n        a performance-based measurement system; and\n            (3) assist the Administrator in developing the report \n        required by section 5 of this Act.\n    (c) Membership.--The Performance-Based Measurement System Advisory \nCommittee shall be comprised of 12 members selected for appointment to \nprovide a broad and balanced representation of interested parties, \nincluding the analytical instruments industry, environmental testing \nlaboratories, representatives from State regulatory agencies, public \ninterest groups, and professional or technical societies.\n    (d) Duration.--Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 \nU.S.C. App.) shall not apply with respect to the duration of the \nadvisory committee established under this section.\n    (e) Duties.--The Performance-Based Measurement System Advisory \nCommittee shall convene at least twice a year, and may meet at \nadditional times as required by the Administrator. The Performance-\nBased Measurement System Advisory Committee shall submit to the \nAdministrator such recommendations as it believes are consistent with \nits purposes. The Administrator shall make available to the \nPerformance-Based Measurement System Advisory Committee such staff as \nare necessary to carry out its purposes.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n    No later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the \nAdministrator shall submit to Congress a report containing a plan to \nestablish a performance-based measurement system approval process in \naccordance with section 4."
