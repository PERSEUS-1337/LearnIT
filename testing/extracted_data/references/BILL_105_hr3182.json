FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a variety of effective and appropriate judicial \n        remedies are available under existing law for the full redress \n        of legal and constitutional violations, and the imposition, \n        increase, levying, or assessment by the courts of taxes, or the \n        courts' requiring the implementation of additional spending, is \n        neither necessary nor appropriate for the full and effective \n        exercise of remedies imposed by Federal courts with appropriate \n        jurisdiction;\n            (2) the imposition, increase, levying, or assessment of \n        taxes by judicial order--\n                    (A) is not an appropriate exercise of the judicial \n                power under the Constitution; and\n                    (B) is incompatible with--\n                            (i) the traditional principles of the laws \n                        and Government of the United States; and\n                            (ii) the basic American principle that \n                        taxation without representation is tyranny \n                        (because Federal courts are not elected \n                        officials and therefore are not answerable to \n                        the popular will);\n            (3) when a Federal court issues an order that requires or \n        results in the imposition, increase, levying, or assessment of \n        any tax, or requires additional spending, the court--\n                    (A) exceeds the proper boundaries of the limited \n                jurisdiction and authority of Federal courts under the \n                Constitution; and\n                    (B) intrudes on the legislative and political \n                functions of a republican form of government, as \n                guaranteed to every State of the Union under section 4 \n                of article IV of the United States Constitution;\n            (4) no court should enter an order or approve any \n        settlement--\n                    (A) remedying a legal or constitutional violation, \n                by imposing, creating, increasing, levying, or \n                assessing any tax; or\n                    (B) that has the effect of imposing, creating, \n                increasing, levying, or assessing any tax;\n            (5) a settlement agreement or order entered by a Federal \n        court should be fashioned within the framework of the budgetary \n        restraints of any affected State or political subdivision \n        thereof;\n            (6) the Congress retains the authority under sections 1 and \n        2 of article III of the United States Constitution to limit and \n        regulate the jurisdiction of the inferior Federal courts, and \n        such authority includes the power to limit the remedial \n        authority of such courts;\n            (7) notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (6), the \n        Congress acknowledges that in certain circumstances the Federal \n        courts have abrogated constitutional authority with regard to \n        judicially mandating a tax, levy, assessment, or additional \n        spending measure in order to achieve a remedy, and--\n                    (A) any such tax, levy, or assessment shall not be \n                sustained; and\n                    (B) in the case of any such spending measure the \n                mandate must be overturned unless specific requirements \n                are met;\n            (8) remedial injunctions formulated by the Federal courts, \n        that require state or local government institutions to make \n        improvements in the services they provide (otherwise known as \n        ``structural injunctions''), in order to address a \n        constitutional violation breach the principles of the \n        separation of powers among the 3 branches of the Federal \n        Government by circumventing the democratic decisionmaking \n        process;\n            (9) the Constitution does not permit the Federal courts to \n        exercise their remedial powers to engage in the structural \n        reform of local institutions and local governments;\n            (10) for a court-ordered remedy to be effective, it \n        necessarily requires political and public support;\n            (11) if courts inject themselves into the political arena, \n        they risk undermining their impartiality;\n            (12) the Federal Government's duty to remedy a \n        constitutional violation does not permit the Federal judiciary \n        to exceed its authority;\n            (13) as taxing is an independent power granted to the \n        Congress by the Constitution, spending is not an independent \n        power, but a qualification of that taxing power; and\n            (14) appropriating public money in response to a judicial \n        order that provides a remedy to a constitutional violation is a \n        political function and should be determined by elected \n        officials.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATION ON FEDERAL COURT REMEDIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 1369.

Such notice shall be provided before the beginning of the \nnext fiscal year of that State or political subdivision occurring after \nthe order is issued or settlement approved.\n    ``(f) Presumption.--There shall be a presumption that a spending \nmeasure required by a Federal court is not a narrowly tailored means of \nremedying violations of Federal or State rights or laws.\n    ``(g) Technical Clarification.--For purposes of this section--\n            ``(1) the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a \n        State; and\n            ``(2) any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the \n        District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the \n        District of Columbia.\n    ``(h) Effect of Supreme Court Decision.--Should the Supreme Court \nfind that the imposition of a tax, levy, or assessment by, or a \nspending measure required by, a Federal judge is illegal or \nunconstitutional, nothing contained in this section shall be construed \nto otherwise make legal, validate, or approve of such a tax, levy, \nassessment, or spending measure.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents for chapter 85 of \ntitle 28, United States Code, is amended by adding after the item \nrelating to section 1368 the following new item:\n\n``1369.
