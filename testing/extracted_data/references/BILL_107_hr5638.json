RELOCATION OF ELIGIBLE FEDERAL ENTITIES FOR THE REALLOCATION OF \n              SPECTRUM FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\n\n    Subsection (g) of section 113 of the National Telecommunications \nand Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)) is \namended to read as follows:\n    ``(g) Relocation of Eligible Federal Entities for the Reallocation \nof Spectrum for Commercial Purposes.--\n            ``(1) Eligible federal entities.--Any Federal entity that \n        operates a Federal Government station assigned to a band of \n        frequencies specified in paragraph (2) and that incurs \n        relocation costs because of the reallocation of frequencies \n        from Federal use to non-Federal use is eligible for payment for \n        such costs from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, in accordance \n        with section 118 of this Act. For purposes of this paragraph, \n        Federal power agencies exempted under subsection (c)(4) that \n        choose to relocate from the frequencies identified for \n        reallocation pursuant to subsection (a), are eligible to \n        receive payment under this paragraph.\n            ``(2) Eligible frequencies.--The bands of eligible \n        frequencies for purposes of this section are as follows:\n                    ``(A) the 216-220 megahertz band, 1432-1435 \n                megahertz band, 1710-1755 megahertz band, and 2385-2390 \n                megahertz band of frequencies; and\n                    ``(B) any other band of frequencies reallocated \n                from Federal use to non-Federal use after January 1, \n                2002.\n            ``(3) Definition of relocation costs.--For purposes of this \n        subsection, the term `relocation costs' means the costs \n        incurred by a Federal entity to achieve comparable capability \n        of systems, regardless of whether that capability is achieved \n        by relocating to a new frequency assignment or by utilizing an \n        alternative technology. Such costs include--\n                    ``(A) the costs of any modification or replacement \n                of equipment, software, facilities, operating manuals, \n                training costs, or regulations that are attributable to \n                relocation;\n                    ``(B) the costs of all engineering, equipment, \n                software, site acquisition and construction costs, as \n                well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expense, \n                including outside consultants, and reasonable \n                additional costs incurred by the Federal entity that \n                are attributable to relocation, including increased \n                recurring costs associated with the replacement \n                facilities;\n                    ``(C) the costs of engineering studies, economic \n                analyses, or other expenses reasonably incurred in \n                calculating the estimated relocation costs that are \n                provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (4) of \n                this subsection;\n                    ``(D) the one-time costs of any modification of \n                equipment reasonably necessary to accommodate \n                commercial use of such frequencies prior to the \n                termination of the Federal entity's primary allocation \n                or protected status, when the eligible frequencies as \n                defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection are made \n                available for private sector uses by competitive \n                bidding and a Federal entity retains primary allocation \n                or protected status in those frequencies for a period \n                of time after the completion of the competitive bidding \n                process; and\n                    ``(E) the costs associated with the accelerated \n                replacement of systems and equipment if such \n                acceleration is necessary to ensure the timely \n                relocation of systems to a new frequency assignment.''.\n            ``(4) Notice to commission of estimated relocation costs.--\n                    ``(A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least \n                9 months prior to the commencement of any auction of \n                eligible frequencies defined in paragraph (2).
