FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Forest Service, managing national forests and \n        grasslands covering 192,000,000 acres, plays an integral role \n        in the protection, enhancement, and conservation of the natural \n        resources of the United States.\n            (2) The Forest Service has a long history of successful \n        cooperation with non-Federal entities in fulfilling all mission \n        areas and responsibilities of the Forest Service.\n            (3) Such cooperation is becoming increasingly more \n        important in the research and development mission area of the \n        Forest Service as the number of staff research scientists has \n        declined from 985 scientists in 1985 to only 486 scientists in \n        2005. To accomplish its research mission to meet current \n        forestry challenges and ensure that forest managers have the \n        latest science and technology to manage the National Forest \n        System sustainably over the long-term, it is critical that the \n        Forest Service cooperate with other research organizations, \n        including forestry schools, land-grant colleges and \n        universities, and 1890 institutions.\n            (4) By expanding and clarifying Forest Service authorities \n        to work with cooperators, the Forest Service can improve the \n        ability of the Forest Service to administer National Forest \n        System lands by increasing local community involvement in \n        collaborative restoration and building the capacity of rural \n        public land communities in fulfilling the Forest Service's \n        mission.\n            (5) The Forest Service can benefit from maximizing use of \n        existing authorities and establishing new authority to improve \n        local community involvement in, and support of, fulfilling the \n        Forest Service's mission.\n            (6) Encouraging conservation education will increase public \n        awareness of Forest Service programs and activities, will \n        heighten public understanding of the need to sustain natural \n        and cultural resources, and will promote public participation \n        in the conservation of these resources.\n            (7) Encouraging partnerships with public land communities \n        will expedite the implementation of priority restoration \n        projects on National Forest System lands.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to encourage agreements between the Forest Service and \n        cooperators to promote public awareness and participation in \n        the restoration and management of the resources and programs of \n        the Forest Service;\n            (2) to affirm Congress' support for agreements between the \n        Forest Service and cooperators that further the Forest \n        Service's mission by assisting the Forest Service in the \n        administration of all Forest Service programs;\n            (3) to clarify and create additional authority for the \n        Forest Service to work with cooperators; and\n            (4) to leverage Forest Service resources with the resources \n        of cooperators.\n\nSEC. 3.
