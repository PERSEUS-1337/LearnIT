FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has fallen behind other \n        industrialized countries in terms of competing in a global \n        economy. This deterioration is due in large part to the \n        diminishing number of well-trained people in the fields of \n        mathematics, science, and technology, as well as the decrease \n        in scientific innovations generated from the United States in \n        recent years.\n            (2) Not only did the United States produce fewer graduates \n        in mathematics, science, and engineering in 2002 than it did in \n        1985, but the United States is also generating far fewer \n        college graduates in those fields than other countries. In \n        China, 59 percent of undergraduates receive degrees in science \n        and engineering and in Japan, 66 percent receive such degrees, \n        but in the United States, only 32 percent of undergraduates \n        receive degrees in science and engineering.\n            (3) United States students are scoring far behind students \n        in other countries on international mathematics and science \n        assessments. A recent Trends in International Mathematics and \n        Science Study (TIMSS), the largest and most comprehensive \n        comparative international study of education, found that 12th \n        graders in the United States ranked 21st out of 40 \n        industrialized countries on general knowledge in mathematics \n        and science. Furthermore, the Programme for International \n        Student Assessment (PISA), an organization that compiles \n        reports on the reading and mathematics skills of 15-year-olds, \n        found that the United States ranked 28th out of 40 nations \n        surveyed in mathematics literacy.\n            (4) In the United States, each State has its own set of \n        standards and curriculum for mathematics and science education \n        in kindergarten through grade 12, with its own definition of \n        proficiency for these standards. When each State's definition \n        of proficiency is compared to a national model, less than 40 \n        percent of the students in grade 4, and only 17 percent of the \n        students in grade 12, reach the national proficiency level in \n        mathematics. In addition, approximately \\1/3\\ of the students \n        in grades 4 and 8, and nearly \\1/2\\ of the students in grade \n        12, do not reach the basic level in science, according to the \n        recent National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n            (5) In its report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm: \n        Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic \n        Future, the National Academy of Sciences recommends that the \n        Department of Education should collect ``effective K-12 \n        materials that would be available free of charge as a voluntary \n        national curriculum that would provide an effective standard \n        for K-12 teachers''. The National Academy of Sciences advocates \n        for the creation of world-class national benchmarks and a \n        national curriculum in order to ensure students are receiving \n        the skills needed to successfully compete in a global economy.\n\nSEC. 3.
