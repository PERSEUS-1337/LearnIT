Such recourse loans shall \n        be made available whenever the crop (or the portion of the crop \n        not normally harvested in a high moisture state) is harvested \n        with a moisture content in excess of Commodity Credit \n        Corporation standards for loans made under paragraphs (1) and \n        (6) of subsection (a) of this section, or whenever the crop has \n        a test weight below the minimum weight required for Commodity \n        Credit Corporation nonrecourse loans made under such \n        paragraphs.\n            ``(B) Recourse loans under this paragraph shall be made to \n        producers on a farm who--\n                    ``(i) present certified scale tickets from an \n                inspected, certified commercial scale, including \n                licensed warehouses, feedlots, feed mills, \n                distilleries, or other similar entities approved by the \n                Secretary; or\n                    ``(ii) present field or other physical measurements \n                of the standing or stored feed grain crop in regions of \n                the country that do not have certified commercial \n                scales from which certified scale tickets may be \n                obtained within reasonable proximity of harvest \n                operation; and\n                    ``(iii) certify that the quantity of feed grain to \n                be placed under loan was in fact harvested on the farm; \n                and\n                    ``(iv) participate in an acreage limitation program \n                for the crop of feed grains established by the \n                Secretary.\n            ``(C) A producer shall not be eligible for a loan under \n        this paragraph unless any prior loans made under the authority \n        of this paragraph have been fully repaid.\n            ``(D) Loans made under this paragraph shall bear interest \n        at a rate determined by the Secretary, but in no event shall \n        the rate exceed the rate of interest charged for loans made \n        under paragraphs (1) and (6) of subsection (a) of this section.\n            ``(E) Loans under this paragraph shall be made in an amount \n        as determined by the Secretary equal to at least eighty \n        percent, but not greater than ninety percent, of the lowest \n        county adjusted nondiscounted loan rate for the appropriate \n        crop year for loans made to producers of feed grains meeting \n        the Commodity Credit Corporation standards for nonrecourse \n        loans under paragraphs (1) and (6) of subsection (a) of this \n        section.\n            ``(F) Loans made under this paragraph shall be repaid in \n        three equal annual installments, with the first such \n        installment being due and payable 365 days following the \n        advance of the loan funds to the producer and consisting of \n        one-third of the principal amount of the outstanding loan and \n        100 percent of the accrued interest thereon. The second \n        installment shall consist of one-half of the principal amount \n        of the outstanding loan balance and 100 percent of the accrued \n        interest thereon, and the third installment shall consist of \n        the remaining principal of the loan and 100 percent of the \n        accrued interest thereon. In the event any installment is not \n        made within 60 days following the date upon which it becomes \n        due and payable, the Secretary shall have the right without \n        further notice to offset the entire balance of the amount owed \n        on the loan, including interest thereon, against any other \n        payments the producer may be entitled to receive under one or \n        more of the annual programs established under the Agricultural \n        Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) for wheat, feed grains, \n        upland cotton, rice, and oilseeds.\n            ``(G) The Secretary may permit a producer who has obtained \n        a loan under this paragraph to repay a part or all of any \n        annual installment required under subparagraph (F) by tendering \n        to the Commodity Credit Corporation a quantity of feed grain \n        which is of acceptable quality to meet the standards for a \n        nonrecourse loan under paragraphs (1) and (6) of subsection (a) \n        of this section. Such tender shall be made by the producer at \n        any facility approved for storage of commodities owned by the \n        Corporation which facility is situated in the same county (or a \n        county adjacent to the county) in which the producer's farm is \n        located, and the producer's loan installment payment shall be \n        credited with an amount equal to the per bushel county adjusted \n        loan rate for the grade and quality of grain tendered times the \n        total number of bushels tendered in payment by the producer as \n        approved by the Secretary."
