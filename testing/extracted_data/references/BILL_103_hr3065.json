To the extent that any amount remains credited \nto that participant at the end of each plan year, such amount shall be \ndeposited to a section 408(A) medical care savings account (which may \nalso be referred to as a `Medical IRA') for that participant.\n    ``(c) Payments from Account Balance.--If the plan provides for \nlevel installment payments, the plan may also provide that the maximum \namount of reimbursement at a particular time during the period of \ncoverage may be limited to the amount of actual contributions to the \nparticipant's benefit account. A participant may be advanced, interest \nfree, such amounts necessary to cover incurred medical expenses which \nexceed the amount then credited to the participant's benefit account, \nupon the participant's agreement to repay such advancement from future \ninstallments or upon ceasing to be a participant.\n    ``(d) Reporting.--Employers shall cause to be issued to \nparticipating employees, not less frequently than quarterly, a \nstatement setting forth amounts remaining in their accounts.\n    ``(e) Limitations on Medical Care Savings Benefits.--For purposes \nof this section--\n            ``(1) In general.--In the case of an Employer who has a \n        Health Plan in existence immediately prior to the adoption of \n        the Medical Care Savings Benefit, the maximum amount that may \n        be contributed annually to a participant's benefit account \n        shall be equal to--\n                    ``(A) the cost of that Health Plan for that \n                participant's type of coverage; plus\n                    ``(B) a cost of living adjustment for the calendar \n                year in which the plan year begins, determined under \n                section 1(f)(3) of the Code as adjusted annually based \n                on the CPI-Medical cost of living component.\n            ``(2) Other employers.--In the case of an Employer to whom \n        paragraph (1) does not apply, the contribution limit shall be \n        equal to the 67th percentile of the per employee health plan \n        expenditures (for the calendar year for which such plan begins) \n        for the type of coverage applicable to such employee based on a \n        broad representative survey using methodology the same as or \n        similar to that used by States to develop an average market \n        premium for small group guarantee access legislation. Such \n        study may be no broader than each State and may be broken down \n        into representative surveys for areas within a State. The \n        amount of such contribution shall be adjusted annually in \n        accordance with the cost of living adjustment provided for in \n        subsection (1)(b) of this section.\n            ``(3) Overall limitation.--In no event may any contribution \n        described above exceed the deductible amount of the Qualified \n        Higher Deductible Plan.\n    ``(f) Health Plan.--The term `Health Plan' means an employee \nwelfare benefit plan providing medical care (as defined in section \n213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) to participants or \nbeneficiaries directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or \notherwise.\n    ``(g) Qualified Higher Deductible Plan.--The term `Qualified Higher \nDeductible Plan' is a Health Plan which provides for payment of covered \nbenefits in excess of the higher deductible, which higher deductible \nshall not exceed $5,000 in 1993 and, adjusted annually thereafter for \nincreases in the cost of living in accordance with regulations \nprescribed by the Secretary.\n    ``(h) Coordination With Health Flexible Spending Accounts.--If, \nduring a Plan Year, a participating employee has a Medical Care Savings \nBenefit in effect and a health flexible spending account established \nunder section 125, coverage under the health flexible spending account, \nfor the type of medical expenses that may be reimbursed under the \nMedical Care Savings Benefit, would be limited to 100 percent of the \ndeductible under the Qualified Higher Deductible Plan, less the amount \ncredited in the current year to the Employee's Medical Care Savings \nBenefit Account.

Additionally, the Qualified Higher Deductible Plan may \nprovide that the deductible specified in the insurance policy may be \nincreased by the amount of any benefits payable by any other health \nbenefits program or plan.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
