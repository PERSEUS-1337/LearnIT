FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n        inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.\n            (2) Crohn's disease may occur in any section of the \n        gastrointestinal tract but is predominately found in the lower \n        part of the small intestine and the large intestine. Ulcerative \n        colitis is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the \n        innermost lining of the colon. Complete removal of the colon in \n        patients with ulcerative colitis can potentially alleviate and \n        cure symptoms.\n            (3) Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis behave \n        similarly, they are collectively known as inflammatory bowel \n        disease. Both diseases present a variety of symptoms, including \n        severe diarrhea; abdominal pain with cramps; fever; arthritic \n        joint pain, inflammation of the eye, and rectal bleeding. There \n        is no known cause of inflammatory bowel disease, or medical \n        cure.\n            (4) It is estimated that up to 1,400,000 people in the \n        United States suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, 30 \n        percent of whom are diagnosed during their childhood years.\n            (5) Children with inflammatory bowel disease miss school \n        activities because of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, and \n        many adults who had onset of inflammatory bowel disease as \n        children had delayed puberty and impaired growth and have never \n        reached their full genetic growth potential.\n            (6) Inflammatory bowel disease patients are at high risk \n        for developing colorectal cancer.\n            (7) The total annual medical costs for inflammatory bowel \n        disease patients are estimated at more than $2,000,000,000.\n            (8) The average time from presentation of symptoms to \n        diagnosis in children is three years.\n            (9) Delayed diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease \n        frequently results in more-active disease associated with \n        increased morbidity and complications.\n            (10) The National Institutes of Health National Commission \n        on Digestive Diseases issued comprehensive research goals \n        related to inflammatory bowel disease in its April 2009 report \n        to Congress and the American public entitled ``Opportunities \n        and Challenges in Digestive Diseases Research: Recommendations \n        of the National Commission on Digestive Diseases''.\n\nSEC. 3. ENHANCING CDC'S PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES ON INFLAMMATORY BOWEL \n              DISEASE.\n\n    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 320A the following:\n\n``SEC. 320B.
