FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \n    established the Admiralty Island National Monument which is managed \n    by the Secretary of Agriculture, by and through the Forest Service.\n        (2) The Forest Service has established a policy of encouraging \n    the acquisition of private land inholdings within Admiralty Island \n    National Monument on a willing buyer/willing seller basis. Congress \n    has supported this policy, for example by passage of the Greens \n    Creek Land Exchange Act of 1996 which provided for a land exchange \n    of certain public and private lands in Admiralty Island National \n    Monument.\n        (3) Lands owned by Alaska Pulp Corporation, consisting of 54 \n    acres, more or less, located in Hood Bay on Admiralty Island within \n    the boundaries of the Kootznoowoo Wilderness are available for \n    transfer to Federal ownership on a willing seller/willing buyer \n    basis.
