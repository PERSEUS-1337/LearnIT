FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On average, a child in the United States is exposed to \n        27 hours of television each week, and some children are exposed \n        to as much as 11 hours of television each day.\n            (2) The average American child watches 8,000 murders and \n        100,000 acts of other violence on television by the time the \n        child completes elementary school.\n            (3) By the age of 18 years, the average American teenager \n        has watched 200,000 acts of violence on television, including \n        40,000 murders.\n            (4) The Times Mirror Center reports that a recent poll of \n        Americans indicates that 72 percent of the American people \n        believe that there is too much violence on television, and, \n        according to a survey by U.S. News and World Report dated May \n        1994, 91 percent of American voters believe that mayhem in the \n        media contributes to violence in real life.\n            (5) On several occasions since 1975, The Journal of the \n        American Medical Association has alerted the medical community \n        to the adverse effects of televised violence on child \n        development, including an increase in the level of aggressive \n        behavior and violent behavior among children who view it.\n            (6) The National Commission on Children recommended in 1991 \n        that producers of television programs exercise greater \n        restraint in the content of programming for children.\n            (7) A report of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, \n        dated May 1993, indicates that there is an irrefutable \n        connection between the amount of violence depicted in the \n        television programs watched by children and increased \n        aggressive behavior among children.\n            (8) It is in the National interest that parents be \n        empowered with the technology to block the viewing of \n        television programs whose content is overly violent or \n        objectionable for other reasons.\n            (9) Technology currently exists to permit the manufacture \n        of television receivers that are capable of permitting parents \n        to block television programs having violent or otherwise \n        objectionable content.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF TELEVISION VIOLENCE RATING CODE.\n\n    Section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 303) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(v) Prescribe, in consultation with television broadcasters, \ncable operators, appropriate public interest groups, and interested \nindividuals from the private sector, rules for rating the level of \nviolence in television programming, including rules for the \ntransmission by television broadcast systems and cable systems of \nsignals containing specifications for blocking violent programming.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIREMENT FOR MANUFACTURE OF TELEVISIONS THAT BLOCK PROGRAMS.\n\n    Section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 303), as \namended by section 3, is further amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(w) Require, in the case of apparatus designed to receive \ntelevision signals that are manufactured in the United States or \nimported for use in the United States and that have a picture screen 13 \ninches or greater in size (measured diagonally), that such apparatus--\n            ``(1) be equipped with circuitry designed to enable viewers \n        to block the display of channels, programs, and time slots; and\n            ``(2) enable viewers to block display of all programs with \n        a common rating.''.\n\nSEC. 5. SHIPPING OR IMPORTING OF TELEVISIONS THAT BLOCK PROGRAMS.\n\n    (a) Regulations.--Section 330 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \nU.S.C. 330) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and\n            (2) by adding after subsection (b) the following new \n        subsection (c):\n    ``(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall ship \nin interstate commerce, manufacture, assemble, or import from any \nforeign country into the United States any apparatus described in \nsection 303(w) of this Act except in accordance with rules prescribed \nby the Commission pursuant to the authority granted by that section.\n    ``(2) This subsection shall not apply to carriers transporting \napparatus referred to in paragraph (1) without trading it.\n    ``(3) The rules prescribed by the Commission under this subsection \nshall provide performance standards for blocking technology. Such rules \nshall require that all such apparatus be able to receive the rating \nsignals which have been transmitted by way of line 21 of the vertical \nblanking interval and which conform to the signal and blocking \nspecifications established by the Commission.\n    ``(4) As new video technology is developed, the Commission shall \ntake such action as the Commission determines appropriate to ensure \nthat blocking service continues to be available to consumers.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 330(d) of such Act, as \nredesignated by subsection (a)(1), is amended by striking ``section \n303(s), and section 303(u)'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``and \nsections 303(s), 303(u), and 303(w)''.\n\nSEC. 6.
