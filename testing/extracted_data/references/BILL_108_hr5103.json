FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In August 2003, United States Supreme Court Justice \n        Anthony Kennedy, in a speech before the annual convention of \n        the American Bar Association, called for a reexamination of the \n        issue of mandatory minimum sentencing and a review of ``. . . \n        the inadequacies--and the injustices--in our penal correctional \n        systems''.\n            (2) Justice Kennedy stated that in too many cases, \n        mandatory minimum sentences are unwise and unjust, and that he \n        could ``. . . accept neither the necessity nor the wisdom of \n        mandatory minimum sentences''.\n            (3) Justice Kennedy concluded that in the Federal criminal \n        justice system ``[o]ur resources are misspent, our punishments \n        too severe, our sentences too long''.\n            (4) In response, in October 2003, the President of the ABA \n        created the Justice Kennedy Commission to investigate the \n        issues raised by Justice Kennedy's August 2003 speech.\n            (5) On June 23, 2004, the Commission issued a report, which \n        concluded that America's criminal justice systems rely too \n        heavily on incarceration and that they need to consider more \n        effective alternatives, including shorter sentences, treatment \n        and prisoner reentry programs.\n            (6) At its August 2004 annual convention, the ABA House of \n        Delegates adopted the recommendations of the Justice Kennedy \n        Commission, including the recommendation to repeal mandatory \n        minimum sentencing statutes.\n            (7) Since the enactment of mandatory minimum sentencing for \n        drug users, the Federal Bureau of Prisons budget increased by \n        more than 2,016 percent, from $220,000,000 in 1986 to about \n        $4,437,000,000 in 2004.\n            (8) Mandatory minimums have not reduced sentencing \n        discretion, but rather have transferred discretion from judges \n        to prosecutors. Prosecutors, not judges, have the discretion to \n        reduce a charge, accept or deny a plea bargain, reward or deny \n        a defendant's substantial assistance or cooperation in the \n        prosecution of someone else, and ultimately, to determine the \n        final sentence of the defendant.\n            (9) African Americans comprise 12 percent of the United \n        States population, 15 percent of drug users, 17 percent of \n        cocaine users, but 33 percent of all Federal drug convictions \n        and 57 percent of Federal cocaine convictions.\n            (10) In 1986, before the mandatory minimums for crack \n        cocaine offenses became effective, the average Federal offense \n        for African Americans was 11 percent higher than whites. \n        Following the implementation of mandatory drug sentencing laws, \n        the average drug offense sentence for African Americans was 49 \n        percent higher than whites.\n            (11) The average dealer holds a low-wage job and sells part \n        time to obtain for his or her own use.\n            (12) According to the Justice Department, the time spent in \n        prison does not affect recidivism rates.\n            (13) Largely as a result of mandatory minimum sentencing \n        statutes, there are now more than 2,100,000 persons in prison \n        and almost 70 percent of the people behind bars in America are \n        persons of color. African Americans made up 40 percent of the \n        Federal prison population in August 2003, up from 31 percent in \n        1986 before Federal mandatory minimums were enacted.\n            (14) As a result of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, \n        particularly with respect to drug crimes, in 2001, the average \n        Federal drug trafficking conviction was 72.7 months while the \n        average Federal manslaughter sentence was 34.3 months, the \n        average assault sentence 37.7 months, and the average sexual \n        abuse sentence 65.2 months.\n            (15) In 1999, African Americans constituted 13 percent of \n        drug users. In that same year, African Americans constituted 35 \n        percent of drug arrests, 53 percent of drug convictions, and 58 \n        percent of those in prison for drug offenses.\n            (16) Though their rates of drug use are roughly equal, \n        because of aggressive police tactics, racial profiling, and \n        other activities heavily targeted at street level drug activity \n        in urban areas (as opposed to the less visible drug activity \n        prevalent in more affluent areas), African Americans are \n        arrested for drug offenses at six times the rate of whites.\n            (17) Federal mandatory minimum sentences make African \n        Americans more likely to be incarcerated and for longer periods \n        than their white counterparts. In the year 2000, 84.7 percent \n        of crack cocaine cases were brought against African Americans \n        even though, in that year, African Americans comprised only \n        about 26.6 percent of crack users. Only 5.6 percent of crack \n        cases that year were brought against Caucasians even though \n        they constituted 64.4 percent of crack users.\n            (18) In the 20 years from 1981 to 2001, the sentenced \n        portion of the Federal prison population grew from about 20,000 \n        in 1981 to about 115,000 prisoners. During that same period, \n        the percentage of drug offenders in Federal prison grew from 25 \n        percent to almost 60 percent. Mandatory minimum sentences for \n        drug crimes are the largest drivers of expanding prison \n        populations.\n\nSEC. 3. APPROVAL OF CERTAIN PROSECUTIONS BY ATTORNEY GENERAL.\n\n    A Federal prosecution for an offense under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, or for \nany conspiracy to commit such an offense, where the offense involves \nthe illegal distribution or possession of a controlled substance in an \namount less than that amount specified as a minimum for an offense \nunder section 401(b)(1)(A) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n841(b)(1)(A)) or, in the case of any substance containing cocaine or \ncocaine base, in an amount less than 500 grams, shall not be commenced \nwithout the prior written approval of the Attorney General.\n\nSEC. 4.

and\n                    (E) by striking the sentence beginning \n                ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law''.\n    (c) Section 1010.--Section 1010(b) of the Controlled Substances \nImport and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960(b)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1)--\n                    (A) by striking ``of not less than 10 years and not \n                more than'' and inserting ``for any term of years or \n                for'';\n                    (B) by striking ``and if death'' the first place it \n                appears and all that follows through ``20 years and not \n                more than life'' the first place it appears;\n                    (C) by striking ``of not less than 20 years and not \n                more than life imprisonment'' and inserting ``for any \n                term of years or for life'';\n                    (D) by inserting ``imprisonment for any term of \n                years or to'' after ``if death or serious bodily injury \n                results from the use of such substance shall be \n                sentenced to'';
