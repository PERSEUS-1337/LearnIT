SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Job Corps Youth Sentencing \nAlternative for Vocational Education and Training Act'' or the \n``YOUTHSAVE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Over 1,000,000 offenders are incarcerated in the \n        Nation's prisons and jails, and Federal and State correctional \n        systems face severe prison overcrowding.\n            (2) The annual costs of incarceration range as high as \n        $36,000 per inmate and represent one of the fastest growing \n        expenses facing States.\n            (3) Most juvenile offenders, regardless of the seriousness \n        of their crimes, are released at the age of 21, and are poorly \n        educated, unskilled, and unprepared to enter the workforce.\n            (4) Research on crime prevention shows that early \n        intervention directed at first-time offenders is essential to \n        helping them avoid a lifetime of crime.\n            (5) Studies have shown that inmates who receive job \n        training in prison are 3 times less likely to return to jail \n        after being released than their counterparts who do not receive \n        job training.\n            (6) The current system of juvenile incarceration usually \n        serves to warehouse offenders without providing effective \n        counseling, education, and job training necessary to reorient \n        youth inmates away from crime.\n            (7) Successful efforts to educate and train convicted \n        youths could result in substantial cost savings in terms of \n        reduced crime, incarceration, public assistance, and in higher \n        payroll tax revenues.\n            (8) The Job Corps program, authorized under part B of title \n        IV of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1691 et \n        seq.), is the Nation's only residential education and \n        vocational training program targeted to serve low-income youth \n        who face multiple barriers to becoming economically self-\n        sufficient.\n            (9) The Job Corps program has a documented record of \n        success during its 29 years of operation, including a 75 \n        percent placement rate of successfully helping graduates obtain \n        permanent employment, return to school, or enter the armed \n        services, and such program returns $1.46 on every $1.00 \n        invested in the program.\n            (10) Eligibility requirements of the Job Corps program \n        limit the participation of youths with certain behavioral \n        problems and youths who are being adjudicated or have been \n        convicted of crimes.\n            (11) Under section 433(a)(3) of the Job Training \n        Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1703(a)(3)), the Secretary of Labor \n        is authorized to undertake one or more pilot projects designed \n        to involve youths who have a history of behavioral problems in \n        order to provide these youths with the education, job training, \n        and counseling services that have proved so successful among \n        regular Job Corps participants.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to establish separate Job Corps Youthsave centers for \n        youths who have been convicted of nonviolent criminal offenses \n        which shall be an alternative sentencing option for such \n        youths;\n            (2) to provide youth offenders at such centers with \n        intensive counseling, education, and job training in order to \n        help them become self-sufficient members of society; and\n            (3) to provide a disciplined environment at such centers in \n        which youth offenders can receive maximum benefit from regular \n        Job Corps services and other services geared specifically to \n        the needs of such offenders.\n\nSEC. 3.
