FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in recent years, there has been an alarming number of \n        instances of price-fixing and bid-rigging regarding foods \n        purchased for--\n                    (A) the school lunch program established under the \n                National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.); and\n                    (B) the school breakfast program established under \n                the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et \n                seq.);\n            (2) during the past several years, the Antitrust Division \n        of the Department of Justice has filed over 95 criminal cases \n        against persons accused of bid-rigging conspiracies, false \n        statements, mail fraud, price-fixing, and similar activities \n        involving dairy products sold to schools or the Department of \n        Defense;\n            (3) over 30 grand juries in States are investigating \n        similar activities, especially in connection with activities \n        involving the dairy industry;\n            (4) 45 corporations and 48 individuals have been convicted \n        by Federal courts of similar activities, and total fines and \n        civil damages of approximately $100,000,000 have been assessed \n        in Federal and State actions for similar activities;\n            (5) a report of the Comptroller General of the United \n        States noted that, as of March 1992, the Secretary of \n        Agriculture had neither suspended nor debarred any of the 13 \n        dairy companies or 28 individuals convicted, as of March 1992, \n        of milk contract bid-rigging from participating in the school \n        lunch and breakfast programs;\n            (6) effective educational and monitoring programs can \n        greatly reduce the incidence of price-fixing and bid-rigging by \n        companies that sell products to schools;\n            (7) reducing the incidence of price-fixing and bid-rigging \n        in connection with the school lunch and breakfast programs \n        could save school districts, parents, and taxpayers millions of \n        dollars per year;\n            (8) the Comptroller General of the United States has noted \n        that bid-rigging awareness training is an effective means of \n        deterring improper collusion and bid-rigging; and\n            (9) the Comptroller General of the United States in a \n        General Accounting Office report addressed many of the concerns \n        described in this section with respect to bid rigging in the \n        school lunch program.\n\nSEC. 3.
