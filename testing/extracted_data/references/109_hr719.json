    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Agricultural Export Facilitation Act \nof 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The export sector of United States agriculture makes an \n        important positive contribution to this country's trade \n        balance.\n            (2) The total value of United States exports of \n        agricultural products shipped to Cuba since 2000 when such \n        sales were first authorized by Congress is approximately \n        $1,000,000,000, including transportation, port fees, and \n        insurance costs. In December 2001, Cuba purchased approximately \n        $4,300,000 in food and agricultural products. In 2002, Cuba \n        purchased approximately $138,600,000 in food and agricultural \n        products. In 2003, Cuba purchased approximately $256,900,000 in \n        food and agricultural products. In 2004, Cuba purchased \n        approximately $380,000,000 in food and agricultural products. \n        Cuba ranked at the bottom of 226 agricultural export markets \n        for United States companies in 2001; ranked 50th of 226 in \n        2002; ranked 35th of 219 in 2003; and ranked approximately 25th \n        of 228 in 2004. Cuba is therefore an important source of \n        revenue for United States agriculture and its affiliated \n        industries, such as manufacturers and distributors of value-\n        added food products.\n            (3) To be competitive in sales to Cuban purchasers, United \n        States exporters of agricultural products and their \n        representatives, including representatives of United States air \n        or sea carriers, ports and shippers, must have ready and \n        reliable physical access to Cuba. Such access is currently \n        uncertain because, under existing regulations, United States \n        exporters and their representatives must apply for and receive \n        special Treasury Department licenses to travel to Cuba to \n        engage in sales-related activities. The issuance of such \n        licenses is subject to both administrative delays and periodic \n        denials. A blanket statutory authorization for sales and \n        transport-related travel to Cuba by United States exporters \n        will remove the current bureaucratic impediment to agricultural \n        product sales endorsed by Congress when it passed the Trade \n        Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.\n            (4) On many occasions United States visas have been delayed \n        and often denied to prospective Cuban purchasers of products \n        authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n        Enhancement Act of 2000. The result has been that family \n        farmers and other small producers and distributors of \n        agricultural products who lack the resources to fund sales \n        delegations to Cuba have been denied access to potential \n        purchasers in that country. A simple solution is for the \n        Department of State to issue visas to Cuban nationals who \n        demonstrate an itinerary of meetings with prospective United \n        States exporters of products authorized under the Trade \n        Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. In \n        addition, visas should be issued to Cuban phytosanitary \n        inspectors who require entry into the United States to conduct \n        on-premise inspections of production and processing facilities \n        and the products of potential United States exporters.\n            (5) The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act \n        of 2000 requires ``payment of cash in advance'' for United \n        States agricultural exports to Cuba. Some Federal agencies \n        responsible for the implementation of the Trade Sanctions \n        Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 have expressed the \n        view that ``cash in advance'' requires that payment be received \n        by a United States exporter in advance of shipment of goods to \n        Cuba. Indeed, late last year payments due United States \n        exporters from purchasers in Cuba were frozen in United States \n        banks while the terms of those payments were reviewed \n        unnecessarily. This action by the Department of the Treasury \n        has created a climate of commercial uncertainty that has \n        inhibited agricultural sales under the Trade Sanctions Reform \n        and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to Cuba.\n            (6) There is nothing in either the Trade Sanctions Reform \n        and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 itself or its legislative \n        history to support the view that Congress intended payment to \n        be made in advance of the shipment of goods from this country \n        to Cuba. It was and is the intent of Congress that a seller of \n        a product authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and \n        Export Enhancement Act of 2000 receive payment only before a \n        Cuban purchaser takes physical possession of that product.\n            (7) At present it is the policy of the United States \n        Government to prohibit direct payment between Cuban and United \n        States financial institutions. As a result, Cuban purchasers of \n        products authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n        Enhancement Act of 2000 must route their payments through third \n        country banks that charge a fee for this service. Allowing \n        direct payments between Cuban and United States financial \n        institutions will permit the United States exporters to receive \n        payment directly to their financial institutions within hours \n        instead of days and will eliminate an unnecessary transactional \n        fee, thereby allowing Cuban purchasers to purchase more United \n        States origin agricultural products.\n            (8) Trademarks and trade names are vital assets of the \n        United States companies that export branded food products, \n        including those who today or in the future may sell such \n        products to Cuba under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n        Enhancement Act of 2000. Hundreds of United States companies \n        have registered their trademarks in Cuba in order to ensure the \n        exclusive right to use those trademarks when the United States \n        trade embargo on that country is lifted. Moreover, following \n        the enactment of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n        Enhancement Act of 2000, many United States companies are today \n        exporting branded food products to Cuba where they hope to \n        establish their brands with Cuban purchasers in order to \n        benefit from current sales under the Trade Sanctions Reform and \n        Export Enhancement Act of 2000, as well as position themselves \n        for the larger post-embargo market for United States goods in \n        Cuba.\n            (9) Sales to Cuba of branded products of United States \n        companies contribute to the livelihoods of American workers and \n        the balance sheets of United States businesses. Those sales \n        depend on the security of United States trademarks and trade \n        names protected in Cuba by reciprocal treaties and agreements \n        for the protection of intellectual property. Among such \n        treaties and agreements are the Agreement on Trade-Related \n        Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the Inter-\n        American Convention for Trademark and Commercial Protection.\n            (10) The United States District Court for the Southern \n        District of New York ruled that section 211 of the Department \n        of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 \n        abrogates, with respect to Cuba, the Inter-American Convention \n        on Trademarks and Commercial Protection. The court's ruling was \n        affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \n        Circuit.\n            (11) Cuba's international remedy under customary \n        international law (as codified by Article 60 of the 1969 Vienna \n        Convention on Treaties), for a breach by the United States of \n        the Inter-American Convention, is to suspend or revoke the \n        protections Cuba currently affords United States trademarks and \n        trade names.\n            (12) In order to preserve the rights of United States \n        nationals holding trademarks in Cuba, including those engaged \n        in authorized sales under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n        Enhancement Act of 2000 now and in the future, the United \n        States must repeal section 211 of the Department of Commerce \n        and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 and the United \n        States must comply with all treaty obligations owed Cuba as \n        they relate to trademarks and trade names.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to remove impediments to \npresent and future sales of United States agricultural products to Cuba \nunder the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 and \nto otherwise facilitate such sales.\n\nSEC. 3. TRAVEL TO CUBA IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED SALES ACTIVITIES.\n\n    Section 910 of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement \nAct of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7209) is amended by inserting after subsection \n(b) the following:\n    ``(c) General License Authority for Travel-Related Expenditure in \nCuba by Persons Engaging in TSREEA of 2000 Sales and Marketing \nActivities in That Country and TSREEA-Related Transportation \nActivities.--\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n        authorize under a general license the travel-related \n        transactions listed in subsection (c) of section 515.560 of \n        title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, for travel to, from, or \n        within Cuba in connection with activities undertaken in \n        connection with sales and marketing, including the organization \n        and participation in product exhibitions, and the \n        transportation by sea or air of products pursuant to this Act.\n            ``(2) Definitions.--In this subsection, the term `sales and \n        marketing activities' means any activity with respect to travel \n        to, from, or within Cuba that is undertaken by a United States \n        person in order to explore the market in that country for the \n        sale of products pursuant to this Act or to engage in sales \n        activities with respect to such products.
