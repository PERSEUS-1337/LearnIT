FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this Act \n        as the ``Secretary'') administers the 191,000,000-acre National \n        Forest System for multiple uses in accordance with Federal law;\n            (2) where suitable, one of the recognized multiple uses for \n        National Forest System land is grazing by livestock;\n            (3) the Secretary authorizes grazing through the issuance \n        of term grazing permits that have terms of not to exceed 10 \n        years and that include terms and conditions necessary for the \n        proper administration of National Forest System land and \n        resources;\n            (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n        has issued approximately 9,000 term grazing permits authorizing \n        grazing on approximately 90,000,000 acres of National Forest \n        System land;\n            (5) of the approximately 9,000 term grazing permits issued \n        by the Secretary, approximately one-half have expired or will \n        expire by the end of 1996;\n            (6) if the holder of an expiring term grazing permit has \n        complied with the terms and conditions of the permit and \n        remains eligible and qualified, that individual is considered \n        to be a preferred applicant for a new term grazing permit in \n        the event that the Secretary determines that grazing remains an \n        appropriate use of the affected National Forest System land;\n            (7) in addition to the approximately 9,000 term grazing \n        permits issued by the Secretary, it is estimated that as many \n        as 1,600 term grazing permits may be waived by permit holders \n        to the Secretary in favor of a purchaser of the permit holder's \n        permitted livestock or base property by the end of 1996;\n            (8) to issue new term grazing permits, the Secretary must \n        comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n        U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other laws;\n            (9) for a large percentage of the grazing permits that will \n        expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, the \n        Secretary has devised a strategy that will result in compliance \n        with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other \n        applicable laws (including regulations) in a timely and \n        efficient manner and enable the Secretary to issue new term \n        grazing permits, where appropriate;\n            (10) for a small percentage to the grazing permits that \n        will expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, \n        the strategy will not provide for the timely issuance of new \n        term grazing permits; and\n            (11) in cases in which ranching operations involve the use \n        of a term grazing permit issued by the Secretary, it is \n        essential for new term grazing permits to be issued in a timely \n        manner for financial and other reasons.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that graving \ncontinues without interruption on National Forest System land in a \nmanner that provides long-term protection of the environment and \nimprovement of National Forest System rangeland resources while also \nproviding short-term certainty to holders of expiring term grazing \npermits and purchasers of a permit holder's permitted livestock or base \nproperty.\n\nSEC. 2.
