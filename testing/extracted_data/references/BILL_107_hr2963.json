FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Certain areas located in the White River National \n        Forest and the Bureau of Land Management, Glenwood Springs \n        Resource Area, in Colorado along Deep Creek should be protected \n        and enhanced for the benefit and enjoyment of present and \n        future generations, including the areas making up the rugged \n        and remote limestone gorge formed by Deep Creek on the White \n        River Plateau of the White River National Forest in Garfield \n        and Eagle Counties, Colorado, which have wilderness values and \n        offer unique and valuable scenic, geological, scientific, and \n        recreational opportunities.\n            (2) The unique high elevation riparian areas and natural \n        and wildlife components, enhanced by the rural western setting \n        of the area, provide extensive opportunities for primitive \n        recreational activities, are publicly used for hiking, cave \n        exploration, and solitude, and are worthy of additional \n        protection as a wilderness area.\n            (3) Deep Creek carves a rugged and remote limestone gorge, \n        forming a dramatic pristine canyon over 2,500 feet deep and 13 \n        miles long.\n            (4) The limestone strata have created ideal conditions for \n        the formation of caves, many of which are among Colorado's most \n        outstanding.\n            (5) There are both absolute and conditional decreed water \n        rights appertaining to waters upstream and downstream from the \n        Wilderness Area. These rights are private property rights and \n        are entitled to protection.\n            (6) It is possible to provide for proper management and \n        protection of the wilderness values of the Wilderness Area in \n        ways that provide for the reasonable development of the \n        upstream and adjacent water rights.\n            (7) Out of respect for the native Ute people who frequented \n        the area near Trappers Lake and the Deep Creek headwaters for \n        centuries, the Wilderness Area shall be known as the Deep \n        Creek-Yampatika Ute Wilderness.\n            (8) Colorado law authorizes the Colorado Water Conservation \n        Board to hold instream flow rights in order to protect the \n        natural environment. Establishment and/or augmentation of such \n        an instream flow right for Deep Creek, abandonment of existing \n        conditional rights appertaining to waters upstream from the \n        Wilderness Area, and/or conversion to such instream flow rights \n        of existing absolute water rights appertaining to such waters \n        would be beneficial to the protection of the resources and \n        values of the Wilderness Area.\n            (9) There are no known water resource facilities or \n        projects, or rights-of-way or access routes serving water \n        resource facilities or projects, within the Wilderness Area. \n        Therefore, it is not necessary to include provisions in this \n        Act for access, operation, routes, maintenance, or repair for \n        water resource facilities or projects.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to conserve, protect, and \nenhance for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations \nthe unique and nationally important values of the Federal lands \ndepicted on the Map, including wilderness, geological, natural, \nscientific, recreational, environmental, biological, and scenic \nresources of such Federal lands, by establishing the Deep Creek-\nYampatika Ute Wilderness Area in the State of Colorado.\n\nSEC. 3.
