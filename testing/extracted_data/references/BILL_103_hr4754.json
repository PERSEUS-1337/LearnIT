FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (a) On December 2, 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands \n        Conservation Act (94 Stat. 2371) established Gates of the \n        Arctic National Park and Preserve and Gates of the Arctic \n        Wilderness. The village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in the \n        highlands of the central Brooks Range, is virtually surrounded \n        by these national park and wilderness lands and is the only \n        village located within the boundary of a National Park System \n        unit in Alaska.\n            (b) Unlike most other Alaskan Native communities, the \n        village of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major river, \n        lake, or coastline that can be used as a means of access. The \n        residents of Anaktuvuk Pass have relied increasingly on snow \n        machines in winter and all-terrain vehicles in summer as their \n        primary means of access to pursue caribou and other subsistence \n        resources.\n            (c) In a 1983 land exchange agreement, linear easements \n        were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for use of all-\n        terrain vehicles across certain national park lands, mostly \n        along stream and river banks. These linear easements proved \n        unsatisfactory, because they provided inadequate access to \n        subsistence resources while causing excessive environmental \n        impact from concentrated use.\n            (d) The National Park Service and the Nunamiut Corporation \n        initiated discussions in 1985 to address concerns over the use \n        of all-terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land. Those \n        discussions resulted in an agreement, originally executed in \n        1992 and thereafter amended in 1993 and 1994, among the \n        National Park Service, the Nunamiut Corporation, the City of \n        Anaktuvuk Pass, and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Full \n        effectuation of this agreement, as amended, requires \n        ratification by the Congress.\n\nSEC. 3.
