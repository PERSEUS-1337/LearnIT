FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) \n        is one of the most important laws available to United States \n        businesses to deal with unfair practices in import trade and to \n        enforce intellectual property rights against infringing \n        imports.\n            (2) On November 23, 1988, a panel of the General Agreement \n        on Tariffs and Trade (hereafter in this Act referred to as \n        ``GATT'') found section 337 to be in violation of United States \n        obligations under the GATT, because certain procedures under \n        section 337 did not provide national treatment for imported \n        goods and because some aspects of the procedures were \n        unnecessary for effective compliance with United States patent \n        law.\n            (3) On November 7, 1989, the United States allowed adoption \n        of the GATT panel report on section 337, thereby assuming an \n        obligation to reform section 337 to comply with its obligations \n        under the GATT.\n            (4) Because of the special difficulties in enforcing \n        intellectual property rights against unfairly traded imports, \n        special enforcement procedures that apply only to imports are \n        necessary to effectively enforce intellectual property rights \n        against infringing imports.\n            (5) The GATT allows special enforcement procedures when \n        such procedures are not less favorable than the procedures used \n        against domestic products or such procedures are necessary to \n        secure compliance with copyright, patent, trademark, and mask \n        work registration protection laws or regulations.\n            (6) To be effective, such enforcement procedures must \n        establish administrative proceedings which can reach multiple \n        parties in one forum, allow efficient foreign discovery, \n        provide expeditious dispute resolution, and provide border \n        enforcement by the United States Customs Service.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to conform section 337 of \nthe Tariff Act of 1930 and title 28 of the United States Code to the \nprovisions of the GATT to ensure that section 337 procedures can reach \nmultiple parties in one forum, allow efficient foreign discovery, \nprovide expeditious dispute resolution even in the absence of a \ndeadline for final determinations, and provide border enforcement of \ndeterminations.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT OF SECTION 337 OF THE TARIFF ACT OF 1930.\n\n    (a) Investigation.--Section 337(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 \nU.S.C. 1337(b)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``; Time Limits'' in the heading;\n            (2) in paragraph (1), by striking ``The Commission shall \n        conclude any such investigation'' and all that follows through \n        the end period and inserting the following: ``The Commission \n        shall conclude any such investigation and make its \n        determination under this section at the earliest practicable \n        time after the date of publication of notice of such \n        investigation. To promote expeditious adjudication, the \n        Commission shall, within 30 days of the initiation of an \n        investigation, establish a target date for its final \n        determination.''; and\n            (3) by striking the fifth sentence in paragraph (3).\n    (b) Determination; Review.--Section 337(c) of such Act is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``a settlement agreement'' in the first \n        sentence and inserting ``an agreement between the parties'';\n            (2) by striking ``subsection (d) or (e)'' in the second \n        sentence and inserting ``subsection (d), (e), or (f) (and each \n        declaration under subsection (o))''; and\n            (3) by striking ``(f), or (g)'' in the fourth sentence and \n        inserting ``(f), (g), or (o)''.\n    (c) Exclusion of Articles From Entry.--Section 337(d) of such Act \nis amended by inserting after the first sentence the following new \nsentence: ``No article shall be excluded from entry where the \nCommission determines that the owner, importer, or consignee of the \narticle has established a sufficient counterclaim directly related to \nthe unfair methods or acts determined by the Commission to exist.''.\n    (d) Entry Under Bond.--Section 337(e) of such Act is amended--\n            (1) in the last sentence of paragraph (1), by striking \n        ``determined by the Commission'' and all that follows through \n        the end period and inserting: ``prescribed by the Secretary in \n        an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to \n        protect the complainant from any injury.

The Commission may prescribe the \n        terms and conditions under which bonds may be forfeited under \n        this paragraph.''.\n    (f) Conditions Applicable for General Exclusion Orders.--Section \n337(g) of such Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the \nfollowing new paragraph:\n            ``(3) The authority of the Commission to issue an exclusion \n        from entry of articles shall be limited to persons determined \n        by the Commission to be violating this section unless the \n        Commission determines that--\n                    ``(A) a general exclusion from entry of articles is \n                necessary to prevent circumvention of an exclusion from \n                entry limited to such persons; or\n                    ``(B) there is a pattern of violation of this \n                section and it is difficult to identify the persons \n                responsible.''.\n    (g) Entry Under Bond After Referral to President.--Section \n337(j)(3) of such Act is amended by striking ``shall be entitled to \nentry under bond'' and all that follows through the end period and \ninserting ``shall, until such determination becomes final, be entitled \nto entry under bond prescribed by the Secretary in an amount determined \nby the Commission to be sufficient to protect the complainant from \ninjury.
