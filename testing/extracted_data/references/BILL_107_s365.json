SNOWMOBILES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--(1) Recreational snowmobile use within units of the \nNational Park System is an established, traditional, and legitimate \nmeans of visitor use and enjoyment of these public lands when conducted \nin a manner that does not adversely affect or impair park resources and \nvalues.\n    (2) The snowmobile manufacturers and the Environmental Protection \nAgency will be working to establish emissions standards for a new \ngeneration of snowmobiles. This new generation of machines will be \ncleaner and quieter and should be available to the public within five \nyears.\n    (3) Cleaner, quieter snowmobiles may provide the public with a \ngreater opportunity to enjoy the National Park System in a manner that \nis consistent with park resources and values.\n    (b) Interim Park Operations.--(1) As is consistent with the Act \nentitled, ``An Act to establish a National Park Service, and for other \npurposes,'' approved August 25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), in the \nfollowing units of the National Park System where snowmobile use \noccurred or was authorized as of January 1, 2000, such use shall \ncontinue restricted to levels of no less than the average wintertime \nuse and activity over the last three winters. This use can be subject \nto other reasonable regulations governing such use existing as of \nJanuary 1, 2000, including emergency closure authority:\n            Acadia National Park, Maine\n            Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Colorado\n            Crater Lake National Park, Oregon\n            Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming\n            Mount Rainier National Park, Washington\n            North Cascades National Park, Washington\n            Olympic National Park, Washington\n            Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado\n            Sequoia National Park, California\n            Kings Canyon National Park, California\n            Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota\n            Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota\n            Yellowstone National Park, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming\n            Zion National Park, Utah\n            Appalachian National Scenic Trail, Multi-States\n            Saint Croix National Scenic River, Wisconsin, Minnesota\n            Pictured Rocks National Seashore, Michigan\n            Cedar Breaks National Monument, Utah\n            Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado, Utah\n            Grand Portage National Monument, Minnesota\n            Blue Ridge Parkway, North Carolina, Virginia\n            John D.

The restrictions shall apply \nto the smallest practical portion of the unit adequate to address the \nimpacts.\n    (B) Before restricting use and activity in this manner, the \nSecretary shall make a finding of significant environmental impact \nbased on on-the-ground study in the affected unit or portion of the \nunit and sound, peer-reviewed scientific information applicable to that \nunit or portion of the unit. Within at least 90 days before finalizing \nsuch restrictions, the Secretary shall notify the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on Resources of \nits intent and provide the public with at least 30 days to comment on \nthe proposal.\n    (3) Consistent with other applicable law, the National Park Service \nmay prohibit recreational snowmobile use within all units of the system \nnot listed in subsection (b)(1).\n    (c) Long-Term Program and Operations.--(1) Within two years after \nthe enactment of this Act, the Environmental Protection Agency shall \npromulgate final national standards governing emissions by snowmobiles.\n    (2) The Environmental Protection Agency may engage in negotiated \nrulemaking with the snowmobile manufacturers regarding this standard.\n    (3) Taking into account noise reductions achieved in conjunction \nwith the emissions standard described in subsection (c)(1), not later \nthan five years following the date of enactment of this Act, the \nNational Park Service, in conjunction with the Society of Automotive \nEngineers, shall set noise standards for snowmobile use in the National \nPark System.\n    (d) Management Plans and Studies.--(1) The National Park Service is \ndirected to prepare management plans to assure education and \nenforcement of regulations governing recreational snowmobile use within \nthe system.\n    (2) The National Park Service shall conduct new comprehensive \nstudies to assess the impacts of recreational snowmobile use within the \naffected units of the system on park resources, visitor use and \nenjoyment, and adjacent communities. Among other things, these studies \nmust include consideration of the EPA snowmobile emission standards, \nsnowmobiles that are produced in response to those standards, and \ntechnological and other advances occurring or anticipated at that time. \nThe conclusions derived from such studies shall be the basis for any \nproposed revised regulations and management plans to govern use of \nrecreational snowmobiles within the units listed in subsection (b)(1) \nof this section.\n    (3) Not later than four years following the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the National Park Service shall prepare a Report to Congress \nconcerning the proper use of snowmobiles for recreation in National \nPark System units. Among other things, this Report shall consider the \nimpact of the snowmobiles compliant with the emission standards set in \nsubsection (c)(1) on wildlife, the environment, and other relevant \nfactors.\n    (4) Not later than five years after the date of enactment of this \nAct, and based upon the findings of the Report to Congress described in \nsubsection (d)(3) and other relevant information, the National Park \nService shall propose revised regulations and management plans to \ngovern use of recreational snowmobiles within the units listed in \nsubsection (b)(1) of this Act.\n    (5) No management plan or regulation developed in accordance with \nsubsection (d)(4) shall permit the entry of snowmobiles that do not \nmeet the emission and noise standards described in subsections (c)(1) \nand (c)(3), respectively, into the units of the National Park System \ndescribed in section (b)(1) of this Act.\n    (e) Savings Clause.--Nothing herein is intended to affect the \nprovisions of Public Law 96-487, including but not limited to, Section \n1110(a)."
