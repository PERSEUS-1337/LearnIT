FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Since 1975, title XX of the Social Security Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 1397 et seq.), commonly referred to as the Social \n        Services Block Grant (in this section referred to as ``SSBG''), \n        has authorized funding for social services to ensure that at-\n        risk children and families, the elderly, and physically and \n        mentally disabled individuals remain stable, independent, and \n        economically self sufficient. In 1981, Congress and the Reagan \n        Administration converted SSBG into a block grant designed to \n        give maximum flexibility to States to serve these fundamental \n        purposes.\n            (2) Funds provided under the SSBG focus cost-effective \n        support at the community level that prevents the need for \n        inappropriate institutional care which is more costly for \n        Federal and State programs such as the medicaid, medicare, and \n        the social services disability benefits programs.\n            (3) The SSBG helps to further the goals set forth in the \n        Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act \n        of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. 2105) by supporting \n        Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and support-\n        related programs such as on-the-job training, child care, \n        transportation, counseling, and other services that facilitate \n        long-term family stability and economic self sufficiency.\n            (4) The SSBG provides essential funding to many States for \n        child welfare services that support the goals of the Adoption \n        and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-89; 111 Stat. \n        2115) to promote a safe family environment and encourage \n        adoption to move children into stable and permanent families.\n            (5) The SSBG helps promote independent living for \n        vulnerable and low-income elderly individuals by supporting \n        home care services, including home-delivered meals, adult \n        protective services, adult day care, and other essential case \n        management services provided in every State.\n            (6) It is reported that 820,000 older Americans are abused \n        and neglected in this country each year. There are additional \n        concerns about the under reporting of elderly abuse and \n        neglect. The SSBG supports adult protective services that \n        prevent widespread abuse and neglect of older Americans and \n        help more than 651,000 elderly individuals in 31 States.\n            (7) More than 570,000 disabled individuals receive a range \n        of community-based services and supports nationwide. The SSBG \n        provides significant resources to fill the funding gaps in the \n        developmental disabilities system by supporting such services \n        as early intervention and crisis intervention, adult day care, \n        respite care, transportation, employment training, and \n        independent living services in 38 States.\n            (8) The SSBG supports essential mental health and related \n        services to ensure that vulnerable adults and children receive \n        early intervention to prevent more serious and costly mental \n        health crises in the future. Such services include the \n        provision of counseling to almost 400,000 adults and children, \n        case management services for nearly 900,000 families, and the \n        provision of information and referral assistance to more than \n        1,300,000 individuals.\n            (9) There are nearly 3,000,000 reports of child abuse and \n        neglect each year. There are currently over 300,000 children in \n        the American foster care system. The SSBG enables the provision \n        of child protective services to 1,300,000 children, adoption \n        services to over 150,000 children and families, and prevention \n        and intervention services to more than 700,000 families.\n            (10) The SSBG has been eroded by more than $1,000,000,000 \n        over the last 6 years resulting in  cuts in services in many \nStates and local communities.\n            (11) Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block \n        grants cannot be used to make up cuts to the SSBG because a \n        large percentage of SSBG funds are used for the elderly, \n        disabled, and other populations that are ineligible for TANF \n        funds.\n            (12) The 104th Congress made a commitment to the SSBG in \n        the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \n        Act of 1996 by authorizing the program at $2,380,000,000 \n        through fiscal year 2002 and returning the authorization for \n        the program to $2,800,000,000 in fiscal year 2003 and each \n        succeeding fiscal year.\n\nSEC. 2. RESTORATION OF AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER UP TO 10 PERCENT OF TANF \n              FUNDS TO THE SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n              2002.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 404(d)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act \n(42 U.S.C. 604(d)(2)(B)) is amended to read as follows:\n                    ``(B) Applicable percent.--For purposes of \n                subparagraph (A), the applicable percent is--\n                            ``(i) 10 percent in the case of fiscal year \n                        2001; and\n                            ``(ii) 10 percent in the case of fiscal \n                        year 2002.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \ntake effect on October 1, 2001.\n\nSEC. 3.
