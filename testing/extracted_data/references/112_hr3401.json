    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhanced Border Security Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to protect United States citizens \nfrom external threats by establishing and applying appropriate \ncounterinsurgency tactics under a coordinated and targeted strategy to \ncombat the terrorist insurgency in Mexico waged by transnational \ncriminal organizations by utilizing cross-agency capabilities to--\n            (1) secure the United States-Mexico border through a secure \n        border area;\n            (2) curtail the ability of such organizations to finance \n        their operations with United States funds in cities throughout \n        the United States; and\n            (3) increase the ability of the Government of Mexico to--\n                    (A) reduce violence;\n                    (B) diminish corruption;\n                    (C) improve cooperation between military and law \n                enforcement;\n                    (D) stabilize communities; and\n                    (E) fortify functioning government institutions.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Mexican drug cartels have evolved into transnational \n        criminal organizations and diversified and expanded their \n        illicit activities, including human smuggling, trafficking in \n        stolen oil, weapons smuggling, extortion, kidnapping, and \n        cybercrime.\n            (2) Mexican drug cartels have increased their profits \n        through various illicit activities and have become more \n        resilient and dangerous organizations. Rough estimates of \n        stolen oil proceeds range between $2 billion and $4 billion \n        each year. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and \n        Crime (UNODC), approximately $6.6 billion annually is generated \n        from human smuggling from Latin America to the United States.\n            (3) A July 2011 White House report found that transnational \n        criminal organizations have expanded and matured, threatening \n        the security of citizens and the stability of governments \n        throughout the region, with direct security implications for \n        the United States.\n            (4) An August 2011 Department of Justice National Drug \n        Threat Assessment found that Mexican-based transnational \n        criminal organizations were operating in more than 1,000 United \n        States cities during 2009 and 2010.\n            (5) On October 11, 2011, a foiled terrorist assassination \n        plot of the Saudi Arabian Ambassador by members of the Iranian \n        Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps demonstrated the \n        internationally recognized threat posed by Mexican drug cartel \n        members at the United States-Mexico border.\n            (6) The Merida Initiative, led by the Department of State, \n        has failed to address the evolution of the drug trafficking \n        organizations into transnational criminal organizations, the \n        diversification of their illicit activities, and the systematic \n        implementation of insurgency tactics that undermines the \n        Mexican state and seeks to control the political space.\n            (7) The Merida Initiative has faced implementation \n        challenges and programmatic delays. A July 2010 Government \n        Accountability Office report highlighted Merida Initiative \n        delays associated with equipment deliveries as well as a lack \n        of clear benchmarks for programmatic success.\n            (8) The utilization of counterinsurgency tactics will focus \n        on isolating Mexican transnational criminal organizations from \n        their sources of power, such as drugs, money, human resources, \n        and weapons, while addressing both military and non-military \n        conditions and border conditions sustaining the insurgency, \n        including corruption, infighting, financing, and human support.\n            (9) The end goal of the coordinated and targeted strategy \n        is to protect United States citizens from external threats \n        through the empowering of a friendly and competent government \n        that operates within international laws and regulations and is \n        able to secure itself from internal threats.\n\nSEC. 4.
