SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``More Water, More \nEnergy, and Less Waste Act of 2007''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) development of energy resources, including oil, natural \n        gas, coalbed methane, and geothermal resources, frequently \n        results in bringing to the surface water extracted from \n        underground sources;\n            (2) some of that produced water is used for irrigation or \n        other purposes, but most of the water is returned to the \n        subsurface or otherwise disposed of as waste;\n            (3) reducing the quantity of produced water returned to the \n        subsurface and increasing the quantity of produced water that \n        is made available for irrigation and other uses--\n                    (A) would augment water supplies;\n                    (B) could reduce the costs to energy developers for \n                disposing of the water; and\n                    (C) in some cases, could increase the efficiency of \n                energy development activities; and\n            (4) it is in the national interest--\n                    (A) to limit the quantity of produced water \n                disposed of as waste;\n                    (B) to optimize the production of energy resources; \n                and\n                    (C) to remove or reduce obstacles to use of \n                produced water for irrigation or other purposes in ways \n                that will not adversely affect water quality or the \n                environment.\n    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to optimize the production of energy resources--\n                    (A) by minimizing the quantity of produced water; \n                and\n                    (B) by facilitating the use of produced water for \n                irrigation and other purposes without adversely \n                affecting water quality or the environment; and\n            (2) to demonstrate means of accomplishing those results.\n\nSEC. 2.
