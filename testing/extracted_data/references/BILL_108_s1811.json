FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Most studies of violence against women currently focus \n        on physical abuse or rape, primarily because they are easier to \n        identify and measure and are potentially lethal, however, \n        almost all battered women describe psychological abuse as the \n        most harmful.\n            (2) Most available research on violence against women has \n        focused on young to middle-aged white women living in the \n        community although available data shows that incarcerated \n        women, women living in poverty, women belonging to minority \n        ethnic and language groups, older women, and women with mental \n        and physical disabilities report especially high rates of \n        victimization.\n            (3) Victims of violence are at increased risk for a number \n        of physical and mental health problems, for example, in primary \n        care practice, women who have been raped report more symptoms \n        of illness and more negative health behaviors than \n        nonvictimized women.\n            (4) Effective methods for screening to identify women \n        affected by violence are prerequisite to understanding the \n        outcomes of abuse-sensitive medical care, for example, the \n        effect of medical attention to violence on perceived health \n        utilization of health services over time, and patient \n        satisfaction.\n            (5) Violence against women occurs in a sociocultural \n        context. More research should be conducted to identify \n        sociocultural factors that promote and maintain violence \n        against women and to learn how sociocultural factors, such as \n        gender roles and poverty, mediate the effects of interpersonal \n        victimization.\n            (6) There are a number of community-based and legal system \n        interventions available to victims of interpersonal violence. \n        However, there is little evaluation research on the \n        effectiveness of these interventions, especially for various \n        subpopulations of women. More research needs to be conducted on \n        the effectiveness of legal and community-based interventions, \n        not only those with the goal of changing the behavior of \n        assailants but also those with the goal of helping women take \n        safety-promoting actions.\n            (7) Much of the research on violence against women examines \n        continuing rates of physical or psychological abuse as outcome \n        measures and measures the behavior of the perpetrators, not \n        something over which the woman has direct and immediate \n        control. However, research on the women's attempts to manage \n        and end the violence in their lives is rare.\n            (8) Much of the extant research has focused on violence \n        against women in the streets (sexual assault) or in their homes \n        (domestic violence and battering). However, consistent focus on \n        violence against women in work-related (violence by partners in \n        these settings and by coworkers and colleagues) and educational \n        contexts has been more limited.\n\nSEC. 3. RESEARCH INITIATIVES.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 399O.
