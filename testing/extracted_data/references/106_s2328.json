FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the crime of identity theft has become one of the major \n        law enforcement challenges of the new economy, as vast \n        quantities of sensitive, personal information are now \n        vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;\n            (2) the United States Postal Inspection Service estimates \n        that 50,000 people a year have become victims of identity theft \n        since the mid-1990's;\n            (3) the United States Secret Service investigated identity \n        theft losses to individuals and institutions of $745,000,000 in \n        1997, a 75 percent increase over the $442,000,000 lost in 1995;\n            (4) according to TransUnion Corporation, a national credit \n        bureau, the total number of identity theft inquiries to its \n        Fraud Victim Assistance Department grew from 35,235 in 1992 to \n        522,922 in 1997;\n            (5) an integral part of many identity crimes is the \n        fraudulent acquisition of the social security number of an \n        individual;\n            (6) credit issuers, credit reporting agencies, and other \n        organizations with access to sensitive personal data have an \n        obligation to handle such information responsibly, and should \n        take affirmative steps to prevent identity criminals from \n        intercepting such information;\n            (7) identity theft causes extraordinary damage to its \n        victims, jeopardizing their access to needed credit and forcing \n        many to spend years trying to restore their good name;\n            (8) the resources available to identity theft victims are \n        inadequate, and both the private sector and Federal agencies \n        should provide better and more sympathetic assistance to such \n        victims;\n            (9) credit reporting agencies and credit issuers should \n        have uniform reporting requirements and effective fraud alerts \n        to assist identity theft victims in repairing and protecting \n        their credit; and\n            (10) consumers need greater access to information that is \n        collected about them so they can quickly identify fraudulent \n        activity.\n\nSEC. 3. CHANGES OF ADDRESS.\n\n    (a) Duty of Issuers of Credit.--Section 132 of the Truth in Lending \nAct (15 U.S.C. 1642) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``No \n        credit'';
