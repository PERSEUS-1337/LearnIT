FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) osteoporosis, or porous bone, is a condition \n        characterized by an excessive loss of bone tissue and an \n        increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine, and \n        wrist;\n            (2) osteoporosis is a threat to an estimated 25,000,000 \n        Americans, 80 percent of whom are women, many of whose cases go \n        undiagnosed because the condition develops without symptoms \n        until a strain, bump, or fall causes a fracture;\n            (3) between 3 and 4 million Americans have Paget's disease, \n        osteogenesis imperfecta, hyperparathyroidism, and other related \n        metabolic bone diseases;\n            (4) osteoporosis is responsible for 1,500,000 bone \n        fractures annually, including more than 250,000 hip fractures, \n        500,000 vertebral fractures, 200,000 fractures of the wrist, \n        and the remaining fractures at other limb sites;\n            (5) 1 of every 2 women and 1 of every 8 men over age 50 \n        will develop fractures associated with osteoporosis;\n            (6) direct medical costs of osteoporosis are estimated to \n        be $10,000,000,000 annually for the United States, not \n        including the costs of family care and lost work for \n        caregivers;\n            (7) direct medical costs of osteoporosis are expected to \n        increase precipitously because the proportion of the population \n        comprised of older persons is expanding and each generation of \n        older persons tends to have a higher incidence of osteoporosis \n        than preceding generations;\n            (8) technology now exists, and new technology is \n        developing, that will permit early diagnosis and prevention of \n        osteoporosis as well as management of the condition once it has \n        developed;\n            (9) funding for research on osteoporosis and related bone \n        diseases is severely constrained at key research institutes, \n        including the National Institute of Arthritis and \n        Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Institute on \n        Aging, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and \n        Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Dental Research, and \n        the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;\n            (10) further research is needed to improve medical \n        knowledge concerning--\n                    (A) cellular mechanisms related to the processes of \n                bone resorption and bone formation, and the effect of \n                different agents on bone remodeling;\n                    (B) risk factors for osteoporosis, including newly \n                discovered risk factors, risk factors related to groups \n                not ordinarily studied (such as men and minorities), \n                risk factors related to genes that help to control \n                skeletal metabolism, and risk factors relating to the \n                relationship of aging processes to the development of \n                osteoporosis;\n                    (C) bone mass measurement technology, including \n                more widespread and cost-effective techniques for \n                making more precise measurements and for interpreting \n                measurements;\n                    (D) calcium (including bioavailability, intake \n                requirements, and the role of calcium in building \n                heavier and denser skeletons), and vitamin D and its \n                role as an essential vitamin in adults;\n                    (E) prevention and treatment, including the \n                efficacy of current therapies, alternative drug \n                therapies for prevention and treatment, and the role of \n                exercise; and\n                    (F) rehabilitation; and\n            (11) further educational efforts are needed to increase \n        public and professional knowledge of the causes of, methods for \n        avoiding, and treatment of osteoporosis.\n\nSEC. 3. OSTEOPOROSIS RESEARCH.\n\n    Subpart 4 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 285d et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \nnew section:\n\n``SEC. 442A.
