SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Mentor Schools \nAct''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) while low-income students have made significant gains \n        with respect to educational achievement and attainment, \n        considerable gaps still persist for these students in \n        comparison to those from more affluent socio-economic \n        backgrounds;\n            (2) our Nation has a compelling interest in assuring that \n        all children receive a high quality education;\n            (3) new methods and experiments to revitalize the \n        educational achievement of, and opportunities for, low-income \n        individuals must be a part of any comprehensive solution to the \n        problems in our Nation's educational system;\n            (4) successful educational alternatives should be widely \n        implemented to better the education of low-income individuals;\n            (5) preliminary research shows that same gender schools \n        produce promising academic and behavioral improvements in both \n        sexes for low-income, educationally disadvantaged students;\n            (6) extensive data on same gender schools are needed to \n        determine whether same gender schools are closely tailored to \n        achieving the compelling government interest in assuring that \n        all children are educated to the best of their ability;\n            (7) in recent years efforts to experiment with same gender \n        schools have been inhibited by lawsuits and threats of lawsuits \n        by private groups as well as governmental entities; and\n            (8) same gender schools are a legal educational alternative \n        to coeducational schools and are not prohibited under the \n        regulations under title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n        (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), as such regulations were in effect on \n        the day preceding the date of enactment of this Act, so long \n        as--\n                    (A) comparable courses, services and facilities are \n                available to students of each sex; and\n                    (B) the same policies and criteria for admission to \n                such schools are used for both sexes.\n    (c) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to award grants to local educational agencies for the \n        establishment of same gender schools for low-income students;\n            (2) to determine whether same gender schools make a \n        difference in the educational achievement and opportunities of \n        low-income, educationally disadvantaged individuals;\n            (3) to improve academic achievement and persistence in \n        school; and\n            (4) to involve parents in the educational options and \n        choices of their children.\n\nSEC. 2.
