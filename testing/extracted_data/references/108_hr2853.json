    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Colombian Temporary Protected Status \nAct of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) Colombia has been embroiled in a 38-year internal \n        conflict, resulting in the death of tens of thousands civilians \n        and combatants;\n            (2) the 2 main armed antigovernment rebel groups, the \n        Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas \n        Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC) and the National \n        Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional, or ELN) \n        control, operate in, or influence 40 to 50 percent of \n        Colombia's territory;\n            (3) the FARC and ELN regularly attack civilian populations, \n        commit extrajudicial killings and massacres, collect war taxes, \n        compel civilians into their ranks, and engage in other coercive \n        practices against the civilian population, including the \n        growing of illicit crops;\n            (4) the main paramilitary groups, such as the United Self-\n        Defense Groups of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, or \n        AUC), have grown dramatically in recent years to become a major \n        national force, operating in nearly every department of the \n        country;\n            (5) the AUC and related paramilitary groups are \n        responsible, according to human rights groups, for over 70 \n        percent of extradjudicial killings and forced disappearances in \n        Colombia since 1995, and regularly attack civilian populations \n        and engage in other coercive practices against the civilian \n        population, including the growing of illicit crops;\n            (6) the FARC, ELN, and AUC, all designated by the \n        Department of State as foreign terrorist organizations, have an \n        estimated combined force of 35,000 combatants;\n            (7) according to Colombian and international refugee \n        organizations, the number of people newly displaced by \n        political violence increased by 30 percent from 317,340 in 2000 \n        to 412,000 in 2002, making Colombia's internally displaced \n        population of approximately 3 million people the second largest \n        population of internally displaced people in the world;\n            (8) Afro-Colombian communities, especially the largely \n        Afro-Colombian province of Choco, registered the highest \n        percentage of population displaced in 2002;\n            (9) according to Colombian and international human rights \n        organizations, the number of people killed or disappeared per \n        day increased from 14 in 2000 to 20 in 2002;\n            (10) according to the United Nations High Commissioner for \n        Human Rights 2003 Annual Report, direct violations by the \n        Colombian military increased in 2002;\n            (11) according to Colombian and international human rights \n        organizations and the State Department's own country reports, \n        significant collaboration between the AUC and related \n        paramilitary forces and the Colombian Armed Forces remain \n        persistent and pervasive, especially at the local, \n        departmental, and regional level;\n            (12) kidnappings, perpetrated mainly by the FARC, ELN and \n        criminal organizations, target mainly middle and upper classes \n        and political and business leaders, while declining from 3,706 \n        in 2000 to 2,986 in 2002, remain unacceptably high and affect \n        the daily security of the target populations;\n            (13) President Uribe has reduced by more than 50 percent \n        the budgets for the Colombian Human Rights Ombudsman Office (La \n        Procuraduria) and for local, regional and federal-level \n        attorneys and officers of the Colombian Human Rights Defenders \n        Office (Defensoria del Pueblo);\n            (14) investigations and prosecutions of human rights crimes \n        have stalled or been dismissed during the 2002-2003 tenure of \n        Colombian Attorney General Luis Camilo Osorio;\n            (15) there is little likelihood of a resumption of peace \n        negotiations between the Colombian government and the largest \n        rebel force, the FARC, following the collapse of talks in 2002; \n        and\n            (16) the violence of the war, which had been mostly \n        contained in rural areas prior to 2002, has now spread to urban \n        areas, with cities such as Medellin experiencing an average of \n        13 killings a day, is daily escalating with no foreseeable \n        relief in either rural or urban regions.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that, in view of the recent \nescalation of the current civil war in Colombia, Colombia qualifies for \ndesignation under section 244(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(1)(A)), pursuant to which Colombian \nnationals would be eligible for temporary protected status in the \nUnited States.\n\nSEC. 4. DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS \n              TO COLOMBIANS.\n\n    (a) Designation.--\n            (1) In general.--For purposes of section 244 of the \n        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a), Colombia \n        shall be treated as if it had been designated under subsection \n        (b) of that section, subject to the provisions of this section.\n            (2) Period of designation.--The initial period of such \n        designation shall begin on the date of enactment of this Act \n        and shall remain in effect for 2 years.\n    (b) Aliens Eligible.--In applying section 244 of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a) pursuant to the designation made \nunder this section, subject to section 244(c)(3) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(3)), an alien who is a national of \nColombia meets the requirements of section 244(c)(1) of that Act (8 \nU.S.C. 1254a(c)(1)) only if--\n            (1) the alien has been continuously physically present in \n        the United States since the date of enactment of this Act;\n            (2) the alien is admissible as an immigrant, except as \n        otherwise provided under section 244(c)(2)(A) of the \n        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(A)), and \n        is not ineligible for temporary protected status under section \n        244(c)(2)(B) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(B)); and\n            (3) the alien registers for temporary protected status in a \n        manner that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish.\n    (c) Consent to Travel Abroad.--The Secretary of Homeland Security \nshall give the prior consent to travel abroad described in section \n244(f)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(f)(3)) \nto an alien who is granted temporary protected status pursuant to the \ndesignation made under this section, if the alien establishes to the \nsatisfaction of the Secretary of Homeland Security that emergency and \nextenuating circumstances beyond the control of the alien require the \nalien to depart for a brief, temporary trip abroad. An alien returning \nto the United States in accordance with such an authorization shall be \ntreated the same as any other returning alien provided temporary \nprotected status under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (8 U.S.C. 1254a)."
