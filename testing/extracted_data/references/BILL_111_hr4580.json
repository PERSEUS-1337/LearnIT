FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In its January 2010 report card, the Commission on the \n        Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and \n        Terrorism stated that the Federal Government must ``become a \n        stronger advocate for citizen, community, state, and regional \n        preparedness to effectively respond'' to both natural disasters \n        and man-made events.\n            (2) The Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) is the \n        only program at the Federal level that supports the integration \n        of local emergency management, law enforcement, and health and \n        medical systems into a coordinated response to a mass casualty \n        event caused by a weapon of mass destruction, an incident \n        involving hazardous materials, an epidemic disease outbreak, or \n        a natural disaster.\n            (3) The MMRS program was established in the wake of the \n        1995 deadly release of sarin nerve gas in a Tokyo subway, and \n        the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma \n        City.\n            (4) The MMRS program aims to improve medical response \n        systems, by enhancing the existing local response systems and \n        capabilities of a community before an incident occurs.\n            (5) The MMRS program provides tangible benefits in the form \n        of increased operational capacity and communication, improved \n        personnel training, stockpiled pharmaceuticals, and adequate \n        supplies of personal protective equipment and other specialized \n        response equipment.\n            (6) The MMRS program supports a number of other existing \n        Federal programs, such as the Hospital Preparedness Program, \n        the Cities Readiness Initiative, the State Homeland Security \n        Program, and Urban Area Security Initiative.\n            (7) The MMRS program provides funding to 124 local \n        jurisdictions in 43 States, covering approximately 70 percent \n        of the United States population.\n            (8) The MMRS program has become an increasingly vital part \n        of our homeland security infrastructure in the wake of recent \n        influenza outbreaks, renewed terrorists threats, and severe \n        weather emergencies.\n\nSEC. 3.
