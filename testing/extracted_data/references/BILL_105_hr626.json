FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Federal Government has a responsibility to promote \n        the general welfare of the Nation by employing its resources to \n        remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the \n        acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for \n        families of lower income and by developing effective \n        partnerships with governmental and private entities to \n        accomplish these objectives.\n            (2) Based upon the status of the Kingdom of Hawaii as an \n        internationally recognized and independent sovereign and the \n        unique historical and political relationship between the United \n        States and Native Hawaiians, the Native Hawaiian people have a \n        continuing right to local autonomy in traditional and cultural \n        affairs and an ongoing right of self-determination and self-\n        governance that has never been extinguished.\n            (3) The authority of Congress under the Constitution of the \n        United States to legislate and address matters affecting the \n        rights of indigenous people of the United States includes the \n        authority to legislate in matters affecting Native Hawaiians.\n            (4) In 1921, in recognition of the severe decline in the \n        Native Hawaiian population, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes \n        Commission Act, 1920, which set aside approximately 200,000 \n        acres of the ceded public lands for homesteading by Native \n        Hawaiians, thereby affirming the special relationship between \n        the United States and the Native Hawaiians.\n            (5) In 1959, under the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for \n        the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', approved \n        March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States reaffirmed the \n        special relationship between the United States and the Native \n        Hawaiian people--\n                    (A) by transferring what the United States deemed \n                to be a trust responsibility for the administration of \n                the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of Hawaii, but \n                continuing Federal superintendence by retaining the \n                power to enforce the trust, including the exclusive \n                right of the United States to consent to land exchanges \n                and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission \n                Act, 1920, enacted by the legislature of the State of \n                Hawaii affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such \n                Act; and\n                    (B) by ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the \n                public lands formerly held by the United States, \n                mandating that such lands be held ``in public trust'' \n                for ``the betterment of the conditions of Native \n                Hawaiians, as defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission \nAct, 1920'', and continuing Federal superintendence by retaining the \nexclusive legal responsibility to enforce this public trust.\n            (6) In recognition of the special relationship that exists \n        between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people, \n        Congress has extended to Native Hawaiians the same rights and \n        privileges accorded to American Indians and Alaska Natives \n        under the Native American Programs Act of 1974, the American \n        Indian Religious Freedom Act, the National Museum of the \n        American Indian Act, the Native American Graves Protection and \n        Repatriation Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the \n        Native American Languages Act, the American Indian, Alaska \n        Native and Native Hawaiian Culture and Arts Development Act, \n        the Job Training and Partnership Act, and the Older Americans \n        Act of 1965.\n            (7) The special relationship has been recognized and \n        reaffirmed by the United States Congress in the area of \n        housing--\n                    (A) through the authorization of mortgage loans \n                insured by the Federal Housing Administration for the \n                purchase, construction, or refinancing of homes on \n                Hawaiian Home Lands under the National Housing Act;\n                    (B) by mandating Native Hawaiian representation on \n                the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska \n                Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing;\n                    (C) by the inclusion of Native Hawaiians in the \n                Native American Veterans' Home Loan Equity Act of 1993; \n                and\n                    (D) by enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands \n                Recovery Act, which establishes a process that enables \n                the Federal Government to convey lands to the \n                Department of Hawaiian Home Lands equivalent in value \n                to lands acquired by the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To implement the recommendation of the National \n        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n        Hawaiian Housing (in this Act referred to as the \n        ``Commission'') that Congress establish a Native Hawaiian \n        Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program to alleviate and \n        address the severe housing needs of Native Hawaiians by \n        extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available \n        to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n            (2) To address the following needs of the Native Hawaiian \n        population, as documented in the Final Report of the \n        Commission, ``Building the Future: A Blueprint for Change'' \n        (1992); the United States Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development report, ``Housing Problems and Needs of Native \n        Hawaiians (1995);'' and the State Department of Hawaiian Home \n        Lands report ``Department of Hawaiian Home Lands Beneficiary \n        Needs Study'' (1995):\n                    (A) Native Hawaiians experience the highest \n                percentage of housing problems in the Nation: 49 \n                percent, compared to 44 percent for American Indian and \n                Alaska Native households in tribal areas, and 27 \n                percent for all United States households, particularly \n                in the area of overcrowding (27 percent versus 3 \n                percent nationally) with 36 percent of Hawaiian \n                homelands households experiencing overcrowding.\n                    (B) Native Hawaiians have the worst housing \n                conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously \n                overrepresented in the State's homeless population, \n                representing over 30 percent.\n                    (C) Among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs \n                of the Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands \n                are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current \n                applicants, approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, are \n                in need of housing, with one-half of those applicant \n                households facing overcrowding and one-third paying \n                more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. Under \n                Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines, \n                70.8 percent of Department of Hawaiian Home Lands \n                lessees and applicants fall below the Department of \n                Housing and Urban Development median family income, \n                with more than half having incomes below 30 percent.\n\nSEC. 3.
