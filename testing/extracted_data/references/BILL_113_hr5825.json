FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public \n        Law 111-148) (in this section referred to as the ``Affordable \n        Care Act'') established certain taxpayer-funded subsidies, such \n        as premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions, that \n        directly or indirectly pay portions of the costs of health \n        insurance and services for eligible individuals and households.\n            (2) Diplomats of foreign governments and United Nations \n        staff members who are not citizens or lawful permanent \n        residents of the United States do not pay Federal income taxes \n        on their salaries from those employers.\n            (3) The Department of State has notified foreign missions \n        in the United States, permanent missions to the United Nations, \n        and the United Nations Secretariat that ``the benefits of the \n        United States Affordable Care Act are available'' to their \n        personnel.\n            (4) According to the Department of Health and Human \n        Services and the Congressional Research Service, foreign \n        diplomats and United Nations employees in the United States are \n        currently eligible to obtain United States taxpayer-funded \n        subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, such as premium tax \n        credits and cost-sharing reductions, on the same basis as \n        American citizens and lawful permanent residents.\n            (5) United States diplomats overseas do not depend on \n        foreign taxpayers for health care coverage, but rely on United \n        States-based health insurance plans that provide overseas \n        coverage.\n            (6) The Department of Health and Human Services does not \n        currently collect data that would allow it to identify any \n        foreign diplomats who are enrolled in a qualified health plan \n        and who may be receiving premium tax credits or cost-sharing \n        reductions pursuant to the Affordable Care Act.\n            (7) The Department of State also does not possess that \n        data, and has asserted that it is not involved in whatever \n        processes foreign diplomats may use to obtain benefits funded \n        by the United States Government.\n            (8) The Internal Revenue Service does not collect visa \n        information and is not currently able to discern whether any \n        taxpayer is present in the United States pursuant to an A \n        (diplomatic) or a G (UN/international organization) \n        nonimmigrant visa.\n            (9) The Internal Revenue Service also does not collect data \n        identifying whether a foreign diplomat is enrolled in a \n        qualified health plan and is receiving a premium tax credit or \n        cost-sharing reduction pursuant to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) foreign diplomats should be allowed to purchase health \n        insurance coverage in the United States, but the cost of that \n        coverage should be borne by their sending States; and\n            (2) United States taxpayers should not subsidize the health \n        insurance expenses of foreign diplomats.\n\nSEC. 4.
