FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The global proliferation of man-portable air defense \n        systems (MANPADS), other small arms and light weapons, and \n        tactical missile systems poses a direct threat to the national \n        security of the United States.\n            (2) The use of MANPADS and other small arms and light \n        weapons by terrorists and insurgent groups continues to hamper \n        United States efforts to achieve peace and security in Iraq and \n        Afghanistan.\n            (3) The proliferation of tactical missile systems provides \n        many regimes with a means of income and threatens international \n        peace and security.\n            (4) The Government Accountability Office has estimated that \n        there are between 500,000 and 750,000 MANPADS in the world.\n            (5) Many countries that possess stocks of MANPADS, other \n        conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems no longer \n        require such weapons for their own security or self defense, \n        but do not possess the means for the elimination or \n        safeguarding of such systems.\n            (6) There is currently no single United States program \n        designed to promote efforts in other countries related to \n        conventional arms threat reduction and the elimination of \n        tactical missiles.\n            (7) The Department of State has not used the \n        Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund for any activity to \n        eliminate any tactical missile systems since 2002.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) where appropriate, the United States Government should \n        provide assistance to countries seeking to secure, remove, or \n        eliminate stocks of MANPADS, other conventional weapons, and \n        tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat; and\n            (2) given the clear links between global networks of \n        terrorism and networks of the illicit trade in small arms and \n        light weapons, the United States Government should place \n        consistent, broad, and continued emphasis on combating the \n        proliferation of MANPADS, other small arms and light weapons, \n        and tactical missile systems within the broader \n        nonproliferation strategy of the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to assist the governments of \nother countries in safeguarding or eliminating stocks of MANPADS, other \nconventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a \nproliferation threat.\n\nSEC. 4.
