    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Gang Elimination Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The number of documented members of gangs located in \n        the United States has grown to over 800,000. This number is \n        larger than all but six armies in the world.\n            (2) Gangs run by international drug cartels represent a \n        clear and present danger to the national security of the United \n        States.\n            (3) Drug gangs have become one of the principle means of \n        importing and distributing illegal narcotics in the United \n        States.\n            (4) Drug gangs are now operating within suburban \n        communities. Some police departments and some sheriffs' offices \n        located in such communities are less prepared than police \n        departments and sheriffs' offices located in urban communities \n        to reduce this threat.\n            (5) The average recruit into a gang is in the seventh \n        grade.\n            (6) Gangs run by international drug cartels now number in \n        the hundreds of thousands, across city, State, and national \n        boundaries.\n            (7) Current efforts by municipal and State law enforcement \n        communities have not eliminated this threat to the Nation, law \n        and order, or to children.\n            (8) Only the Federal Government can muster the strategy, \n        resources, and intelligence to remove this growing danger to \n        the people in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO ELIMINATE THE ILLEGAL OPERATIONS OF THE \n              THREE INTERNATIONAL DRUG GANGS THAT PRESENT THE BIGGEST \n              THREAT IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, shall submit to Congress a report, in \nboth classified and unclassified form, setting forth a national \nstrategy to eliminate within the period that is four years after the \ndate of such submission the illegal operations of each National Threat \nDrug Gang designated under subsection (b). In addition to such \nstrategy, the report shall include the following information:\n            (1) A list identifying each of such National Threat Drug \n        Gangs.\n            (2) A description of the composition, operations, \n        strengths, and weaknesses of each of such National Threat Drug \n        Gangs.\n    (b) Designation of National Threat Drug Gangs.--In developing the \nnational strategy under subsection (a), the Attorney General shall \nidentify the top three international drug gangs that present the \ngreatest threat to law and order in the United States and shall \ndesignate each such gang as a ``National Threat Drug Gang''. For \npurposes of identifying such gangs, the Attorney General shall \nconsider--\n            (1) the extent to which, for the purpose of committing a \n        drug-related offense, the gang conducts activities with any \n        international terrorist organization or state designated by the \n        Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism, as compared \n        to the extent to which other international drug gangs conduct \n        such activities for such purpose;\n            (2) the volume of controlled substances (as defined in \n        section 102 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 802)) \n        that such gang imports to or distributes within the United \n        States, as compared to the volume of controlled substances that \n        other international drug gangs import to or distribute within \n        the United States; and\n            (3) the extent to which the gang is a threat to children \n        and schools within the United States, as compared to the extent \n        to which other international drug gangs are such a threat.\n    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) Drug gang.--The term ``drug gang'' means an ongoing \n        group, club, organization, or association of 50 or more \n        individuals--\n                    (A) that has as one of its primary purposes the \n                commission of one or more drug-related offenses;\n                    (B) the members of which engage, or have engaged \n                within the past five years, in a continuing series of \n                drug-related offenses; and\n                    (C) the activities of which--\n                            (i) include crimes of violence, as defined \n                        in section 16 of title 18, United States Code \n                        (including rape); and\n                            (ii) affect interstate or foreign commerce.\n            (2) Drug-related offense.--The term ``drug-related \n        offense'' means--\n                    (A) a Federal felony involving a controlled \n                substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled \n                Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)) for which the maximum \n                penalty is not less than 5 years, including a crime \n                involving the manufacturing, importing, distributing, \n                dispensing, or possessing with the intent to \n                manufacture, distribute, or dispense such a controlled \n                substance; and\n                    (B) a conspiracy to commit an offense described in \n                subparagraph (A).\n            (3) International drug gang.--The term ``international drug \n        gang'' means a drug gang that--\n                    (A) conducts activities that affect foreign \n                commerce; or\n                    (B) conspires with another drug gang that conducts \n                activities that affect foreign commerce."
