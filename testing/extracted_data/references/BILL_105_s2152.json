FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 1,000,000,000 people in the developing world \n        are living in severe poverty.\n            (2) According to the United Nations Children's Fund, the \n        mortality for children under the age of 5 is 10 percent in all \n        developing countries and nearly 20 percent in the poorest \n        countries.\n            (3) Nearly 33,000 children die each day from malnutrition \n        and disease which is largely preventable.\n            (4)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads \n        and less access to educational and economic opportunities than \n        their male counterparts.\n            (B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially \n        women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only \n        on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health, and \n        education, since women tend to reinvest income in their \n        families.\n            (5)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly \n        women, generally lack stable employment and social safety nets.\n            (B) Many women turn to self-employment to generate a \n        substantial portion of their livelihood.\n            (C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty \n        because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to build \n        their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-\n        employment activities.\n            (D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as \n        high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.\n            (6)(A) On February 2-4, 1997, an international Microcredit \n        Summit was held in Washington, D.C., to launch a plan to expand \n        access to credit for self-employment and other financial and \n        business services to 100,000,000 of the world's poorest \n        families, especially the women of those families, by 2005.\n            (B) With an average of 5 people to a family, achieving this \n        goal will mean that the benefits of microcredit will reach \n        nearly half of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 absolute \n        poor.\n            (7)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their \n        businesses dramatically when they have access to loans at \n        reasonable interest rates.\n            (B) Through the development of self-sustaining microcredit \n        programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against \n        hunger and poverty.\n            (8)(A) Nongovernmental organizations such as the Grameen \n        Bank, Accion International, and the Foundation for \n        International Community Assistance (FINCA) have been successful \n        in lending directly to the very poor.\n            (B) These institutions generate repayment rates averaging \n        95 percent or higher.\n            (9)(A) Microcredit institutions not only reduce poverty, \n        but also reduce the dependency on foreign assistance.\n            (B) Interest income on a credit portfolio can be used to \n        pay recurring institutional costs, assuring that the long-term \n        development is sustained.\n            (10) Microcredit institutions leverage foreign assistance \n        resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits \n        to program participants.\n            (11) The development of sustainable microcredit \n        institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize \n        domestic savings, are critical to a global strategy of poverty \n        reduction and broad-based economic development.\n            (12)(A) In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative \n        in consultation with Congress.\n            (B) The Initiative was committed to expanding funding for \n        AID's microenterprise programs, provided funding of \n        $137,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, and set a goal that, by the \n        end of fiscal year 1996, half of all microenterprise resources \n        would support programs and institutions providing credit to the \npoorest with loans under $300.\n            (C) In fiscal year 1996, total funding for microenterprise \n        activities fell to $111,000,000 of which only 39 percent was \n        used for programs benefiting the poorest with loans under $300.\n            (D) Increased investment in microcredit institutions \n        serving the poorest is critical to achieving the Microcredit \n        Summit's goal.\n            (E) AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the \n        developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal \n        year 1999 to parallel the growing capacity of microcredit \n        institutions in the developing world.\n            (13) Providing the United States share of the global \n        investment needed to achieve the goal of the Microcredit Summit \n        will require only a modest increase in United States funding \n        for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus \n        on institutions serving the poorest.\n            (14)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest \n        with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate \n        successful microcredit institutions.\n            (B) Microcredit institutions need assistance in developing \n        their institutional capacity to expand their services and tap \n        commercial sources of capital.\n            (15) PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations have \n        demonstrated competence in developing networks of local \n        microcredit institutions that can reach large numbers of the \n        very poor, and help the very poor achieve financial \n        sustainability.\n            (16) Since AID has developed very effective partnerships \n        with PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations, AID should \n        place a priority on investing in PVOs and other nongovernmental \n        organizations through AID's central funding mechanisms.\n            (17) By expanding and replicating successful microcredit \n        institutions, AID should be able to assure the creation of a \n        global infrastructure to provide financial services to the \n        world's poorest families.\n            (18)(A) AID can provide leadership among bilateral and \n        multilateral development aid agencies as such agencies expand \n        their support of microenterprise for the poorest.\n            (B) AID should seek to improve the coordination of efforts \n        at the operational level to promote the best practices for \n        providing financial services to the poor and to ensure that \n        adequate institutional capacity is developed.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide for the continuation and expansion of AID's \n        commitment to develop microcredit institutions;\n            (2) to make microenterprise development the centerpiece of \n        the overall economic growth strategy of AID;\n            (3) to support and develop the capacity of United States \n        PVOs, and other international nongovernmental organizations to \n        provide credit, savings, and training services to \n        microentrepreneurs; and\n            (4) to increase the amount of assistance devoted to \n        providing access to credit for the poorest sector in developing \n        countries, particularly women.\n\nSEC. 3.
