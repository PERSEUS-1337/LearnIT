FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Voice of America (VoA) is now implementing the \n        NewsNow format, which broadcasts news repetitively in a \n        continuous cycle.\n            (2) The NewsNow format forces most VoA coverage of American \n        thought and institutions, as required by the VoA Charter, to be \n        accommodated within that structured news cycle.\n            (3) The NewsNow format is insufficient to present fully the \n        policies of the United States as clearly and effectively as the \n        VoA Charter mandate anticipates.\n            (4) The implementation of the VoA Charter's mandate to \n        present United States policies has traditionally and \n        appropriately been fulfilled by airing editorials.\n            (5) Editorials offer the prudential and principled \n        rationales for United States policy to radio listeners and \n        television viewers and should not be marginalized in any VoA \n        programming format.\n            (6) The television program ``On the Line'' produced by the \n        VoA is an example of a suitable vehicle for fulfilling the VoA \n        Charter's mandate to present United States policies.\n            (7) Television is an increasing important form of United \n        States Government-sponsored broadcasting worldwide.\n            (8) The Broadcasting Board of Governors plans to complete \n        soon a merger of the Worldnet television broadcasting into VoA.\n            (9) Explicit treatment of American thought, institutions, \n        and policies needs to be sustained in United States Government-\n        sponsored television broadcasting.\n\nSEC. 3.
