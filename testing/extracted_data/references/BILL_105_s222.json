FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States often suffers serious economic and \n        environmental losses from severe regional droughts and there is \n        no coordinated Federal strategy to respond to such emergencies;\n            (2) at the Federal level, even though historically there \n        have been frequent, significant droughts of national \n        consequences, drought is addressed mainly through special \n        legislation and ad hoc action rather than through a systematic \n        and permanent process as occurs with other natural disasters;\n            (3) several Federal agencies have a role in drought from \n        predicting, forecasting, and monitoring of drought conditions \n        to the provision of planning, technical, and financial \n        assistance;\n            (4) there has never been one single Federal agency in a \n        lead or coordinating role with regard to drought;\n            (5) the State, local, and tribal governments have had to \n        deal individually and separately with each Federal agency \n        involved in drought assistance; and\n            (6) the President should appoint an advisory commission to \n        provide advice and recommendations on the creation of an \n        integrated, coordinated Federal policy designed to prepare for \n        and respond to serious drought emergencies.\n\nSEC. 3.
