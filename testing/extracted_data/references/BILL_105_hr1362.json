and\n                    (B) decreased by the amount of the decrease (if \n                any) in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans \n                for that fiscal year (relative to the preceding fiscal \n                year) that, as estimated by the Secretaries, results \n                from--\n                            (i) a rate of increase in the level of \n                        medical care appropriations for the Department \n                        of Veterans Affairs described in subparagraph \n                        (A) that is less than the general rate of \n                        increase in health care costs;
