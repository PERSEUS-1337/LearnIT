FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States is an Arctic Nation with--\n                    (A) an approximately 700-mile border with the \n                Arctic Ocean;\n                    (B) more than 100,000,000 acres of land above the \n                Arctic Circle; and\n                    (C) a broader area within the Arctic isotherm that \n                encompasses most of the Bering Sea.\n            (2) The Arctic region of the United States--\n                    (A) is home to an indigenous population which has \n                subsisted for millennia on the abundance in marine \n                mammals, fish, and wildlife, many of which are unique \n                to the region;\n                    (B) is known to the indigenous population as \n                Inuvikput or the ``place where we live''; and\n                    (C) has produced more than 16,000,000,000 barrels \n                of oil and, according to the United States Geological \n                Survey, may hold an additional 30,000,000,000 barrels \n                of oil and 220,000,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural \n                gas, making the region of fundamental importance to the \n                national interest of the United States.\n            (3) Temperatures in the United States Arctic region have \n        warmed by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius over the past half-century, a \n        rate of increase that is twice the global average.\n            (4) The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing and \n        thinning, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration estimates the Arctic Ocean may be ice free \n        during summer months in as few as 30 years.\n            (5) Such changes to the Arctic region are having a \n        significant impact on the indigenous people of the Arctic, \n        their communities and ecosystems, as well as the marine \n        mammals, fish, and wildlife upon which they depend.\n            (6) Such changes are opening new portions of the United \n        States Arctic continental shelf to possible development for \n        offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and \n        tourism.\n            (7) Unprecedented storms over an area of Arctic waters that \n        are now ice-free are eroding sections of Alaska shoreline at \n        rates of 45 feet or more annually. Thawing permafrost is \n        causing roads and the foundations of public buildings and homes \n        to buckle. Entire Alaskan Arctic villages are at risk of \n        serious erosion or of being washed into the sea.\n            (8) As many as 4 of Alaska's coastal villages are at \n        immediate risk and will face overwhelming relocation costs in \n        the during the period from 2009 through 2014 as the lack of \n        winter ice pack allows increased wave energy to erode \n        beachfronts that are no longer held together by frozen soil. \n        The Government Accountability Office estimates that relocation \n        costs for those 4 villages will be $450,000,000 and that as \n        many as 30 additional Alaskan coastal villages will face \n        similar threats during the period from 2009 through 2019.\n            (9) A study conducted by the Government Accountability \n        Office published in June 2009, states that ``most of Alaska's \n        more than 200 Native villages were affected to some degree by \n        flooding and erosion,'' and recommends that ``Congress may wish \n        to consider designating or creating a lead Federal entity that \n        could work in conjunction with the lead state agency to \n        coordinate and oversee village relocation efforts''.\n            (10) A 2009 study by the University of Alaska's Institute \n        for Social and Economic Research concluded that the added \n        adaptation costs for Alaska's public infrastructure resulting \n        from climate change impacts will range up to $6,000,000,000 by \n        2030.\n            (11) Coastal erosion and thawing permafrost threaten the \n        public infrastructure, including airports which are often the \n        only link to the outside world, roadways, and other basic \n        utilities, of many of Alaska's 267 incorporated communities, \n        with an estimated adaptation cost in the tens of billions of \n        dollars during the several decades following the date of the \n        enactment of this Act.\n            (12) Additionally, rising ocean temperatures and increased \n        ocean acidification result in changes in fish habitats and \n        invasive fish species jeopardizing both Alaska's commercial \n        fisheries, which produce 60 percent of the United States \n        commercial catch, and the subsistence hunting, fishing, and \n        gathering that supplies as much as 90 percent of the protein \n        supply for as many as 214 economically disadvantaged Alaskan \n        Native villages from Metlakatla in the south to Point Barrow in \n        the north.\n\nSEC. 3.
