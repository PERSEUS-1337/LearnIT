STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds that--\n            (1) more businesses are promoting disease prevention, \n        healthy lifestyles, and good nutrition through wellness \n        programs than did so in the past;\n            (2) businesses can save on insurance premiums and reduce \n        the number of health insurance claims filed by their employees \n        if employees would participate in a wellness program;\n            (3) wellness programs lead to lower health care costs, \n        reduced absenteeism, increased productivity, and higher morale;\n            (4) one of the Healthy People 2000 national health \n        objectives is to have disease prevention and health promotion \n        programs in at least 85 percent of worksites with 50 or more \n        employees;\n            (5) a recent survey conducted by the Office of Disease \n        Prevention and Health Promotion reported that 81 percent of \n        companies with 50 or more employees had at least 1 health \n        promotion activity in 1992 compared with 66 percent in 1985; \n        and\n            (6) small businesses have less money to devote to employee \n        benefits and therefore shall be given greater incentives to \n        invest in wellness programs for their employees.\n\nSEC. 3.
