    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``San Francisco Bay Shipping and \nFisheries Enhancement Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) San Francisco Bay is a vital environmental, industrial, \n        and recreational resource to the San Francisco Bay area and to \n        the Nation.\n            (2) Over 800 tank vessels enter San Francisco Bay each \n        year, carrying hundreds of millions of gallons of oil and other \n        hazardous substances.\n            (3) The small oil spill of October 28, 1996, showed that \n        current safeguards against oil pollution are inadequate, and \n        that even small oil spills in San Francisco Bay are both costly \n        to mitigate and harmful to the environment, including fish, \n        mammals, and birds.\n            (4) Because of the bathymetry of San Francisco Bay, the \n        Coast Guard has been unable to make needed improvements in the \n        routing of tankers and other deep draft vessels.\n            (5) The presence of multiple underwater hazards less than \n        40 feet below the surface and in close proximity to shipping \n        lanes, combined with increased traffic of tankers with drafts \n        in excess of 45 feet, significantly increase the likelihood of \n        collisions that would result in the release of substantial \n        amounts of oil or other hazardous substances, severely damaging \n        both the economy and the environment of the San Francisco Bay \n        area.\n            (6) Removing hazards to navigation to allow greater \n        separation of vessels carrying oil or other hazardous \n        substances is a simple and economical step that can be taken to \n        reduce substantially the risk of oil pollution, improve the \n        safety of navigation, and reduce threats to the fish, wildlife, \n        and environment of San Francisco Bay.\n\nSEC. 3. NAVIGATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Army shall develop and carry \nout in accordance with this section a navigation project in San \nFrancisco Bay, California, to remove underwater hazards to navigation \nin the vicinity of Alcatraz Island.\n    (b) Rerouting of Vessel Traffic.--The Secretary shall design the \nnavigation project under this section to facilitate the rerouting of \nvessel traffic in San Francisco Bay to minimize the risk of an oil or \nhazardous substance spill resulting from collisions between vessels or \nwith an underwater hazard.\n    (c) Minimization of Impact.--In developing and carrying out the \nnavigation project under this section, the Secretary shall minimize, to \nthe maximum extent practicable, impacts on the environment and on \ncommercial and recreational fisheries.\n    (d) Plan.--\n            (1) General requirement.--In consultation with appropriate \n        Federal, State, and local government agencies and in accordance \n        with applicable Federal and State environmental laws, the \n        Secretary shall develop a plan for implementation of the \n        navigation project under this section.\n            (2) Contents.--The plan shall include initial design and \n        engineering, underwater hazard removal, and, if needed, \n        environmental mitigation.\n            (3) Target dates.--\n                    (A) Feasibility study.--The first phase of the plan \n                shall be completed within 1 year of the date of the \n                enactment of this Act and shall consist of a \n                feasibility study for the project described in \n                subsection (a). The feasibility study shall include \n                scoping, development of alternative designs for the \n                project, cost/benefit analysis, and selection of final \n                project design. In conducting the cost/benefit analysis \n                and selecting a final project design, the Secretary \n                shall consider the economic and environmental benefits \n                of oil spill aversion reasonably to be expected from \n                the completion of the project.\n                    (B) Implementation.--The second phase of the plan \n                shall be completed not later than 3 years after the \n                date of the enactment of this Act and shall consist of \n                underwater hazard removal, transportation, and disposal \n                of the removed material in accordance with the final \n                project design.\n                    (C) Mitigation and monitoring.--The final phase of \n                the plan shall consist of any mitigation needed due to \n                environmental impacts, and environmental monitoring of \n                removal, disposal, and mitigation sites (if different \n                from the disposal site or sites), shall commence as \n                soon as is practicable after the completion of the \n                implementation phase, and shall continue for not less \n                than 5 years thereafter.\n    (e) Non-Federal Participation.--The non-Federal share of the cost \nof developing and carrying out the project under this section shall be \n25 percent.\n    (f) Reports to Congress.--Not later than the last day of each of \nthe time periods referred to in subsection (d)(3), the Secretary shall \nreport to Congress on the progress being made toward development and \nimplementation of the project under this section.\n\nSEC. 4. MODIFICATION OF NAVIGATION LANES.\n\n    The Commandant of the Coast Guard shall modify navigation lanes and \nreroute vessel traffic after the completion of the second phase of the \nnavigation project required by section 3 to improve the safety and \nefficiency of vessel traffic in San Francisco Bay, California. In \ncarrying out this section, the Commandant shall develop a vessel \nrouting program that minimizes the risk of an oil or hazardous \nsubstance spill in San Francisco Bay.\n\nSEC. 5. OIL SPILL RISK ASSESSMENT.\n\n    (a) Survey.--In consultation with the Federal Maritime \nAdministration, the Commandant of the Coast Guard shall survey vessels \nowned by, or operated under contract for, the Federal Maritime \nAdministration for risks for oil spills or other hazards to human \nhealth or the environment.\n    (b) Standards and Procedures.--In surveying vessels under this \nsection, the Commandant shall use the same standards and procedures as \nare used in inspecting similarly situated private vessels.\n    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, the Commandant shall submit to Congress and the \nAdministrator of the Federal Maritime Administration a report \ndescribing any oil spill risks determined in the survey conducted under \nthis section and making recommendations for corrective actions for such \nrisks, including estimates of the costs of those actions.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    For fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1997, there are \nauthorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Army and the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard such sums as may be necessary to carry \nout their respective duties under this Act. Such sums shall remain \navailable until expended."
