FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Sponsors and promoters of major music, sporting, and \n        theatrical events are increasingly seeking to control the \n        resale of tickets to such events in the secondary market, by \n        employing restrictive State laws, imposing and enforcing \n        onerous contractual or license terms, and imposing \n        technological barriers on ticket resale.\n            (2) Such restrictions and downstream controls substantially \n        impede interstate commerce in event tickets, drive up ticket \n        prices, reduce availability of tickets to interested \n        purchasers, narrow the choices available to the public, and are \n        unfair to consumers.\n            (3) Eliminating such restrictions and applying free market \n        principles to the secondary market in event tickets would \n        encourage a robust competitive marketplace in such tickets, \n        would promote the healthy growth of electronic commerce in such \n        tickets in online marketplaces, and would be in the best \n        interests of ticket purchasers, fans, and the general public.\n            (4) Purchasers of event tickets, whether in the primary or \n        secondary ticket markets, are entitled to minimum consumer \n        protection standards, including provisions for full refunds of \n        ticket purchases in appropriate circumstances.\n            (5) In order to achieve a nationwide free market in resale \n        of event tickets, Congress must act to preempt State or local \n        laws that unjustifiably restrict such resales, while preserving \n        State and local authority to legislate or regulate to prevent \n        fraud, maintain public order, or vindicate other legitimate \n        State and local interests.\n\nSEC. 3.
