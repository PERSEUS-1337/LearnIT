FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Department of State's 2004 Country Reports on Human \n        Rights Practices for Uzbekistan states the following:\n                    (A) ``Uzbekistan is an authoritarian state with \n                limited civil rights . . . President Islam Karimov and \n                the centralized executive branch that serves him \n                dominated political life and exercised nearly complete \n                control over the other branches . . . The Government is \n                highly centralized and is ruled by President Karimov \n                and the executive branch through sweeping decree \n                powers, primary authority for drafting legislation, and \n                control of government appointments, most of the \n                economy, and the security forces.''.\n                    (B) ``On December 26, [2004,] elections were held \n                for seats in the lower chamber of the Supreme Assembly \n                (Oliy Majlis) that fell significantly short of \n                international standards for democratic elections . . . \n                Citizens could not exercise the right to change their \n                government peacefully . . . The law makes it extremely \n                difficult for opposition parties to organize, nominate \n                candidates, and campaign.''.\n                    (C) ``Police and, to a lesser extent, NSS [National \n                Security Service] forces tortured, beat, and harassed \n                persons . . . Members of the security forces \n                responsible for documented abuses were rarely punished \n                . . . Police, prison officials, and the NSS allegedly \n                used suffocation, electric shock, rape, and other \n                sexual abuse; however, beating was the most commonly \n                reported method of torture.''.\n                    (D) ``The number of persons in prison for political \n                or religious reasons--primarily persons the Government \n                believed were associated with extremist Islamist \n                political groups, but also members of the secular \n                opposition and human rights activists--was estimated to \n                be between 5,000 and 5,500.''.\n                    (E) ``The Government severely restricted freedom of \n                speech and the press, and an atmosphere of repression \n                stifled public criticism of the Government.''.\n                    (F) ``The Government continued to deny registration \n                to several independent domestic human rights groups and \n                increased pressure on unregistered groups . . . The \n                Government denied the registration applications of two \n                opposition political parties. The Government harassed \n                and abused members of domestic human rights groups.''.\n                    (G) ``The Government restricted freedom of religion \n                and harassed individuals suspected of belonging to \n                extremist groups; several hundred were arrested. The \n                Government limited the activities of minority \n                religions.''.\n                    (H) ``The public generally did not have access to \n                Government information, and information normally \n                considered in the public domain, such as prosecutions \n                for corruption or official malfeasance, were seldom \n                reported.''.\n            (2) On May 13, 2005, security forces of the Government of \n        Uzbekistan conducted a brutal and indiscriminate assault on \n        thousands of demonstrators and onlookers in the city of \n        Andijan, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and many more \n        injuries.\n            (3) The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights \n        of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n        (OSCE) stated in its ``Preliminary Findings on the Events in \n        Andijan, Uzbekistan, 13 May 2005'' that many of the protestors \n        ``spoke about social and economic problems (lack of \n        transparency, corruption in the government, unfair trials, \n        abuse by police, unemployment, taxation, etc) . . . this also \n        attracted others to the square''.\n            (4) The Government of Uzbekistan has imprisoned dozens of \n        individuals who participated in peaceful demonstrations and \n        continues to engage in widespread arrests in the aftermath of \n        the May 13, 2005, assault.\n            (5) The Government of Uzbekistan has consistently denied \n        that a massacre in Andijan took place, expelled local and \n        foreign journalists from the region, and has refused to open \n        the area to a full and independent investigation into the \n        violence.\n            (6) Following the massacre in Andijan, hundreds of Uzbek \n        citizens fled to neighboring Kyrgyzstan, which faces pressure \n        from the Uzbek Government to quickly return them, despite well-\n        grounded concerns that they may be arrested and tortured upon \n        their return, and where, although protected as refugees under \n        international law, they have been targeted by Uzbek authorities \n        for illegal repatriation and face continued threat from Uzbek \n        security services operating in southern Kyrgyzstan.\n            (7) In June 2005, the United States, the European Union \n        (EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United \n        Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the \n        Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe called for \n        a credible independent international inquiry into the recent \n        violence in Andijan and urged the Government of Uzbekistan to \n        prosecute those responsible for civilian deaths.\n            (8) A July 12, 2005, report by the United Nations High \n        Commissioner for Human Rights states that ``consistent, \n        credible eyewitness testimony strongly suggests that grave \n        human rights violations, mostly of the right to life, were \n        committed by Uzbek military and security forces . . . It is not \n        excluded--judging from the accounts of the eyewitnesses \n        interviewed--that the incidents amounted to a mass killing . . \n        .'' in Andijan and reiterates a call for an independent \n        international probe.\n            (9) In July 2004, after a Department of State review of \n        democratization in Uzbekistan, former Secretary of State Colin \n        Powell determined that the Government of Uzbekistan was not \n        fulfilling the terms of a 2002 Strategic Partnership Framework \n        agreement that mandated ``substantial and continuing progress'' \n        on democratization, and accordingly, he did not certify \n        Uzbekistan as eligible to receive certain United States \n        assistance.\n            (10) By continuing to suppress human rights and to deny \n        citizens peaceful, democratic means of expressing their \n        convictions, the Government of Uzbekistan risks fueling popular \n        support for violent and extremist movements.\n            (11) President George W. Bush, in his second Inaugural \n        Address, stated that the United States ``will persistently \n        clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The \n        moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and \n        freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend \n        that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women \n        welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being \n        aspires to live at the mercy of bullies. We will encourage \n        reform in other governments by making clear that success in our \n        relations will require the decent treatment of their own \n        people.''.\n            (12) Congress has repeatedly expressed its desire to see \n        deeper reform in Uzbekistan and has conditioned certain United \n        States assistance to the Government of Uzbekistan on its \n        progress in meeting human rights and democracy commitments made \n        to the United States.\n            (13) After expressions of concern by representatives of the \n        Administration and Congress about the massacre at Andijan, the \n        Government of Uzbekistan has restricted the use of the airbase \n        at Karshi-Khanabad by United States military forces.\n            (14) On July 5, 2005, the Government of Uzbekistan joined \n        the Governments of the Russian Federation, the People's \n        Republic of China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan in \n        calling on countries involved in Coalition operations in \n        Afghanistan to set a deadline for ending their use of airfields \n        and other military presence in Central Asia.\n            (15) On July 7, 2005, the Government of Uzbekistan \n        indicated that it was reconsidering the use by the United \n        States of the Karshi-Khanabad airbase.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress the actions of the Government of \nUzbekistan in general and in the case of the Andijan massacre \nspecifically--\n            (1) are reprehensible, totalitarian, and unbecoming of an \n        ally of the United States;\n            (2) are counterproductive to the United States goals of \n        promoting freedom and democracy; and\n            (3) justify an end to United States assistance for, and an \n        increase in restrictions on, the Government of Uzbekistan until \n        it accelerates democratic reforms and fulfills its human rights \n        obligations.\n\nSEC. 4.
