SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Family and Medical \nLeave Clarification Act''.\n    (b) References.--Whenever in this Act an amendment is expressed in \nterms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, \nthe reference shall be considered to be made to that section or other \nprovision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.\n    (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; references; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Definition of serious health condition.\nSec. 4. Intermittent leave.\nSec. 5. Request for leave.\nSec. 6. Substitution of paid leave.\nSec. 7. Regulations.\nSec. 8. Effective date.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (in this \n        section referred to as the ``Act'') is not working as Congress \n        intended when it passed the Act in 1993. Many employers, \n        including those nationally recognized as having generous \n        family-friendly benefit and leave programs, are experiencing \n        serious problems complying with the Act.\n            (2) The Department of Labor's overly broad regulations and \n        interpretations have caused many of these problems by greatly \n        expanding the Act's coverage to apply to many non-serious \n        health conditions.\n            (3) Documented problems generated by the Act include \n        significant new administrative and personnel costs, loss of \n        productivity and scheduling difficulties, unnecessary paperwork \n        and record keeping, and other compliance problems.\n            (4) The Act often conflicts with employers' existing paid \n        sick leave policies and prevent employers from managing \n        absences through their absence control plans and results in \n        most leave under the Act becoming paid leave.\n            (5) The Commission on Leave, established in title III of \n        the Act, which reported few difficulties with compliance with \n        the Act, failed to identify many of the problems with \n        compliance because its study was conducted too soon after the \n        enactment of the Act and the most significant problems with \n        compliance arose only when employers later sought to comply \n        with the Act's final regulations and interpretations.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION.\n\n    (a) Amendment.--Section 101(11) (29 U.S.C. 2611(11)) is amended by \nadding after and below subparagraph (B) the following:\n        ``The term `serious health condition' does not cover short-term \n        conditions for which treatment and recovery are very brief. \n        Conditions covered include, for example, heart attacks, heart \n        conditions requiring extensive therapy or surgical procedures, \n        strokes, severe respiratory conditions, spinal injuries, \n        appendicitis, pneumonia, emphysema, severe arthritis, severe \n        nervous disorders, injuries caused by serious accidents on or \n        off the job, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriages, complications or \n        illnesses related to pregnancy, such as severe morning \n        sickness, the need for prenatal care, childbirth, and recovery \n        from childbirth.''.\n    (b) Regulations.--\n            (1) Repeal.--The regulations of the Secretary of Labor, \n        published at sections 825.114 and 825.115 of title 29 of the \n        Code of Federal Regulations, and opinion letters promulgated \n        thereunder shall be null and void on the effective date of \n        final regulations issued under paragraph (2).\n            (2) New regulations.--The Secretary of Labor shall revise \n        the regulations referred to in paragraph (1) and shall issue \n        proposed regulations making such revision not later than 90 \n        days after the date of enactment of this Act and shall issue \n        final regulations not later than 180 days after such date of \n        enactment.\n            (3) Transition.--With respect to leave and requests for \n        leave made under section 102 of the Family and Medical Leave \n        Act of 1993 occurring before the effective date of the final \n        regulations under paragraph (2), an employer may rely on the \n        regulations of the Secretary referred to in paragraph (1). In \n        any action to enforce the requirements of such Act pending on \n        or after the effective date of such final regulations, no \n        provision of the regulations referred to in paragraph (1) may \n        be cited as evidence of an employer's non-compliance with such \n        Act.\n\nSEC. 4.

Employers may require \nemployees who travel as part of their normal day-to-day work or duty \nassignments to take leave for the duration of that work or assignment \nif the employer cannot reasonably accommodate the employee's request to \ntake leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule.''.\n\nSEC. 5.

If required by the employer, an employee who \nfails to make such a timely request may be denied leave under this \ntitle.\n            ``(4) Timeliness of request for leave.--As used in \n        paragraph (3) of this subsection, a request for leave is timely \n        if--\n                    ``(A) in the case of foreseeable leave, the \n                employee provides the applicable advance notice \n                required by subsection (e) and submits any written \n                application required by the employer within 5 working \n                days of providing the notice to the employer; and\n                    ``(B) in the case of unforeseeable leave, the \n                employee notifies the employer verbally of the need for \n                the leave no later than the time the leave commences \n                and submits any written application required by the \n                employer within 5 working days of providing the notice \n                to the employer, except that the 5-day period will be \n                extended as necessary if the employee is physically or \n                mentally incapable of providing notice or submitting \n                the application.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
