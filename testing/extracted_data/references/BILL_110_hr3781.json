FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the promotion of the biodiesel industry of the United \n        States is a critical component of an energy policy that reduces \n        dependence on foreign sources of petroleum;\n            (2) a strong biodiesel industry will--\n                    (A) significantly enhance the energy security of \n                the United States; and\n                    (B) promote economic development and job creation \n                (particularly in rural areas of the United States), \n                while providing environmental, health, and greenhouse \n                gas reduction benefits;\n            (3) a federally-implemented biodiesel standard will result \n        in the most efficient pricing for biodiesel across the United \n        States;\n            (4) it is critical to ensure that only high quality \n        biodiesel is dispensed;\n            (5) biodiesel contributes to cleaner air and lifecycle \n        reductions of greenhouse gases;\n            (6) biodiesel is an environmentally safe fuel, and is the \n        most viable transportation fuel when measuring its carbon \n        footprint, life cycle and energy balance;\n            (7) the United States Department of Agriculture lifecycle \n        study shows a 78.4 percent reduction in lifecycle CO2 for B100;\n            (8) 1 billion gallons of biodiesel will reduce current life \n        cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 16.12 billion pounds, the \n        equivalent of removing 1.4 million passenger vehicles from \n        America's roads; and\n            (9) in 2006 alone, biodiesel's contribution to reducing \n        greenhouse gas emissions was equal to removing 350,000 \n        passenger vehicles from America's roads.\n\nSEC. 3.
