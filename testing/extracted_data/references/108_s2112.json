FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The overwhelming majority of Federal, State, and local \n        law enforcement officers throughout the Nation discharge their \n        duties professionally and without bias.\n            (2) A large majority of individuals subjected to traffic \n        stops and other law enforcement activities based on race, \n        ethnicity, or national origin are found to be law abiding, in \n        which case racial profiling is not an effective means to \n        uncover criminal activity.\n            (3) Racial profiling violates the equal protection clause \n        of the United States Constitution.\n            (4) Using race, ethnicity, or national origin as a proxy \n        for criminal suspicion violates the constitutional requirement \n        that police and other government officials accord to all \n        citizens the equal protection of the law.
