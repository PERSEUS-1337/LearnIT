FINDINGS, PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States and the Indian tribes have a unique \n        legal and political government-to-government relationship;\n            (2) pursuant to the Constitution, treaties, statutes, \n        Executive order, court decisions, and course of conduct, the \n        United States has a trust obligation to provide certain \n        services to Indian tribes and to Indians;\n            (3) Federal agencies charged with administering programs \n        and providing services to or for the benefit of Indians have \n        not furnished Congress with adequate information necessary to \n        assess such program on the needs of Indians and Indian tribes;\n            (4) such lack of information has hampered the ability of \n        the Congress to determine the nature, type, and magnitude of \n        such needs as well as its ability to respond to them; and\n            (5) Congress cannot properly fulfill its obligation to \n        Indian tribes and Indian people unless and until it has an \n        adequate store of information related to the needs of Indians \n        nationwide.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) ensure that Indian needs for Federal programs and \n        services are known in a more certain and predictable fashion;\n            (2) require that Federal agencies and departments carefully \n        review and monitor the effectiveness of the programs and \n        services provided to Indians;\n            (3) provide for more efficient and effective cooperation \n        and coordination of, and accountability from, the agencies and \n        departments providing programs and services, including \n        technical and business development assistance, to Indians; and\n            (4) provide Congress with reliable information regarding \n        both Indian needs and the evaluation of Federal programs and \n        services provided to Indians nationwide.\n\nSEC. 3.
