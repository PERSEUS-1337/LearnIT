AMENDMENT.\n\n    Section 632 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law \n106-553; 114 Stat. 2762A-111), is amended to read as follows:\n    ``Sec. 632. (a) The Federal Communications Commission shall modify \nthe rules authorizing the operation of low-power FM radio stations, as \nproposed in MM Docket No. 99-25, to--\n            ``(1) prescribe protection for co-channels and first- and \n        second-adjacent channels; and\n            ``(2) prohibit any applicant from obtaining a low-power FM \n        license if the applicant has engaged in any manner in the \n        unlicensed operation of any station in violation of section 301 \n        of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301).\n    ``(b) Any license that was issued by the Federal Communications \nCommission to a low-power FM station prior to April 2, 2001, and that \ndoes not comply with the modifications adopted by the Commission in MM \nDocket No. 99-25 on April 2, 2001, shall remain invalid.''.\n\nSEC. 3. MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its rules to \neliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements \nbetween--\n            (1) low-power FM stations; and\n            (2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and \n        FM booster stations.\n\nSEC. 4. PROTECTION OF RADIO READING SERVICES.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall comply with its \nexisting minimum distance separation requirements for full-service FM \nstations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations that \nbroadcast radio reading services via an analog subcarrier frequency to \navoid potential interference by low-power FM stations.\n\nSEC. 5. ENSURING AVAILABILITY OF SPECTRUM FOR LOW-POWER FM STATIONS.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM \ntranslator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, \nshall ensure--\n            (1) that licenses are available to FM translator stations, \n        FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations; and\n            (2) that such decisions are made based on the needs of the \n        local community.\n\nSEC. 6. PROTECTION OF TRANSLATOR INPUT SIGNALS.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its rules to \naddress the potential for predicted interference to FM translator input \nsignals on third-adjacent channels set forth in section 2.7 of the \ntechnical report entitled ``Experimental Measurements of the Third-\nAdjacent Channel Impacts of Low-Power FM Stations, Volume One--Final \nReport (May 2003)''.\n\nSEC. 7. ENSURING EFFECTIVE REMEDIATION OF INTERFERENCE.\n\n    The Federal Communications Commission shall modify the interference \ncomplaint process described in section 73.810 of its rules (47 CFR \n73.810) as follows:\n            (1) With respect to those low-power FM stations licensed at \n        locations that do not satisfy third-adjacent channel spacing \n        requirements under section 73.807 of the Commission's rules (47 \n        CFR 73.807), the Federal Communications Commission shall \n        provide the same interference protections that FM translator \n        stations and FM booster stations are required to provide as set \n        forth in section 74.1203 of its rules (47 CFR 74.1203) as in \n        effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n            (2) For a period of 1 year after a new low-power FM station \n        is constructed on a third-adjacent channel, such low-power FM \n        station shall be required to broadcast periodic announcements \n        that alert listeners that interference that they may be \n        experiencing could be the result of the operation of such low-\n        power FM station on a third-adjacent channel and shall instruct \n        affected listeners to contact such low-power FM station to \n        report any interference. The Federal Communications Commission \n        shall require all newly constructed low-power FM stations on \n        third-adjacent channels to--\n                    (A) notify the Federal Communications Commission \n                and all affected stations on third-adjacent channels of \n                an interference complaint by electronic communication \n                within 48 hours after the receipt of such complaint; \n                and\n                    (B) cooperate in addressing any such interference.\n            (3) Low-power FM stations on third-adjacent channels shall \n        be required to address complaints of interference within the \n        protected contour of an affected station and shall be \n        encouraged to address all other interference complaints, \n        including complaints to the Federal Communications Commission \n        based on interference to a full-service FM station, an FM \n        translator station, or an FM booster station by the transmitter \n        site of a low-power FM station on a third-adjacent channel at \n        any distance from the full-service FM station, FM translator \n        station, or FM booster station. The Federal Communications \n        Commission shall provide notice to the licensee of a low-power \n        FM station of the existence of such interference within 7 \n        calendar days of the receipt of a complaint from a listener or \n        another station.\n            (4) To the extent possible, the Federal Communications \n        Commission shall grant low-power FM stations on third-adjacent \n        channels the technical flexibility to remediate interference \n        through the colocation of the transmission facilities of the \n        low-power FM station and any stations on third-adjacent \n        channels.\n            (5) The Federal Communications Commission shall--\n                    (A) permit the submission of informal evidence of \n                interference, including any engineering analysis that \n                an affected station may commission;\n                    (B) accept complaints based on interference to a \n                full-service FM station, FM translator station, or FM \n                booster station by the transmitter site of a low-power \n                FM station on a third-adjacent channel at any distance \n                from the full-service FM station, FM translator \n                station, or FM booster station; and\n                    (C) accept complaints of interference to mobile \n                reception.\n\nSEC. 8. FCC STUDY ON IMPACT OF LOW-POWER FM STATIONS ON FULL-SERVICE \n              COMMERCIAL FM STATIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Federal Communications Commission shall \nconduct an economic study on the impact that low-power FM stations will \nhave on full-service commercial FM stations.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Federal Communications Commission shall submit a report \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate \nand the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \nRepresentatives on the study conducted under subsection (a).\n    (c) Licensing Not Affected by Study.--Nothing in this section shall \naffect the licensing of new low-power FM stations as otherwise \npermitted under this Act.\n\n            Passed the House of Representatives December 16, 2009.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                                            LORRAINE C.
