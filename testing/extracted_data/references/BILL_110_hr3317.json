SHORT TITLE; REFERENCE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``GEAR UP \nEnhancement Act of 2007''.\n    (b) References.--Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever \nin this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \namendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference \nshall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of the \nHigher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1998, Congress created the Gaining Early Awareness \n        and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) following \n        the leadership and innovation of successful programs such as \n        Say Yes to Education, 21st Century Scholars Program, Tell Them \n        We Are Rising, ``I Have a Dream'' Foundation, Project GRAD, and \n        others. GEAR UP, originally conceived of as High Hopes, is now \n        one of the most innovative and successful national college \n        access programs.\n            (2) Though college has become a reality for more families \n        now than ever before, an opportunity gap continues to exist in \n        which low-income students are far less likely to earn a high \n        school diploma, and enroll in and complete college. Whereas \n        73.9 percent of all students nationally graduate from high \n        school, only 52.1 percent of children from low-income families \n        achieve this educational milestone. While 76 percent of high-\n        income high school graduates enroll in college or trade school, \n        only 49 percent of low-income graduates do so.\n            (3) Since its enactment, GEAR UP has served approximately 2 \n        million students in 48 states, the District of Columbia, \n        American Samoa, Guam, Palau and Puerto Rico. The Department of \n        Education reports that 84.4 percent of the first class of GEAR \n        UP students graduated from high school, while only 52.1 percent \n        of low-income students and 73.9 percent all students nationally \n        achieved this same educational milestone. An ACT study found \n        that students from GEAR UP schools had greater changes in \n        academic performance, were more likely to be on track to be \n        college-ready in English and Reading, more likely to take the \n        core high school curriculum, and more likely to have plans for \n        college at grade 10.\n\nSEC. 3. AWARD PERIOD; PRIORITY.\n\n    Section 404A(b) (20 U.S.C. 1070a-21(b)) is amended by striking \nparagraph (2) and inserting the following:\n            ``(2) Award period.--The Secretary may award a grant under \n        this chapter to an eligible entity described in paragraphs (1) \n        and (2) of subsection (c) for 7 years.\n            ``(3) Priority.--In making awards to eligible entities \n        described in subsection (c)(1), the Secretary shall--\n                    ``(A) give priority to eligible entities that--\n                            ``(i) on the day before the date of \n                        enactment of the GEAR UP Enhancement Act of \n                        2007, carried out successful educational \n                        opportunity programs under this chapter (as \n                        this chapter was in effect on such day); and\n                            ``(ii) have a prior, demonstrated \n                        commitment to early intervention leading to \n                        college access through collaboration and \n                        replication of successful strategies; and\n                    ``(B) ensure that students served under this \n                chapter on the day before the date of enactment of the \n                GEAR UP Enhancement Act of 2007 continue to receive \n                assistance through the completion of secondary \n                school.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
