SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Ensure Long-Term Protection \nfor Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017'' or the ``HELP for Coal Miners \nHealth Care Act of 2017''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Over the 8 years preceding the date of the introduction \n        of this Act, the coal industry and the communities supported by \n        that industry have struggled, in large part due to \n        overregulation.\n            (2) Excessive regulation has, in large part, made coal more \n        expensive to mine and use and has put it at an unfair \n        disadvantage in the marketplace.\n            (3) Because of these struggles--\n                    (A) the coal mining industry has lost over 30,000 \n                jobs since President Obama's inauguration;\n                    (B) over 600 coal mines have shuttered since \n                President Obama's inauguration;\n                    (C) more than 25 coal mining companies have filed \n                for bankruptcy since President Obama's inauguration;\n                    (D) Kentucky alone has lost over 10,000 coal mining \n                jobs since President Obama's inauguration; and\n                    (E) the total number of operating coal mines has \n                hit its lowest point on record.\n            (4) Because of the health risks often associated with \n        mining, robust health benefits are vital to coal miner \n        retirees; however, coal company bankruptcies, job cuts, and \n        closures have exhausted the ability of many coal companies to \n        continue providing health benefits to retirees and their \n        dependents.\n            (5) Congress has stepped in twice before, in 1992 and in \n        2006, to assist retired miners and to secure their health \n        benefits. When thousands more were at risk of losing their \n        benefits at the end of 2016, Congress intervened again to \n        provide a 4-month extension in health benefits for orphaned \n        retired miners and their dependents.\n            (6) While this extension helped prevent the loss of health \n        benefits for thousands of miners, it did not provide a long-\n        term solution.\n            (7) It is necessary to provide a permanent extension of \n        health care benefits for the orphaned retirees who are at risk \n        of losing their retirement health benefits at the end of April \n        2017.\n\nSEC. 3.
