FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Over the past 20 years, advances in scientific research \n        have changed the way of thinking about children's mental health \n        and proven that the same mental disorders that afflict adults \n        can also occur in children and adolescents.\n            (2) In January 2001, the Report of the Surgeon General's \n        Conference on Children's Mental Health noted that 74 percent of \n        individuals age 21 with mental disorders had prior problems, \n        indicating that children's mental disorders often persist into \n        adulthood.\n            (3) Scientific research has demonstrated that early \n        identification and treatment of mental disorders in youth \n        greatly improves a child or adolescent's prognosis throughout \n        his or her lifetime.\n            (4) In January 2001, the Surgeon General noted that, while \n        1 in 10 children and adolescents in the United States suffers \n        from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of \n        impairment, only 1 in 5 of such children and adolescents \n        receives needed mental health treatment.\n            (5) In September 2002, the National Council on Disability \n        noted that between 60 and 70 percent of youth in the juvenile \n        justice system have an emotional disturbance and almost 50 \n        percent have co-occurring disabilities.\n            (6) The World Health Organization has reported that youth \n        neuropsychiatric disorders will rise by over 50 percent by \n        2020, making such disorders 1 of the top 5 causes of \n        disability, morbidity, and mortality among children and \n        adolescents.\n            (7) Psychological autopsy studies have found that 90 \n        percent of youths who end their own lives have depression or \n        another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder at the \n        time of their deaths, verifying a link between mental illness \n        and suicide.\n            (8) In 1999, the Surgeon General recognized that mental \n        illness and substance abuse disorders are, in fact, the \n        greatest risk factors for suicidal behavior, and that properly \n        identifying and treating mental illness and substance abuse \n        disorders are an important part of suicide prevention \n        activities.\n            (9) The National Council on Disability has also stated that \n        ``the failure to identify and treat mental disabilities between \n        children and youth has serious consequences, including school \n        failure, involvement with the justice system and other tragic \n        outcomes,'' including ``the growing problem of teen suicides \n        and/or suicide attempts''.\n            (10) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        reported that in 2000 suicide was the 3rd leading cause of \n        death among youth 15 to 24 years of age.\n            (11) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n        Administration reported that in 1999 almost 3,000,000 youth \n        were at risk for suicide, but only 36 percent received mental \n        health treatment.\n            (12) According to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance \n        System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among \n        high school students surveyed in 2001, 19 percent had seriously \n        considered attempting suicide, almost 15 percent had made a \n        specific plan to attempt suicide, almost 9 percent had \n        attempted suicide, and almost 3 percent had made an attempt at \n        suicide that required medical attention.\n            (13) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        reported that each year in the United States, almost as many \n        adolescents and young adults commit suicide as die from all \n        natural causes combined, including leukemia, birth defects, \n        pneumonia, influenza, and AIDS.\n            (14) In January 2001, the Surgeon General issued a goal to \n        ``improve the assessment of and recognition of mental health \n        needs in children'' in part by encouraging ``early \n        identification of mental health needs in existing preschool, \n        child care, education, health, welfare, juvenile justice, and \n        substance abuse treatment systems''.\n            (15) Toward that end, the efforts, initiatives, and \n        activities of the Federal Government should be used to support \n        evidence-based preventive-screening methods to detect mental \n        illness and suicidal tendencies in school-age youth.\n\nSEC. 3.
