    "content": "According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the length of the International Boundary line of the U.S.-Canadian border, excluding Alaska, is approximately 3,987 miles, while the length of the U.S.-Mexican border is estimated at 1,933 miles. The length of the Alaska-Canada border alone is 1,538 miles. The tables below list the 13 U.S. states that share international boundaries with Canada and the four states that share an international border with Mexico, with information from the International Boundary Commission and the U.S. Geological Survey. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has surveyed the coastline of the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii several times. The current figures for the coastline are the results of the measurements done originally in 1915 and updated several times thereafter. These figures reflect the general outline of the seacoast. The figures for Alaska reflect a 1961 remeasurement. It is important to note that boundary and coastline distances can differ significantly based on the scale used on the maps or charts. The Canadian and Mexican international borders are less problematic than the coastline measures because there are long stretches that are straight, such as the nearly 900-mile section of the U.S.-Canadian border along the 49 th parallel. Coastline measurements are more difficult because of the effects of tides and the necessarily arbitrary decisions that must be made about measuring bays, coves, islands, and inlets leading to streams and rivers. The \"general coastline\" data in this report are based on large scale nautical charts, resulting in a coastline measure for the 50 states totaling12,383 miles. Another measure using smaller scale nautical charts more than doubles this measurement to 29,093 miles, while the figures used by the NOAA in administering the Coastal Zone Management program (16 U.S.C. \u00a71451) come to 88,612 miles (not including the Great Lakes).  Table 3 provides figures for the areas of the U.S. coastline bordering international waters. It measures the coastline of the contiguous states from northeast to northwest. Similar to problems mentioned above regarding measuring coastlines, variations in shoreline figures appear due to natural occurrences, including bays and inlets, and in differing methods of measurement. These shoreline lengths were measured in 1970 by the International Coordinating Committee on the Great Lakes Basic Hydraulic and Hydrologic Data.
