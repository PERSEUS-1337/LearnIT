FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The generation of solid and hazardous waste has grown \n        to alarming proportions in the United States. Each person in \n        the United States throws away 3.6 pounds of garbage every day--\n        enough annually to fill a convoy of 10-ton garbage trucks \n        145,000 miles long, which is the equivalent of half-way to the \n        moon or roughly 7 times around the equator.\n            (2) Frequently economic incentives are not sufficient to \n        encourage waste minimization and responsible environmental \n        behavior, and such incentives actually may favor increased \n        waste generation and improper behavior.\n            (3) A system of economic incentives targeted at waste \n        reduction and recycling together with responsible regulation of \n        recycling activity can reduce both the amount and toxicity of \n        materials entering the environment.\n            (4) In particular, there is a need to encourage greater \n        recycling of used oils. Americans are improperly pouring on the \n        ground or into sewers, placing in landfills, or improperly \n        burning over 400 million gallons of such oil per year. This is \n        equivalent to more than 35 Exxon Valdez spills. In addition to \n        fouling the environment, this depletes oil resources and \n        increases the Nation's reliance on foreign oil.\n            (5) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency requires additional statutory authority to address \n        situations in which economic incentives to encourage waste \n        reduction and responsible environmental behavior are not \n        adequate.\n\nSEC. 3. USED OIL RECYCLING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 \nU.S.C. 6921 et seq.) is amended by redesignating sections 3015 through \n3023 as sections 3016 through 3024, respectively, and by inserting \nafter section 3014 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 3015. RECYCLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USED OIL.\n\n    ``(a) General Requirement.--(1) During the period beginning not \nlater than 24 months after the date of the enactment of the Oil \nRecycling Incentives Act and ending 10 years after such date, a \nproducer or importer of lubricating oil each year shall recycle, using \na method described in paragraph (2), an amount of used oil equal to at \nleast that amount of oil determined by--\n            ``(A) multiplying the lubricating oil produced for domestic \n        use or consumption or imported that year by such person, by\n            ``(B) the recycling percentage established by the \n        Administrator under subsection (b).\n    ``(2) A producer or importer of lubricating oil may comply with \nthis subsection--\n            ``(A) by recycling used oil (in compliance with the \n        requirements of section 3014 and regulations promulgated \n        pursuant to such section) through reintroducing the used oil \n        into refinery production for purposes of producing petroleum \n        products;\n            ``(B) by purchasing re-refined oil or re-refined lubricant \n        base stock from a facility having a permit under section 3005 \n        for purposes of producing lubricating oil; or\n            ``(C) by purchasing recycling credits under the recycling \n        credit system established pursuant to subsection (c).\n    ``(3) A producer or importer of lubricating oil shall submit to the \nAdministrator, under regulations promulgated by the Administrator, a \nreport on the amount of lubricating oil produced or imported in each \ncalendar year by such person. The report shall be submitted at least \nonce a year, but the Administrator also may require such interim \nreports under this paragraph as the Administrator considers necessary.\n    ``(4) For purposes of paragraph (1), a producer or importer shall \nbe treated as recycling 2 units of used oil for each unit of re-refined \noil or re-refined lubricant base stock purchased as provided in \nparagraph (2)(B).\n    ``(5) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a producer or importer \nfrom entering into an agreement with a subsidiary or division of such \nproducer or importer--\n            ``(A) for purposes of treating oil recycled by such \n        subsidiary or division as being recycled by the producer or \n        importer for purposes of meeting the recycling requirement of \n        this section; or\n            ``(B) for purposes of obtaining recycling credits created \n        by such subsidiary or division.\n    ``(6) For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), the amount of used oil that \nis recycled as provided in that paragraph shall be determined on the \nbasis of the records of the amount of used oil received by the producer \nor importer.\n    ``(b) Recycling Percentage.--The Administrator each year shall \nestablish a recycling percentage for use under subsection (a). The \npercentage applicable during the first year that the requirement \nestablished by subsection (a) is in effect shall be a percentage that \nis 2 percentage points higher than the recycling rate for lubricating \noil that exists on the date of the enactment of this section. Such \nrecycling rate shall be determined by using data for 1990 or the most \nrecent year for which data are available. For each of the 10 years \nthereafter, the recycling percentage shall be an additional 2 \npercentage points higher than the recycling percentage of the previous \nyear. Such recycling percentage shall go into effect automatically and \nshall be published in the Federal Register.\n    ``(c) Credit System for Recycling Used Oil.--(1) Not later than 18 \nmonths after the date of the enactment of the Oil Recycling Incentives \nAct, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations to establish a \nsystem under which (A) recyclers may create credits for used oil \nrecycling, and (B) producers or importers of lubricating oil may \npurchase such recycling credits from such recyclers, for purposes of \ncomplying with subsection (a). No person may create such credits, and \nno producer or importer of lubricating oil may purchase such credits, \nexcept in accordance with this subsection and the regulations \npromulgated under this subsection. In developing the regulations, the \nAdministrator shall, to the maximum extent feasible, allow for the use \nof records kept in the ordinary course of business or other approaches \nthat facilitate the simple, rapid generation and exchange of credits \nwithout a case-by-case approval.\n    ``(2) At a minimum, the regulations under paragraph (1) shall \ninclude the following requirements:\n            ``(A) The following records shall be kept by a recycler for \n        at least 3 years:\n                    ``(i) A record of the quantities of used oil \n                received for recycling, together with the prices paid \n                to transporters or owners or operators of collection \n                centers.\n                    ``(ii) A record of the quantities of recycled oil \n                sold or otherwise distributed in commerce, and the \n                destinations of such recycled oil. Part of such record \n                shall be a record of the quantities and price of re-\n                refined oil sold to producers or importers of \n                lubricating oil for the purpose of complying with \n                subsection (a).\n                    ``(iii) A record of the sale or other disposition \n                of recycling credits, including the name and address of \n                the producers and importers the credits were sold to, \n                the price charged, and the amount of credits sold.\n            ``(B) The recycler shall sell or otherwise distribute in \n        commerce the recycled oil as specification used oil, off-\n        specification or industrial specification used oil, or re-\n        refined oil (as defined by the Administrator). The recycler \n        shall maintain records of the tests certifying that the oil \n        meets the standards for one of those categories of oil or fuel, \n        along with records of the destination of the oil or fuel by \n        category.\n            ``(C) Each year a producer or importer of lubricating oil \n        shall keep records of the quantity of lubricating oil produced \n        or imported, the recycling of used oil carried out to comply \n        with subsection (a), the amount of re-refined oil or lubricant \n        base stock purchased to comply with subsection (a), the amount \n        of recycling credits purchased (including the names of \n        recyclers from whom the credits were purchased and the dates of \n        the purchases), the price paid for the credits, and the amount \n        (if any) of recycling credits sold or carried over from \n        previous years. The regulations shall allow for a 2-year \n        carryover of credits.\n    ``(3) The Administrator may include such other requirements in the \nregulations under paragraph (1) with respect to qualifications for \nrecyclers, importers, and producers; methods for auditing compliance \nwith the system; and enforcement of the system; as the Administrator \nconsiders necessary or appropriate for administering the recycling \ncredit system established under this subsection.\n    ``(4) The Administrator shall include in the regulations under \nparagraph (1) a procedure by which an interested party may petition the \nAdministrator for credits to be created under the credit system for \nrecycling of used oil using new technology. The Administrator shall \ndetermine, after public notice and opportunity for comment, the amount \nof credit that may be created by new technologies for which petitions \nare granted under this paragraph.\n    ``(d) Reports.--(1) Not later than 6 years after the date of the \nenactment of the Oil Recycling Incentives Act, the Administrator shall \nsubmit to Congress an interim report on the implementation of this \nsection. The report shall include, at a minimum--\n            ``(A) a discussion of the effects of the requirements of \n        this section on the lubricating oil industry, the used oil \n        recycling industry, and on the environment; and\n            ``(B) an evaluation of the level of the recycling \n        percentage under subsection (b) and recommendations on whether, \n        and at what rate, the percentage should be increased in future \n        years above the percentage applicable under subsection (b).\n    ``(2) Not later than 10 years after such date, the Administrator \nshall submit to Congress a final report on the implementation of this \nsection. The report shall include an updated version of the discussion \nand evaluation required in the interim report, as well as such other \nfindings and recommendations with respect to the implementation of this \nsection as the Administrator considers appropriate.\n    ``(e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n            ``(1) The term `producer' with respect to lubricating oil \n        means any person who produces a lubricant base stock from crude \n        oil.
