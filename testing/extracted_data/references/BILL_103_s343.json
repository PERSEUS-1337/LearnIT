MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE AND SEWAGE SLUDGE.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--Section 101 of the Comprehensive Environmental \nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601) is \namended by adding the following new paragraphs at the end thereof:\n            ``(39) The term `municipal solid waste' means all waste \n        materials generated by households, including single and \n        multiple residences, and hotels and motels. The term also \n        includes trash generated by commercial, institutional, and \n        industrial sources (a) when such materials are essentially the \n        same as waste normally generated by households, or (b) when \n        such waste materials were collected and disposed of with other \n        municipal solid waste or sewage sludge and, regardless of when \n        generated, would be considered conditionally exempt small \n        quantity generator waste under section 3001(d) of the Solid \n        Waste Disposal Act. Examples of municipal solid waste include \n        food and yard waste, paper, clothing, appliances, consumer \n        product packaging, disposable diapers, office supplies, \n        cosmetics, glass and metal food containers, school science \n        laboratory waste, and household hazardous waste (such as \n        painting, cleaning, gardening, and automotive supplies). The \n        term `municipal solid waste' does not include combustion ash \n        generated by resource recovery facilities or municipal \n        incinerators, or waste from manufacturing or processing \n        (including pollution control) operations not essentially the \n        same as waste normally generated by households.\n            ``(40) The term `sewage sludge' refers to any solid, \n        semisolid, or liquid residue removed during the treatment of \n        municipal waste water, domestic sewage, or other waste waters \n        at or by a publicly owned treatment works.\n            ``(41) The term `municipality' means any political \n        subdivision of a State and may include cities, counties, \n        villages, towns, townships, boroughs, parishes, schools, school \n        districts, sanitation districts, water districts, and other \n        local governmental entities. The term also includes any natural \n        person acting in his or her official capacity as an official, \n        employee, or agent of a municipality.''.\n    (b) Section 113 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended by adding the \nfollowing new subsections at the end thereof:\n    ``(m) Contribution Actions for Municipal Solid Waste and Sewage \nSludge.--No municipality or other person shall be liable to any person \nother than the President for claims of contribution under this section \nor for other response costs, penalties, or damages under this Act for \nthe generation, transportation, or arrangement for the transportation, \ntreatment, or disposal of municipal solid waste or sewage sludge.\n    ``(n) Public Right-of-Way.--In no event shall a municipality incur \nliability under this Act for the acts of owning or maintaining a public \nright-of-way over which hazardous substances are transported, or of \ngranting a business license to a private party for the transportation, \ntreatment, or disposal of municipal solid waste or sewage sludge. For \nthe purposes of this subsection, `public right-of-way' includes, but is \nnot limited to, roads, streets, flood control channels, or other public \ntransportation routes, and pipelines used as a conduit for sewage or \nother liquid or semiliquid discharges.''.\n    (c) Section 122 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended by adding the \nfollowing new subsection at the end thereof:\n    ``(n) Settlements for Generators and Transporters of Municipal \nSolid Waste or Sewage Sludge.--\n            ``(1) Eligible persons.--The term `eligible person' under \n        this subsection means any person against whom an administrative \n        or judicial action is brought, or to whom notice is given of \n        potential liability under this Act, for the generation, \n        transportation, or arrangement for the transportation, \n        treatment, or disposal of municipal solid waste or sewage \n        sludge. An eligible person who may be liable under section \n        107(a)(1) or 107(a)(2) of this Act or for substances other than \n        municipal solid waste or sewage sludge is covered by the Toxic \n        Cleanup Equity and Acceleration Act of 1993 and the amendments \n        to this Act made by the Toxic Cleanup Equity and Acceleration \n        Act of 1993 to the extent that the person is liable for the \n        generation, transportation, or arrangement for the \n        transportation, treatment, or disposal of municipal solid waste \n        or sewage sludge.\n            ``(2) Negotiation of settlements; moratorium.--Eligible \n        persons under this subsection may offer to settle their \n        potential liability with the President by stating in writing \n        their ability and willingness to settle their potential \n        liability in accordance with this subsection. Upon receipt of \n        such offer to settle, neither the President nor any other \n        person shall take further administrative or judicial action \n        against the eligible person, unless the President determines \n        that the eligible person's offer or position during \n        negotiations is not in good faith or otherwise not in \n        accordance with this subsection or that the matters addressed \n        include liability not related to the generation, \n        transportation, or arrangement for the transportation, \n        treatment, or disposal of municipal solid waste or sewage \n        sludge. Nothing in this subsection shall limit or modify the \n        President's authority under section 104(e) (42 U.S.C. 9604(e)).\n            ``(3) Timing.--Eligible persons may tender offers under \n        this subsection within one hundred and eighty days after \n        receiving a notice of potential liability or becoming subject \n        to administrative or judicial action, or within one hundred and \n        eighty days after a record of decision is issued for the \n        portion of the response action that is the subject of the \n        person's settlement offer, whichever is later. If the President \n        notifies an eligible person that he or she may be a potentially \n        responsible party, no further administrative or judicial action \n        may be taken by any party for one hundred and twenty days \n        against such person.\n            ``(4) Expedited final settlement.--The President shall make \n        a good faith effort to reach final settlements as promptly as \n        possible under this subsection and such settlements shall--\n                    ``(A) allocate to all generation, transportation, \n                or arrangement for the transportation, treatment, or \n                disposal of municipal solid waste or sewage sludge a \n                combined total of no more than 4 percent of the total \n                response costs for the facility; Provided, however, \n                That the President shall reduce this percentage when \n                the presence of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge \n                is not significant at the facility;\n                    ``(B) require an eligible person under this \n                subsection to pay only for his or her equitable share \n                of the maximum 4 percent portion of response costs \n                described in subparagraph (A);\n                    ``(C) limit an eligible person's payments based on \n                such person's inability to pay, litigative risks, \n                public interest considerations, precedential value, and \n                equitable factors;\n                    ``(D) permit an eligible person to provide in-kind \n                services with regard to the response action in lieu of \n                cash contributions and to be credited at market rates \n                for such services;\n                    ``(E) limit a publicly owned treatment works' \n                payments if it has promoted the beneficial reuse of \n                sewage sludge through land application when the basis \n                of liability arises from sewage sludge generated \n                thirty-six months after the date of enactment of this \n                subsection or thereafter; and\n                    ``(F) be reached even in the event that an eligible \n                person may be liable under sections 107(a)(1) or \n                107(a)(2) of this Act or for substances other than \n                municipal solid waste or sewage sludge.\n            ``(5) Covenant not to sue.--The President may provide a \n        covenant not to sue with respect to the facility concerned to \n        any person who has entered into a settlement under this \n        subsection unless such a covenant would be inconsistent with \n        the public interest as determined under subsection (f) of this \n        section.\n            ``(6) Effect of agreement.--A person that has resolved his \n        or her liability to the United States under this subsection \n        shall not be liable for claims of contribution or for other \n        response costs, penalties, or damages under this Act regarding \n        matters addressed in the settlement. Such settlement does not \n        discharge any of the other potentially responsible parties \n        unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the potential \n        liability of the others by the amount of the settlement.\n            ``(7) De minimis settlements.--Nothing in this subsection \n        shall alter or diminish a person's ability to reach a \n        settlement with the President under subsection (g) of this \n        section.\n    ``(o) Future Disposal Practices.--This subsection applies only to \nthe generation, transportation, or arrangement for the transportation, \ntreatment, or disposal of municipal solid waste or sewage sludge \noccurring thirty-six months after the date of enactment of this \nsubsection.
