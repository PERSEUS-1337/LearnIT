FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) since 2007, there has been a net increase in \n        methamphetamine laboratory incidents across the United States, \n        as the number of incidents has risen from 6,858 in 2007 to \n        9,240 in 2014, with a peak of 15,217 in 2010;\n            (2) 23 States have laws that require landlords to inform \n        new renters or potential buyers if a building was previously \n        used as a methamphetamine lab, but the Drug Enforcement Agency \n        estimates that only 5 percent of homes used to make \n        methamphetamine in the United States are disclosed;\n            (3) research shows that for every pound of methamphetamine \n        created by a lab, 5 pounds of toxic waste is produced, most of \n        which becomes airborne and is subsequently absorbed by other \n        objects, such as carpets, furniture, drywall, and countertops;\n            (4) the toxic waste that does not become airborne can \n        remain as residue in bathtubs, toilets, sinks, and floors if it \n        is spilled or not disposed of properly, and without proper \n        cleaning, these harmful chemicals can remain in the affected \n        buildings for years;\n            (5) harmful methamphetamine by-products include propane \n        fuel, lithium, sodium hydroxide, and solvents like benzene, \n        acetone, and hexane, all of which can have negative and lasting \n        effects on families and children in particular;\n            (6) coming into contact with these substances has been \n        shown to cause dry mouth, nose bleeds, respiratory issues, \n        issues with the brain, liver, and kidneys, birth defects, and \n        reproductive problems;\n            (7) solvents like acetone can cause death, while chronic \n        inhalation of hexane can cause significant damage to the \n        central nervous system, and the by-product benzene has been \n        linked to anemia and leukemia in adults as well as children;\n            (8) testing for methamphetamine and harmful by-products of \n        methamphetamine is relatively simple and inexpensive;\n            (9) once a family or business has moved into an affected \n        building, properly cleaning and sterilizing the building can \n        cost up to $10,000, and such an expense can represent a \n        crippling and unexpected financial burden on families and \n        businesses in the United States; and\n            (10) a law requiring landlords to disclose information \n        about the previous methamphetamine usage of a building could \n        prevent unnecessarily exposing millions of people in the United \n        States to potentially lethal circumstances, and the Federal \n        Government must therefore take initiative on this issue to \n        preserve the health and financial stability of the people of \n        the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MANUFACTURE OF \n              METHAMPHETAMINE UPON TRANSFER OR LEASE OF COVERED \n              HOUSING.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n            (1) the term ``covered housing''--\n                    (A) means any housing that is a dwelling unit, \n                including the grounds, outbuildings, fences, \n                structures, and, where applicable, common areas; and\n                    (B) does not include housing that, as of the date \n                on which a seller or lessor sells or leases the \n                housing, is--\n                            (i) newly constructed; or\n                            (ii) has never been occupied;\n            (2) the term ``methamphetamine-based hazard'' means any \n        condition that causes exposure to any hazardous substance or \n        pollutant or contaminant associated with the manufacture of \n        methamphetamine that would result in adverse human health \n        effects, as established by the appropriate Federal agency; and\n            (3) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Housing \n        and Urban Development.\n    (b) Disclosure in Purchase and Sale or Lease of Covered Housing.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in coordination with the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and any \n        other Federal agency with knowledge of methamphetamine-based \n        hazards, shall promulgate regulations for the disclosure of \n        methamphetamine-based hazards in covered housing that is \n        offered for sale or lease.\n            (2) Requirements.--The regulations promulgated under \n        paragraph (1) shall require that--\n                    (A) before the purchaser or lessee is obligated \n                under any contract to purchase or lease covered \n                housing, the seller or lessor shall--\n                            (i) provide a written disclosure to the \n                        purchaser or lessee--\n                                    (I) of any knowledge of whether \n                                methamphetamine was manufactured in the \n                                covered housing;
