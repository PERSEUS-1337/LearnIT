FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Lena Mary Calhoun Horne was born on June 30, 1917, in \n        Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 16, Lena Horne was hired as a \n        dancer in the chorus of Harlem's famous Cotton Club, where she \n        was introduced to such legendary jazz performers as Duke \n        Ellington, Cab Calloway, Count Basie, Ethel Waters, and Billie \n        Holiday.\n            (2) In 1940, she became one of the first African-American \n        women to perform with an all-White band when she toured with \n        Charlie Barnet's jazz band as its featured singer.\n            (3) She was discovered by a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) \n        talent scout and became the first African-American artist to \n        sign a long-term contract with a major film studio.\n            (4) Despite her extraordinary beauty and talent, Lena Horne \n        was often limited to minor acting roles because of her race.\n            (5) Scenes in which she did sing were cut out when they \n        were sent to local distributors in the South and studio \n        executives cast another actress as Julie in the film version of \n        ``Show Boat'' instead of Lena Horne because they did not want \n        the show to star an African-American actress.\n            (6) However, Lena Horne dazzled audiences and critics in a \n        number of films, including ``Cabin in the Sky'' and ``Stormy \n        Weather'' before ultimately turning back to a more lucrative, \n        inclusive career in show business, performing across the nation \n        in nightclubs and on broadway.\n            (7) A strong supporter of American troops, during World War \n        II, Lena Horne toured extensively with the United Service \n        Organizations (USO) on the West Coast and in the South. She \n        expressed outrage about the way African-American soldiers were \n        treated, firmly opposing segregation and discrimination. She \n        was appalled to find that the military was implementing such \n        strong measures of separation based on race, and actively \n        protested performing when she saw that German Prisoners of War \n        (POWs) were seated ahead of Black servicemen.\n            (8) In general, Lena refused to sing for segregated \n        audiences and made it a point to speak out on the issue when \n        performing before her large crowds of mixed races.\n            (9) During the period of McCarthyism in the 1950s, Lena \n        Horne was blacklisted as a communist for 7 years because of her \n        civil rights activism and friendship with Paul Robeson and \n        W.E.B. Du Bois.\n            (10) In 1957, Lena Horne recorded Lena Horne at the \n        Waldorf-Astoria, which reached the U.S. Billboard Top 10 and \n        became the best-selling album by a female singer, regardless of \n        race, in RCA Victor's history.\n            (11) Lena Horne rose to international stardom and toured \n        the world, sharing the stage with such names as Count Basie, \n        Tony Bennett, Billy Eckstine, Vic Damone, and Harry Belafonte, \n        and also starred in musical and television specials with such \n        giants as Judy Garland, Bing Crosby, and Frank Sinatra.\n            (12) Throughout her life, Lena Horne used her fame to \n        become a powerful voice for civil rights and equality.\n            (13) In 1963, she participated in the historic March on \n        Washington for Jobs and Freedom, at which Dr. Martin Luther \n        King, Jr., delivered his immortal ``I Have a Dream'' speech. \n        Lena had gained renown respect for her courage in maintaining a \n        firm stake in the Civil Rights movement, and met President John \n        F. Kennedy days before his death later that year.\n            (14) Lena Horne also performed at rallies throughout the \n        country for the National Council for Negro Women and worked \n        with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \n        People (NAACP), of which she was a member from the age of 2, as \n        well as the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. and National Urban \n        League.\n            (15) She would go on to play herself on such staple \n        American shows as The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, and Sanford \n        and Son.\n            (16) Through the end of the 20th century, Lena Horne \n        continued to entertain large audiences of all ages, races, \n        ethnicities and backgrounds. In 1981, she captivated audiences \n        with her one-woman Broadway show,``Lena Horne: The Lady and Her \n        Music'', which enjoyed a 14-month run before going on tour, and \n        earned her a special Tony Award and two Grammy Awards. In the \n        1950s, Lena actually became the first woman to have been \n        nominated for a Tony Award.\n            (17) In 2002, 73 years after the Academy Awards were first \n        awarded, Halle Berry became the first African-American woman to \n        win an Oscar for Best Actress and recognized in her acceptance \n        speech how Lena Horne paved the way for her and other African-\n        American actresses.\n            (18) Lena Horne passed away in New York City on May 9, \n        2010, at the age of 92.\n            (19) Lena Horne was an entertainer, activist, and mother \n        who used her beauty, talent, and intelligence to fight racial \n        discrimination and injustice and rise to international stardom.\n            (20) A symbol of elegance and grace, she entertained people \n        of all walks of life for over 60 years, and broke barriers for \n        future generations.\n\nSEC. 3.
