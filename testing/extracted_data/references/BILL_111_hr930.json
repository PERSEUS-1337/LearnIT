Study and report by the Institute of Medicine.\nSec. 8. Authorization of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are autoimmune, \n        chronic, inflammatory, painful, disfiguring, and life-altering \n        diseases that require life-long sophisticated medical \n        intervention and care and have no cure.\n            (2) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis affect as many as \n        7,500,000 men, women, and children of all ages and have an \n        adverse impact on the quality of life for virtually all \n        affected.\n            (3) Psoriasis often is overlooked or dismissed because it \n        does not cause death. Psoriasis is commonly and incorrectly \n        considered by insurers, employers, policymakers, and the public \n        as a mere annoyance, a superficial problem, mistakenly thought \n        to be contagious and due to poor hygiene. Treatment for \n        psoriasis often is categorized, wrongly, as ``life-style'' and \n        not ``medically necessary.''\n            (4) Psoriasis goes hand-in-hand with myriad co-morbidities \n        such as Crohn's disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, \n        hypertension, heart attack, cardiovascular disease, liver \n        disease, and psoriatic arthritis, which occurs in 10 to 30 \n        percent of people with psoriasis.\n            (5) The National Institute of Mental Health funded a study \n        that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical and mental \n        disability as other major diseases, including cancer, \n        arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and \n        depression.\n            (6) Psoriasis is associated with elevated rates of \n        depression and suicidal ideation.\n            (7) The risk of premature death is 50 percent higher for \n        individuals with severe psoriasis than for individuals without \n        any form of psoriasis.\n            (8) Total direct and indirect health care costs of \n        psoriasis are calculated at over $11,250,000,000 annually with \n        work loss accounting for 40 percent of the cost burden.\n            (9) Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis \n        may help prevent irreversible joint damage.\n            (10) Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents a \n        challenge for patients and their health care providers because \n        no one treatment works for everyone, some treatments lose \n        effectiveness over time, many treatments are used in \n        combination with others, and all treatments may cause a unique \n        set of side effects.\n            (11) Although new and more effective treatments finally are \n        becoming available, too many people do not yet have access to \n        the types of therapies that may make a significant difference \n        in the quality of their lives.\n            (12) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis constitute a \n        significant national health issue that deserves a comprehensive \n        and coordinated response by Federal and State governments with \n        involvement of the health care provider, patient, and public \n        health communities.\n\nSEC. 4.
