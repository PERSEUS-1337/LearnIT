In the case of such an initial \nsurvey of a renal dialysis facility, the Secretary may allow any State \nto waive the reimbursement for conducting the survey under this section \nif it requests such a waiver.\n    ``(2) In the case of a renal dialysis facility that has waited for \nmore than 6 months to receive the results of an initial survey under \nthis section, the Secretary shall establish a specific timetable for \ncompleting and reporting the results of the survey.''; and\n            (3) in subsection (f), as so redesignated--\n                    (A) by striking ``Notwithstanding any other \n                provision of law,'' and inserting ``(1) Notwithstanding \n                any other provision of law and except as provided in \n                paragraph (2)''; and\n                    (B) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(2) The Secretary may assess and collect fees for the initial \nMedicare survey from a renal dialysis facility subject to the \nrequirements of section 1881(b) in an amount not to exceed a reasonable \nfee necessary to cover the costs of initial surveys conducted for \npurposes of determining the compliance of a renal dialysis facility \nwith the requirements of section 1881(b).

A renal dialysis \nfacility's liability for such fees shall be reasonably based on the \nproportion of the survey costs which relate to such facility.
