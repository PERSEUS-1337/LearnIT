FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States has more than 12 million employers \n        and approximately 135 million working adults.\n            (2) The use of effective worksite policies and programs can \n        reduce health risks and improve the quality of life for the 135 \n        million full-time and part-time workers in the United States.\n            (3) Workers spend more than one-third of their day on the \n        job and, as a result, employers are in a unique position to \n        promote the health and safety of their employees.\n            (4) Chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, \n        obesity, and diabetes are among the most prevalent and costly \n        worker health problems for most employers.\n            (5) The use by employers of effective worksite policies and \n        programs can reduce health risks and improve the quality of \n        life for their employees.\n            (6) The good health of workers is good for business because \n        healthier workers miss less work, are more productive, and have \n        lower health care costs.\n\nSEC. 3.
