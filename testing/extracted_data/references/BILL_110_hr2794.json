FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The nursing shortage has a detrimental impact on the \n        quality of care patients receive in health care settings and \n        plays a role in driving up health care costs.\n            (2) States that have developed strategies involving \n        partnerships with educational institutions and have allocated \n        funds toward implementing their strategies are well suited to \n        make effective use of matching Federal funds to better address \n        and reduce this nursing shortage\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to support State and \nprivate efforts to address lack of capacity in college and university \nnursing programs, the critical driving force behind the serious nursing \nshortage in many States with fast growing populations.\n\nSEC. 3.
