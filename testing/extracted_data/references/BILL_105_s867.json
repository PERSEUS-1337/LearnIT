FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) in recent years, the United States has experienced a \n        significant increase in juvenile crime, especially with respect \n        to serious and violent offenses;\n            (2) a great proportion of the serious and violent offenses \n        referred to in paragraph (1) are committed by individuals whose \n        past criminal record is not revealed to criminal justice \n        agencies, including courts, because of the current or former \n        status of those individuals as juveniles;\n            (3) in recent years, because of the increased mobility and \n        ease of travel by juvenile offenders, especially members of \n        criminal street gangs, to other States and units of local \n        government, the officials of those States and units of local \n        government are often--\n                    (A) unable to obtain any record of prior serious \n                offenses of those juvenile offenders; and\n                    (B) unprepared for the violent behavior of those \n                juvenile offenders; and\n            (4) the inaccessibility of records indicating past violent \n        offenses committed by juvenile offenders--\n                    (A) endangers public safety officers who may \n                encounter those offenders;\n                    (B) increases risks to students at schools where \n                those offenders may be enrolled; and\n                    (C) prevents judicial officials from making the \n                best decision with respect to such an offender that is \n                necessary to protect innocent citizens.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSISTANCE TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3711 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating part Y as part Z;\n            (2) by redesignating section 2501 as section 2601; and\n            (3) by inserting after part X the following:\n\n``PART Y--INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR STATE AND LOCAL CRIMINAL RECORDS SYSTEMS\n\n``SEC. 2501.
