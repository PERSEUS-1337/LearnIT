FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Pulmonary fibrosis (in this section referred to as \n        ``PF'') is a relentlessly progressive, ultimately fatal disease \n        that affects the lungs, gradually robbing a person of the \n        ability to breathe.\n            (2) More than 200,000 individuals may be living with PF in \n        the United States, 48,000 individuals in the United States are \n        diagnosed with PF annually, and as many as 40,000 die annually.\n            (3) Prevalence of PF has increased more than 150 percent \n        since 2001, and is expected to continue rising.\n            (4) The median survival rate for a person with PF is 2.8 \n        years.\n            (5) The cause of PF is not well understood, and in most \n        cases is unknown, though there is growing evidence that one \n        cause of PF may be environmental or occupational exposure to \n        pollutants.\n            (6) There is no Food and Drug Administration-approved \n        treatment or cure for PF.\n            (7) Public awareness of PF remains low compared to rare \n        diseases of lesser prevalence, despite PF's increasing \n        prevalence.\n            (8) There has been no federally funded national awareness \n        or educational effort to improve understanding of PF in the \n        public or medical communities, though nonprofit patient \n        education and research groups have begun to increase awareness. \n        The first Federal legislation expressing Congress's support for \n        PF research, H. Con. Res. 182, was agreed to by both Houses of \n        Congress in 2007.\n\nSEC. 3.
