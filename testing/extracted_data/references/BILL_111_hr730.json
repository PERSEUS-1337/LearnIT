FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The threat of a nuclear terrorist attack on American \n    interests, both domestic and abroad, is one of the most serious \n    threats to the national security of the United States. In the wake \n    of an attack, attribution of responsibility would be of utmost \n    importance. Because of the destructive power of a nuclear weapon, \n    there could be little forensic evidence except the radioactive \n    material in the weapon itself.\n        (2) Through advanced nuclear forensics, using both existing \n    techniques and those under development, it may be possible to \n    identify the source and pathway of a weapon or material after it is \n    interdicted or detonated. Though identifying intercepted smuggled \n    material is now possible in some cases, pre-detonation forensics is \n    a relatively undeveloped field. The post-detonation nuclear \n    forensics field is also immature, and the challenges are compounded \n    by the pressures and time constraints of performing forensics after \n    a nuclear or radiological attack.\n        (3) A robust and well-known capability to identify the source \n    of nuclear or radiological material intended for or used in an act \n    of terror could also deter prospective proliferators. Furthermore, \n    the threat of effective attribution could compel improved security \n    at material storage facilities, preventing the unwitting transfer \n    of nuclear or radiological materials.\n        (4)(A) In order to identify special nuclear material and other \n    radioactive materials confidently, it is necessary to have a robust \n    capability to acquire samples in a timely manner, analyze and \n    characterize samples, and compare samples against known signatures \n    of nuclear and radiological material.\n        (B) Many of the radioisotopes produced in the detonation of a \n    nuclear device have short half-lives, so the timely acquisition of \n    samples is of the utmost importance. Over the past several decades, \n    the ability of the United States to gather atmospheric samples--\n    often the preferred method of sample acquisition--has diminished. \n    This ability must be restored and modern techniques that could \n    complement or replace existing techniques should be pursued.\n        (C) The discipline of pre-detonation forensics is a relatively \n    undeveloped field. The radiation associated with a nuclear or \n    radiological device may affect traditional forensics techniques in \n    unknown ways. In a post-detonation scenario, radiochemistry may \n    provide the most useful tools for analysis and characterization of \n    samples. The number of radiochemistry programs and radiochemists in \n    United States National Laboratories and universities has \n    dramatically declined over the past several decades. The narrowing \n    pipeline of qualified people into this critical field is a serious \n    impediment to maintaining a robust and credible nuclear forensics \n    program.\n        (5) Once samples have been acquired and characterized, it is \n    necessary to compare the results against samples of known material \n    from reactors, weapons, and enrichment facilities, and from \n    medical, academic, commercial, and other facilities containing such \n    materials, throughout the world. Some of these samples are \n    available to the International Atomic Energy Agency through \n    safeguards agreements, and some countries maintain internal sample \n    databases. Access to samples in many countries is limited by \n    national security concerns.\n        (6) In order to create a sufficient deterrent, it is necessary \n    to have the capability to positively identify the source of nuclear \n    or radiological material, and potential traffickers in nuclear or \n    radiological material must be aware of that capability. \n    International cooperation may be essential to catalogue all \n    existing sources of nuclear or radiological material.\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS FOR FORENSICS \nCOOPERATION.\n    It is the sense of the Congress that the President should--\n        (1) pursue bilateral and multilateral international agreements \n    to establish, or seek to establish under the auspices of existing \n    bilateral or multilateral agreements, an international framework \n    for determining the source of any confiscated nuclear or \n    radiological material or weapon, as well as the source of any \n    detonated weapon and the nuclear or radiological material used in \n    such a weapon;\n        (2) develop protocols for the data exchange and dissemination \n    of sensitive information relating to nuclear or radiological \n    materials and samples of controlled nuclear or radiological \n    materials, to the extent required by the agreements entered into \n    under paragraph (1); and\n        (3) develop expedited protocols for the data exchange and \n    dissemination of sensitive information needed to publicly identify \n    the source of a nuclear detonation.\nSEC. 4.
