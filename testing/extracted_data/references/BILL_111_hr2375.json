FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a \n        political and ideological military organization of Iran's \n        government, separate from the Iranian military. It globally \n        spreads Iran's ideology to terrorist groups and began deploying \n        fighters abroad during the Iran-Iraq War in an effort to spread \n        the ideology of the Iranian Revolution throughout the Middle \n        East.\n            (2) The Qods Force, a paramilitary arm of the IRGC, was \n        created to conduct foreign operations--beginning in Iraq's \n        Kurdish region--and to forge relationships with Shiite and \n        Kurdish groups. A Qods unit was also deployed to Lebanon in \n        1982, where it helped to form Hizballah.\n            (3) The IRGC was designated as an entity of proliferation \n        concern under Executive Order 13382 on October 21, 2007, and \n        the Qods Force was designated as a terrorism supporting entity \n        under Executive Order 13224 on October 25, 2007.\n            (4) To further the support of terrorism abroad, Iran's \n        government allows the IRGC to raise funds and own businesses. \n        The IRGC often operates through front businesses and affiliate \n        groups.\n            (5) The IRGC and Qods Force front businesses and affiliate \n        groups represent an important part of the Iranian economy. The \n        National Iranian Gas Company issued one such firm, Khatam-ol-\n        Anbia (Ghorb), a $1.3 billion contract to construct Iran's \n        seventh gas pipeline. In June 2006, Pars Oil and Gas Company, a \n        subsidiary of the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company, \n        awarded Ghorb a $2.3 billion contract to develop Phases 15-16 \n        of Iran's South Pars development--the world's second largest \n        gas field. In July 2006, Tehran Urban & Suburban Railway \n        Company granted Ghorb a $1.2 billion contract to build the \n        seventh line of Tehran's metro system and a $350 million civil \n        engineering contract for the fourth line.\n            (6) In 2008, IRGC naval ships aggressively approached the \n        USS Port Royal, USS Hopper, and USS Ingraham, during a routine \n        transit at the Strait of Hormuz.\n            (7) Members of the IRGC captured 15 British sailors and \n        marines who were inspecting ships in the Persian Gulf near the \n        demarcation line that separates the territorial waters of Iran \n        and Iraq.\n            (8) In December 2006 and January 2007, Iranian surrogates--\n        the Qazali and Sheibani networks, which are now collectively \n        referred to as the Special Groups--stepped up their attacks on \n        Iraqi and Coalition forces. The Qazali network conducted \n        sophisticated operations against United States forces at the \n        Karbala Joint Provincial Coordination Center, kidnapping and \n        killing five United States soldiers during the aborted \n        operation.\n            (9) The Qods Force has provided aid in the form of weapons, \n        training, and funding to Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, the \n        Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, \n        Hizballah, Iraq-based militants, and Taliban fighters in \n        Afghanistan.\n            (10) The United States military reported in February 2007 \n        that the Qods Force was furnishing assistance to Shiite \n        militias in Iraq to assemble improvised explosive devices \n        (IEDs) and explosively formed projectiles (EFPs) that had been \n        used to kill over 150 United States service personnel.\n            (11) United States commanders in Afghanistan--along with \n        the Department of State's Report on International Terrorism for \n        2007 and 2008--have cited specific weapons shipments by Iran, \n        implemented by the Qods Force, to Taliban militants in \n        Afghanistan. The Qods Force provided training to the Taliban on \n        small unit tactics, small arms, explosives, and indirect fire \n        weapons. Since at least 2006, Iran has arranged arms shipments \n        including small arms and associated ammunition, rocket \n        propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107-mm rockets, and plastic \n        explosives to select Taliban members.\n\nSEC. 3.
