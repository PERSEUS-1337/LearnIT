FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Reference product license or approval holders are \n        restricting competitive access to reference products by \n        sponsors seeking to develop drugs, generic drugs, and \n        biosimilars under section 505(b)(2) or 505(j) of the Food, \n        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(2) and 355(j)) and \n        under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 262(k)). These restrictions are deterring and delaying \n        development of drugs, generic drugs and biosimilars by \n        extending lawful patent-based monopolies beyond their lawful \n        patent life.\n            (2) The enforcement provisions set forth in section 505-\n        1(f)(8) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n        355-1(f)(8)) have not been sufficient to prevent anti-\n        competitive practices that interfere with access to reference \n        products which is necessary for the timely development of \n        affordable drugs, generic drugs, and biosimilars.\n            (3) There is not a regulatory structure in place that is \n        sufficient to deter or remedy the anti-competitive harm that \n        results when--\n                    (A) access to reference products is restricted to \n                sponsors developing drugs, generic drugs, or \n                biosimilars in accordance with section 505(b)(2) or \n                505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n                U.S.C. 355(b)(2) or 355(j)), and section 351(k) of the \n                Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), \n                respectively; or\n                    (B) license holders impede the prompt negotiation \n                and development of a single, shared system of elements \n                to assure safe use and supporting agreements under \n                section 505-1(i)(1)(B) of such Act (21 U.S.C. 355-\n                1(i)(1)(B)), on commercially reasonable terms.\n            (4) Requiring license holders to comply with requirements \n        for competitive access to their products, and for the \n        negotiation and development of single, shared systems of \n        elements to assure safe use under section 505-1(i)(1)(B) of the \n        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-\n        1(i)(1)(B)), and subjecting license holders to liability for \n        failing to do so, will not impose obligations on the courts \n        that they cannot adequately and reasonably adjudicate.\n\nSEC. 3. COMPETITIVE ACCESS TO COVERED PRODUCTS FOR DEVELOPMENT \n              PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 505-1 \nof such Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1) the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 505-2.
