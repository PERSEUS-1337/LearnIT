FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The island of Vieques, Puerto Rico, is known for the \n        natural beauty of its coastal features such as beaches, \n        lagoons, and bioluminescent bays.\n            (2) Such bioluminescence is the result of the production \n        and emission of light by a chemical reaction within a living \n        organism, the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense, when it is \n        agitated.\n            (3) Puerto Mosquito Bay in Vieques is of national and \n        international significance because it is among the brightest \n        bioluminescent marine areas in the world.\n            (4) The unique biological and physical properties of Puerto \n        Mosquito Bay, such as its rate of water exchange with the \n        ocean, water quality, and adjacent mangroves, contribute to a \n        high density of the bioluminescent dinoflagellate Pyrodinium \n        bahamense in its waters.\n            (5) Puerto Mosquito Bay is of great ecological, cultural, \n        scientific, educational, and economic value to present and \n        future generations.\n            (6) Puerto Mosquito Bay is of particular value to the \n        residents of Puerto Rico because its nearly unparalleled \n        bioluminescence creates a sense of local pride, wonder, and \n        enjoyment, and attracts visitors who support the local economy.\n            (7) Puerto Mosquito Bay's ecosystem is fragile and its \n        ecological integrity is subject to damage or loss from a \n        variety of potential disturbances.\n            (8) The popularity of Puerto Mosquito Bay is a potential \n        threat because of increasing visitation and related impacts.\n            (9) The unique characteristics of Puerto Mosquito Bay also \n        make it vulnerable to physical, biological, and other \n        disturbances as in other documented cases where bioluminescent \n        bays have been degraded.\n            (10) Action is needed to provide comprehensive protection \n        that would complement current Federal and local management \n        activities.\n            (11) The agencies of the United States need to cooperate \n        fully to achieve the necessary protection of both terrestrial \n        areas adjacent to and marine resources within Puerto Mosquito \n        Bay.\n            (12) The Federal Government and the Government of Puerto \n        Rico should jointly develop and implement a comprehensive \n        program to protect nearby terrestrial and marine areas to \n        maintain water quality and other environmental characteristics \n        that contribute to the unique nature of Puerto Mosquito Bay.\n            (13) Designation of Puerto Mosquito Bay as a United Nations \n        Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization Biosphere \n        Reserve would complement designation as a National Marine \n        Sanctuary by enhancing research, management, and education \n        through international communication and cooperation.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to protect and \npreserve the natural resources of Puerto Mosquito Bay, Puerto Rico, \nwith special consideration for the bioluminescent organisms that make \nthis area unique.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to protect the resources of the area of Puerto Mosquito \n        Bay, Puerto Rico, described in section 4(b);\n            (2) to educate and interpret for the public the unique \n        elements of the Puerto Mosquito Bay environment;\n            (3) to utilize the best available science to monitor and \n        manage the sanctuary to ensure its survival; and\n            (4) to manage human uses of the Puerto Mosquito Bay \n        National Marine Sanctuary designated by section 4(a) consistent \n        with this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.

At least 30 days prior to such termination, the Secretary \n        shall submit written notification of the proposed termination \n        to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of \n        the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House \n        of Representatives.\n    (d) Boundary Modifications.--No later than the date of issuance of \nthe draft environmental impact statement for the Sanctuary under \nsection 304(a)(1)(C)(vii) of the Marine Protection, Research, and \nSanctuaries Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1434(a)(1)(C)(vii)), the Secretary, \nin consultation with the Governor of Puerto Rico, if appropriate, may \nmake modifications to the boundaries of the Sanctuary as necessary to \nfulfill the purposes of this Act.
