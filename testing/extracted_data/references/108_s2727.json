FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In recent years, foreign language needs have \n        significantly increased throughout the Federal Government due \n        to the presence of a wider range of security threats, the \n        emergence of new nation states, and the globalization of the \n        United States economy.\n            (2) Likewise, American businesses increasingly need \n        internationally and multiculturally experienced employees to \n        compete in the global economy and to manage a culturally \n        diverse workforce.\n            (3) Currently, the Federal Government requires 34,000 \n        employees with foreign language skills across more than 70 \n        Federal agencies.\n            (4) Federal agency officials have stated that, over the \n        years, translator and interpreter shortfalls have adversely \n        affected agency operations and hindered United States military, \n        law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic \n        efforts.\n            (5) In a 2002 General Accounting Office report, the United \n        States Army reported that it was experiencing serious \n        shortfalls of translators and interpreters in 5 of its 6 \n        critical languages: Arabic, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Persian-\n        Farsi, and Russian.\n            (6) The number of Foreign Language and Area Studies \n        Fellowships awarded in 2003 was 30 percent less than the number \n        awarded at its high point in 1967.\n            (7) In the 2000-2001 school year, the number of foreign \n        language degrees conferred was 1 percent of the total \n        undergraduate degrees conferred, less than .05 percent of the \n        total masters degrees conferred, and 1 percent of the total \n        doctoral degrees conferred.\n            (8) In the 2003 National Survey of Student Engagement, only \n        \\2/5\\ of undergraduates reported taking foreign language \n        coursework, while only 1 in 5 reported having studied abroad.\n            (9) Only 1 percent of all United States undergraduates \n        studied abroad in the 2001-2002 school year.\n            (10) In 2002, 79 percent of Americans agreed that students \n        should have a study-abroad experience sometime during college.\n            (11) More than 40 percent of Americans said they were more \n        likely to favor an increase in State funding for foreign \n        language education at their local college or university after \n        September 11, 2001.\n\nSEC. 3.
