FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The American Society of Reproductive Medicine \n        recognizes infertility as a disease, and the Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention have described infertility as an \n        emerging public health priority in the United States. Globally, \n        the World Health Organization also formally recognizes \n        infertility as a disease.\n            (2) According to the National Survey of Family Growth of \n        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately \n        3,000,000 women in the United States had trouble conceiving or \n        carrying a pregnancy to term.\n            (3) A portion of those 3,000,000 women are cancer survivors \n        who were diagnosed as infants, children, or young adults. Their \n        treatments included chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery which \n        have led to irreparable damage to their reproductive systems.\n            (4) Military families notably are also impacted by \n        infertility as a result of lower extremity war injuries arising \n        from the perils of modern warfare. For active duty individuals, \n        frequent changes in permanent duty station, combat deployments, \n        and training rotations complicate access to fertility \n        treatments. In addition, active duty individuals or veterans \n        have no coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF) through their \n        military health insurance and must pay out of pocket for those \n        expenses, even within military treatment facilities.\n            (5) For many, the cost of treatment for the disease of \n        infertility is prohibitive. According to the American Society \n        for Reproductive Medicine, the cost per cycle of IVF is \n        approximately $12,500, and on average couples require at least \n        2 cycles. Many couples have to choose between their desire to \n        establish a family and their future financial well-being.\n            (6) Medical insurance coverage for infertility treatments \n        is sparse and inconsistent at the State level. Only 8 States \n        have passed laws to require comprehensive infertility coverage, \n        and under those State laws employer-sponsored plans are exempt; \n        therefore, coverage for treatments such as IVF is limited. \n        According to Mercer's 2005 National Survey of Employer-\n        Sponsored Health Plans, IVF was voluntarily covered by 19 \n        percent of large employer-sponsored health plans and only 11 \n        percent of small employer-sponsored health plans. Even in \n        States with coverage mandates, out-of-pocket expenses for these \n        treatments are significant.\n            (7) According to the latest National Survey of Family \n        Growth, African-American and Hispanic women are more likely to \n        be infertile than Caucasian women, yet studies indicate that \n        they are less likely to use infertility services.\n\nSEC. 3. CREDIT FOR CERTAIN INFERTILITY TREATMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting before \nsection 24 the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 23A.
