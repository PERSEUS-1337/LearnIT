REFERENDA.\n\n    (a) Policy of the United States.--(1) In general.--It is the policy \nof the United States that the residents of Puerto Rico periodically \nshould be afforded an opportunity freely to express their wishes \nregarding their political status.--\n    (2) Options.--The self-determination process for Puerto Rico should \nbe one that enables the people of Puerto Rico to preserve their current \npolitical status if that is their preference, or to choose to seek, in \naccordance with a process approved by Congress and the residents of \nPuerto Rico--\n                    (A) admission as a State of the Union on the basis \n                of full equality; or\n                    (B) withdrawal of United States sovereignty in \n                favor of independence or free association.\n    (b) Requirements.--A referendum under this Act--\n            (1) shall be conducted among persons in Puerto Rico who \n        meet the residency, United States citizenship, and other \n        requirements of applicable law governing voter eligibility in \n        Puerto Rico;\n            (2) shall otherwise be in accordance with applicable \n        provisions of the elections law of Puerto Rico and other \n        relevant local and Federal law consistent with this Act; and\n            (3) shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast.\n    (c) Referendum by the End of 1998.--\n            (1) In general.--A referendum under this Act shall be \n        conducted not later than December 31, 1998.\n            (2) Format.--\n                    (A) Part one of the ballot.--In the referendum \n                under paragraph (1), the option of continuing the \n                current Commonwealth arrangements and Puerto Rico's \n                current political status, or, alternatively, entering \n                on a process leading to permanent full self-government \n                through separate sovereignty or statehood, shall be \n                presented in Part One of the ballot as Options A and B, \n                as follows:\n\n                               ``part one\n\n            ``Option A.--COMMONWEALTH: The residents of Puerto Rico \n        desire to continue the current Commonwealth structure for self-\n        government with respect to internal affairs and administration \n        under a local constitution, subject to the provisions of the \n        Constitution and laws of the United States that apply to Puerto \n        Rico. Puerto Rico will remain an unincorporated territory of \n        the United States, and application of Federal law and \n        provisions of the Constitution to Puerto Rico remains within \n        the discretion of Congress. The future status of Puerto Rico \n        will be determined through a process authorized by Congress \n        that includes self-determination by the residents of Puerto \n        Rico in periodic referenda.\n            ``Option B.--PATH TO SEPARATE SOVEREIGNTY OR STATEHOOD: The \n        residents of Puerto Rico desire to enter on a process for \n        Congress and the residents of Puerto Rico to define and approve \n        in a later vote a transition to permanent full self-government \n        through either separate sovereignty or statehood as set forth \n        in Part Two of this ballot.''.\n                    (B) Part two of the ballot.--Part Two of the ballot \n                shall present voters with a choice between 2 options \n                for ending the current territorial status in favor of \n                separate sovereignty, in the form of independence, or \n                free association as may be agreed, according to \n                international law and definitions compatible with the \n                constitutional process and practices of the United \n                States, or, alternatively, full integration into the \n                United States constitutional system on the basis of \n                equality. The definitions of separate sovereignty and \n                full integration leading to statehood shall appear in \n                Part Two of the ballot as Options A and B, as follows:\n            ``Option A.--SEPARATE SOVEREIGNTY: The residents of Puerto \n        Rico desire to be a separate sovereign nation that exercises \n        all the powers of government with respect to its territory and \n        population, with full authority and responsibility for its \n        internal and external affairs, through independence (or free \n        association as may be agreed). Puerto Rico will become fully \n        self-governing under its own constitution establishing a \n        republican form of government, which shall be the supreme law. \n        The United States Constitution and laws shall no longer apply, \n        and the sovereignty, nationality, and citizenship of the United \n        States in Puerto Rico shall terminate based on approval of \n        separate sovereignty by Congress and the residents of Puerto \n        Rico. Birth in Puerto Rico or relationship to a person who \n        acquired United States citizenship by statute due to birth in \n        Puerto Rico during the territorial period no longer will confer \n        United States citizenship, but such persons shall have a right \n        to retain statutory United States citizenship for life based on \n        continued allegiance to the United States and election or \n        designation as prescribed by Congress consistent with the \n        transition to separate sovereignty and succession of \n        nationality.\n            ``Option B.--STATEHOOD: The residents of Puerto Rico desire \n        admission of Puerto Rico as a State of the Union. Through \n        statehood residents of Puerto Rico will have a status and \n        rights secured under the United States Constitution, which will \n        be the supreme law of the land with the same force and effect \n        as in the other States of the Union. The sovereign State of \n        Puerto Rico will be in permanent union with the United States, \n        and powers not delegated to the Federal Government or \n        prohibited to the States by the United States Constitution \n        shall be reserved to the people of Puerto Rico or the State \n        Government. The United States nationality and citizenship of \n        persons born in Puerto Rico will be guaranteed in the same way \n        it is for all United States citizens born in other States of \n        the Union. United States citizens in Puerto Rico will have full \n        and equal rights and duties of United States citizenship, \n        including voting rights in elections for President and Vice \n        President, as well as representation by 2 members in the United \n        States Senate and proportionally on the basis of population in \n        the House of Representatives.''.\n            (3) Instructions to voters.--\n                    (A) Part one.--The instructions to voters for Part \n                One of the ballot in a referendum under this subsection \n                shall state that a voter may select Option A or Option \n                B by marking either option, but that ballots with both \n                options marked in Part One will not be counted.\n                    (B) Part two.--The instructions to voters for Part \n                Two of the ballot in such a referendum shall state that \n                a voter may vote on Part Two regardless of how the \n                voter voted on Part One, or even if they did not vote \n                on Part One. The instructions to voters on Part Two \n                shall also state that Part Two is to determine the \n                preference of voters as between the options for seeking \n                separate sovereignty or statehood in case a majority of \nthe voters voting on Part One approve that course as set forth in \nOption B on Part One of the ballot. The voters shall be instructed to \napprove Option A or Option B in Part Two by marking either, but that \nballots with both options marked in Part Two will not be counted.\n            (4) Validity of either part.--On any ballot cast in a \n        referendum under this subsection either Part One or Part Two \n        shall be counted if properly cast, even if the other part of \n        the ballot is not counted due to the manner in which the other \n        part has been cast.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n    (a) Selection of Current Status or Rejection of Transition.--If a \nmajority of the voters approve continuation of the current \nunincorporated status and the present `Commonwealth' structure for \nlocal self-government, or on rejection of a transition plan, unless \notherwise provided by Congress, referenda on the future political \nstatus of Puerto Rico shall be held in accordance with this Act every 4 \nyears thereafter, but not within 270 calendar days of a general \nelection, in order to ensure that the right of the people of Puerto \nRico to self-determination is respected, and that the people \nperiodically are afforded the opportunity freely to express their \nwishes with respect to resolution of Puerto Rico's status based on \npermanent full self-government.\n    (b) Selection of Statehood.--If statehood is selected, the \nPresident, not later than 180 days after the referendum, shall transmit \nto the Congress legislation providing for the admission of Puerto Rico \nas a State of the Union in accordance with a transition plan that \nincludes procedures for approval of the terms of admission and \nimplementation thereof by a majority vote of the residents of Puerto \nRico.\n    (c) Selection of Separate Sovereignty.--If separate sovereignty is \nselected, the President, not later than 180 days after the referendum, \nshall transmit to the Congress legislation to providing a plan for the \ntransition to an international sovereign-to-sovereign relationship \ngoverned by a treaty or international agreement (including measures to \ncease conferral of United States citizenship on persons born in Puerto \nRico), and such legislation shall include procedures for approval of \nthe transition to separate sovereignty by a majority vote of the \nresidents of Puerto Rico."
