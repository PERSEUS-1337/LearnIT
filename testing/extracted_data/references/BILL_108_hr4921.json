FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) a severe to extreme drought affected approximately 15 \n        percent of the contiguous United States as of the end of April \n        2004,\n            (2) about 32 percent of the contiguous United States fell \n        in the moderate to extreme drought categories at the end of \n        April 2004,\n            (3) the Colorado River system is facing the worst drought \n        on record,\n            (4) the drought throughout the western United States could \n        persist for up to another 30 years,\n            (5) growing populations and changing values have increased \n        demands on water supplies and river systems, resulting in water \n        use and management conflicts throughout the country, \n        particularly in the West, where the population is expected to \n        increase at least 30 percent in the next 20-25 years, and\n            (6) unless highly efficient water usage practices can be \n        developed and maintained in the West, it will not be possible \n        to provide the water needed to sustain western ecosystems, as \n        well as population growth.\n\nSEC. 3.
