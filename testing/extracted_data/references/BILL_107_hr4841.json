FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The first European exploration of the Hudson River and \n        Lake Champlain and the introduction of steam navigation to \n        maritime commerce were events of major historical importance, \n        both in the United States and internationally.\n            (2) In 1609, Englishman Henry Hudson, acting in service of \n        the Dutch East India Company, was the first European to sail up \n        the river later named for him in the vessel HALF MOON, and \n        French explorer Samuel de Champlain was the first European to \n        see the lake later named for him.\n            (3) These voyages were 2 of the most significant passages \n        in the European exploration and discovery of America, and began \n        2 of the earliest contacts in the New World between Native \n        Americans and Europeans.\n            (4) These explorations led to the establishment of Fort \n        Orange, Dutch and later English settlement of what is now the \n        capital city of the State of New York, and settlement of French \n        Quebec settlements as far south as Lake George. From these \n        early settlements came an influence on our history, culture, \n        law, commerce, and traditions of liberty which extends to the \n        present day, and which is constantly reflected in the position \n        of the United States as the leader of the nations of the free \n        world.\n            (5) In 1807, Robert Fulton navigated the Hudson River from \n        the city of New York to Albany in the steamboat CLERMONT, \n        successfully inaugurating steam navigation on a commercial \n        basis. This event is one of the most important events in the \n        history of navigation. It revolutionized waterborne commerce on \n        the great rivers of the United States, transformed naval \n        warfare, and fostered international relations through \n        transoceanic travel and trade.\n            (6) The National Park Service owns and operates significant \n        resources in New York related to the early history of the \n        nation and the Hudson River Valley.\n            (7) In 2002 the State of New York enacted legislation \n        establishing a State Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Commission.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the Hudson-\nFulton-Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission to--\n            (1) ensure a suitable national observance of the Henry \n        Hudson, Robert Fulton, and Samuel de Champlain 2009 \n        anniversaries through cooperation with and assistance to the \n        programs and activities of New York, New Jersey, and Vermont;\n            (2) assist in ensuring that Hudson-Fulton-Champlain 2009 \n        observances provide an excellent visitor experience and \n        beneficial interaction between visitors and the natural and \n        cultural resources of the New York, New Jersey, and Vermont \n        sites;\n            (3) assist in ensuring that Hudson-Fulton-Champlain 2009 \n        observances are inclusive and appropriately recognize the \n        diverse Hudson River and Lake Champlain communities that \n        developed over 4 centuries;\n            (4) facilitate international involvement in the Hudson-\n        Fulton-Champlain 2009 observances;\n            (5) support and facilitate marketing efforts for a \n        commemorative coin, a commemorative stamp, and related \n        activities for the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain 2009 observances; \n        and\n            (6) assist in the appropriate development of heritage \n        tourism and economic benefits to the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
