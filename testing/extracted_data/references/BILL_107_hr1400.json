FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price \n        discrimination practices that compel many older Americans to \n        pay substantially more for prescription drugs than consumers in \n        foreign nations and the drug manufacturers' most favored U.S. \n        customers, such as health insurers, health maintenance \n        organizations, and the Federal Government.\n            (2) Older Americans who buy their own prescription drugs \n        often pay twice as much for prescription drugs as consumers in \n        foreign nations and the drug manufacturers' most favored U.S. \n        customers. In some cases, older Americans pay 10 times more for \n        prescription drugs than such customers.\n            (3) The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers \n        sustains their high profits (for example, $27,300,000,000 in \n        1999), but causes financial hardship and impairs the health and \n        well-being of millions of older Americans. Many older Americans \n        are forced to choose between buying their food and buying their \n        medicines.\n            (4) Foreign nations and U.S. federally funded health care \n        programs use purchasing power to obtain prescription drugs at \n        low prices. Medicare beneficiaries are denied this benefit and \n        cannot obtain their prescription drugs at the lower prices \n        available to such nations and programs.\n            (5) Implementation of the policy set forth in this Act will \n        reduce prices for brand name prescription drugs for many \n        Medicare beneficiaries by an average of 40 percent.\n            (6) In addition to substantially lowering the costs of \n        prescription drugs for older Americans, implementation of the \n        policy set forth in this Act will significantly improve the \n        health and well-being of older Americans and lower the costs to \n        the Federal taxpayer of the Medicare program.\n            (7) Older Americans who are terminally ill and receiving \n        hospice care services represent some of the most vulnerable \n        individuals in our nation. Making prescription drugs available \n        to Medicare beneficiaries under the care of Medicare-certified \n        hospices will assist in extending the benefits of lower \n        prescription drug prices to those most vulnerable and in need.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers and to \nmake prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at \nsubstantially reduced prices.\n\nSEC. 3. PARTICIPATING MANUFACTURERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Each participating manufacturer of a covered \noutpatient drug shall make available for purchase by each pharmacy such \ncovered outpatient drug in the amount described in subsection (b) at \nthe price described in subsection (c).\n    (b) Description of Amount of Drugs.--The amount of a covered \noutpatient drug that a participating manufacturer shall make available \nfor purchase by a pharmacy is an amount equal to the aggregate amount \nof the covered outpatient drug sold or distributed by the pharmacy to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n    (c) Description of Price.--The price at which a participating \nmanufacturer shall make a covered outpatient drug available for \npurchase by a pharmacy is a price no greater than the manufacturer's \naverage foreign price.\n    (d) Enforcement.--The United States shall debar a manufacturer of \ndrugs or biologicals that does not comply with the provisions of this \nAct.\n\nSEC. 4. SPECIAL PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO HOSPICE PROGRAMS.\n\n    For purposes of determining the amount of a covered outpatient drug \nthat a participating manufacturer shall make available for purchase by \na pharmacy under section 3, there shall be included in the calculation \nof such amount the amount of the covered outpatient drug sold or \ndistributed by a pharmacy to a hospice program. In calculating such \namount, only amounts of the covered outpatient drug furnished to a \nMedicare beneficiary enrolled in the hospice program shall be included.\n\nSEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n    The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to \nimplement this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. REPORTS TO CONGRESS REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF ACT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall \nreport to the Congress regarding the effectiveness of this Act in--\n            (1) protecting Medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory \n        pricing by drug manufacturers, and\n            (2) making prescription drugs available to Medicare \n        beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices.\n    (b) Consultation.--In preparing such reports, the Secretary shall \nconsult with public health experts, affected industries, organizations \nrepresenting consumers and older Americans, and other interested \npersons.\n    (c) Recommendations.--The Secretary shall include in such reports \nany recommendations the Secretary considers appropriate for changes in \nthis Act to further reduce the cost of covered outpatient drugs to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n\nSEC. 7.
