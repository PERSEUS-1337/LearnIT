FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) approximately 60 percent of fish and wildlife in the \n        United States are on private land;\n            (2) it is imperative to facilitate private landowner-\n        centered and results-oriented efforts that promote efficient \n        and innovative ways to protect and enhance natural resources;\n            (3) there is no readily available source of technical \n        biological information that the public can access to assist \n        with the application of state-of-the-art techniques to restore, \n        enhance, and manage fish and wildlife habitats;\n            (4) a voluntary cost-effective program that leverages \n        public and private funds to assist private landowners in the \n        conduct of state-of-the-art fish and wildlife habitat \n        restoration, enhancement, and management projects is needed;\n            (5) durable partnerships working collaboratively with \n        willing private landowners to implement on-the-ground projects \n        has lead to the reduction of endangered species listings;\n            (6) Executive Order No. 13352 (69 Fed. Reg. 52989) directs \n        the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and \n        Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency to pursue new \n        cooperative conservation programs involving the collaboration \n        of Federal, State, local, and tribal governments, private for-\n        profit and non-profit institutions, non-governmental entities, \n        and individuals;\n            (7) since 1987, the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program \n        has exemplified cooperative conservation as an innovative, \n        voluntary partnership program that helps private landowners \n        restore wetland and other important fish and wildlife habitat; \n        and\n            (8) through 33,103 agreements with private landowners, the \n        Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program has accomplished the \n        restoration of 677,000 acres of wetland, 1,253,700 acres of \n        prairie and native grasslands, and 5,560 miles of riparian and \n        in-stream habitat since 1987, demonstrating much of that \n        success since only 2001.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \nrestoration, enhancement, and management of fish and wildlife habitats \non private land through the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, a \nprogram that works with private landowners to conduct cost-effective \nhabitat projects for the benefit of fish and wildlife resources in the \nUnited States.\n\nSEC. 3.
