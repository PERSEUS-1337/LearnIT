FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The territory of Puerto Rico has a population of more \n        than 3.4 million, and United States citizenship has been \n        granted to individuals born in the islands for one hundred \n        years.\n            (2) The territory has an insular government that, subject \n        to Federal law, exercises authority similar to that possessed \n        by the governments of the several States.\n            (3) The United States citizens of Puerto Rico are not \n        treated equally in Federal law with citizens in the States and \n        do not have representation in their national government other \n        than that provided by a sole resident commissioner who can only \n        vote in committees of the House of Representatives to which she \n        or he is assigned.\n            (4) An overwhelming majority of the United States citizens \n        residing in Puerto Rico want to replace territory status with a \n        permanent form of government that provides for equality and for \n        democratic representation in the making of their national laws.\n            (5) It has been the longstanding policy of the United \n        States that the American citizens of the territory can \n        determine whether it should eventually become a State or a \n        nation.\n            (6) In a plebiscite held in Puerto Rico under local law, a \n        majority of the vote rejected continuation of the current \n        territory status, with more than 61.1 percent petitioning the \n        Congress and the President for statehood and a transition to \n        equality and permanence within the Union of States.\n            (7) Public Law 113-76 responded to the plebiscite under \n        territorial law by providing for a plebiscite under Federal law \n        on an option or options proposed by the Elections Commission of \n        Puerto Rico that can resolve the question of the territory's \n        status and are found by the Department of Justice to not \n        conflict with the Constitution, laws, and policies of the \n        United States.\n            (8) The Governor, two-thirds majorities of each house of \n        the Legislative Assembly, and the Resident Commissioner of \n        Puerto Rico elected in November 2016 were voted into office on \n        a platform of seeking equality and permanence for Puerto Rico \n        within the United States.\n            (9) Puerto Rico is treated as a State for the purposes of \n        most laws but is not treated equally with the States under \n        dozens of statutes, including some providing for major health \n        and other programs for individuals with critical needs and in a \n        number of revenue measures.\n            (10) The limitations of, and treatment under, territory \n        status has left Puerto Rico under-developed and substantially \n        contributed to its economy being weak for four decades and in \n        depression for the last one.\n            (11) Millions of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico have \n        moved to a State for the greater opportunity and better way of \n        life possible in a State.\n            (12) Equality within the Nation is required for a healthy \n        American economy and essential for Puerto Rico's social and \n        economic health as well as for basic reasons of democracy.\n            (13) Puerto Ricans have contributed greatly to the Nation \n        in all fields of endeavor both in war and in peace.\n            (14) Puerto Rico should be transitioned into equality \n        within the Union.\n\nSEC. 3. PROCESS FOR REPLACING TERRITORY STATUS.\n\n    (a) Consistent with Public Law 113-76, it is the policy of the \nUnited States that the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico may choose whether \nPuerto Rico will become a State or a nation through a plebiscite under \nthat law.\n    (b) If the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico reaffirm the territory's \nchoice of statehood through a plebiscite under Public Law 113-76, \nFederal laws that do not apply to Puerto Rico or apply differently to \nthe territory than to the several States are amended or repealed to \nphase in the equal treatment of Puerto Rico with the several States by \nJanuary 3, 2025, as shall be provided for in a plan submitted to the \nCongress and the President not later than 270 days after the enactment \nof this Act by the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status, and \nPuerto Rico shall become a State on January 3, 2025.\n\nSEC. 4.
