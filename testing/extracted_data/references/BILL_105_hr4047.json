FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Florida Keys are a chain of islands located \n        adjacent to spectacular, unique, and nationally significant \n        marine environments, including North America's only living \n        coral barrier reef ecosystem.\n            (2) Recognizing the national significance of the Florida \n        Keys marine environment and the compelling national interest in \n        the protection of these resources, Congress passed the Florida \n        Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act (104 Stat. \n        3089-3095) designating the Florida Keys National Marine \n        Sanctuary.\n            (3) Section 8(a)(1) of such Act directed the Administrator \n        and the Governor of the State of Florida, in consultation with \n        the Secretary of Commerce, to develop a comprehensive water \n        quality protection program for the Sanctuary.\n            (4) Section 8(a)(1)(A) of such Act states that a purpose of \n        such water quality program is to recommend priority corrective \n        actions and compliance schedules addressing point and nonpoint \n        sources of pollution to restore and maintain the chemical, \n        physical, and biological integrity of the Sanctuary, including \n        restoration and maintenance of a balanced, indigenous \n        population of corals, shellfish, fish and wildlife, and \n        recreational activities in and on the water.\n            (5) Section 8(d)(2)(A) of such Act provided for the \n        establishment of the Water Quality Steering Committee that is \n        co-chaired by the Regional Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency and a representative of the State of Florida \n        to set guidance and policy for the development and \n        implementation of water quality improvement projects.\n            (6) Section 8(d)(2)(C) of such Act provided for the \n        establishment of a Technical Advisory Committee comprised of \n        scientists from Federal agencies, State agencies, academic \n        institutions, private nonprofit organizations, and \n        knowledgeable citizens to advise the Water Quality Steering \n        Committee.\n            (7) Section 8(a)(1)(B) of such Act states that another \n        purpose of the water quality protection program is to assign \n        responsibilities for the implementation of the program among \n        the Governor of the State of Florida, the Secretary of \n        Commerce, and the Administrator in accordance with applicable \n        Federal and State laws.\n            (8) Dilapidated and inadequate wastewater treatment systems \n        and inadequate stormwater management systems are the largest \n        manmade sources of pollution to the nearshore waters of the \n        Florida Key's, representing the greatest threat to their \n        nationally significant marine resources.\n            (9) The United States Environmental Protection Agency, \n        other Federal, State, and local agencies and citizen \n        stakeholders have identified wastewater infrastructure \n        improvements as the single most important investment to improve \n        nearshore water quality around the Florida Keys. Improvement of \n        stormwater management in the area of the Florida keys is also \n        needed to reduce pollutant loadings from largely uncontrolled \n        stormwater runoff from existing development.\n            (10) The cost of wastewater improvements necessary to \n        improve nearshore water quality around the Florida Keys is \n        estimated at between $184,000,000 and $418,000,000, depending \n        on the percentage reduction in wastewater nutrient loadings to \n        be achieved and which treatment system or systems are \n        ultimately selected.\n            (11) The cost of stormwater improvements necessary to \n        reduce such pollutant loadings is estimated at between \n        $370,000,000 and $680,000,000, depending on the percentage \n        reduction in stormwater pollutant loadings to be achieved and \nwhich areas are selected to be retrofitted.\n            (12) The cost of these necessary improvements represent an \n        insurmountable burden to the 85,000 permanent residents of \n        Monroe County, Florida.\n            (13) It is necessary to change Federal law in order to \n        carry out the Federal responsibilities identified under section \n        8(a)(1)(B) of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and \n        Protection Act.\n            (14) It is therefore entirely consistent with the goals and \n        policies of such Act that Congress authorize appropriations to \n        supplement State and local initiatives to improve water quality \n        in the Florida Keys marine environment.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to protect the resources of the Florida \nKeys National Marine Sanctuary (as designated by section 5 of the \nFlorida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act) by providing \nthe Federal share of funds for projects to replace inadequate \nwastewater treatment systems and inadequate stormwater management \nsystems in Monroe County, Florida.
