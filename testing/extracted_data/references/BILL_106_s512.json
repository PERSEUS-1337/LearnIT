FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are \n        biologically-based neurodevelopmental diseases that cause \n        severe impairments in language and communication and generally \n        manifest in young children sometime during the first two years \n        of life.\n            (2) Best estimates indicate that 1 in 500 children born \n        today will be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and \n        that 400,000 Americans have autism or an autism spectrum \n        disorder.\n            (3) There is little information on the prevalence of autism \n        and other pervasive developmental disabilities in the United \n        States. There have never been any national prevalence studies \n        in the United States, and the two studies that were conducted \n        in the 1980s examined only selected areas of the country. \n        Recent studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan suggest that the \n        prevalence of classic autism alone may be 300 percent to 400 \n        percent higher than previously estimated.\n            (4) Three quarters of those with infantile autism spend \n        their adult lives in institutions or group homes, and usually \n        enter institutions by the age of 13.\n            (5) The cost of caring for individuals with autism and \n        autism spectrum disorder is great, and is estimated to be $13.3 \n        billion per year solely for direct costs.\n            (6) The rapid advancements in biomedical science suggest \n        that effective treatments and a cure for autism are attainable \n        if--\n                    (A) there is appropriate coordination of the \n                efforts of the various agencies of the Federal \n                Government involved in biomedical research on autism \n                and autism spectrum disorders;\n                    (B) there is an increased understanding of autism \n                and autism spectrum disorders by the scientific and \n                medical communities involved in autism research and \n                treatment; and\n                    (C) sufficient funds are allocated to research.\n            (7) The discovery of effective treatments and a cure for \n        autism will be greatly enhanced when scientists and \n        epidemiologists have an accurate understanding of the \n        prevalence and incidence of autism.\n            (8) Recent research suggests that environmental factors may \n        contribute to autism. As a result, contributing causes of \n        autism, if identified, may be preventable.\n            (9) Finding the answers to the causes of autism and related \n        developmental disabilities may help researchers to understand \n        other disorders, ranging from learning problems, to \n        hyperactivity, to communications deficits that affect millions \n        of Americans.\n            (10) Specifically, more knowledge is needed concerning--\n                    (A) the underlying causes of autism and autism \n                spectrum disorders, how to treat the underlying \n                abnormality or abnormalities causing the severe \n                symptoms of autism, and how to prevent these \n                abnormalities from occurring in the future;\n                    (B) the epidemiology of, and the identification of \n                risk factors for, infantile autism and autism spectrum \n                disorders;\n                    (C) the development of methods for early medical \n                diagnosis and functional assessment of individuals with \n                autism and autism spectrum disorders, including \n                identification and assessment of the subtypes within \n                the autism spectrum disorders, for the purpose of \n                monitoring the course of the disease and developing \n                medically sound strategies for improving the outcomes \n                of such individuals;\n                    (D) existing biomedical and diagnostic data that \n                are relevant to autism and autism spectrum disorders \n                for dissemination to medical personnel, particularly \npediatricians, to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of this \ndisease; and\n                    (E) the costs incurred in educating and caring for \n                individuals with autism and autism spectrum disorders.\n            (11) In 1998, the National Institutes of Health announced a \n        program of research on autism and autism spectrum disorders. A \n        sufficient level of funding should be made available for \n        carrying out the program.\n\nSEC. 3.
