FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) crimes committed with guns threaten the peace and \n        domestic tranquillity of the citizens of the United States and \n        the security and general welfare of the Nation and its people;\n            (2) the unregistered and unregulated circulation of \n        firearms in the United States increases the number of crimes \n        committed with firearms;\n            (3) firearms crimes have created a substantial burden on \n        interstate and foreign commerce;\n            (4) fear of firearms crimes discourages citizens from \n        traveling between the States to conduct business or to visit \n        national shrines and monuments, including the Nation's Capital;\n            (5) in view of the ease with which firearms may be \n        concealed and transported across State lines, individual State \n        action to regulate firearms is made ineffective by lax \n        regulation in other States and, accordingly, national \n        legislation establishing minimum standards for the registration \n        and regulation of firearms is necessary to permit effective \n        State action;\n            (6) crimes committed with guns have disrupted our national \n        political processes and threaten the republican form of \n        government within the States as guaranteed by Article IV of the \n        United States Constitution;\n            (7) the use of guns in homicides is not evenly distributed \n        across population subgroups, death and injury in criminal \n        violence from firearms are especially pronounced in the younger \n        age groups and among minorities, and firearm homicide is the \n        second leading cause of death for 15- to 19-year-olds and is \n        increasing more rapidly than any other cause of death;\n            (8) the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n        was established to provide for the common defense by protecting \n        the rights of the individual States to organize militias in \n        times of national emergency;\n            (9) firearm ownership is a privilege, not unlike that of \n        driving a car, and it is the duty and obligation of the Federal \n        Government to institute regulations and guidelines in order to \n        safeguard the welfare of the general public; and\n            (10) officials of the Government of the United States, \n        including 4 Presidents of the United States and candidates for \n        national public office, have been assassinated by use of \n        firearms, and the lives of national officials of the \n        legislative, executive, and judicial branches are increasingly \n        threatened by the unregistered and unregulated circulation of \n        firearms in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3.
