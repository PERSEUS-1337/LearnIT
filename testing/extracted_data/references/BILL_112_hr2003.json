SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Taxing Speculators \nout of the Oil Market Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The price of oil has risen and fallen dramatically over \n        the last decade without a clear connection to the laws of \n        supply and demand.\n            (2) The price of a barrel of oil predictably stayed beneath \n        $20 a barrel of oil for decades. In the beginning of 1999, the \n        price was under $10 a barrel of oil, but since then the oil \n        market has been plagued by speculation and fluctuated wildly.\n            (3) In late 2004, the price of oil exceeded $40 a barrel of \n        oil, up 400 percent in 5 years.\n            (4) In late 2007, the price exceeded $80 a barrel of oil, \n        up 800 percent in 8 years.\n            (5) In mid 2008, the price of oil peaked at $145 a barrel, \n        up 1,450 percent in under ten years.\n            (6) The price of oil collapsed in 2008 to just over $30 a \n        barrel of oil.\n            (7) By early 2011, the price of oil rebounded to almost \n        $115 per barrel of oil.\n            (8) These large price swings coincide with drop in demand \n        since 2005. In 2010, the United States consumed 2.1 million \n        barrels of oil per day less than it did 6 years ago.\n            (9) Many economists have attributed this irrational \n        behavior of the oil market to the large increase in speculative \n        trading in oil derivatives.\n            (10) A transaction tax on speculative trading can deter \n        short-term speculation which will reduce the volatility and \n        price of oil.\n\nSEC. 2.
