    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities \n        (including the St. Louis downtown facility, the Weldon Springs \n        facility, and the Hematite facility) were exposed to levels of \n        radionuclides and radioactive materials that were much greater \n        than the current maximum allowable Federal standards;\n            (2) the Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were \n        exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative \n        to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \n        were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure;\n            (3)(A) the chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy \n        Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations \n        described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with respect \n        to worker exposures;\n            (B) workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of \n        uranium per day causing kidney damage; and\n            (C) a recent epidemiological study found excess levels of \n        nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts;\n            (4) the Department of Energy has admitted that those \n        workers were subjected to risks and had their health endangered \n        as a result of working with these highly radioactive materials;\n            (5) the Department of Energy reported that workers at the \n        Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and \n        recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive;\n            (6) the National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n        Health admits that--\n                    (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site \n                consisted of intense periods of processing extremely \n                high levels of radionuclides; and\n                    (B) the Institute has virtually no personal \n                monitoring data for workers prior to 1948;\n            (7) the National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n        Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n        sites that if they are not interviewed as a part of the dose \n        reconstruction process, it--\n                    (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to \n                conduct dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n                    (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that \n                incompletely or inaccurately estimates the radiation \n                dose to which the energy employee named in the claim \n                had been exposed;\n            (8) the Department of Health and Human Services published \n        the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the Special \n        Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and as of January 27, 2004, \n        the rule has yet to be finalized; and\n            (9) many of those former workers have died while waiting \n        for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some claimants \n        who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be completed.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITION OF MEMBER OF THE SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT.\n\n    Section 3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384l(14)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n        and\n            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:\n                    ``(C) The employee was so employed for a number of \n                work days aggregating at least 45 workdays at a \n                facility operated under contract to the Department of \n                Energy by Mallinkrodt Incorporated or its successors \n                (including the St. Louis downtown or `Destrahan' \n                facility during any of calendar years 1942 through \n                1958, the Weldon Springs feed materials plant facility \n                during any of calendar years 1958 through 1966, and the \n                Hematite facility during any of calendar years 1958 \n                through 1969), and during the employment--\n                            ``(i)(I) was monitored through the use of \n                        dosimetry badges for exposure at the plant of \n                        the external parts of an employee's body to \n                        radiation; or\n                            ``(II) was monitored through the use of \n                        bioassays, in vivo monitoring, or breath \n                        samples for exposure at the plant to internal \n                        radiation; or\n                            ``(ii) worked in a job that had exposures \n                        comparable to a job that is monitored, or \n                        should have been monitored, under standards of \n                        the Department of Energy in effect on the date \n                        of enactment of this subparagraph through the \n                        use of dosimetry badges for monitoring external \n                        radiation exposures, or bioassays, in vivo \n                        monitoring, or breath samples for internal \n                        radiation exposures, at a facility.''."
