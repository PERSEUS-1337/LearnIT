    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Airline Passenger Safety Enhancement \nAct of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The screening of passengers and property at United \n        States airports is, by law, the responsibility of airlines.\n            (2) There are more than 18,000 airport security personnel \n        in the United States who do the screening.\n            (3) The security personnel are employed by private \n        companies that perform the screening under contract with the \n        airlines. The personnel are generally paid at rates that are at \n        or only slightly above minimum wage. They receive minimal \n        benefits.\n            (4) The General Accounting Office has found that the \n        average employment turnover rate for airport screening \n        personnel at 19 major United States airports was 125 percent. \n        The turnover rate in some cases was as high as 416 percent.\n            (5) Other countries have registered employment turnover \n        rates for airport screening personnel that are less than 50 \n        percent, including Belgium, which has a turnover rate of four \n        percent.\n            (6) In addition to identifying the instability in the \n        workforce of airport screening personnel, the General \n        Accounting Office has found that insufficient security \n        precautions are being taken at airport entrances and \n        checkpoints where airport employees are screened, including \n        entrances and checkpoints for ramp areas.\n            (7) Investigators of the Office of the Inspector General of \n        the Department of Transportation, in unannounced tests, have \n        successfully gained access to supposedly secure areas of United \n        States airports without proper credentials in 68 percent of \n        those tests, and have then been able to board aircraft \n        unchallenged 117 times.\n            (8) The General Accounting Office has determined that \n        undercover agents have been able to penetrate restricted areas \n        of United States commercial airports with counterfeit or \n        otherwise invalid badges or other credentials, giving those \n        agents the opportunity (if they so intended) to carry weapons, \n        explosives, chemical or biological agents, or other dangerous \n        materials into those areas.\n\nSEC. 3. AIRPORT SECURITY STUDY.\n\n    (a) Requirement for Study.--The Administrator of the Federal \nAviation Administration shall carry out a comprehensive study to \ndetermine how the performance of security functions at airports in the \nUnited States should be organized and carried out, in cooperation with \nair carriers and airport administrators, to secure the safety of \npassengers and workers in all areas of airports and into the aircraft \nboarded at the airports.\n    (b) Plan.--The Administrator shall develop a comprehensive plan for \nensuring security at airports in the United States.
