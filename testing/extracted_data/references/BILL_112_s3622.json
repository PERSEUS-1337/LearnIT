DETERMINATION OF UNREASONABLY EXCESSIVE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Attorney General, in determining whether an \nalleged violator's price was unreasonably excessive, shall consider \nwhether--\n            (1) the price reasonably reflected additional costs, not \n        within the control of that person or company, that were paid, \n        incurred, or reasonably anticipated by that person or company;\n            (2) the price reasonably reflected additional risks taken \n        by that person or company to produce, distribute, obtain, or \n        sell such product under the circumstances;\n            (3) there is a gross disparity between the challenged price \n        and the price at which the same or similar goods were readily \n        available in the same region and during the same Presidentially \n        declared market shortage;\n            (4) the marginal benefit received by the wholesaler or \n        distributor is significantly changed in comparison with \n        marginal earnings in the year before a market shortage was \n        declared;\n            (5) the price charged was comparable to the price at which \n        the goods were generally available in the trade area if the \n        wholesaler or distributor did not sell or offer to sell the \n        prescription drug in question prior to the time a market \n        shortage was declared; and\n            (6) the price was substantially attributable to local, \n        regional, national, or international market conditions.\n    (b) Consultation.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Attorney General or \ndesignee, shall consult with representatives of the National \nAssociation of Wholesalers, Group Purchasing Organizations, \nPharmaceutical Distributors, Hospitals, Manufacturers, patients, and \nother interested community organizations to reassess the criteria set \nforth in subsection (a) in determining unreasonably excessive and \nprepare and submit to Congress a report on the results of the \nreassessment.\n\nSEC. 7.
