FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Federal agencies included in the Department of Homeland \n        Security perform important non-homeland security functions on \n        which all United States citizens rely, such as the protection \n        of fisheries and agriculture, communication and transportation \n        infrastructures, and medical supplies.\n            (2) Federal agencies included in the Department shall \n        ensure the continuation of non-homeland security functions as \n        new homeland security responsibilities are adopted.\n            (3) A strategy to address non-homeland security functions \n        is needed to meet the daily needs of Americans and to preserve \n        the security of the Nation.\n            (4) Non-homeland security functions are complementary to \n        homeland security functions and often share personnel, \n        resources, and assets. It is appropriate for each Under \n        Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that \n        non-homeland security functions are performed.\n            (5) Agencies in the Department of Homeland Security perform \n        essential non-homeland security functions Americans rely on \n        everyday, including the following:\n                    (A) The United States Coast Guard has vital non-\n                homeland security functions, including search and \n                rescue, fisheries enforcement, marine environmental \n                protection, law enforcement, marine safety, and aids to \n                navigation.\n                    (B) The Department of Homeland Security Bureau of \n                Citizenship and Immigration Services provides important \n                immigration and citizenship services and benefits \n                including processing and approving requests for \n                citizenship, adjudicating asylum for refugees, and \n                immigration benefits, such as refugee and intercountry \n                adoptions.\n                    (C) The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \n                assists local communities to prepare for and respond to \n                floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornadoes, and \n                other natural disasters. The Federal Emergency \n                Management Agency supplements State and local responses \n                to natural disasters and the mitigation of damage, and \n                prevention of disasters, such as earthquakes.\n                    (D) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \n                and the Animal Research Service develop strategies to \n                prevent and control foreign or emerging animal and \n                plant disease epidemics vital to farmers, the economy, \n                and the protection of the environment.\n                    (E) The Secret Service is charged with safeguarding \n                payment and financial systems by protecting against \n                counterfeiting, identity theft, credit card fraud, cell \n                phone fraud, computer and telecommunications fraud, \n                money laundering, and other financial crimes.\n                    (F) The United States Customs Service protects our \n                free trade essential for a healthy economy by working \n                to lower the cost of trade compliance, providing \n                guidance on the conduct of legal trade, and monitoring \n                imports to ensure compliance with public health and \n                safety laws. Customs protects intellectual property and \n                combats money laundering, child pornography, and drug \n                trafficking.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) ensure the continuation of non-homeland security \n        functions of Federal agencies; and\n            (2) ensure that Federal agencies develop sound management \n        strategies and allocate sufficient funding to carry out non-\n        homeland security functions.\n\nSEC. 3.
