FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tuberculosis is one of the greatest infectious causes \n        of death of adults worldwide, killing nearly 2,000,000 people \n        per year--one person every 15 seconds.\n            (2) One-third of the world's population is infected with \n        the tuberculosis bacterium and an estimated 9,000,000 \n        individuals develop active tuberculosis each year.\n            (3) Tuberculosis is the leading killer among individuals \n        who are HIV-positive due to their weakened immune systems, and \n        it is estimated that one-third of people with HIV infection \n        have tuberculosis.\n            (4) Today, tuberculosis is a leading killer of women of \n        reproductive age.\n            (5) There are 22 countries that account for 80 percent of \n        the world's burden of tuberculosis. The People's Republic of \n        China and India account for 35 percent of all estimated new \n        tuberculosis cases each year.\n            (6) Driven by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, incidence rates of \n        tuberculosis in Africa have more than doubled on average since \n        1990, making it the only region in the world in which \n        tuberculosis rates are not currently stabilized or declining. \n        The problem is so pervasive that in August 2005, African Health \n        Ministers and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared \n        tuberculosis to be an emergency in Africa.\n            (7) The wide extent of drug resistance, including multi-\n        drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), in Eastern Europe and \n        other parts of the world represents a critical challenge to the \n        global control of tuberculosis. Drug resistance surveillance \n        reports have confirmed the serious scale and spread of \n        tuberculosis in Eastern Europe with tuberculosis strains often \n        resistant to all first line drugs and also to some second line \n        drugs.\n            (8) With more than 50 percent of tuberculosis cases in the \n        United States attributable to foreign-born individuals and with \n        the increase in international travel, commerce, and migration, \n        elimination of tuberculosis in the United States depends on \n        efforts to control the disease in developing countries. Recent \n        research has shown that to invest in tuberculosis control \n        abroad, where treatment and program costs are significantly \n        cheaper than in the United States, would be a cost-effective \n        strategy to reduce tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality \n        domestically.\n            (9) The threat that tuberculosis poses for Americans \n        derives from the global spread of tuberculosis and the \n        emergence and spread of strains of multi-drug resistant \n        tuberculosis, which is far more deadly, and more difficult and \n        costly to treat.\n            (10) DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course) is one \n        of the most cost-effective health interventions available today \n        and is a core component of the new Stop TB Strategy.\n            (11) The Stop TB Strategy, developed by the World Health \n        Organization, builds on the success of DOTS and ongoing \n        challenges so as to serve all those in need and reach targets \n        for prevalence, mortality, and incidence reduction. The Stop TB \n        Strategy includes six components:\n                    (A) Pursuing high-quality expansion and enhancement \n                of DOTS coverage.\n                    (B) Implementing tuberculosis and HIV collaborative \n                activities, preventing, and controlling multi-drug \n                resistant tuberculosis, and addressing other special \n                challenges.\n                    (C) Contributing to the strengthening of health \n                systems.\n                    (D) Engaging all health care providers, including \n                promotion of the International Standards for \n                Tuberculosis Care.\n                    (E) Empowering individuals with tuberculosis and \n                communities.\n                    (F) Enabling and promoting research to develop new \n                diagnostics, drugs, vaccines, and program-based \n                operational research relating to tuberculosis.\n            (12) The Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015: Actions for Life \n        is a comprehensive plan developed by the Stop TB Partnership \n        that sets out the actions necessary to achieve the millennium \n        development goal of cutting tuberculosis deaths and disease \n        burden in half by 2015 and thus eliminate tuberculosis as a \n        global health problem by 2050.\n            (13) While innovations such as the Global Tuberculosis Drug \n        Facility have enabled low-income countries to treat a standard \n        case of tuberculosis with drugs that cost as little as $16 for \n        a full six-month course of treatment, there are still millions \n        of individuals with no access to effective treatment.\n            (14) As the global resource investment in fighting \n        tuberculosis increases, partner nations and international \n        institutions must commit to a corresponding increase in the \n        technical and program assistance necessary to ensure that the \n        most effective and efficient tuberculosis treatments are \n        provided.\n            (15) The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n        Malaria is an important global partnership established to \n        combat these three infectious diseases that together kill \n        millions of people a year. Expansion of effective tuberculosis \n        treatment programs constitutes a major component of Global Fund \n        investment, along with integrated efforts to address HIV and \n        tuberculosis in areas of high prevalence.\n            (16) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \n        is actively involved with global tuberculosis control efforts \n        since the global tuberculosis epidemic directly impacts \n        tuberculosis in the United States, and because Congress has \n        strongly urged the CDC each year to increase its involvement \n        with international tuberculosis control efforts.\n            (17) The CDC is assisting countries with a high burden of \n        tuberculosis to--\n                    (A) implement the World Health Organization-\n                recommended control strategies by improving the \n                capacity to diagnose and cure individuals with \n                tuberculosis;\n                    (B) improve the capacity to diagnose, treat, and \n                prevent tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals and \n                individuals with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and\n                    (C) conduct programmatically-relevant operational \n                research to identify and evaluate new diagnostics, \n                treatment regimes, and interventions to control \n                tuberculosis.\n\nSEC. 3.
