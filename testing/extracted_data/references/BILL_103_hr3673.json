FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) land that is held by agencies of the Federal Government \n        does not fully contribute to the tax base of overburdened units \n        of local government;\n            (2) further acquisitions of private lands by Federal \n        agencies have the potential to impose severe hardships on units \n        of local government; and\n            (3) when it is clearly in the national interest for the \n        Federal Government to acquire private lands, other than by a \n        contemporaneous exchange involving Federal land, Federal \n        agencies should minimize the impact of Federal acquisition on \n        units of local government.\n\nSEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of Congress that--\n            (1) Federal agencies should not acquire private land, other \n        than by exchange, unless the acquisition is clearly in the \n        national interest;\n            (2) the acquisition of private land by a Federal agency \n        should be based on a careful analysis of the full range of the \n        benefits and costs of Federal acquisition; and\n            (3) the acquisition of private land by a Federal agency \n        should not result in a net loss of local tax revenues to the \n        relevant unit of local government.\n\nSEC. 4.
