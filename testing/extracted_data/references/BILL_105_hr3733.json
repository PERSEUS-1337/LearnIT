FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) fully accredited bachelor's degree academic programs in \n        plastics, electronic, mechanical, manufacturing, construction, \n        wood, and automotive engineering technology, and in technology \n        management, are a significant asset for the State and region in \n        which they are located, and for the Nation;\n            (2) graduates of academic programs described in paragraph \n        (1) are experiencing a nearly 100 percent placement rate, \n        entering the work force making significant contributions to the \n        productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness of their \n        particular companies;\n            (3) the future preparation of America's workers, industrial \n        managers, and technicians depends on the use of modern, state-\n        of-the-art instructional equipment that is very expensive and \n        has a rather short relevant life span; and\n            (4) it is sound educational policy to invest Federal \n        dollars in programs and projects that directly benefit and \n        enhance the preparation of tomorrow's leaders in technology and \n        related industries which make the United States more \n        competitive in world markets.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANT AUTHORITY.\n\n    The Director of the National Science Foundation (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Director'') may make grants to organizations that \nprovide postsecondary education in applied engineering and technology \nfor equipment and capital improvements needed to ensure that such \neducation is provided using state-of-the-art instructional equipment \nand facilities. Amounts made available through such grants may be used \nin support of applied engineering and technology programs for any of \nthe following purposes:\n            (1) Purchase, rental, or lease of scientific or laboratory \n        equipment, including computer hardware and software, for \n        educational purposes, including instructional and research \n        purposes.\n            (2) Construction, maintenance, renovation, and improvement \n        in classroom, library, laboratory, and other instructional \n        facilities.\n            (3) Acquisition of library books, periodicals, microfilm, \n        data bases, software, and other educational materials.\n            (4) Tutoring, counseling, and student service programs \n        designed to improve academic success.\n            (5) Funds and administrative management, and acquisition of \n        equipment for use in strengthening funds management.\n            (6) Joint use of facilities, such as laboratories and \n        libraries.\n            (7) Establishing or improving a development office to \n        strengthen or improve contributions from alumni and the private \n        sector.\n            (8) Establishing community outreach programs which will \n        encourage elementary and secondary students to develop the \n        academic skills and the interest to pursue postsecondary \n        applied engineering and technology education.\n            (9) Other activities proposed in the application submitted \n        pursuant to section 4 that--\n                    (A) contribute to carrying out the purposes of this \n                Act; and\n                    (B) are approved by the Director as part of the \n                review and acceptance of such application.\n\nSEC. 4.
