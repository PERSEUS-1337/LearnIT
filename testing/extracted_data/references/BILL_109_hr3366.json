For \n        every 12-month period after the first such period after the \n        license is issued and continuing for the life of the new \n        license and any subsequent licenses, the annual payment shall \n        include an additional 3 percent of the amount of the payment \n        made during the preceding 12-month period.\n            (B) Prior to the establishment of the Erie Canal Harbor \n        Development Corporation, the payment described in subparagraph \n        (A) shall be held in escrow by the NYPA for transfer to the \n        corporation upon its establishment.

Any such acquisition by the licensee shall be carried \nout pursuant to such terms as may be necessary to ensure replacement of \nany residential, educational, recreational, and community services and \nfacilities acquired or adversely affected by such acquisition, and that \nsuch replacement facilities or services are of equivalent character, \nvalue, and number to those so acquired, while meeting contemporary \nstandards for construction, operation, and level of service.\n    (b) Resources for First Responders.--The New York Power Authority \nshall provide to First Responders serving the local jurisdictions in \nwhich the Niagara Power Project facilities are located adequate \nfinancial and other resources and assistance to acquire, operate, \nmaintain, and replace, through the term of any license granted pursuant \nto this Act, the equipment and other assets needed to protect human \nlife and property from harm should any feature or facility of the \nNiagara Power Project be subject to damage of any type because of an \nact of terror or other criminal behavior.\n\nSEC. 6. HOLD HARMLESS.\n\n     Nothing in this Act authorizes any increase in the rates and \ncharges for electric energy under the Replacement Power program.\n\nSEC. 7. SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this Act, or amendment made by this Act, or the \napplication of this Act or such amendments to any person or \ncircumstance is determined by a court to be invalid, the validity of \nthe remainder of this Act and the amendments made by this Act and the \napplication of such provision to other persons and circumstances shall \nnot be affected by such determination."
