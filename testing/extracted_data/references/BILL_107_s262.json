NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFICATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n    Part A of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 (20 U.S.C. 6621 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 2104. NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFICATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n    ``(a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the `Teaching \nExcellence in America's Classrooms and Homerooms Act' (TEACH).\n    ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            ``(1) Accomplished teachers are an essential resource for \n        schools and key to the success of any effective education \n        reform initiative. What teachers know and can do are the most \n        important influences on what students learn, according to \n        national studies.\n            ``(2) Three years after the landmark 1983 report, `A Nation \n        at Risk', the Carnegie Task Force on Teaching as a Profession \n        issued a seminal report entitled `A Nation Prepared: Teachers \n        for the 21st Century'. Its leading recommendation called for \n        the establishment of a National Board for Professional Teaching \n        Standards. Founded in 1987, the National Board for Professional \n        Teaching Standards is an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan \n        organization whose mission is to establish high and rigorous \n        standards for what accomplished teachers should know and be \n        able to do.\n            ``(3) Over 9,500 teachers from all 50 States and the \n        District of Columbia have completed advanced certification by \n        the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, which \n        certification is the most rigorous assessment process that a \n        teacher can go through and the highest professional credential \n        in the field of teaching. And more than 12,000 teachers have \n        applied for National Board Certification in the 2000-2001 \n        school year.\n            ``(4) Teacher salaries have remained stagnant over the past \n        decade, according to a new study by the National Education \n        Association, and \\2/3\\ of the States do not meet the national \n        average of $40,582 for teacher salaries.\n            ``(5) The full fee for National Board Certification is \n        $2,300. Thirty-nine States and 181 local school districts have \n        enacted financial incentives for teachers seeking National \n        Board Certification, including fee support to candidates and \n        salary increases for teachers who achieve National Board \n        Certification.\n            ``(6) Recent data from the Accomplished Teaching Validation \n        Study have demonstrated that teachers who are certified by the \n        National Board for Professional Teaching Standards \n        significantly outperform their peers who are not National Board \n        Certified on 11 of 13 key measures of teaching expertise.\n            ``(7) If we are to improve student achievement and success \n        in school, the United States must encourage and support the \n        training and development of our Nation's teachers, who are the \n        single, most important in-school influence on student learning.\n    ``(c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide a Federal \nsubsidy and support to certain elementary school and secondary school \nteachers who pursue advanced certification provided by the National \nBoard for Professional Teaching Standards.\n    ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Board.--The term `Board' means the National Board for \n        Professional Teaching Standards.\n            ``(2) Eligible teacher.--The term `eligible teacher' means \n        an individual who is a prekindergarten or early childhood \n        educator, or a kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teacher, \n        instructor, counselor, or principal in an elementary school or \n        secondary school on a full-time basis.\n    ``(e) Program Authorization.--\n            ``(1) Program authorized.--From sums appropriated pursuant \n        to the authority of subsection (g) for any fiscal year, the \n        Secretary, in accordance with this section, shall provide \n        financial assistance to the National Board for Professional \n        Teaching Standards, in order to pay the Federal share of the \n        costs of the authorized activities described in subsection (f).\n    ``(f) Authorized Activities.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Federal funds received under this \n        section may be used only for the following activities:\n                    ``(A) To help States and local school districts \n                provide fee support to teachers seeking National Board \n                Certification.\n                    ``(B) For outreach and educational activities \n                directly related to teachers' awareness and pursuit of \n                National Board Certification.\n            ``(2) Priorities.--The Board shall give priority to \n        providing outreach and educational activities under paragraph \n        (1)(B) among the following:\n                    ``(A) School districts in which there are a \n                significant number of low-performing schools.\n                    ``(B) School districts with low teacher \n                participation rates in the National Board Certification \n                process.\n                    ``(C) School districts serving special populations, \n                including--\n                            ``(i) limited English proficient children;\n                            ``(ii) gifted and talented children;\n                            ``(iii) children with disabilities; and\n                            ``(iv) economically and educationally \n                        disadvantaged children.\n    ``(g) Authorization of Appropriations; Allocation.--\n            ``(1) Authorization of appropriations.--For the purpose of \n        carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n        appropriated $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and such sums as \n        may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.\n            ``(2) Allocation.--Of the amounts appropriated under \n        paragraph (1) for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall make \n        available--\n                    ``(A) 85 percent of such amounts to carry out \n                subsection (f)(1)(A); and\n                    ``(B) 15 percent of such amounts to carry out \n                subsection (f)(1)(B).''.\n\n          TITLE II--TAX INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER CERTIFICATIONS\n\nSEC. 201.
