FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n        Agency has determined that more than 40 percent of the assessed \n        water of the United States does not meet applicable water \n        quality standards established by States, territories, and \n        Indian tribes;\n            (2) the water described in paragraph (1) includes \n        approximately 300,000 miles of rivers and shorelines, and \n        approximately 5,000,000 acres of lakes, that are polluted by \n        sediments, excess nutrients, and harmful microorganisms;\n            (3) Congress enacted--\n                    (A) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n                U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) to maintain the chemical, \n                physical, and biological integrity of water of the \n                United States; and\n                    (B) the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et \n                seq.) to protect public health by regulating the public \n                drinking water supply of the United States;\n            (4) because criminal, civil, and administrative penalties \n        assessed under the Acts referred to in paragraph (3) are \n        returned to the Treasury, those amounts are not available to \n        protect, preserve, or enhance the quality of water in \n        watersheds in which violations of those Acts occur; and\n            (5) the establishment of a national clean and safe water \n        fund would help States in achieving the goals described in \n        paragraph (1) by providing funding to protect and improve \n        watersheds and aquifers.\n\nSEC. 3.
