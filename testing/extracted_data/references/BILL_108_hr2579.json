FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The export of agricultural products is of vital \n        importance to the economy of the United States.\n            (2) In 2002, agriculture was a large positive contributor \n        to the United States merchandise trade balance with a trade \n        surplus of $12,300,000,000.\n            (3) The growth of United States agricultural exports should \n        continue to be an important factor in improving the United \n        States merchandise trade balance.\n            (4) Increasing the volume of agricultural exports will \n        increase farm income in the United States, thereby protecting \n        family farms and contributing to the economic well-being of \n        rural communities in the United States.\n            (5) Although the United States efficiently produces high-\n        quality agricultural products, United States producers cannot \n        realize their full export potential because many foreign \n        countries deny fair and equitable market access to United \n        States agricultural products.\n            (6) The Foreign Agricultural Service estimates that United \n        States agricultural exports are reduced by $4,700,000,000 \n        annually due to unjustifiable imposition of sanitary and \n        phytosanitary measures that deny or limit market access to \n        United States products.\n            (7) The denial of fair and equitable market access for \n        United States agricultural products impedes the ability of \n        United States farmers to export their products, thereby harming \n        the economic interests of the United States.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to reduce or eliminate foreign unfair trade practices \n        and to remove constraints on fair and open trade in \n        agricultural products;\n            (2) to ensure fair and equitable market access for exports \n        of United States agricultural products; and\n            (3) to promote free and fair trade in agricultural \n        products.\n\nSEC. 3.
