FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since 2011, the terrorist group now known as the \n        Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), has rapidly \n        expanded, now possessing greater funding, more personnel, and \n        heavier weapons than any other terrorist force.\n            (2) ISIL has threatened to continue attacking United States \n        persons and interests and has an apocalyptic vision for a \n        larger confrontation with the United States and its allies in \n        the Middle East.\n            (3) According to the United States intelligence community, \n        approximately 20,000 to 30,000 ISIL fighters operate in Iraq \n        and Syria, an estimated 3,000 of which are believed to have \n        western passports.\n            (4) ISIL finances itself through looting, smuggling, taxes, \n        oil sales, kidnapping, and human trafficking.\n            (5) According to United States officials, ISIL captured \n        approximately 1,500 Humvees, a number of other modern armored \n        vehicles and transport trucks, over 50 long-range Global \n        Positioning System (GPS)-guided artillery pieces, a substantial \n        number of artillery shells, a large quantity of small arms, \n        approximately 4,000 heavy machine guns, and other weapons from \n        the Iraqi Security Forces in June 2014, and has also reportedly \n        captured a number of other weapons and vehicles from Bashar al-\n        Assad's forces in Syria.\n            (6) The rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in \n        Iraq caused by ISIL advances in Iraq and Syria has resulted in \n        approximately 1,500,000 refugees and internally displaced \n        people from Syria and Iraq taking refuge in the Iraqi Kurdistan \n        region. The Kurdistan Regional Government is facing a \n        humanitarian and budget crisis while defending itself from \n        ISIL.\n            (7) The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is the \n        democratically elected government of the Kurdistan Region in \n        Iraq, and Iraqi Kurds have been a reliable and stable partner \n        of the United States.\n            (8) The Iraqi constitution guarantees the right of Iraqi \n        regions, such as Iraqi Kurdistan, to maintain ``internal \n        security forces for the region such as police, security forces, \n        and guards of the region''.\n            (9) The Kurdish Peshmerga forces are officially organized \n        under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs and commanded by the \n        Minister of Peshmerga, who reports to the President of the \n        Kurdistan Regional Government.\n            (10) ISIL has positioned its forces along a 650-mile border \n        with the Kurdistan Regional Government's Peshmerga forces.\n            (11) ISIL has employed captured armored vehicles, long-\n        range artillery, and heavy weapons in attacking thinly \n        stretched Kurdish forces along the border.\n            (12) United States airstrikes against ISIL targets have \n        helped stall the terrorist organization's advance on territory \n        held by Kurdish forces, but have not proven to be militarily \n        decisive against ISIL.\n            (13) The United States and its allies have provided the \n        resupply of various small arms and training to Peshmerga forces \n        since June 2014.\n            (14) Such resupply efforts, to comply with United States \n        law, must be approved and coordinated through the Government of \n        Iraq. In the initial phase of the resupply effort, the \n        Government of Iraq constrained and delayed the emergency supply \n        of weapons to the Kurdistan Regional Government.\n            (15) The Peshmerga forces lack battle-ready armored \n        vehicles and the ability to take significant offensive action \n        against ISIL forces, leading to requests for such assistance.\n            (16) Armored vehicles, anti-armor weapons, long-range \n        artillery, and other weapons are consistent with the Kurdistan \n        Regional Government's constitutional right to defend itself \n        against the clear and present danger posed by ISIL.\n            (17) A strong Peshmerga force is essential to countering \n        the ISIL threat to Iraq, the region, and United States \n        interests.\n            (18) The longer ISIL's sanctuary remains largely \n        unchallenged, the more time it will have to reinforce its \n        positions, and plan attacks against United States interests.\n\nSEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \n        (ISIL) is critical to maintaining a unified Iraq in which all \n        faiths and ethnicities are afforded equal protection and full \n        integration into the Iraqi government and society;\n            (2) the people of Kurdistan face an urgent and deadly \n        threat from ISIL which the Iraqi Security Forces, of which the \n        Peshmerga are a component, are currently unable to match in \n        armaments;\n            (3) any outstanding issues between the Government of Iraq \n        and the Kurdistan Regional Government should be resolved by the \n        two parties expeditiously to allow for a resumption of normal \n        relations; and\n            (4) ISIL's recent advances and continued growth present an \n        imminent threat to Iraqi Kurdistan, the rest of Iraq and the \n        Middle East, and international security.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States to directly provide the \nKurdistan Regional Government with advanced conventional weapons, \ntraining, and defense services, on an emergency and temporary basis, to \nmore effectively partner with the United States and other international \ncoalition members to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \n(ISIL).\n\nSEC. 4.
