FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Eight years of civil war and massive human rights \n        violations have created a humanitarian crisis in the Republic \n        of Sierra Leone, leaving over 50,000 dead and 1,000,000 \n        displaced from their homes.\n            (2) As many as 480,000 Sierra Leoneans have fled into \n        neighboring countries, especially Guinea.\n            (3) All parties to the conflict have committed abuses, but \n        the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and its ally, the former \n        Sierra Leonean army (AFRC) are responsible for the overwhelming \n        majority.\n            (4) The RUF and AFRC have systematically abducted, raped, \n        mutilated, killed, or forced children to fight alongside RUF \n        soldiers.\n            (5) The RUF continues to hold hundreds and perhaps \n        thousands of prisoners, including many child soldiers, despite \n        the agreement of RUF leadership at Lome to release all \n        children.\n            (6) The civil defense forces committed human rights \n        violations, including killings and recruitment of child \n        soldiers, and Economic Community of West African States \n        Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) forces have also committed \n        human rights abuses, including executions of captured \n        combatants and killings of civilians.\n            (7) Neighboring countries, especially Liberia and Burkina \n        Faso, have contributed greatly to the destruction of Sierra \n        Leone by aiding and arming the RUF and providing sanctuary for \n        RUF fighters.\n            (8) International humanitarian efforts to assist Sierra \n        Leoneans, both at home and in Guinea, have fallen far short of \n        need such that conditions in refugee camps and among displaced \n        persons camps are deplorable, food and medicine is dangerously \n        inadequate, and the refugee population on the Sierra Leonean \n        border continues to be preyed upon by RUF insurgents and \n        subjected to rape, mutilation, or killing.\n            (9) Demobilization, demilitarization, and reintegration \n        (DDR) efforts, as called for in the Lome agreement of July \n        1999, have begun months late and are still at beginning stages.\n            (10) With the withdrawal of the West African peacekeeping \n        forces, the United Nations Security Council has approved the \n        deployment of 11,000 peacekeeping forces for Sierra Leone.\n            (11) There are approximately 45,000 combatants, including \n        many child soldiers, in Sierra Leone who must be demobilized, \n        provided with alternate employment, and reintegrated into their \n        communities.\n            (12) Both the Government of Sierra Leone and the RUF/AFRC \n        formally agreed in the Lome Convention of July 7, 1999, to \n        uphold, promote, and protect the human rights (including the \n        right to life and liberty, freedom from torture, the right to a \n        fair trial, freedom of conscience, expression, and association, \n        and the right to take part in the governance of one's country) \n        of every Sierra Leonean as well as the enforcement of \n        humanitarian law.\n    (b) Sense of the Congress.--The Congress urges the President to \nvigorously promote efforts to end further degradation of conditions in \nthe Republic of Sierra Leone, to dramatically increase United States \nassistance to demobilization, demilitarization, and reintegration (DDR) \nefforts and humanitarian initiatives, to assist in the collection of \ndocumentation about human rights abuses by all parties, and to engage \nin diplomatic initiatives aimed at consolidating the peace and \nprotecting human rights.\n\nSEC. 3. DEMOBILIZATION, DEMILITARIZATION, AND REINTEGRATION ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) In General.--There is authorized to be appropriated to the \nPresident $13,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 for assistance under chapter \n4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2221 et \nseq.) to the Sierra Leone DDR Trust Fund of the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development for demobilization, demilitarization, \nand reintegration assistance in Sierra Leone.

DEMOCRATIZATION, ELECTORAL, AND JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) Judicial Assistance.--There is authorized to be appropriated to \nthe President $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 for assistance to rebuild \nand strengthen the capacity of the judiciary in the Republic of Sierra \nLeone and to assist efforts to establish the rule of law and maintain \nlaw and order in Sierra Leone.\n    (b) Expanded International Military Education and Training \nAssistance.--Beginning 1 year after the conclusion of free and fair \nelections in Sierra Leone, the President may provide expanded \ninternational military education and training assistance to the \nmilitary forces and related civilian personnel of Sierra Leone under \nsection 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2347) \nsolely for the purpose of providing training relating to defense \nmanagement, civil-military relations, law enforcement cooperation, and \nmilitary justice.\n    (c) Additional Requirements.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to the \nauthorization of appropriations under subsection (a)--\n            (1) are in addition to any other amounts available for the \n        purposes described in such subsection; and\n            (2) are authorized to remain available until expended.\n\nSEC. 5. ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\n    (a) Statement of Congressional Concern About Accountability.--It is \nthe sense of the Congress that a thorough and nonpartisan initiative to \ncollect information on human rights abuses by all parties to the \nconflict in the Republic of Sierra Leone be undertaken. Comprehensive \nand detailed information, particularly the identification of specific \nunits, individuals, and commanders found to have been especially \nabusive, will be essential for vetting human rights abusers from the \nnewly formed armed forces and police forces of Sierra Leone and for \ndeterring abuses by all parties in the future. Accordingly, the \nCongress calls upon the administration to strongly support an \nindependent process of data collection on human rights abuses in Sierra \nLeone, for use by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission when it has \nbeen established, and to support any future initiatives of \ninternational accountability for Sierra Leone.\n    (b) Assistance for Truth and Reconciliation Commission.--\n            (1) Assistance for establishment and support of \n        commission.--The President is authorized to provide assistance \n        for the establishment and support of a Truth and Reconciliation \n        Commission to establish accountability for human rights abuses \n        in the Republic of Sierra Leone.\n            (2) Assistance for human rights data collection.--The \n        Secretary of State, acting through the Assistant Secretary of \n        the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, is authorized \n        to collect human rights data with respect to Sierra Leone and \n        assist the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in carrying out \n        its functions.\n            (3) Authorization of appropriations.--\n                    (A) Establishment and support of commission.--There \n                is authorized to be appropriated to the President \n                $1,500,000 for fiscal year 2001 for assistance under \n                chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n                1961 to carry out paragraph (1).\n                    (B) Human rights data collection.--There is \n                authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of State \n                $500,000 for fiscal year 2001 to carry out paragraph \n                (2).
