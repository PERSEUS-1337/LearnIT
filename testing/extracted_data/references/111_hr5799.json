NATIONAL INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING TASK FORCE.\n\n    (a) Establishment of Task Force.--The President shall create a \nNational Intermodal Transportation Planning Task Force (referred to in \nthis Act as ``Task Force'') with the Secretary of Transportation, or \ndesignee, acting as chairperson and compromised of representatives of \nthe Departments of Commerce, Energy, Labor, and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government \nagencies the President considers necessary to conduct the study and \ncomplete the Plan required by this Act.\n    (b) Duties of Task Force.--The Task Force shall--\n            (1) conduct a study on transportation needs, a draft of \n        which shall be completed not later than 12 months after the \n        date of enactment of this Act and the final study shall be \n        completed not later than 15 months after the date of enactment \n        of this Act;\n            (2) sponsor a conference on National Transportation \n        Planning not later than 6 months after the completion of the \n        draft study;\n            (3) make recommendations to the President for possible \n        invitees to the conference on National Transportation Planning \n        described in section 3;\n            (4) use the study and the input of attendees of the \n        conference under section 3 to draft a National Intermodal \n        Transportation Plan (referred to in this Act as ``Plan'') not \n        later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act \n        and publish it in the Federal Register and place it on the \n        Department's Web site for public comment; and\n            (5) transmit to Congress, and place on the Department of \n        Transportation's Web site, a National Intermodal Transportation \n        Plan not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of \n        this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION STUDY.\n\n    In developing the study established pursuant to section 1, the Task \nForce shall consider all aspects and all modes of transportation, \npublic, private, and commercial, including air, rail (passenger and \nfreight), road, port, waterway, bicycle, and pedestrian. The study \nshall project for the next 30 years and examine and identify for such \nperiod of time the following:\n            (1) National transportation priorities.\n            (2) The anticipated demand, steps currently being taken to \n        address anticipated demand, how successful these steps are \n        anticipated to be, the most advantageous allocation of \n        shipments of goods and travel among the various capacities of \n        various modes, connectivity of those modes, and comparative \n        costs. Comparative costs shall take into account past public \n        investments in currently existing infrastructure for each \n        transportation mode.\n            (3) Deficiencies in the current and currently planned \n        transportation systems to meet current and anticipated demand \n        and the appropriate level of redundancies.\n            (4) How intermodal transportation planning may help address \n        anticipated transportation demand, social impacts of \n        transportation, and the impact of the transportation sector on \n        the environment, particularly global warming.\n            (5) What obstacles exist to enhance and improve intermodal \n        transportation planning to meet national priorities so that the \n        national Plan provides suggestions on policy and legislative \n        recommendations to such obstacles.\n            (6) Transportation   purposes, systems operational \n        requirements and capacities, comparative long-term costs, and \n        revenue sources.\n            (7) How different agencies and levels of government may be \n        better incorporated and coordinated to improve transportation \n        planning.\n            (8) Obstacles to potential benefits from, and current \n        efforts in mega-region planning at the national and regional \n        level.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING CONFERENCE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Task Force shall convene a National \nTransportation Priorities Conference (referred to in this Act as the \n``Conference'') not later than 6 months after the completion of the \ndraft National Transportation Study.\n    (b) Conference Mission.--The mission of the Conference shall be--\n            (1) to review the draft of the study conducted pursuant to \n        section 2 and comment on the draft's findings;\n            (2) to discuss ways to improve transportation planning;\n            (3) to suggest short-term and long-term goals to be \n        incorporated into the Plan;\n            (4) to examine and evaluate how environmental priorities \n        and economic planning are integrated into transportation \n        planning;\n            (5) to identify obstacles to meeting those goals and \n        suggestion measures to reduce or eliminate those obstacles; and\n            (6) to perform other tasks that the Task Force considers \n        helpful to complete the Study and the Plan.\n    (c) Conference Representatives.--The Conference shall be comprised \nof representatives appointed by the President of the following:\n            (1) State Departments of Transportation.\n            (2) State legislatures.\n            (3) Municipal leaders.\n            (4) Metropolitan planning organizations.\n            (5) Transportation nonprofit and advocacy groups.\n            (6) Bike and pedestrian and other transportation safety \n        organizations.\n            (7) Transportation trade associations.\n            (8) Small and large transportation companies.\n            (9) Environmental organizations.\n            (10) Labor unions.\n            (11) Academia.\n            (12) And other groups the Task Force considers helpful in \n        achieving the conference's mission.\n\nSEC. 5.
