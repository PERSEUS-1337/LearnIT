FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal government, through its Medicare program, \n        pays approximately $8 billion per year solely to train \n        resident-physicians in the United States, and as a result, has \n        an interest in assuring the safety of patients treated by \n        resident-physicians and the safety of resident-physicians \n        themselves.\n            (2) Resident-physicians spend a significant amount of their \n        time performing activities not related to the educational \n        mission of training competent physicians.\n            (3) The excessive numbers of hours worked by resident-\n        physicians is inherently dangerous for patient care and for the \n        lives of resident-physicians.\n            (4) The scientific literature has consistently demonstrated \n        that the sleep deprivation of the magnitude seen in residency \n        training programs leads to cognitive impairment.\n            (5) A substantial body of research indicates that excessive \n        hours worked by resident-physicians lead to higher rates of \n        medical error, motor vehicle accidents, depression and \n        pregnancy complications.\n            (6) The medical community has not adequately addressed the \n        issue of excessive resident-physician work hours.\n            (7) Different medical specialty training programs have \n        different patient care considerations but the effects of sleep \n        deprivation on resident-physicians does not change between \n        specialties.\n            (8) The Federal government has regulated the work hours of \n        other industries when the safety of employees or the public is \n        at risk.\n\nSEC. 3. REVISION OF MEDICARE HOSPITAL CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION \n              REGARDING WORKING HOURS OF RESIDENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1866 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395cc) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(1)--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph \n                (R);\n                    (B) by striking the period at the end of \n                subparagraph (S) and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by inserting after subparagraph (S) the \n                following new subparagraph:\n            ``(T) in the case of a hospital that uses the services of \n        physician residents or postgraduate trainees, to meet the \n        requirements of subsection (j).''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(j)(1)(A) In order that the working conditions and working hours \nof physicians and postgraduate trainees promote the provision of \nquality medical care in hospitals, as a condition of participation \nunder this title each hospital shall establish the following limits on \nworking hours for certain members of the medical staff and postgraduate \ntrainees:\n            ``(i) Subject to subparagraph (C), postgraduate trainees \n        may work no more than a total of 80 hours per week and 24 hours \n        per shift.\n            ``(ii) Subject to subparagraph (C), postgraduate trainees--\n                    ``(I) shall have at least 10 hours between \n                scheduled shifts;\n                    ``(II) shall have at least 1 full day out of every \n                7 days off and one full weekend off per month;\n                    ``(III) who are assigned to patient care \n                responsibilities in an emergency department shall work \n                no more than 12 continuous hours in that department; \n                and\n                    ``(IV) shall not be scheduled to be on call in the \n                hospital more often than every third night.\n    ``(B) The Secretary shall promulgate such regulations as may be \nnecessary to ensure quality of care is maintained during the transfer \nof direct patient care from one postgraduate trainee to another at the \nend of each such 24 hour period referred to in subparagraph (A) and \nshall take into account cases of individual patient emergencies.\n    ``(C) The work hour limitations under subparagraph (A) and \nrequirements of subparagraph (B) shall not apply to a hospital during a \nstate of emergency declared by the Secretary that applies with respect \nto that hospital.\n    ``(2) The Secretary shall promulgate such regulations as may be \nnecessary to monitor and supervise postgraduate trainees assigned \npatient care responsibilities as part of an approved medical training \nprogram, as well as to assure quality patient care.\n    ``(3) Each hospital shall inform postgraduate trainees of--\n            ``(A) their rights under this subsection, including methods \n        to enforce such rights (including so-called whistle-blower \n        protections); and\n            ``(B) the effects of their acute and chronic sleep \n        deprivation both on themselves and on their patients.\n    ``(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term `postgraduate \ntrainee' includes a postgraduate intern, resident, or fellow.''.\n    (b) Designation.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n        shall designate an individual within the Department of Health \n        and Human Services to handle all complaints of violations that \n        arise from residents who report that their programs are in \n        violation of the requirements of section 1866(j) of the Social \n        Security Act (as added by subsection (a)).\n            (2) Grievance rights.--A post graduate trainee or physician \n        resident may file a complaint with the Secretary of Health and \n        Human Services concerning a violation of such requirements. \n        Such a complaint may be filed anonymously.
