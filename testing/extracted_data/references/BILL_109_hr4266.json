FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Gulf Coast region of the United States was recently \n        decimated by twin natural disasters: Hurricanes Katrina and \n        Rita.\n            (2) Hurricane Katrina crashed into the Gulf Coast on August \n        29, 2005, as a category 4 storm.\n            (3) At the time of its landing, Hurricane Katrina was \n        recorded as the third strongest hurricane to ever make landfall \n        on the United States, with sustained winds over 140 miles per \n        hour.\n            (4) The damage and destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina \n        along the coastal regions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and \n        Alabama were unmatched in their breadth and scope.\n            (5) A 10- to 30-foot storm surge came ashore on over 200 \n        continuous miles of coastline from southeast Louisiana, \n        including Mississippi and Alabama, through to the Florida \n        panhandle.\n            (6) The 30-foot storm surge recorded at Biloxi, \n        Mississippi, is the highest ever observed in the United States.\n            (7) Hurricane Katrina's storm surge quickly breached the \n        levee system that protected the city of New Orleans from Lake \n        Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River, subsequently flooding \n        at least 80 percent of the city.\n            (8) The magnitude of Hurricane Katrina was of such an \n        unprecedented scale that the Federal disaster declarations \n        which followed its destructive path blanketed over 90,000 \n        square miles of the United States, an area almost as large as \n        the United Kingdom, displacing more than 1,000,000 people--a \n        humanitarian crisis on a scale unseen in the United States \n        since the Great Depression.\n            (9) The storm has now become the most destructive and \n        costliest natural disaster in the history of the United States, \n        resulting in over 1,300 deaths and estimated damage between \n        $70,000,000,000 and $130,000,000,000.\n            (10) Less than one month later, on September 24, 2005, the \n        region was battered again, this time by the strongest-measured \n        hurricane to ever have entered the Gulf of Mexico--Hurricane \n        Rita.\n            (11) Hurricane Rita came ashore between Texas and Louisiana \n        as a category 3 hurricane, packing winds up to 120 miles per \n        hour and a storm surge of 10 feet.\n            (12) A day prior to landfall, the resultant storm surge \n        also reopened some of the levee breaches caused by Hurricane \n        Katrina a month earlier and re-flooded parts of New Orleans.\n            (13) Local storm surges of 15 to 20 feet in southwestern \n        Louisiana were reported, and damage was extensive in coastal \n        parishes.\n            (14) Thousands of residents and families in the effected \n        States, who lived outside the 100-year flood plain and were \n        told they did not need flood insurance, suffered significant \n        damage to their homes and in many cases total losses.\n            (15) These families are currently without any type of \n        permanent shelter or any means by which to acquire such shelter \n        or otherwise make themselves whole, thus crippling the Gulf \n        Coast region and its economy.\n            (16) Because of the unprecedented magnitude of the storm \n        and the impact that the devastation of such a large region will \n        have on the United States as a whole, the Federal Government \n        should play a role in providing emergency assistance to these \n        families to help them rebuild and get on with their lives.\n\nSEC. 3. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES DAMAGED \n              OR DESTROYED BY HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA.\n\n    Title IV of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \nAssistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following:\n\n``SEC. 425.
