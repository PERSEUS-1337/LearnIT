FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) President Theodore Roosevelt began an American wildlife \n        conservation legacy by establishing the first national wildlife \n        refuge at Indian River Lagoon on Pelican Island, Florida, on \n        March 14, 1903;\n            (2) the National Wildlife Refuge System is comprised of \n        more than 93,000,000 acres of Federal land managed by the \n        United States Fish and Wildlife Service in more than 520 \n        individual refuges and thousands of Waterfowl Production Areas \n        located in all 50 States and the territories of the United \n        States;\n            (3) the System is the only network of Federal land that--\n                    (A) is dedicated singularly to wildlife \n                conservation; and\n                    (B) has wildlife-dependent recreation and \n                environmental education as priority public uses;\n            (4) the System serves a vital role in the conservation of \n        millions of migratory birds, hundreds of endangered and \n        threatened species, some of the premier fisheries of the United \n        States, marine mammals, and the habitats on which those species \n        depend;\n            (5)(A) each year the System provides millions of Americans \n        with opportunities to participate in wildlife-dependent \n        recreation, including hunting, fishing, and wildlife \n        observation; and\n            (B) through those activities, Americans develop an \n        appreciation for the natural wonders and wildlife heritage of \n        the United States;\n            (6) the occasion of the centennial of the beginning of the \n        System, in 2003, presents a historic opportunity to enhance \n        natural resource stewardship and expand compatible public \n        enjoyment of the national wildlife refuges of the United \n        States; and\n            (7) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service--\n                    (A) recognizes that the System has a backlog of \n                unmet critical operations and maintenance needs;\n                    (B) has worked to prioritize those needs; and\n                    (C) has made efforts to control the extent of the \n                backlog.\n\nSEC. 3.
