Such transfers may provide for the sale of \n                generating equipment and facilities to persons other \n                than the persons to whom transmission facilities are \n                sold.

Such transfers may provide, \n                to the extent practicable, for the grouping of \n                facilities utilizing different sources of power \n                (including coal-fired, nuclear, and hydroelectric \n                generating facilities) and provide for access to the \n                transmission grids of the Federal Power Marketing \n                Administrations by such groupings to ensure \n                availability of power from different sources and to \n                enhance competition. All outstanding loans associated \n                with such facilities and equipment shall be assumed by \n                the purchasers.\n                    (B) Transfer of jurisdictional authority over real \n                property.--Transfer to appropriate governmental \n                departments and agencies, including the National Park \n                Service, of jurisdictional authority over real property \n                which is controlled by the Federal Power Marketing \n                Administrations and which is not transferred under \n                subparagraph (A).\n                    (C) Transfer of certain functions.--Transfer to \n                appropriate Federal departments and agencies of \n                functions of the Federal Power Marketing \n                Administrations which are not related to power \n                generation and sale.\n                    (D) Termination of federal power marketing \n                administrations.--Termination of the Federal Power \n                Marketing Administrations after the transfers under \n                subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) have been made.\n            (3) Additional requirements.--The plan developed under \n        paragraph (1) shall include--\n                    (A) a step-by-step procedure to carry out the sales \n                and transfers described in paragraph (2);\n                    (B) a timetable for implementation of each step of \n                the plan;\n                    (C) an estimate of the amount of anticipated net \n                proceeds from the sale of assets of the Federal Power \n                Marketing Administrations; and\n                    (D) an estimate of the cost of implementing the \n                plan."
