FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) It is in the national interest for the citizens of the \n        Nation, and those who purchase products of the United States \n        Mint, to know that gold, silver, and platinum coinage produced \n        by the several United States mints are of the proper size, \n        weight, and purity provided for by law.\n            (2) From 1792 until 1977, an annual assay commission, as \n        first required by the Act entitled ``An Act establishing a \n        Mint, and regulating the Coins of the United States'' and \n        approved April 2, 1792, performed such functions, until such \n        time as there were no precious metal coins regularly being \n        produced by the United States mints.\n            (3) Since 1977, the United States Mint has begun regular \n        production of bullion coinage comprised of .999 fine silver, \n        .9995 fine platinum, and gold of either .900 or .999 fine.\n            (4) Since 1982, the United States Mint has produced \n        millions of gold and silver commemorative coins that have sold \n        to collectors and others on the primary market for more than \n        $1,000,000,000.\n            (5) It is desirable to involve numismatists, and others, in \n        the process of marketing and merchandising of coins, of which \n        an annual assay is an important component part.\n            (6) There is a marketing need for an annual ceremony to \n        attest that the coins produced by the several United States \n        mints are manufactured in conformity with their statutory \n        requirements, to publicize the same, and to involve the general \n        and numismatic public in the annual assay and its report.\n\nSEC. 3.
