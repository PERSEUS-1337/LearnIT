FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Manufacturing Extension Partnership services are \n        available in all 50 States and at 392 locations.\n            (2) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership delivers \n        critical services to small and midsized manufacturers, \n        providing access to public and private resources that enhance \n        growth, improve productivity, and expand capacity.\n            (3) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership helps \n        manufacturers position themselves as strong long-term \n        competitors in domestic and international markets.\n            (4) Of the 7 million jobs lost in the recession as of \n        February 2009, over 2 million were from the manufacturing \n        sector, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership reported \n        creating or retaining over 57,000 manufacturing jobs in the \n        most recent surveyed year.\n            (5) The Manufacturing Extension Partnership has delivered \n        $1.44 billion in cost savings annually and $10.5 billion in \n        increased or retained sales in a single year.\n            (6) Every dollar contributed by the Federal Government to \n        the Manufacturing Extension Partnership is matched 2-to-1 by \n        State and local governments and participating manufacturers.\n            (7) The recession has strained many State budgets, and 23 \n        State Manufacturing Extension Partnership Centers reported a \n        decrease or elimination of State funding in 2009.\n            (8) When a State decreases or eliminates funding for the \n        Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the cost-share burden is \n        shifted to small manufacturers who are unlikely to be able to \n        afford increased contributions during an economic downturn, and \n        the availability of Manufacturing Extension Partnership \n        services is jeopardized.\n            (9) A reduction in the matching requirement for \n        participants in the Manufacturing Extension Partnership will \n        greatly alleviate the burden on State budgets and small \n        manufacturers and preserve the Manufacturing Extension \n        Partnership's ability to provide critical services to small \n        manufacturers and create much-needed jobs in the manufacturing \n        sector.\n\nSEC. 2. HOLLINGS MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM.\n\n    Section 25(c) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nAct (15 U.S.C. 278k(c)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, unless otherwise \n        determined under paragraph (3)(C)'' before the period at the \n        end;\n            (2) in paragraph (3)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (B)--\n                            (i) by striking ``not less than 50 percent \n                        of the costs incurred for the first 3 years and \n                        an increasing share for each of the last 3 \n                        years'' and inserting ``the applicant's share \n                        of the costs incurred (in this subsection \n                        referred to as `cost share')''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``For purposes of the \n                        preceding sentence, the'' and inserting \n                        ``The'';\n                    (B) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as \n                subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively;\n                    (C) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the \n                following new subparagraph:\n                    ``(C) The Secretary shall by rule establish \n                appropriate criteria to be considered in determining a \n                Center's cost share.

The Secretary shall review each Center's cost \n                share annually and at such other times as the Secretary \n                considers appropriate. An adjustment to a Center's cost \n                share in a year shall not affect the amount of Federal \n                funds such Center receives in such year.''; and\n                    (D) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated by \n                subparagraph (B)--\n                            (i) by striking ``50 percent'' and \n                        inserting ``cost share''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``Center's contribution'' \n                        and inserting ``Center's cost share''; and\n            (3) in paragraph (5)--\n                    (A) in the 6th sentence, by striking ``at declining \n                levels''; and\n                    (B) in the last sentence--\n                            (i) by striking ``Funding'' and inserting \n                        ``Unless otherwise determined under paragraph \n                        (3)(C), funding''; and\n                            (ii) by striking ``one third'' and \n                        inserting ``50 percent''."
