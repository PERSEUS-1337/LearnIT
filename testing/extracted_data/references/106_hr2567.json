MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS.\n\n    Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \nU.S.C. 8001 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n         ``PART L--MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS\n\n``SEC. 10993. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) Although 7,500,000 children under the age of 18 \n        require mental health services, fewer than 1 in 5 of these \n        children receive the services.\n            ``(2) Across the United States, counseling professionals \n        are stretched thin, and often students do not get the help the \n        students need. The current national average ratio of students \n        to counselors in elementary and secondary schools is 513:1.\n            ``(3) United States schools need more mental health \n        professionals, and the flexibility to hire the professionals \n        that will best serve their students.\n            ``(4) The maximum recommended ratio of--\n                    ``(A) students to counselors is 250:1;\n                    ``(B) students to psychologists is 1,000:1; and\n                    ``(C) students to social workers is 800:1.\n            ``(5) In States like California or Minnesota, 1 counselor \n        typically serves more than 1,000 students. In some schools, no \n        counselor is available to assist students in times of crisis, \n        or at any other time. In Colorado, the average student-to-\n        counselor ratio is 645:1.\n            ``(6) The number of students is expected to grow \n        significantly over the next few years. During this time, many \n        school-based mental health professionals who currently serve \n        our Nation's youth will retire. Not counting these retirements, \n        over 100,000 new school counselors will be needed to decrease \n        the student-to-counselor ratio to 250:1 by the year 2005.\n            ``(7) The Federal support for reducing the student-to-\n        counselor ratio would pay for itself, through reduced \n        incidences of death, violence, and substance abuse, and through \n        improvements in students' academic achievement, graduation \n        rates, college attendance, and employment.\n\n``SEC. 10993A. PURPOSE.\n\n    ``The purpose of this part is to help States and local educational \nagencies recruit, train, and hire 141,000 additional school-based \nmental health personnel, including 100,000 additional counselors, \n21,000 additional school psychologists, and 20,000 additional school \nsocial workers over a 5-year period--\n            ``(1) to reduce the student-to-counselor ratios nationally, \n        in elementary and secondary schools, to an average of--\n                    ``(A) 1 school counselor for every 250 students\n                    ``(B) 1 school psychologist for every 1,000 \n                students; and\n                    ``(C) 1 social worker for every 800 students;\n        as recommended in a report by the Institute of Medicine of the \n        National Academy of Sciences relating to schools and health, \n        issued in 1997;\n            ``(2) to help adequately address the mental, emotional, and \n        developmental needs of elementary and secondary school \n        students;\n            ``(3) to remove the emotional, behavioral, and psycho-\n        social barriers to learning so as to enhance the classroom \n        preparedness and ability to learn of students;\n            ``(4) to support school staff and teachers in improving \n        classroom management, conducting behavioral interventions to \n        improve school discipline, and developing the awareness and \n        skills to identify early warning signs of violence and the need \n        for mental health services; and\n            ``(5) to support parents in improving the school behavior \n        and academic success of their children.\n\n``SEC. 10993B.
