    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Regulatory \nImprovement Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Small businesses are frequently the source of new \n        products, methods, and innovations.\n            (2) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n        to creating jobs in a dynamic economy.\n            (3) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n        entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n        other small entities.\n            (4) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n        in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n        small entities disproportionately burdensome demands, including \n        legal, accounting, and consulting costs.\n            (5) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n        recognize and take account of the differences in the scale and \n        resources of regulated entities but have failed to do so.\n            (6) Alternative regulatory approaches that do not conflict \n        with the stated objectives of the statutes the regulations seek \n        to implement may be available and may minimize the significant \n        economic impact of regulations on small businesses and other \n        small entities.\n            (7) Federal agencies have failed to analyze and uncover \n        less costly alternative regulatory approaches, despite the fact \n        that the chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \n        known as the Regulatory Flexibility Act), requires them to do \n        so.\n            (8) Federal agencies continue to interpret chapter 6 of \n        title 5, United States Code, in a manner that permits them to \n        avoid their analytical responsibilities.\n            (9) Significant changes are needed in the methods by which \n        Federal agencies develop and analyze regulations, receive input \n        from affected entities, and develop regulatory alternatives \n        that will lessen the burden or maximize the benefits of final \n        rules to small businesses and other small entities.\n            (10) It is the intention of the Congress to amend chapter 6 \n        of title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n        including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n        rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking process \n        and that the agencies assess a full range of alternatives that \n        will limit adverse economic consequences or enhance economic \n        benefits.\n            (11) Federal agencies should be capable of assessing the \n        impact of proposed and final rules without delaying the \n        regulatory process or impinging on the ability of Federal \n        agencies to fulfill their statutory mandates.\n\nSEC. 3. CLARIFICATION AND EXPANSION OF RULES COVERED BY THE REGULATORY \n              FLEXIBILITY ACT.\n\n    Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at \nthe end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(9) Economic impact.--The term `economic impact' means, \n        with respect to a proposed or final rule--\n                    ``(A) any direct economic effect on small entities \n                of such rule; and\n                    ``(B) any indirect economic effect on small \n                entities which is reasonably foreseeable and results \n                from such rule (without regard to whether small \n                entities will be directly regulated by the rule).''.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS PROVIDING FOR MORE DETAILED ANALYSES.\n\n    (a) Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.--Subsection (b) of \nsection 603 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as \nfollows:\n    ``(b) Each initial regulatory flexibility analysis required under \nthis section shall contain a detailed statement describing--\n            ``(1) the reasons why the action by the agency is being \n        considered;\n            ``(2) the objectives of, and legal basis for, the proposed \n        rule;\n            ``(3) the type of small entities to which the proposed rule \n        will apply;\n            ``(4) the number of small entities to which the proposed \n        rule will apply or why such estimate is not available;\n            ``(5) the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other \n        compliance requirements of the proposed rule, including an \n        estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject \n        to the requirement, the costs, and the type of professional \n        skills necessary to comply with the rule; and\n            ``(6) all relevant Federal rules which may duplicate, \n        overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule, or the reasons why \n        such a description could not be provided.''.\n    (b) Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.--\n            (1) Paragraph (1) of section 604(a) of title 5, United \n        States Code, is amended by striking ``succinct''.\n            (2) Paragraph (3) of such section is amended by striking \n        ``an explanation'' and inserting ``a detailed explanation''.\n            (3) Paragraph (4) of such section is amended to read as \n        follows:\n            ``(4) a description of the projected reporting, \n        recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the rule, \n        including an estimate of the classes of small entities which \n        will be subject to the requirement, the costs, and the type of \n        professional skills necessary to comply with the rule; and''.\n    (c) Certification of No Impact.--Subsection (b) of section 605 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting ``detailed'' \nbefore ``statement'' both places such term appears.\n\nSEC. 5.

Periodic review of rules\n    ``(a) Not later than 180 days after the enactment of the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Improvement Act, each agency shall publish in the \nFederal Register and place on its website a plan for the periodic \nreview of rules issued by the agency which the head of the agency \ndetermines have a significant economic impact on a substantial number \nof small entities. Such determination shall be made without regard to \nwhether the agency performed an analysis under section 604. The purpose \nof the review shall be to determine whether such rules should be \ncontinued without change, or should be amended or rescinded, consistent \nwith the stated objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize \nsignificant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities. \nSuch plan may be amended by the agency at any time by publishing the \nrevision in the Federal Register and subsequently placing the amended \nplan on the agency's website.\n    ``(b) The plan shall provide for the review of all such agency \nrules existing on the date of the enactment of the Small Business \nRegulatory Improvement Act within 10 years of the date of publication \nof the plan in the Federal Register and for review of rules adopted \nafter the date of enactment of the Small Business Regulatory \nImprovement Act within 10 years after the publication of the final rule \nin the Federal Register. If the head of the agency determines that \ncompletion of the review of existing rules is not feasible by the \nestablished date, the head of the agency shall so certify in a \nstatement published in the Federal Register and may extend the review \nfor not longer than 2 years after publication of notice of extension in \nthe Federal Register. Such certification and notice shall be sent to \nthe Chief Counsel for Advocacy and the Congress.\n    ``(c) Each agency shall annually submit a report regarding the \nresults of its review pursuant to such plan to the Congress and, in the \ncase of agencies other than independent regulatory agencies (as defined \nin section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code) to the \nAdministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of \nthe Office of Management and Budget. Such report shall include the \nidentification of any rule with respect to which the head of the agency \nmade a determination described in paragraph (5) or (6) of subsection \n(d) and a detailed explanation of the reasons for such determination.\n    ``(d) In reviewing rules under such plan, the agency shall consider \nthe following factors:\n            ``(1) The continued need for the rule.\n            ``(2) The nature of complaints received by the agency from \n        small entities concerning the rule.\n            ``(3) Comments by the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and \n        the Chief Counsel for Advocacy.\n            ``(4) The complexity of the rule.\n            ``(5) The extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates, or \n        conflicts with other Federal rules and, unless the head of the \n        agency determines it to be infeasible, State and local rules.\n            ``(6) The length of time since the rule has been evaluated \n        or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or \n        other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule.\n    ``(e) The agency shall publish in the Federal Register and on its \nwebsite a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to such plan. Such \npublication shall include a brief description of the rule, the reason \nwhy the agency determined that it has a significant economic impact on \na substantial number of small entities (without regard to whether it \nhad prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule), and \nrequest comments from the public, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, and \nthe Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman concerning the enforcement of the \nrule.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
