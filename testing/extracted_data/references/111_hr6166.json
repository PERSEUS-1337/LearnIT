If the Secretary determines that it is appropriate \n    to issue any proof version of such coin, coins of such version \n    shall be struck only at the United States Mint at West Point, New \n    York.\n        ``(8) Marketing study defined.--The market study described in \n    paragraph (1) means an analysis of the market for palladium bullion \n    investments conducted by a reputable, independent third party that \n    demonstrates that there would be adequate demand for palladium \n    bullion coins produced by the United States Mint to ensure that \n    such coins could be minted and issued at no net cost to \n    taxpayers.''.\nSEC. 3. BUDGETARY EFFECT.\n    The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying \nwith the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be determined by \nreference to the latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO \nLegislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \nRecord by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that \nsuch statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
