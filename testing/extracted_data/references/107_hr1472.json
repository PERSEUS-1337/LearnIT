The study shall--\n            (1) determine the effectiveness of the Foundation's \n        programs, with emphasis on quantitative evidence of the \n        programs' impact on increasing the numbers of individuals \n        obtaining baccalaureate and graduate degrees in science, \n        mathematics, and engineering and subsequently entering careers \n        in those fields;\n            (2) identify the principal characteristics of effective \n        programs and factors that would affect the replication of \n        effective programs at other sites; and\n            (3) develop recommendations for surveys and for other data \n        collection and analysis activities that would strengthen the \n        Foundation's capability to assess the effectiveness of these \n        programs and to replicate and enlarge successful programs.\n    (b) Plan.--On the basis of the assessment under subsection (a), the \nDirector shall develop a plan for--\n            (1) instituting a research grants program and allocating \n        resources for the Foundation's internal assessment activities \n        to address recommendations developed under subsection (a)(3); \n        and\n            (2) scaling up and replicating programs and activities that \n        have been determined to be effective in increasing the numbers \n        of baccalaureate and graduate degrees in science, mathematics, \n        and engineering from segments of the population \n        underrepresented in these career fields.\n    (c) Transmittal to Congress.--The National Science Foundation shall \ntransmit to Congress within 18 months after the date of enactment of \nthis Act a report setting forth the findings, conclusions, and \nrecommendations of the assessment conducted in accordance with \nsubsection (a) and the plan developed in accordance with subsection \n(b), including recommended funding levels for proposed programs and \nactivities.\n\nSEC. 9. NATIONAL RESEARCH FACILITIES PLAN.\n\n    Section 201 of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of \n1998 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) Cost Categories.--All cost data on facilities construction, \nrepair and upgrades, operations, and maintenance provided in the plan \nrequired under subsection (a) shall indicate the source of the funds by \nappropriations account. Data supplied on operations costs shall \nindicate current and planned funding for instrumentation development \nand upgrades required to maintain the scientific value of the \nfacility.''.\n\nSEC. 10. REPORTS ELIMINATION.\n\n    Section 3003(a)(1) of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset \nAct of 1995 (31 U.S.C. 1113 note) does not apply to any report required \nto be submitted under any of the following provisions of law:\n            (1) Section 4(j)(1) of the National Science Foundation Act \n        of 1950 (42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1)).\n            (2) Section 36(e) of the Science and Engineering Equal \n        Opportunities Act (42 U.S.C. 1885c(e)).\n            (3) Section 37 of the Science and Engineering Equal \n        Opportunities Act (42 U.S.C. 1885d).\n            (4) Section 108 of the National Science Foundation \n        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1986 (42 U.S.C. 1886).\n            (5) Section 101(a)(3) of the High-Performance Computing Act \n        of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 5511(a)(3)).\n            (6) Section 3(a)(7) and (f) of the National Science \n        Foundation Act of 1950 (42 U.S.C. 1862(a)(7) and (f)).\n            (7) Section 7(a) of the National Science Foundation \n        Authorization Act, 1977 (42 U.S.C. 1873 note)."
