FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) The General Accounting Office reported in 1995 that \n        ``America's schools are not designed or equipped for the 21st \n        Century'';\n            (2) an excellent education that provides American children \n        with a fighting chance at the American Dream includes rigorous \n        academic basic instruction, plus technological literacy and \n        proficiency in working with computers;\n            (3) by the year 2000, 60 percent of American jobs will \n        require technology skills; thus, without early training in \n        technological literacy, many of our future leaders will start \n        their adult lives at a severe economic disadvantage;\n            (4) while America's classrooms are supported by dedicated \n        teachers, involved families, and bright young children, many of \n        our Nation's classrooms lack the important technological \n        resources that they need to prepare both teachers and students \n        for a technologically advanced present and future;\n            (5) advanced technology has improved America's economic \n        competitiveness, transformed commerce and communications, and \n        improved the quality of life of millions of Americans, but it \n        has not yet made as transforming an impact on the way schools \n        educate children;\n            (6) the Internet and the World Wide Web are revolutionizing \n        the way individuals and organizations share and find \n        information, yet only 14 percent of our classrooms have a \n        telephone jack, and about 1 in 50 are connected to the \n        Internet; furthermore, the most common computer in our Nation's \n        schools is the Apple 2c, introduced over a decade ago and now \n        on display at the Smithsonian Institution; and while 50 percent \n        of schools have local area computer networks (LANs), less than \n        10 percent of those networks connect with computers in \n        classrooms;\n            (7) therefore, bringing America's classrooms into the 21st \n        Century requires a major national investment in technology, \n        including computers, software, and interactive \n        interconnectivity;\n            (8) the sums required to bring our classrooms into the 21st \n        Century extend into the tens of billions of dollars;\n            (9) Congress has authorized and funded several programs \n        which invest in education technology; however, because of the \n        immense scale of the need, and because primary and secondary \n        education are primarily a local and State responsibility, \n        bringing our classrooms into the 21st Century is best done in a \n        manner that does not increase Federal Government expenditures \n        or bureaucracy and keeps control as close as possible to the \n        children and teachers who will benefit; and\n            (10) many businesses invest their time and resources into \n        classrooms; but the tremendous need for additional computer \n        equipment and software in our classrooms, plus the wave of \n        computer upgrades taking place among businesses in the United \n        States, argue persuasively for an additional financial \n        incentive to encourage businesses to invest their equipment \n        into 21st Century classrooms.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to direct the innovation \nand energy of private enterprise to the education of our young people, \nexpand technological literacy, and bring the education of our young \npeople into the 21st Century.\n\nSEC. 3.
