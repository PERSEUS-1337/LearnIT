FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) A single, simple nuclear weapon detonated in the heart \n        of an American city would kill 100,000 people instantly, and \n        seriously injure tens of thousands more. A significant portion \n        of the city would probably become permanently uninhabitable, \n        with little chance of a successful cleanup.\n            (2) Making such a weapon would not be difficult, by modern \n        technological standards, given 25 to 35 pounds of highly \n        enriched uranium.\n            (3) Since the development of the first nuclear weapons, \n        countries around the world have recognized the unique risk that \n        nuclear weapons pose to peace and security.\n            (4) The first treaty limiting the use of nuclear technology \n        was the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which banned the \n        testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in outer space, \n        and under water. Since that time, many treaties to limit the \n        use and proliferation of nuclear weapons have been signed.\n            (5) Perhaps the most important of these treaties is the \n        Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which \n        restricts almost all of the 188 nations that are signatories \n        from developing nuclear weapons. As part of their obligation \n        under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n        153 countries have reached safeguards agreements with the \n        International Atomic Energy Agency that require a comprehensive \n        system for accounting for nuclear materials and intrusive \n        inspections of their nuclear facilities.\n            (6) These treaties and safeguards agreements reflect the \n        worldwide understanding that nuclear materials in the wrong \n        hands pose a direct threat to peace and prosperity.\n            (7) Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, Article 39 \n        states the following: ``The Security Council shall determine \n        the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, \n        or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide \n        what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and \n        42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.''\n            (8) In 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n        unanimously adopted Resolution 1540, binding on all members of \n        the United Nations, which stated in part the following:\n        ``The Security Council, ... Acting under Chapter VII of the \n        Charter of the United Nations, ...\n                    ``2. Decides also that all States, in accordance \n                with their national procedures, shall adopt and enforce \n                appropriate effective laws which prohibit any non-State \n                actor to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, \n                transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or \n                biological weapons and their means of delivery, in \n                particular for terrorist purposes, as well as attempts \n                to engage in any of the foregoing activities, \n                participate in them as an accomplice, assist or finance \n                them;\n                    ``3. Decides also that all States shall take and \n                enforce effective measures to establish domestic \n                controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, \n                chemical, or biological weapons and their means of \n                delivery, including by establishing appropriate \n                controls over related materials and to this end shall: \n                ...\n                            ``(d) Establish, develop, review and \n                        maintain appropriate effective national export \n                        and trans-shipment controls over such items, \n                        including appropriate laws and regulations to \n                        control export, transit, trans-shipment and re-\n                        export and controls on providing funds and \n                        services related to such export and trans-\n                        shipment such as financing, and transporting \n                        that would contribute to proliferation, as well \n                        as establishing end-user controls; and \n                        establishing and enforcing appropriate criminal \n                        or civil penalties for violations of such \n                        export control laws and regulations;''.\n            (9) Resolution 1540 reflects the general understanding of \n        the members of the United Nations that the illicit transfer of \n        nuclear weapons and related materials is a ``threat to the \n        peace''.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States that the transfer of a \nnuclear weapon or device or of nuclear material or technology with \nreason to believe that the weapon or device, or a weapon or device made \nusing the transferred material or technology, may be used for terrorist \npurposes, is a crime against humanity and that individuals are liable \nfor such acts under customary international criminal law.\n\nSEC. 4.
