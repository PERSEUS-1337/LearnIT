MODIFICATION OF LONG-TERM CONTRACT REGARDING TONGASS NATIONAL \n              FOREST.\n\n    Title III of the Tongass Timber Reform Act (Public Law 101-626; 104 \nStat. 4430) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 302. 1996 CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) The term `board feet' means net scribner long-log \n        scale for all sawlogs and all hemlock and spruce utility grade \n        logs.\n            ``(2) The term `contract' means the timber sale contract \n        numbered A10fs-1042 between the United States and the Ketchikan \n        Pulp Company.\n            ``(3) The term `contracting officer' means the Regional \n        Forester of Region 10 of the United States Forest Service.\n            ``(4) The term `mid-market criteria' means an appraisal \n        that ensures an average timber operator will have a weighted \n        average profit and risk margin of at least 60 percent of normal \n        in a mid-market situation, representative of the most recent 10 \n        years of actual market data.\n            ``(5) The term `proportionality' means the proportion of \n        high volume stands (stands of 30,000 or more board feet per \n        acre) to low volume stands (stands of 8,000 to 30,000 board \n        feet per acre).\n            ``(6) The term `purchaser' means the Ketchikan Pulp \n        Company.\n    ``(b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) On July 26, 1951, the Forest Service, on behalf of \n        the United States, and the purchaser entered into a contract to \n        harvest 8,250,000,000 board feet of timber from the Tongass \n        National Forest in the State of Alaska. While the contract is \n        scheduled to end June 30, 2004, it acknowledges an intention on \n        the part of the Forest Service to supply adequate timber \n        thereafter for permanent operation of the purchaser's \n        facilities on a commercially sound and permanently economical \n        basis. This legislation is necessary to effectuate that intent.\n            ``(2) A pulp mill or similar facility is necessary in \n        southeast Alaska to optimize the level of year-round, high-\n        paying jobs in the area, to provide high value added use of \n        low-grade wood and by-product material from sawmilling \n        operations, and to maintain a stable regional economy.\n            ``(3) The purchaser plans to make environmental and \n        operational improvements to its pulp mill, including conversion \n        to an elementally chlorine free bleaching process, expansion of \n        wastewater treatment facilities, relocation of the existing \n        wastewater outfall, and improvements to chemical recovery and \n        power generation equipment. Total capital expenditures are \n        estimated to be $200,000,000, $25,000,000 of which the \n        purchaser has already invested.\n            ``(4) Extension of the contract for 15 years is the minimum \n        reasonable extension period to allow amortization of these \n        environmental improvement and energy efficiency projects.\n            ``(5) Ketchikan is the fourth largest city in Alaska. Its \n        economic and job base are extremely dependent upon the \n        continuation of the contract, which provides the principal \n        source of year-round employment in the area. The purchaser has \n        stated among its goals and objectives the following:\n                    ``(A) Continuation of a long-term commitment to \n                Ketchikan and southeast Alaska, including maintenance \n                of a stable Alaskan workforce, utilization of Alaskan \n                contractors, vendors, and suppliers to permit those \n                businesses to hire and maintain Alaskan employees.\n                    ``(B) Participation in the Forest Service's land \n                management planning process with other users so that \n                the process may be completed expeditiously with maximum \n                information.\n                    ``(C) Adherence to sound principles of multiple-use \n                and sustained yield of forest resources providing for \n                the production of sustainable contract volumes for the \n                purchaser and the other timber operators in southeast \n                Alaska and the protection and promotion of other forest \n                uses, including tourism, fishing, subsistence, hunting, \n                mining, and recreation.\n                    ``(D) Protection of air, water, and land, including \n                fish and wildlife habitat, through compliance with \n                applicable Federal, State, and local laws.\n                    ``(E) Commitment to continue to explore new \n                processes and technology to maximize the use of timber \n                harvested and increase the value of products \n                manufactured in southeast Alaska.\n            ``(6) The national interest is served by a policy that \n        accomplishes the proper stewardship of publicly owned assets in \n        the Tongass National Forest, a fair return to the United States \n        for public timber in the Tongass National Forest, and a proper \n        balance among multiple use interests in the Tongass National \n        Forest to enhance forest health, sustainable harvest, and the \n        general economic health and growth in southeast Alaska and the \n        United States in order to improve national economic benefits. \n        The national interest is best achieved by fostering domestic \n        forest product markets and by modifying the terms of the \n        contract pursuant to subsection (c).\n    ``(c) Contract Fairness Changes.--The contract is hereby modified \nas follows:\n            ``(1) Extension.--The term of the contract is extended by \n        15 years from June 30, 2004.\n            ``(2) Sale Offering plan.--The contract shall include a \n        plan describing the amount of volume, location, and the \n        schedule by which the purchaser shall receive the timber \n        required by paragraph (3) for the remainder of the contract \n        term.
