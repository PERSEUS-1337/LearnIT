If a committee fails to report the \n                bill within that period or the House has adopted a \n                concurrent resolution providing for adjournment sine \n                die at the end of a Congress, such committee shall be \n                automatically discharged from further consideration of \n                the bill and it shall be placed on the appropriate \n                calendar.\n                    (B) Proceeding to consideration.--Not later than 3 \n                legislative days after the approval bill is reported or \n                a committee has been discharged from further \n                consideration thereof, it shall be in order to move to \n                proceed to consider the approval bill in the House. \n                Such a motion shall be in order only at a time \n                designated by the Speaker in the legislative schedule \n                within two legislative days after the day on which the \n                proponent announces an intention to the House to offer \n                the motion provided that such notice may not be given \n                until the approval bill is reported or a committee has \n                been discharged from further consideration thereof. \n                Such a motion shall not be in order after the House has \n                disposed of a motion to proceed with respect to that \n                special message. The previous question shall be \n                considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption \n                without intervening motion. A motion to reconsider the \n                vote by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in \n                order.\n                    (C) Consideration.--If the motion to proceed is \n                agreed to, the House shall immediately proceed to \n                consider the approval bill in the House without \n                intervening motion. The approval bill shall be \n                considered as read. All points of order against the \n                approval bill and against its consideration are waived. \n                The previous question shall be considered as ordered on \n                the approval bill to its passage without intervening \n                motion except 4 hours of debate equally divided and \n                controlled by the proponent and an opponent and one \n                motion to limit debate on the bill. A motion to \n                reconsider the vote on passage of the approval bill \n                shall not be in order.\n            (3) Consideration in the senate.--\n                    (A) Committee action.--The appropriate committee of \n                the Senate shall report without amendment the approval \n                bill not later than the third session day after \n                introduction. If a committee fails to report the \n                approval bill within that period or the Senate has \n                adopted a concurrent resolution providing for \n                adjournment sine die at the end of a Congress, the \n                committee shall be automatically discharged from \n                further consideration of the approval bill and it shall \n                be placed on the appropriate calendar.\n                    (B) Motion to proceed.--Not later than 3 session \n                days after the approval bill is reported in the Senate \n                or the committee has been discharged thereof, it shall \n                be in order for any Senator to move to proceed to \n                consider the approval bill in the Senate. The motion \n                shall be decided without debate and the motion to \n                reconsider shall be deemed to have been laid on the \n                table. Such a motion shall not be in order after the \n                Senate has disposed of a prior motion to proceed with \n                respect to the approval bill.\n                    (C) Consideration.--If a motion to proceed to the \n                consideration of the approval bill is agreed to, the \n                Senate shall immediately proceed to consideration of \n                the approval bill without intervening motion, order, or \n                other business, and the approval bill shall remain the \n                unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of. \n                Consideration on the bill in the Senate under this \n                subsection, and all debatable motions and appeals in \n                connection therewith, shall not exceed 10 hours equally \n                divided in the usual form. All points of order against \n                the approval bill or its consideration are waived. \n                Consideration in the Senate on any debatable motion or \n                appeal in connection with the approval bill shall be \n                limited to not more than 1 hour. A motion to postpone, \n                or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other \n                business, or a motion to recommit the approval bill is \n                not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which \n                the approval bill is agreed to or disagreed to is not \n                in order.\n            (4) Amendments prohibited.--No amendment to, or motion to \n        strike a provision from, an approval bill considered under this \n        section shall be in order in either the Senate or the House of \n        Representatives.\n            (5) Coordination with action by other house.--\n                    (A) In general.--If, before passing the approval \n                bill, one House receives from the other a bill--\n                            (i) the approval bill of the other House \n                        shall not be referred to a committee; and\n                            (ii) the procedure in the receiving House \n                        shall be the same as if no approval bill had \n                        been received from the other House until the \n                        vote on passage, when the bill received from \n                        the other House shall supplant the approval \n                        bill of the receiving House.\n                    (B) Exception.--This paragraph shall not apply to \n                the House of Representatives.\n    (b) Limitation.--Subsection (a) shall apply only to an approval \nbill described in subsection (c) and introduced pursuant to subsection \n(a)(1).\n    (c) Approval Bill Described.--For purposes of subsection (a), a \nbill described in this paragraph is a bill--\n            (1) which consists of the proposed legislation which is \n        included in such report to carry out the recommendations made \n        by the Commission in the report; and\n            (2) the title of which is as follows: ``A bill to carry out \n        the recommendations of the Commission on Long Term Social \n        Security Solvency.''.\n    (d) Extended Time Period.--If Congress adjourns at the end of a \nCongress and an approval bill was then pending in either House of \nCongress or a committee thereof, or an approval bill had not yet been \nintroduced with respect to a special message, then within the first 3 \ndays of session of the next Congress, the Commission shall transmit to \nCongress an additional special message containing all of the \ninformation in the previous, pending special message. An approval bill \nmay be introduced within the first five days of session of such next \nCongress and shall be treated as an approval bill under this section, \nand the time periods described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection \n(a) shall commence on the day of introduction of that approval bill."
