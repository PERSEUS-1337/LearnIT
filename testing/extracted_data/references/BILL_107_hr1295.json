FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) During 2001, 182,800 new cases of female invasive \n        breast cancer will be diagnosed, and 40,800 women will die from \n        the disease. In addition, 1,400 male cases are projected to be \n        diagnosed, and 400 men will die from the disease.\n            (2) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n        death among all women and the leading cause of cancer death \n        among women between ages 40 and 55.\n            (3) Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among \n        women, excluding skin cancers.\n            (4) Each year thousands of women and men who cannot afford \n        treatment are diagnosed with breast cancer.\n            (5) Early detection of breast cancer is the best \n        protection. However, there is no benefit of early detection if \n        adequate treatment cannot be obtained.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To promote the creation of specialized license plates \n        for breast cancer awareness and research or treatment programs \n        by providing matching grants to States that develop and fund \n        such license plate programs.\n            (2) To provide an incentive for States to develop a program \n        similar to the Breast Cancer License Plate program in \n        California, which authorizes special breast cancer license \n        plates for an increased fee with a portion of that fee being \n        expended to assist low-income breast cancer victims in \n        affording treatment or to increase research funding.\n            (3) To continue the partnerships among the Federal \n        Government, State governments, and individuals in raising \n        awareness about breast cancer among all Americans.\n\nSEC. 3.
