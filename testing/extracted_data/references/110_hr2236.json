FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Women with infants and toddlers are a rapidly growing \n        segment of the labor force today.\n            (2) Statistical surveys of families show that over 50 \n        percent of mothers with children less than 1 year of age are in \n        the labor force.\n            (3) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that \n        mothers breastfeed exclusively for six months but continuing \n        for at least the 1st year of a child's life and that \n        arrangements be made to allow a mother's expressing of milk if \n        mother and child must separate.\n            (4) Research studies show that children who are not \n        breastfed have higher rates of mortality, meningitis, some \n        types of cancers, asthma and other respiratory illnesses, \n        bacterial and viral infections, diarrhoeal diseases, ear \n        infections, allergies, and obesity.\n            (5) Research studies have also shown that breastmilk and \n        breastfeeding have protective effects against the development \n        of a number of chronic diseases, including juvenile diabetes, \n        lymphomas, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, some chronic liver \n        diseases, and ulcerative colitis.\n            (6) Maternal benefits of breastfeeding include a reduced \n        risk for postpartum hemorrhage and decreased risk for \n        developing osteoporosis, ovarian cancer, and premenopausal \n        breast cancer.\n            (7) The health benefits to children from breastfeeding \n        translate into a threefold decrease in parental absenteeism due \n        to infant illness.\n            (8) Congress intended to include breastfeeding and \n        expressing breast milk as protected conduct under the amendment \n        made by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 to title VII \n        of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n            (9) Although title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \n        so amended, applies with respect to ``pregnancy, childbirth, or \n        related medical conditions'', a few courts have failed to reach \n        the conclusion that breastfeeding and expressing breast milk in \n        the workplace are covered by such title.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n            (1) to promote the health and well-being of infants whose \n        mothers return to the workplace after childbirth, and\n            (2) to clarify that breastfeeding and expressing breast \n        milk in the workplace are protected conduct under the amendment \n        made by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 to title VII \n        of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nSEC. 102. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964.\n\n    Section 701(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e(k)) \nis amended--\n            (1) by inserting ``(including lactation)'' after \n        ``childbirth'', and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following: ``For purposes of \n        this subsection, the term `lactation' means a condition that \n        may result in the feeding of a child directly from the breast \n        or the expressing of milk from the breast.''.\n\n   TITLE II--CREDIT FOR EMPLOYER EXPENSES FOR PROVIDING APPROPRIATE \nENVIRONMENT ON BUSINESS PREMISES FOR EMPLOYED MOTHERS TO BREASTFEED OR \n                    EXPRESS MILK FOR THEIR CHILDREN\n\nSEC. 201. ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR EMPLOYER EXPENSES FOR PROVIDING \n              APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENT ON BUSINESS PREMISES FOR EMPLOYED \n              MOTHERS TO BREASTFEED OR EXPRESS MILK FOR THEIR CHILDREN.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to business related \ncredits) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 45O.
