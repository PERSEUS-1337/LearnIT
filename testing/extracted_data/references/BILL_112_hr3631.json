SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving Urban Area Security \nInitiative Capability Gains Act of 2011'' or the ``Preserving UASI \nCapability Gains Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the wake of the devastating attacks of September 11, \n        2001, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n        United States (the ``9/11 Commission'') concluded that ``[i]f \n        New York or other major cities are to be prepared for future \n        terrorist attacks, different first responder agencies within \n        each city must be fully coordinated, just as different branches \n        of the U.S. military are.''.\n            (2) The 9/11 Commission recommended that limited Federal \n        preparedness and response resources should be allocated to \n        ``supplement state and local resources based on risks and \n        vulnerabilities that merit additional support.''.\n            (3) The Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) program, as \n        established in 2003, provides grant funding to certain high-\n        threat, high-density urban areas that need assistance to build \n        an enhanced and sustainable capacity to prevent, protect \n        against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks and \n        other catastrophic events.\n            (4) The UASI program emphasizes multi-jurisdictional, \n        regional readiness and supports the unique planning, \n        organization, equipment, training, and exercise needs of high-\n        threat, high-density urban areas. State and local governments \n        have leveraged Federal investment under the UASI program to \n        provide personnel, plans, equipment, training, and exercises to \n        first responders to address the homeland security challenges of \n        a post-9/11 world.\n            (5) An August 2011 report issued by the National Urban Area \n        Security Initiative Association stated that between fiscal \n        years 2003 and 2010, high-threat, high-density urban areas had \n        received 6.5 billion dollars in UASI funding to achieve \n        preparedness and response capabilities.\n            (6) Over the past eight years, UASI funding has enabled at-\n        risk State and local governments to develop critical \n        preparedness and response capabilities that such governments \n        could not otherwise achieve.\n            (7) UASI funding has been used to advance the National \n        Homeland Security Priorities promulgated by the Department of \n        Homeland Security in the National Preparedness Guidelines in \n        2007, including to strengthen information sharing and \n        collaboration, strengthen interoperable and operable \n        communications, strengthen planning and citizen preparedness, \n        improve chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and \n        explosives detection, and improve critical infrastructure \n        protection.\n            (8) UASI funding has helped foster better detection of \n        potential threats and information sharing on the local level. \n        In fact, an October 2010 study released by the Institute for \n        Homeland Security Solutions found that 51 percent of the 68 \n        known terrorist plots from 1999 to 2009 were thwarted when \n        community members or local law enforcement--the first lines of \n        defense--detected these threats.\n            (9) For fiscal year 2010, the Department of Homeland \n        Security identified 64 high-threat, high-density urban areas \n        that required UASI funding to achieve and preserve preparedness \n        and response capabilities and provided necessary funding.\n            (10) For fiscal year 2011, the Department of Homeland \n        Security eliminated thirty-two high-threat, high-density urban \n        areas from the UASI program when UASI funding was reduced by 18 \n        percent pursuant to the Department of Defense and Full-Year \n        Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011. The urban areas \n        eliminated are Albany, NY; Austin, TX; Bakersfield, CA; Baton \n        Rouge, LA; Bridgeport, CT; Buffalo, NY; Columbus, OH; El Paso, \n        TX; Hartford, CT; Honolulu, HI; Indianapolis, IN; Jacksonville, \n        FL; Kansas City, MO; Louisville, KY; Memphis, TN; Milwaukee, \n        WI; Nashville, TN; New Orleans, LA; Oklahoma City, OK; Omaha, \n        KS; Oxnard, CA; Providence, RI; Richmond, VA; Rochester, NY; \n        Sacramento, CA; Salt Lake City, UT; San Antonio, TX; San Juan, \n        PR; Syracuse, NY; Toledo, OH; Tucson, AZ; and Tulsa, OK.\n            (11) As a result of the funding reductions to the UASI \n        program for fiscal year 2011, many of these high-threat, high-\n        density urban areas must stretch their limited financial \n        resources to preserve the advancements made to their terrorism \n        prevention and disaster preparedness and response capabilities \n        with UASI funding. Some of these urban areas will not be able \n        to sustain the advancements made under the UASI program without \n        additional Federal assistance. Nationally, this capabilities' \n        erosion has significant homeland security implications.\n\nSEC. 3.
