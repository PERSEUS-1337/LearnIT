SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business \nHealth Insurance Relief Act of 2002''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Of the 39,000,000 uninsured Americans, 72 percent are \n        either full-time workers or dependents of those workers.\n            (2) Of the uninsured working population, 56 percent are \n        employed by small businesses.\n            (3) Of the working population, more than 74 percent are \n        covered by employer-sponsored health insurance.\n            (4) Small businesses are less likely to offer health \n        insurance to their employees, and employees of those small \n        businesses are less likely to participate in a health plan when \n        it is offered to them, when compared with larger businesses and \n        employees of larger businesses.\n            (5) Implementation of the policy set forth in this Act in \n        participating States will reduce the number of low-income \n        workers without health insurance in those States.\n            (6) Because individuals without health insurance do not \n        seek preventive care or early intervention, when those \n        individuals suffer from a serious medical condition, they are \n        often faced with large medical bills which they cannot pay.\n            (7) The costs of unpaid medical bills by individuals \n        without health insurance are often shifted to private and \n        Government payers.\n            (8) By increasing access to affordable health insurance for \n        low-income workers, this Act will contribute to the health and \n        well-being of those individuals, as well as reduce costs for \n        those who bear the burden of uncompensated care.\n\nSEC. 2.
