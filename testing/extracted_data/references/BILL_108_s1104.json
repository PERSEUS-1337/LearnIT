The period under this paragraph begins when the notice is \nmailed. If the person required to be notified is not notified within \nthe 48-hour period, the abortion may proceed even if the notice by mail \nis not received.\n    ``(3) The requirement that 48 hours actual notice be provided under \nthis subsection may be waived by an affidavit of--\n            ``(A) the member of the armed forces concerned, or another \n        parent of the minor, if the minor has no managing conservator \n        or guardian; or\n            ``(B) a court-appointed managing conservator or guardian.\n    ``(4) A physician may execute for inclusion in the minor's medical \nrecord an affidavit stating that, according to the best information and \nbelief of the physician, notice or constructive notice has been \nprovided as required by this subsection. Execution of an affidavit \nunder this paragraph creates a presumption that the requirements of \nthis subsection have been satisfied.\n    ``(5) A certification required by paragraph (1)(D) is confidential \nand privileged and is not subject to disclosure, discovery, subpoena, \nor other legal process. Personal or identifying information about the \nminor, including her name, address, or social security number, may not \nbe included in a certification under paragraph (1)(D). The physician \nmust keep the medical records on the minor in compliance with \nregulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.\n    ``(6) A physician who intentionally performs an abortion on a \npregnant unemancipated minor in violation of this subsection commits an \noffense punishable by a fine not to exceed $10,000.\n    ``(7) It is a defense to prosecution under this subsection that the \nminor falsely represented her age or identity to the physician to be at \nleast 18 years of age by displaying an apparently valid governmental \nrecord of identification such that a reasonable person under similar \ncircumstances would have relied on the representation. The defense does \nnot apply if the physician is shown to have had independent knowledge \nof the minor's actual age or identity or failed to use due diligence in \ndetermining the minor's age or identity.\n    ``(d) Judicial Approval.--(1) A pregnant unemancipated minor who is \na child of a member of the armed forces and who wishes to have an \nabortion using facilities of the Department of Defense without \nnotification to the member of the armed forces, another parent, her \nmanaging conservator, or her guardian may file an application for a \ncourt order authorizing the minor to consent to the performance of an \nabortion without notification to either of her parents or a managing \nconservator or guardian.\n    ``(2) Any application under this subsection may be filed in any \nappropriate district court of the United States. In the case of a minor \nwho elects not to travel to the United States in pursuit of an order \nauthorizing the abortion, the court may conduct the proceedings in the \ncase of such application by telephone.\n    ``(3) An application under this subsection shall be made under oath \nand include--\n            ``(A) a statement that the minor is pregnant;\n            ``(B) a statement that the minor is unmarried, is under 18 \n        years of age, and has not had her disabilities removed;\n            ``(C) a statement that the minor wishes to have an abortion \n        without the notification of either of her parents or a managing \n        conservator or guardian; and\n            ``(D) a statement as to whether the minor has retained an \n        attorney and, if she has retained an attorney, the name, \n        address, and telephone number of her attorney.\n    ``(4) The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor. If \nthe minor has not retained an attorney, the court shall appoint an \nattorney to represent the minor. If the guardian ad litem is an \nattorney, the court may appoint the guardian ad litem to serve as the \nminor's attorney.\n    ``(5) The court may appoint to serve as guardian ad litem for a \nminor--\n            ``(A) a psychiatrist or an individual licensed or certified \n        as a psychologist;\n            ``(B) a member of the clergy;\n            ``(C) a grandparent or an adult brother, sister, aunt, or \n        uncle of the minor; or\n            ``(D) another appropriate person selected by the court.\n    ``(6) The court shall determine within 48 hours after the \napplication is filed whether the minor is mature and sufficiently well-\ninformed to make the decision to have an abortion performed without \nnotification to either of her parents or a managing conservator or \nguardian, whether notification would not be in the best interest of the \nminor, or whether notification may lead to physical, sexual, or \nemotional abuse of the minor. If the court finds that the minor is \nmature and sufficiently well informed, that notification would not be \nin the minor's best interest, or that notification may lead to \nphysical, sexual, or emotional abuse of the minor, the court shall \nenter an order authorizing the minor to consent to the performance of \nthe abortion without notification to either of her parents or a \nmanaging conservator or guardian and shall execute the required forms.\n    ``(7) If the court fails to rule on the application within the \nperiod specified in paragraph (6), the application shall be deemed to \nbe granted and the physician may perform the abortion as if the court \nhad issued an order authorizing the minor to consent to the performance \nof the abortion without notification under subsection (c).\n    ``(8) If the court finds that the minor does not meet the \nrequirements of paragraph (6), the court may not authorize the minor to \nconsent to an abortion without the notification authorized under \nsubsection (c)(1).\n    ``(9) The court may not notify a parent, managing conservator, or \nguardian that the minor is pregnant or that the minor wants to have an \nabortion. The court proceedings shall be conducted in a manner that \nprotects the anonymity of the minor. The application and all other \ncourt documents pertaining to the proceedings are confidential and \nprivileged and are not subject to disclosure, discovery, subpoena, or \nother legal process. The minor may file the application using a \npseudonym or using only her initials.\n    ``(10) An order of the court issued under this subsection is \nconfidential and privileged and is not subject to disclosure, \ndiscovery, subpoena, or other legal process. The order may not be \nreleased to any person but the pregnant minor, the pregnant minor's \nguardian ad litem, the pregnant minor's attorney, another person \ndesignated to receive the order by the minor, or a governmental agency \nor attorney in a criminal or administrative action seeking to assert or \nprotect the interest of the minor.\n    ``(11) A filing fee is not required of and court costs may not be \nassessed against a minor filing an application under this subsection.\n    ``(e) Appeal.--(1) A minor whose application under subsection (d) \nis denied may appeal to the court of appeals of the United States \nhaving jurisdiction of the district court of the United States that \ndenied the application. If the court of appeals fails to rule on the \nappeal within 48 hours after the appeal is filed, the appeal shall be \ndeemed to be granted and the physician may perform the abortion using \nfacilities of the Department of Defense as if the court had issued an \norder authorizing the minor to consent to the performance of the \nabortion using facilities of the Department of Defense without \nnotification under subsection (c). Proceedings under this subsection \nshall be given precedence over other pending matters to the extent \nnecessary to assure that the court reaches a decision promptly.\n    ``(2) A ruling of the court of appeals under this subsection is \nconfidential and privileged and is not subject to disclosure, \ndiscovery, subpoena, or other legal process. The ruling may not be \nreleased to any person but the pregnant minor, the pregnant minor's \nguardian ad litem, the pregnant minor's attorney, another person \ndesignated to receive the ruling by the minor, or a governmental agency \nor attorney in a criminal or administrative action seeking to assert or \nprotect the interest of the minor.\n    ``(3) A filing fee is not required of and court costs may not be \nassessed against a minor filing an appeal under this subsection.\n    ``(f) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) The term `abortion' means the use of any means at a \n        medical facility of the Department of Defense to terminate the \n        pregnancy of a female known by an attending physician to be \n        pregnant, with the intention that the termination of the \n        pregnancy by those means will with reasonable likelihood cause \n        the death of the fetus.
