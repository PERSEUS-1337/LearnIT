FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly one-third of American women report being \n        physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some \n        point in their lives.\n            (2) Family violence costs the nation between $5,000,000,000 \n        and $10,000,000,000 each year in medical expenses, police and \n        court costs, shelters and foster care, sick leave, absenteeism, \n        and nonproductivity.\n            (3) The Nation's first specialized domestic violence court \n        was established in Chicago in the early 1980s to centralize the \n        prosecution of domestic violence offenders.\n            (4) There are presently more than 300 domestic violence \n        courts in at least 23 States nationwide.\n            (5) Specialized domestic violence courts in several \n        communities have resulted in cutting the processing time of \n        domestic violence, reducing a backlog of existing domestic \n        violence cases and raising the conviction rate.\n            (6) Specialized domestic violence courts allow judges, \n        prosecutors and defense attorneys to focus on the intricacies \n        of domestic violence cases, especially with regards to repeat \n        offenders.\n\nSEC. 3.
