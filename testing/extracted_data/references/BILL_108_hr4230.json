FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Acts of anti-Semitism in countries throughout the \n        world, including in some of the world's strongest democracies, \n        have increased significantly in frequency and scope over the \n        last several years.\n            (2) During the last three months of 2003 and the first \n        three months of 2004, there were numerous instances of anti-\n        Semitic violence around the world, including the following \n        incidents:\n                    (A) In Putrajaya, Malaysia, on October 16, 2003, \n                Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia told the 57 \n                national leaders assembled for the Organization of the \n                Islamic Conference that Jews ``rule the world by \n                proxy'', and called for a ``final victory'' by the \n                world's 1.3 billion Muslims, who, he said, ``cannot be \n                defeated by a few million Jews''.\n                    (B) In Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15, 2003, \n                simultaneous car bombs exploded outside two synagogues \n                filled with worshippers, killing 24 people and wounding \n                more than 250.\n                    (C) In Hobart, Australia, on January 5, 2004, \n                poison was used to ignite and burn anti-Semitic slogans \n                into the lawns of the Parliament House of the state of \n                Tasmania.\n                    (D) In St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 15, \n                2004, vandals desecrated approximately 50 gravestones \n                in a Jewish cemetery, painting the stones with \n                swastikas and anti-Semitic graffiti.\n                    (E) In Toronto, Canada, from March 19 to March 21, \n                2004, vandals attacked a Jewish school, a Jewish \n                cemetery, and area synagogues, painting swastikas and \n                anti-Semitic slogans on the walls of a synagogue and on \n                residential property in a nearby, predominantly Jewish, \n                neighborhood.\n                    (F) In Toulon, France, on March 23, 2004, a Jewish \n                synagogue and community center were set on fire.\n            (3) Anti-Semitism has at times taken the form of \n        vilification of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and \n        incitement against Israel.\n            (4) Anti-Semitism is also increasingly emanating from the \n        Arab and Muslim world on a sustained basis, including through \n        books distributed by government-owned publishing houses in \n        Egypt and other Arab countries.\n            (5) In November 2002, state-run television in Egypt \n        broadcast the anti-Semitic series entitled ``Horseman Without a \n        Horse'', which is based upon the fictitious conspiracy theory \n        known as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The Protocols \n        have been used throughout the last century by despots such as \n        Adolf Hitler to justify violence against Jews.\n            (6) In November 2003, Arab television featured an anti-\n        Semitic series entitled ``Ash-Shatat'' (``The Diaspora''), \n        which depicts Jewish people conspiring to gain control of the \n        world.\n            (7) The sharp rise in anti-Semitic violence has caused \n        international organizations such as the Organization for \n        Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elevate and bring \n        renewed focus to this issue, including the convening by the \n        OSCE in June 2003 of a conference in Vienna dedicated solely to \n        the issue of anti-Semitism.\n            (8) On April 28-29, 2004, in Berlin, Germany, the OSCE will \n        again convene a conference dedicated to addressing the problem \n        of anti-Semitism, with the United States delegation to be led \n        by former Mayor of New York City Ed Koch.\n            (9) The United States has vigorously supported efforts to \n        address anti-Semitism through bilateral relationships and \n        interaction with international organizations such as the OSCE, \n        the European Union, and the United Nations.\n            (10) Congress has consistently supported efforts to address \n        the rise in anti-Semitic violence. During the 107th Congress, \n        both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed \n        resolutions expressing strong concern about the sharp \n        escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe and calling on \n        the Department of State to thoroughly document the phenomenon.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States should continue to vigorously support \n        efforts to combat anti-Semitism worldwide through bilateral \n        relationships and interaction with international organizations \n        such as the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe \n        (OSCE);\n            (2) the United States delegation to the OSCE conference in \n        Berlin should advocate for the appointment of a High \n        Commissioner on anti-Semitism;\n            (3) the President should direct the United States \n        Ambassador to the United Nations to introduce in the most \n        appropriate forum in the United Nations a measure condemning \n        anti-Semitism;\n            (4) the Secretary of State should establish a permanent \n        office in the Department of State to monitor and combat anti-\n        Semitism; and\n            (5) the Department of State should thoroughly document acts \n        of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement that occur around \n        the world.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE TO MONITOR AND COMBAT \n              ANTI-SEMITISM.\n\n    The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is amended by \nadding after section 58 (22 U.S.C. 2730) the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 59.
