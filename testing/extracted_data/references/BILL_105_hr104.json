(a) Disposal of Property and Interests.--(1) The \nSecretary of the Interior, after determining it to be in the public \ninterest and after publication of notice in the Federal Register and 30 \ndays for public comment--\n            ``(A) may dispose of lands, or interests therein (but not \n        the mineral estate), within the National Battlefields, National \n        Historical Parks, and other National Park System units which \n        preserve American history; and\n            ``(B) may accept as consideration for the disposal other \n        lands, interests in lands, cash payment, or any combination \n        thereof which is equal in value to the lands or interests being \n        disposed of.\n    ``(2) To protect the aesthetic, recreational, cultural, or historic \nvalues of the unit of the National Park System, the Secretary shall \ninclude in such disposals any terms, covenants, conditions, or \nreservations deemed necessary to ensure preservation of the public \ninterest and uses consistent with the purposes for which the area was \ndesignated and to attempt to stimulate the land use patterns existing \nat the relevant historic period.\n    ``(3) In disposing of lands or interests under this subsection, the \nSecretary shall, to the extent practicable, provide the person or \npersons, or their heirs, as determined from the deed and land records, \nfrom whom the land or interest was acquired by the United States an \nopportunity to reacquire the land or interest. The Secretary shall \npublish a notice in an appropriate regional or local newspaper in an \nattempt to locate such persons.\n    ``(4) Each disposal in excess of $150,000 shall be reported to the \nCommittee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate at least 30 \ndays prior to consummation of the disposal.\n    ``(5) The person or persons acquiring lands or interests therein \nunder this subsection shall bear all reasonable costs of survey and \nappraisal incidental to such conveyance, as determined by the \nSecretary.\n    ``(b) Lease.--(1) The Secretary of the Interior, after determining \nit to be in the public interest and after publication of notice in the \nFederal Register and 30 days for public comment, may lease lands or \nextend existing leases within the National Battlefields, National \nHistorical Parks, and other National Park System units which preserve \nAmerican history for private uses that promote, and are consistent \nwith, the purposes for which the area was designated and that attempt \nto stimulate the land use patterns existing at the relevant historic \nperiod.\n    ``(2) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall provide the \nperson or persons, or their heirs, as determined from the deed and land \nrecords, from whom the land or interest was acquired by the United \nStates an opportunity to lease the land for acceptable uses. The \nSecretary shall publish a notice in an appropriate regional or local \nnewspaper in an attempt to locate such persons.\n    ``(3) Such leases may be negotiated noncompetitively.
