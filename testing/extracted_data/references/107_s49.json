    "title": "A bill to amend the wetlands regulatory program under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide credit for the low wetlands loss rate in Alaska and recognize the significant extent of wetlands conservation in Alaska, to protect Alaskan property owners, and to ease the burden on overly regulated Alaskan cities, boroughs, municipalities, and villages.",
    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Wetlands Conservation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) according to the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service, approximately 170,200,000 acres of wetlands existed in \n        Alaska in the 1780s and approximately 170,000,000 acres of \n        wetlands exist now, representing a loss of less than one-tenth \n        of 1 percent through human and natural processes;\n            (2) according to the United States Fish and Wildlife \n        Service more than 221,000,000 acres of wetlands existed at the \n        time of Colonial America in the area that is now the contiguous \n        United States and that 117,000,000 of those acres, roughly 53 \n        percent, have been filled, drained, or otherwise removed from \n        wetland status;\n            (3) Alaska contains more wetlands than all of the other \n        States combined;\n            (4) 88 percent of Alaska's wetlands are publicly owned, \n        while only 26 percent of the wetlands in the 48 contiguous \n        States are publicly owned;\n            (5) approximately 98 percent of all Alaskan communities, \n        including 200 of the 209 remote villages in Alaska, are located \n        in or adjacent to wetlands;\n            (6) approximately 62 percent of all federally designated \n        wilderness lands, 70 percent of all Federal park lands, and 90 \n        percent of all Federal refuge lands are located in Alaska, thus \n        providing protection against use or degradation to \n        approximately 60,000,000 acres of wetlands in Alaska;\n            (7) 104,000,000 acres of land were granted to the State of \n        Alaska at statehood for purposes of economic development;\n            (8) approximately 43,000,000 acres of land were granted to \n        Alaska Natives through regional and village corporations and \n        Native allotments for their use and between 45 percent and 100 \n        percent of each Native corporation's land is categorized as \n        wetlands;\n            (9) development of basic community infrastructure in \n        Alaska, where approximately 75 percent of the nonmountainous \n        areas are wetlands, is often delayed and sometimes prevented by \n        the existing wetlands regulatory program, with minimal \n        identifiable environmental benefit;\n            (10) the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act formerly regulated \n        disposition of dredge spoils in navigable waters, which did not \n        include wetlands, to keep navigable waters free of impairments;\n            (11) the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act, more \n        commonly known as the Clean Water Act, formed the basis for a \n        broad expansion of Federal jurisdiction over wetlands by \n        modifying the definition of ``navigable waters'' to include all \n        ``waters of the United States'';\n            (12) in 1975, a United States district court ordered the \n        Army Corps of Engineers to publish revised regulations \n        concerning the program to implement section 404 of the Clean \n        Water Act, which expanded the scope of the program to include \n        the discharge of dredged and fill material into wetlands;\n            (13) the wetlands regulatory program was expanded yet again \n        by regulatory action to include isolated wetlands (wetlands \n        that are not adjacent to navigable waters), and such an \n        expansion formed the basis for burdensome intrusions on the \n        property rights of Alaskans, Alaskan Native Corporations, and \nthe State of Alaska;\n            (14) expansion of the wetlands regulatory program in this \n        manner is beyond what the Congress intended when it passed the \n        Clean Water Act and has placed unnecessary economic and \n        administrative burdens on private property owners, small \n        businesses, city governments, State governments, farmers, \n        ranchers, and others, while providing negligible environmental \n        benefits;\n            (15) for Alaska, a State with substantial conserved \n        wetlands and less than 1 percent private, noncorporate land \n        ownership, the burdens of the current wetlands regulatory \n        program unnecessarily inhibit reasonable community growth and \n        environmentally benign resource development;\n            (16) Alaska villages, municipalities, boroughs, city \n        governments, and Native organizations are increasingly \n        frustrated with the constraints of the wetlands regulatory \n        program because it interferes with the location of community \n        centers, airports, sanitation systems, roads, schools, \n        industrial areas, and other critical community infrastructure;\n            (17) policies intended to achieve ``no net loss'' of \n        wetlands reflect a response to the 53 percent loss of the \n        wetlands base in the 48 contiguous States, and do not take into \n        account the large percentage of conserved wetlands in Alaska; \n        and\n            (18) individual landowners in Alaska have lost up to 97 \n        percent of their property value and Alaskan communities have \n        lost a significant portion of their tax base due to wetlands \n        regulations.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT.\n\n    (a) National Policy.--Section 101(a) of the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (33 U.S.C. 1251(a)) is amended by--\n            (1) striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (6);\n            (2) striking the period at the end of paragraph (7) and \n        inserting in lieu thereof a semicolon;
