FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States Government is increasingly relying on \n        armed private security contractors to perform mission-critical \n        and emergency essential functions that historically have been \n        performed by United States military or Government personnel.\n            (2) In August 2008, the Congressional Budget Office \n        estimated that there were approximately 190,000 contractors \n        operating in Iraq, and between 25,000 and 30,000 of these were \n        private security contractors.\n            (3) As of September 2009, the Department of Defense had \n        approximately 218,000 contract employees operating in Iraq and \n        Afghanistan, as compared to 195,000 members of the United \n        States Armed Forces operating in these two theaters of war.\n            (4) As of June 2009, the Department of Defense had deployed \n        over 13,000 armed private security contractors in Iraq and over \n        5,000 in Afghanistan, an increase from 10,743 and 4,111, \n        respectively, in March 2009.\n            (5) As of February 28, 2009, the Department of State used \n        3,321 armed private security contractors in Iraq and 689 in \n        Afghanistan.\n            (6) In September 2009, photos surfaced showing individuals \n        hired by ArmorGroup North America, which was awarded a contract \n        by the Department of State to provide security at the United \n        States embassy in Kabul, engaging in lewd and drunken sexual \n        conduct and hazing.\n            (7) There is evidence that ArmorGroup North America, and \n        its parent company Wackenhut Services, had previously ignored \n        repeated reports of misconduct by its employees in Kabul.\n            (8) The Department of State issued numerous formal notices \n        to ArmorGroup North America regarding performance deficiencies, \n        and in March 2009 wrote to the company expressing ``grave \n        concern'' about the short-staffing of guard posts.\n            (9) In May 2009, four men employed as military trainers for \n        Paravant LLC, a Blackwater affiliate, fired on a civilian \n        vehicle in Kabul, killing one Afghan and wounding two others.\n            (10) On September 16, 2007, individuals hired by the \n        company then known as Blackwater USA opened fire on Baghdad's \n        Nisour Square, killing 17 Iraqis and wounding at least 20 \n        others.\n            (11) A Federal judge dismissed criminal charges against the \n        Blackwater contractors involved in the Nisour Square shooting \n        after finding that Federal prosecutors misused evidence, a \n        decision that has been appealed by the Department of Justice.\n            (12) On October 18, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n        stated that the work of many contractors in Iraq is ``at cross-\n        purposes to our larger mission in Iraq,'' and that ``right now \n        those missions are in conflict''.\n            (13) On Christmas Eve 2006, Blackwater contractor Andrew \n        Moonen, while drunk, shot and killed a guard to Iraqi Vice \n        President Adil Abd-al-Mahdi in the Green Zone, and though Mr. \n        Moonen lost his job with Blackwater as a result of this \n        incident, he was promptly hired by Combat Support Associates, \n        another Department of Defense contractor, and sent to work in \n        Kuwait.\n            (14) In the wake of the 2004 killing of four Blackwater \n        contractors in Fallujah, the families of the men killed filed a \n        civil suit against the company, alleging that Blackwater failed \n        to properly equip and man its armored vehicles.\n            (15) Xe Services, LLC, the company formerly known as \n        Blackwater, has also faced allegations of weapons smuggling and \n        improperly licensing firearms.\n            (16) In 2007, the Committee on Oversight and Government \n        Reform of the House of Representatives investigated \n        Blackwater's employment practices and found that the company's \n        classification of its security guards may have allowed the firm \n        to avoid paying Social Security, Medicare, and Federal income \n        and employment taxes.\n            (17) In response to a request from the Committee on \n        Oversight and Government Reform of the House of \n        Representatives, the Inspector General of the Small Business \n        Administration investigated Blackwater in 2008 and found that \n        the company may have misrepresented its small business status, \n        enabling it to qualify for $110,000,000 in government contracts \n        set aside specifically for small businesses.\n            (18) Signed affidavits have been filed in a civil lawsuit \n        against Blackwater that company founder Erik Prince views \n        himself ``as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating \n        Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe'', that he \n        knowingly deployed ``demonstrably unfit men'' to Iraq, and that \n        he used illegal ammunition, including a bullet designed to \n        explode after entering the human body, among other charges.\n            (19) In November 2007, a contractor employed by DynCorp \n        International, LLC, reportedly shot and killed an unarmed taxi \n        driver who, according to witnesses, posed no threat to the \n        DynCorp convoy.\n            (20) A January 2007 report by the Special Inspector General \n        for Iraq Reconstruction stated that DynCorp billed the United \n        States for millions of dollars of work that was never \n        authorized.\n            (21) In October 2007, an audit report issued by the Special \n        Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction stated that the \n        Department of State ``does not know specifically what it \n        received for most of the $1,200,000,000 in expenditures under \n        its DynCorp Contract for the Iraqi Police Training Program''.\n            (22) Congress does not have complete access to information \n        about all security contracts, the number of armed private \n        security contractors working in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other \n        combat zones, the number of contractors who have died, and any \n        disciplinary actions taken against contract personnel or \n        companies.\n\nSEC. 3.
