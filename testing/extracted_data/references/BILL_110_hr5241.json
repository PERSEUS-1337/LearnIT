RESPONSE TO SEVERE INFESTATIONS OF BARK BEETLES AND OTHER \n              INSECTS ON FEDERAL LAND IN COLORADO.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fire and bark beetles and other insects that feed on \n        trees are natural parts of Colorado's forest ecology that have \n        some beneficial effects and help shape the forests by thinning \n        dense tree stands and promoting cyclical re-growth.\n            (2) However, in various parts of Colorado, large-scale \n        infestations of bark beetles and other insects, in combination \n        with other factors, have increased the likelihood of unusually \n        severe wildfires that pose a threat to lives and property in \n        nearby communities and to municipal water supplies and other \n        infrastructure.\n            (3) The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law \n        108-148; 16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) was enacted to address the \n        need to reduce the volume of fuel that can feed the most severe \n        wildfires that threaten communities.\n            (4) The modification of some provisions of the Healthy \n        Forests Restoration Act of 2003 will help to further expedite \n        action to reduce the risks of severe wildfires to Colorado \n        communities, water supplies, and infrastructure in or near \n        forested areas most severely affected by infestations of bark \n        beetles and other insects.\n    (b) Insect-Emergency Area Defined.--Section 101 of the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (12) through (16) as \n        paragraphs (13) through (17), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (11) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(12) Insect-emergency area.--The term `insect-emergency \n        area' means an area of Federal land in Colorado designated by \n        the Secretary pursuant to section 107.''.\n    (c) Alternative Analysis Process.--Section 104(d)(2) of the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6514(d)(2)) is amended by \ninserting after ``at-risk community'' the following: ``or on any other \nlands identified for such a project in a community wildfire protection \nplan for an at-risk community in or adjacent to an insect-emergency \narea''.\n    (d) Response to Insect Emergencies.--Title I of the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act of 2003 is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating sections 107 and 108 as sections 108 \n        and 109, respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 106 (16 U.S.C. 6516) the \n        following new section:\n\n``SEC. 107. COLORADO INSECT-EMERGENCY AREAS.\n\n    ``(a) Designation of Insect-Emergency Areas.--\n            ``(1) Designation authority.--The Secretary may designate \n        an area of Federal land in Colorado as an insect-emergency area \n        if--\n                    ``(A) the Secretary determines that the area is \n                subject to a widespread infestation of bark beetles or \n                other insects;\n                    ``(B) the Secretary determines that the area is \n                characterized by insect-induced tree mortality that \n                has, or within one year of the determination will have, \n                produced a condition such that an immediate reduction \n                in hazardous fuels is required in order to reduce the \n                risks to human life and property or to a municipal \n                water supply from a severe wildfire; and\n                    ``(C) the area is identified for hazardous fuel \n                reduction treatment in a community wildfire protection \n                plan.\n            ``(2) Criteria.--The determinations required by \n        subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) shall be made on the \n        basis of the best information available, including observation \n        of relevant insect infestations.\n            ``(3) Limitation on delegation.--In the case of National \n        Forest System lands, the authority to designate an insect-\n        emergency area may be delegated only to a Regional Forester.\n    ``(b) Initiation of Designation Process.--\n            ``(1) Initiation.--The designation of an insect-emergency \n        area may be made on the initiative of the Secretary or in \n        response to a request by any agency of the State of Colorado or \n        a political subdivision thereof.\n            ``(2) Deadline.--If a request for designation is initiated \n        by the State or a political subdivision thereof, the Secretary \n        shall issue a decision regarding the request not later than 90 \n        days after receipt of the request.\n    ``(c) Consultation and Public Comment.--Before making the \ndeterminations required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) \nof subsection (a) with respect to an area, the Secretary shall--\n            ``(1) consult with any Federal agency responsible for \n        management of lands within a relevant community wildfire \n        protection plan and appropriate State and local officials; and\n            ``(2) provide public notice and seek public comments on the \n        possible determinations.\n    ``(d) Review of Designation.--Any administrative or judicial review \nof the decision of the Secretary to designate an insect-emergency area \nshall be subject to regulations issued pursuant to section 105 and to \nthe provisions of section 106.\n    ``(e) Authorized Hazardous Fuel Reduction Projects in Designated \nAreas.--An authorized hazardous fuel reduction project involving only \nlands within an insect-emergency area may be categorically excluded \nfrom documentation in an environmental impact statement and \nenvironmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act of \n1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) if--\n            ``(1) the project involves only lands that are identified \n        for hazardous-fuel reduction treatment in a community wildfire \n        protection plan; and\n            ``(2) the decision to categorically exclude the project is \n        made in accordance with applicable extraordinary circumstances \n        procedures established pursuant to section 1508.4 of title 40, \n        Code of Federal Regulations.''."
