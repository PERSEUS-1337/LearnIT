    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n        citizenship and regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n        offenders into free society. The right to vote may not be \n        abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on \n        account of race, color, gender, or previous condition of \n        servitude. Basic constitutional principles of fairness and \n        equal protection require an equal opportunity for United States \n        citizens to vote in Federal elections.\n            (2) Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal \n        elections, an authority that has repeatedly been upheld by the \n        Supreme Court.\n            (3) Although State laws determine the qualifications for \n        voting in Federal elections, Congress must ensure that those \n        laws are in accordance with the Constitution. Currently, those \n        laws vary throughout the Nation, resulting in discrepancies \n        regarding which citizens may vote in Federal elections.\n            (4) An estimated 3,900,000 individuals in the United \n        States, or 1 in 50 adults, currently cannot vote as a result of \n        a felony conviction. Women represent about 500,000 of those \n        3,900,000.\n            (5) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n        ethnic minorities.\n            (6) Fourteen States disenfranchise ex-offenders who have \n        fully served their sentences, regardless of the nature or \n        seriousness of the offense.\n            (7) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders who \n        have fully served their sentences, the right to vote can be \n        regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often \n        illusory.\n            (8) In 8 States, a pardon or order from the Governor is \n        required for an ex-offender to regain the right to vote. In 2 \n        States, ex-offenders must obtain action by the parole or pardon \n        board to regain that right.\n            (9) Offenders convicted of a Federal offense often have \n        additional barriers to regaining voting rights. In at least 16 \n        States, Federal ex-offenders cannot use the State procedure for \n        restoring their voting rights. The only method provided by \n        Federal law for restoring voting rights to ex-offenders is a \n        Presidential pardon.\n            (10) Few persons who seek to have their right to vote \n        restored have the financial and political resources needed to \n        succeed.\n            (11) Thirteen percent of the African-American adult male \n        population, or 1,400,000 African-American men, are \n        disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, 3 in 10 \n        African-American men in the next generation will be \n        disenfranchised at some point during their lifetimes. Hispanic \n        citizens are also disproportionately disenfranchised, since \n        those citizens are disproportionately represented in the \n        criminal justice system.\n            (12) The discrepancies described in this subsection should \n        be addressed by Congress, in the name of fundamental fairness \n        and equal protection.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to restore fairness in the \nFederal election process by ensuring that ex-offenders who have fully \nserved their sentences are not denied the right to vote.\n\nSEC. 3.
