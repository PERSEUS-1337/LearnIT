FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) participation in athletic pursuits play an important \n        role in teaching young Americans how to work on teams, handle \n        challenges and overcome obstacles;\n            (2) participation in athletic pursuits play an important \n        role in keeping the minds and bodies of young Americans healthy \n        and physically fit;\n            (3) there is increasing concern among citizens, educators, \n        and public officials regarding the athletic opportunities for \n        young men and women at institutions of higher education;\n            (4) a recent study by the National Collegiate Athletic \n        Association found that in Division I-A institutions, only 20 \n        percent of the average athletic department operations budget of \n        $1,310,000 is spent on women's athletics; 15 percent of the \n        average recruiting budget of $318,402 is spent on recruiting \n        female athletes; the average scholarship expenses for men is \n        $1,300,000 and $505.246 for women; and an average of 143 grants \n        are awarded to male athletes and 59 to women athletes;\n            (5) female college athletes receive less than 18 percent of \n        the athletics recruiting dollar and less than 24 percent of the \n        athletics operating dollar;\n            (6) male college athletes receive approximately \n        $179,000,000 more per year in athletic scholarship grants than \n        female college athletes;\n            (7) prospective students and prospective student athletes \n        should be aware of the commitments of an institution to \n        providing equitable athletic opportunities for its men and \n        women students; and\n            (8) knowledge of an institution's expenditures for women's \n        and men's athletic programs would help prospective students and \n        prospective student athletes make informed judgments about the \n        commitments of a given institution of higher education to \n        providing equitable athletic benefits to its men and women \n        students.\n\nSEC. 3.
