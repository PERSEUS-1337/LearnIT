FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) adult day care offers services, including medical care, \n        rehabilitation therapies, dignified assistance with activities \n        of daily living, social interaction, and stimulating \n        activities, to seniors who are frail, physically challenged, or \n        cognitively impaired;\n            (2) access to adult day care services provides seniors and \n        their familial caregivers support that is critical to keeping \n        the senior in the family home;\n            (3) more than 22,000,000 families in the United States \n        serve as caregivers for aging or ailing seniors, nearly 1 in 4 \n        American families, providing close to 80 percent of the care to \n        individuals requiring long-term care;\n            (4) nearly 75 percent of those actively providing such care \n        are women who also maintain other responsibilities, such as \n        working outside of the home and raising young children;\n            (5) the average loss of income to these caregivers has been \n        shown to be $659,130 in wages, pension, and Social Security \n        benefits;\n            (6) the loss in productivity in United States businesses \n        ranges from $11,000,000,000 to $29,000,000,000 annually;\n            (7) the services offered in adult day care facilities \n        provide continuity of care and an important sense of community \n        for both the senior and the caregiver;\n            (8) there are adult day care centers in every State in the \n        United States and the District of Columbia;\n            (9) these centers generally offer transportation, meals, \n        personal care, and counseling in addition to the medical \n        services and socialization benefits offered; and\n            (10) with the need for quality options in how to best care \n        for our senior population about to dramatically increase with \n        the aging of the baby boomer generation, the time to address \n        these issues is now.\n\nSEC. 3.
