    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Convict Service Labor Prohibition \nAct of 1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States exists in a changed international \n        economic environment;\n            (2) one part of this changed market place is an increase in \n        international trade and an advocacy by many policy makers and \n        many in the private sector of so-called free trade, based on \n        the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, a \n        major manifestation of which is the negotiation of a North \n        American Free Trade Agreement;\n            (3) although expanded trade may provide increased economic \n        opportunity for some segments of the United States society, it \n        may also cause the loss of thousands of United States jobs. As \n        United States companies move their operations out of the United \n        States to take advantage of labor that costs as little as one-\n        tenth of the wages of United States workers, the well-being of \n        working people across the United States is threatened;\n            (4) another part of the changed United States market place \n        is the greatly increased importance of the service sector and \n        of service-based jobs in the United States;\n            (5) the United States Customs Service ruled on July 15, \n        1992, in a case involving the sorting of coupons by Mexican \n        prisoners in a maquiladora operation that existing Federal law \n        does not prohibit the importation of goods upon which services \n        were performed by forced, convict or prison labor;\n            (6) the Customs Service ruling of July 15, 1992, allows the \n        performance of a wide range of service activities, including \n        laundry cleaning, auto repair, appliance repair, and many \n        others, by prisoners in Mexico and other countries, possibly \n        even including some assembly operations that make up so much of \n        the so-called off-shore enterprises;\n            (7) the Customs Service ruling of July 15, 1992, will cost \n        thousands of additional United States jobs as international \n        trade continues to expand and U.S. companies continue to take \n        advantage of low-waged labor, including imprisoned workers, \n        against which United States workers cannot compete; and\n            (8) existing Federal trade law is intended to protect \n        United States workers from the unfair foreign competition of \n        work done in other countries by forced, convict or prison \n        labor; however, in light of the Customs Service ruling of July \n        15, 1992, existing Federal law is clearly inadequate to protect \n        United States workers.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to amend and enhance \nFederal law protections for United States jobs by prohibiting the \nimportation into the United States from any other country goods on \nwhich services were performed by convicts or prisoners, and by \nestablishing penalties for violation of this Act.\n\nSEC. 3. TRANSPORTING OR IMPORTING GOODS MADE BY OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY \n              CONVICTS OR PRISONERS.\n\n    Section 1761 of title 18, United States Code, is amended in \nsubsection (a) by inserting after ``mined,'' the following: ``or on \nwhich services were performed,''.\n\nSEC. 4. FAILURE TO MARK PACKAGES MADE BY AND IDENTIFY SERVICES PROVIDED \n              BY CONVICTS OR PRISONERS.\n\n    Section 1762(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \ninserting after ``mined,'' the following: ``or on which services were \nperformed,''.\n\nSEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT OF PROHIBITION AGAINST IMPORTATION OF CONVICT-MADE \n              GOODS.\n\n    Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``All goods'' and inserting ``(a) In \n        General--All goods'';\n            (2) in subsection (a) (as designated by paragraph (a) of \n        this subsection)--\n                    (A) by inserting after ``manufactured'' the \n                following: ``, or on which services are performed,''; \n                and\n                    (B) by striking the second sentence;\n            (3) by striking ```Forced Labor,'''; and\n            (4) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) Penalties.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Any person who--\n                    ``(A) enters or imports, or attempts to enter or \n                import, goods, wares, articles, or merchandise into the \n                customs territory of the United States in violation of \n                subsection (a); and\n                    ``(B) knew or should have known that such entry or \n                importation, or attempted entry or importation, was in \n                violation of such subsection, shall be liable to pay to \n                the United States a civil penalty.\n            ``(2) Amount of penalty.--Any civil penalty imposed under \n        paragraph (1) shall be in an amount not to exceed--\n                    ``(A) $10,000 for one violation;\n                    ``(B) $100,000 in the case of a person previously \n                subject to a penalty for one violation under this \n                section; or\n                    ``(C) $1,000,000 in the case of a person previously \n                subject to penalties for more than one violation under \n                this section.\n            ``(3) Regulations required.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n        shall by regulation, within one year of the date of enactment \n        of this Act, prescribe procedures for imposing penalties under \n        this section, including, but not limited to, prepenalty \n        notice.''."
