FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) technology has had a tremendous impact on the manner in \n        which banks and other financial institutions conduct their \n        businesses, and has affected virtually all aspects of their \n        operations;\n            (2) such changes relate not only to the creation, \n        retention, and delivery of documents and other information, but \n        also to the receipt and payment of funds, the purchase and sale \n        of goods and services, and other aspects of the ability of a \n        financial institution to communicate with and service its \n        customer base;\n            (3) financial and other transactions will increasingly be \n        carried over open electronic networks such as the Internet, and \n        through other methods where the identity of the parties \n        participating in such transactions may not be easily verifiable \n        and where there is a need to assure that information \n        transmitted among the parties has not been altered;\n            (4) banks, by virtue of their role in the Nation's payment \n        system, their relationships with their customers, and through \n        the prudent use of technology, are well placed to facilitate \n        financial transactions over such electronic media as the \n        Internet;\n            (5) the parties to such financial and other transactions \n        may previously have entered into agreements or system rules \n        pursuant to which the transactions subsequently take place \n        (known as ``closed system transactions'');\n            (6) if the formation of system rules and agreements are \n        otherwise valid and effective under applicable law, such as \n        under State contract law, the parties should be able to use \n        electronic authentication under the terms and conditions of \n        those system rules and agreements, to help ensure that the \n        development of electronic authentication will be appropriately \n        market driven;\n            (7) premature, conflicting, or unwise regulation can \n        inadvertently discourage the use of technology in financial \n        transactions, can inhibit the development of electronic \n        commerce, and can reduce security in financial transactions;\n            (8) it is appropriate for Congress to enable a framework \n        under which banks and their subsidiaries and affiliates can \n        participate in electronic commerce and electronic banking \n        without undue premature or unnecessary regulation, but under \n        which appropriate oversight is provided; and\n            (9) in particular, it is appropriate for the Board of \n        Governors of the Federal Reserve System to consult with the \n        other Federal and State banking regulators and report to the \n        Congress regarding the use of electronic authentication \n        techniques, in order to facilitate electronic commerce and \n        electronic banking, and to study the need for and wisdom of \n        consumer protection in the context of the developing area of \n        electronic commerce.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to facilitate the participation by financial \n        institutions in the burgeoning area of electronic commerce and \n        electronic banking;\n            (2) to ensure that the interests of consumers are \n        adequately protected; and\n            (3) to avoid the effects of premature or conflicting \n        regulation that could inadvertently impede the development of \n        electronic banking and commerce or imperil the security of \n        electronic banking and commerce.\n\nSEC. 3.
