PROGRAMS OF HEALTH PROMOTION OR DISEASE PREVENTION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Nothing in the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Public Health \nService Act shall be applied, administered, or interpreted to prevent \nany provider or issuer of health insurance (including any employer) \nfrom establishing premium discounts or rebates, or modifying copayments \nor deductibles, in the case of individuals who adhere to, or \nparticipate in, a program of health promotion or disease prevention \nwhich meets the requirements of subsection (b).\n    (b) Programs of Health Promotion or Disease Prevention to Which \nSection Applies.--\n            (1) General provisions.--\n                    (A) General rule.--For purposes of subsection (a), \n                a program of health promotion or disease prevention \n                (referred to in this subsection as a ``wellness \n                program'') shall be a program that is designed to \n                promote health or prevent disease that meets the \n                applicable requirements of this subsection.\n                    (B) No conditions based on health status factor.--\n                If none of the conditions for obtaining a premium \n                discount or rebate or other reward for participation in \n                a wellness program is based on an individual satisfying \n                a standard that is related to a health status factor, \n                such wellness program shall not violate this section if \n                participation in the program is made available to all \n                similarly situated individuals and the requirements of \n                paragraph (2) are complied with.\n                    (C) Conditions based on health status factor.--If \n                any of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount \n                or rebate or other reward for participation in a \n                wellness program is based on an individual satisfying a \n                standard that is related to a health status factor, \n                such wellness program shall not violate this section if \n                the requirements of paragraph (3) are complied with.\n            (2) Wellness programs not subject to requirements.--If none \n        of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount or rebate or \n        other reward under a wellness program as described in paragraph \n        (1)(B) are based on an individual satisfying a standard that is \n        related to a health status factor (or if such a wellness \n        program does not provide such a reward), the wellness program \n        shall not violate this section if participation in the program \n        is made available to all similarly situated individuals. The \n        following programs shall not have to comply with the \n        requirements of paragraph (3) if participation in the program \n        is made available to all similarly situated individuals:\n                    (A) A program that reimburses all or part of the \n                cost for memberships in a fitness center.\n                    (B) A diagnostic testing program that provides a \n                reward for participation and does not base any part of \n                the reward on outcomes.\n                    (C) A program that encourages preventive care \n                related to a health condition through the waiver of the \n                copayment or deductible requirement under an individual \n                or group health plan for the costs of certain items or \n                services related to a health condition (such as \n                prenatal care or well-baby visits).\n                    (D) A program that reimburses individuals for the \n                costs of smoking cessation programs without regard to \n                whether the individual quits smoking.\n                    (E) A program that provides a reward to individuals \n                for attending a periodic health education seminar.\n            (3) Wellness programs subject to requirements.--If any of \n        the conditions for obtaining a premium discount, rebate, or \n        reward under a wellness program as described in paragraph \n        (1)(C) is based on an individual satisfying a standard that is \n        related to a health status factor, the wellness program shall \n        not violate this section if the following requirements are \n        complied with:\n                    (A) The reward for the wellness program, together \n                with the reward for other wellness programs with \n                respect to the plan that requires satisfaction of a \n                standard related to a health status factor, shall not \n                exceed 30 percent of the cost of employee-only coverage \n                under the plan. If, in addition to employees or \n                individuals, any class of dependents (such as spouses \n                or spouses and dependent children) may participate \n                fully in the wellness program, such reward shall not \n                exceed 30 percent of the cost of the coverage in which \n                an employee or individual and any dependents are \n                enrolled. For purposes of this paragraph, the cost of \n                coverage shall be determined based on the total amount \n                of employer and employee contributions for the benefit \n                package under which the employee is (or the employee \n                and any dependents are) receiving coverage. A reward \n                may be in the form of a discount or rebate of a premium \n                or contribution a waiver of all or part of a cost-\n                sharing mechanism (such as deductibles, copayments, or \n                coinsurance), the absence of a surcharge, or the value \n                of a benefit that would otherwise not be provided under \n                the plan. The Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human \n                Services, and the Treasury may increase the reward \n                available under this subparagraph to up to 50 percent \n                of the cost of coverage if the Secretaries determine \n                that such an increase is appropriate.\n                    (B) The wellness program shall be reasonably \n                designed to promote health or prevent disease. A \n                program complies with the preceding sentence if the \n                program has a reasonable chance of improving the health \n                of, or preventing disease in, participating individuals \n                and it is not overly burdensome, is not a subterfuge \n                for discriminating based on a health status factor, and \n                is not highly suspect in the method chosen to promote \n                health or prevent disease. The plan or issuer shall \n                evaluate the program's reasonableness at least once per \n                year.\n                    (C) The plan shall give individuals eligible for \n                the program the opportunity to qualify for the reward \n                under the program at least once each year.\n                    (D) The full reward under the wellness program \n                shall be made available to all similarly situated \n                individuals. For such purpose, among other things:\n                            (i) The reward is not available to all \n                        similarly situated individuals for a period \n                        unless the wellness program allows--\n                                    (I) for a reasonable alternative \n                                standard (or waiver of the otherwise \n                                applicable standard) for obtaining the \n                                reward for any individual for whom, for \n                                that period, it is unreasonably \n                                difficult due to a medical condition to \n                                satisfy the otherwise applicable \n                                standard; and\n                                    (II) for a reasonable alternative \n                                standard (or waiver of the otherwise \n                                applicable standard) for obtaining the \n                                reward for any individual for whom, for \n                                that period, it is medically \n                                inadvisable to attempt to satisfy the \n                                otherwise applicable standard.\n                            (ii) If reasonable under the circumstances, \n                        the plan or issuer may seek verification, such \n                        as a statement from an individual's physician, \n                        that a health status factor makes it \n                        unreasonably difficult or medically inadvisable \n                        for the individual to satisfy or attempt to \n                        satisfy the otherwise applicable standard.\n                    (E) The plan or issuer involved shall disclose in \n                all plan materials describing the terms of the wellness \n                program the availability of a reasonable alternative \n                standard (or the possibility of waiver of the otherwise \n                applicable standard) required under subparagraph (D). \n                If plan materials disclose that such a program is \n                available, without describing its terms, the disclosure \n                under this subparagraph shall not be required.\n    (c) Existing Programs.--Nothing in this section shall prohibit a \nprogram of health promotion or disease prevention that was established \nprior to the date of enactment of this section and applied with all \napplicable regulations, and that is operating on such date, from \ncontinuing to be carried out for as long as such regulations remain in \neffect.\n    (d) Regulations.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as \nprohibiting the Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services, or the \nTreasury from promulgating regulations in connection with this section."
