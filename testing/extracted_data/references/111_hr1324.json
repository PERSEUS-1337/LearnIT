    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Child Nutrition Promotion and School \nLunch Protection Act of 2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) for a school food service program to receive Federal \n        reimbursements under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n        1771 et seq.) or the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), school meals served by the \n        program must meet science-based nutrition standards established \n        by Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture;\n            (2) foods sold outside the reimbursable school meal \n        programs (including food and beverages sold in vending \n        machines, a la carte in cafeterias, school stores, and snack \n        bars) are not required to meet comparable nutritional \n        standards;\n            (3) in order to promote child nutrition and health, \n        Congress--\n                    (A) has authorized the Secretary to establish \n                nutrition standards in the school lunchroom during meal \n                time; and\n                    (B) since 1979, has prohibited the sale of food of \n                minimal nutritional value, as defined by the Secretary, \n                in areas where school meals are sold or eaten;\n            (4) federally reimbursed school meals and child nutrition \n        and health are undermined by the uneven authority of the \n        Secretary to apply nutrition standards throughout the school \n        campus and over the course of the school day;\n            (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the definition \n        of the term ``food of minimal nutritional value'' is the \n        national nutrition standard for foods sold outside of school \n        meals;\n            (6) since 1979, when the Secretary defined the term ``food \n        of minimal nutritional value'' and promulgated regulations for \n        the sale of those foods during meal times, nutrition science \n        has evolved and expanded;\n            (7) because some children purchase foods other than \n        balanced meals provided through the school lunch program \n        established under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) and the school breakfast program \n        established by section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 \n        U.S.C. 1773), the efforts of parents to ensure that their \n        children consume healthful diets are undermined;\n            (8) experts in nutrition science have found that--\n                    (A) since the 1970s, obesity rates have tripled \n                among children ages 6 to 19;\n                    (B) children's sodium intake is 214 percent above \n                recommended levels;\n                    (C) 85 percent of children consume more saturated \n                fat than is recommended in the most recent Dietary \n                Guidelines for Americans published under section 301 of \n                the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research \n                Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5341);\n                    (D) over \\2/3\\ of all foods consumed by \n                schoolchildren are foods that are recommended for \n                occasional intake;\n                    (E) overweight and obesity are leading modifiable \n                risk factors that have led to the growing number of \n                children with type 2 diabetes; and\n                    (F) \\1/4\\ of children ages 5 to 10 show early \n                warning signs of heart disease, such as elevated blood \n                cholesterol or high blood pressure;\n            (9) in 1996, children aged 2 to 18 years consumed an \n        average of 118 more calories per day than children did in 1978, \n        which is the equivalent of 12 pounds of weight gain annually, \n        if not compensated for through increased physical activity; and\n            (10) the national estimated cost of obesity is \n        $123,000,000,000 a year, \\1/2\\ of which is paid through the \n        Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and the Medicaid program under title \n        XIX of that Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3.
