FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Armed career criminals are certain individuals deemed \n        to be particularly culpable and dangerous because of their \n        prior criminal convictions and their possession of a firearm.\n            (2) The purpose of section 924(e) of title 18, United \n        States Code, (in this section referred to as ``section \n        924(e)'') has been, and continues to be, to provide certain and \n        severe punishment for these armed recidivist offenders, and \n        also to protect the public from the distinctive risk and acute \n        harms posed by them.\n            (3) The requirement of the Supreme Court of the United \n        States under Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990) and \n        Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), that district \n        courts apply a ``categorical approach'' when determining \n        whether certain prior convictions trigger an enhanced sentence \n        under section 924(e), has led to increased litigation and \n        inconsistent sentencing results, placing an onerous burden on \n        the judicial system and rendering the protection of public \n        safety haphazard.\n            (4) The ``categorical approach'' prevents Federal judges \n        from looking at reliable evidence of the facts of the \n        qualifying prior convictions and instead only permits Federal \n        judges to review the language of the statute of conviction and \n        certain limited judicial records. The Supreme Court of the \n        United States has said that its reading of section 924(e) in \n        this regard is colored, in part, by concern that to permit a \n        more probing judicial inquiry could raise right-to-jury-trial \n        issues because the sentence enhancement under section 924(e) \n        increases the statutory maximum sentence of 10 years under \n        section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code, to life \n        imprisonment. Under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 \n        (2000), a case decided after the date of enactment of the \n        Firearms Owners' Protection Act (Public Law 99-308; 100 Stat. \n        449), which initially added section 924(e), any facts (other \n        than prior convictions) which may be used to increase the \n        sentence of a defendant beyond the statutory maximum sentence \n        must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n            (5) Despite the best efforts of Federal prosecutors to \n        enforce section 924(e) for the safety of the community, there \n        have been numerous instances in which armed career criminals \n        have not been sentenced consistent with congressional intent \n        due to the precedent that has significantly narrowed the \n        applicability of section 924(e) and prevented judges from \n        exercising their historic sentencing discretion and judgment.\n            (6) Few statutory sentencing issues have led to such a \n        ceaseless stream of costly and time-consuming litigation at \n        every level of the Federal court system as the determination of \n        whether the broad range of offenses under State and local law \n        qualify categorically as crimes of violence or serious drug \n        trafficking offenses.\n            (7) Congress finds that significant disparities in the \n        content and formulation of State criminal law have resulted, \n        under Supreme Court precedent, in the unreasoned divergence of \n        criminal sentences based on fortuities such as differing \n        charging and recordkeeping practices among the 50 States, \n        Federal territories, and thousands of counties and parishes \n        across the United States. In the judgment of Congress, \n        fundamental principles of equality and fair treatment, as well \n        as the imperative of vigorously protecting public safety, \n        require far more uniform administration and implementation of \n        the sentencing provisions under section 924(e).\n            (8) Congress further believes that Federal judges should be \n        entrusted to continue their historic role and judgment as \n        sentencing fact finders capable of examining and evaluating \n        reliable evidence to determine if a particular conviction or \n        series of convictions merits enhancement.\n            (9) To allow judges to return to their traditional \n        sentencing roles and to make the sentencing judgments \n        traditionally assigned to courts under the Constitution of the \n        United States, this Act lowers the maximum sentence under \n        section 924(e) from life to 25 years, and increases the maximum \n        sentence under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code, \n        from 10 years to 25 years so that the exercise of the \n        traditional sentencing discretion of the court to enhance a \n        sentence as permitted by section 924(e) for armed career \n        criminals will not increase the statutory maximum sentence and \n        thereby implicate Apprendi principles.\n            (10) Because sentences for violations of section 922(g) of \n        title 18, United States Code, by individuals who are not armed \n        career criminals will commonly fall in the range of 10 years or \n        less by operation of the advisory sentencing guidelines and the \n        reasonable judgment of the sentencing courts, Congress does not \n        anticipate that there will be many resulting changes in the \n        length of sentence for those individuals, although the \n        increased statutory maximum will apply.\n            (11) To ensure that an inflexible application of section \n        924(e) does not result in overly harsh results, this Act gives \n        prosecutors the discretion to file a notice advising the \n        defendant and the court whether the prosecutor will seek to \n        invoke all, some, or none of the prior convictions of the \n        defendant to trigger the penalty enhancement.\n\nSEC. 3.
