FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Pharmacists are an important link in our Nation's \n        health care system. A critical shortage of pharmacists is \n        threatening the ability of pharmacies to continue to provide \n        important prescription related services.\n            (2) In the landmark report entitled ``To Err is Human: \n        Building a Safer Health System'', the Institute of Medicine \n        reported that medication errors can be partially attributed to \n        factors that are indicative of a shortage of pharmacists (such \n        as too many customers, numerous distractions, and staff \n        shortages).\n            (3) Congress acknowledged in the Healthcare Research and \n        Quality Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-129) a growing demand for \n        pharmacists by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services to conduct a study to determine whether there is a \n        shortage of pharmacists in the United States and, if so, to \n        what extent.\n            (4) As a result of Congress' concern about how a shortage \n        of pharmacists would impact the public health, the Secretary of \n        Health and Human Services published a report entitled ``The \n        Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and Demand for \n        Pharmacists'' in December of 2000.\n            (5) ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and \n        Demand for Pharmacists'' found that ``While the overall supply \n        of pharmacists has increased in the past decade, there has been \n        an unprecedented demand for pharmacists and for pharmaceutical \n        care services, which has not been met by the currently \n        available supply'' and that the ``evidence clearly indicates \n        the emergence of a shortage of pharmacists over the past two \n        years''.\n            (6) The same study also found that ``The factors causing \n        the current shortage are of a nature not likely to abate in the \n        near future without fundamental changes in pharmacy practice \n        and education.'' The study projects that the number of \n        prescriptions filled by community pharmacists will increase by \n        20 percent by 2004. In contrast, the number of community \n        pharmacists is expected to increase by only 6 percent by 2005.\n            (7) Regarding access to pharmacy services in rural areas, \n        the study found that ``Remoteness, isolation from other \n        professionals, lower economic returns, reduced opportunities \n        for advancement, and other rural practice characteristics \n        remain obstacles'' to attracting pharmacists.\n            (8) The demand for pharmacists will increase as \n        prescription drug use continues to grow.\n\nSEC. 3. HEALTH PROFESSIONS PROGRAMS RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF \n              PHARMACY.\n\n    Part E of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n294n et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n              ``Subpart 3--Pharmacy Workforce Development\n\n``SEC. 781.
