EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTIONS FOR NEWBORNS AND \n              INFANTS WITH HEARING LOSS.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act only, the following \nterms in this section are defined as follows:\n            (1) Hearing screening.--Newborn and infant hearing \n        screening consists of objective physiologic procedures to \n        detect possible hearing loss and to identify newborns and \n        infants who, after rescreening, require further audiologic and \n        medical evaluations.\n            (2) Audiologic evaluation.--Audiologic evaluation consists \n        of procedures to assess the status of the auditory system; to \n        establish the site of the auditory disorder; the type and \n        degree of hearing loss, and the potential effects of hearing \n        loss on communication; and to identify appropriate treatment \n        and referral options. Referral options should include linkage \n        to state IDEA Part C coordinating agencies or other appropriate \n        agencies, medical evaluation, hearing aid/sensory aid \n        assessment, audiologic rehabilitation treatment, national and \n        local consumer, self-help, parent, and education organizations, \n        and other family-centered services.\n            (3) Medical evaluation.--Medical evaluation by a physician \n        consists of key components including history, examination, and \n        medical decision making focused on symptomatic and related body \n        systems for the purpose of diagnosing the etiology of hearing \n        loss and related physical conditions, and for identifying \n        appropriate treatment and referral options.\n            (4) Medical intervention.--Medical intervention is the \n        process by which a physician provides medical diagnosis and \n        direction for medical and/or surgical treatment options of \n        hearing loss and/or related medical disorder associated with \n        hearing loss.\n            (5) Audiologic rehabilitation.--Audiologic rehabilitation \n        (intervention) consists of procedures, techniques, and \n        technologies to facilitate the receptive and expressive \n        communication abilities of a child with hearing loss.\n            (6) Early intervention.--Early intervention (e.g., \n        nonmedical) means providing appropriate services for the child \n        with hearing loss and ensuring that families of the child are \n        provided comprehensive, consumer-oriented information about the \n        full range of family support, training, information services, \n        communication options and are given the opportunity to consider \n        the full range of educational and program placements and \n        options for their child.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to clarify the \nauthority within the Public Health Service Act to authorize statewide \nnewborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention \nprograms and systems, technical assistance, a national applied research \nprogram, and interagency and private sector collaboration for policy \ndevelopment, in order to assist the States in making progress toward \nthe following goals:\n            (1) All babies born in hospitals in the United States and \n        its territories should have a hearing screening before leaving \n        the birthing facility. Babies born in other countries and \n        residing in the United States via immigration or adoption \n        should have a hearing screening as early as possible.\n            (2) All babies who are not born in hospitals in the United \n        States and its territories should have a hearing screening \n        within the first 3 months of life.\n            (3) Appropriate audiologic and medical evaluations should \n        be conducted by 3 months for all newborns and infants suspected \n        of having hearing loss to allow appropriate referral and \n        provisions for audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early \n        intervention before the age of 6 months.\n            (4) All newborn and infant hearing screening programs and \n        systems should include a component for audiologic \nrehabilitation, medical and early intervention options that ensures \nlinkage to any new and existing state-wide systems of intervention and \nrehabilitative services for newborns and infants with hearing loss.\n            (5) Public policy in regard to newborn and infant hearing \n        screening and intervention should be based on applied research \n        and the recognition that newborns, infants, toddlers, and \n        children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing have unique language, \n        learning, and communication needs, and should be the result of \n        consultation with pertinent public and private sectors.\n    (c) Statewide Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening, Evaluation and \nIntervention Programs and Systems.--Under the existing authority of the \nPublic Health Service Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary''), acting through the \nAdministrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nshall make awards of grants or cooperative agreements to develop \nstatewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and \nintervention programs and systems for the following purposes:\n            (1) To develop and monitor the efficacy of state-wide \n        newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and \n        intervention programs and systems.
