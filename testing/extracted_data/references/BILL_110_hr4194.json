FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) While underage drinking has been on the decline for \n        more than 20 years, the consumption of beverage alcohol by \n        underage youth is an ongoing national concern. According to the \n        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 10.8 \n        million Americans between the ages of 12 to 20 for whom alcohol \n        is illegal report current alcohol use, approximately 28 percent \n        of that age group.\n            (2) Data from the National Academy of Sciences/Institute of \n        Medicine, the Federal Trade Commission, the Century Council and \n        the American Medical Association show that most youth who drink \n        obtain alcohol primarily through noncommercial sources, such as \n        family and friends.\n            (3) According to research conducted by Teenage Research \n        Unlimited (TRU) for the Century Council, 10-18 year olds say \n        parents and school teachers should begin discussing the dangers \n        and consequences of underage drinking with children by age 11.\n            (4) The role of parents in reducing underage drinking, \n        particularly among middle-school aged children, is critical. \n        Numerous studies confirm the crucial role parents play in \n        shaping the behavior and decisionmaking skills of their \n        children. For example, a study reported in Health Education and \n        Behavior, February 2001, suggests that parental involvement is \n        associated with a 67 percent less likelihood of drinking.\n            (5) The Surgeon General's 2007 Call to Action to Prevent \n        and Reduce Underage Drinking recognizes that significant social \n        transitions, such as moving from elementary school to middle \n        school or from middle school to high school may increase the \n        likelihood that adolescents will use alcohol, in part because \n        they increase adolescent stress levels. Additionally, evidence \n        shows that youth who spend more time engaged in volunteering, \n        sports, music, academics and leadership are less likely to \n        engage in risky behaviors, such as alcohol use.\n            (6) According to a 2004 study published in the Journal of \n        Adolescent Health, ``Adults' Approval and Adolescents' Alcohol \n        Use,'' one in five teens reported drinking alcohol that was \n        provided by a parent or a friend's parent at a party. \n        Additionally, researchers found that such provision of alcohol \n        significantly increased the likelihood of regular and binge \n        drinking.\n            (7) A 2003 report submitted to Congress by the National \n        Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine recommended that \n        underage drinking cannot be successfully addressed by focusing \n        on youth alone. Two out of three teens (aged 13 to 18) said it \n        is easy to get alcohol from their homes without their parents \n        knowing it. Thirty-three percent of teens responded that it is \n        easy to obtain alcohol from their own parents (knowingly); this \n        increases to 40 percent when it is from a friend's parent.\n            (8) The Surgeon General's 2007 Call to Action to Prevent \n        and Reduce Underage Drinking supports holding adults \n        accountable for underage drinking at house parties, even when \n        those adults are not at home.\n            (9) In nearly 20 States, legislatures are considering bills \n        to increase penalties for adults who provide alcohol to people \n        under the age of 21. Those penalties include higher fines, \n        driver's license suspensions and even jail.\n            (10) The Surgeon General's 2007 Call to Action to Prevent \n        and Reduce Underage Drinking includes the need for complete and \n        timely information on patterns and trends in youth alcohol \n        consumption in order to develop and evaluate prevention \n        strategies. Additionally, reports from the General Accounting \n        Office and the Department of Health and Human Services \n        demonstrate the need for better data collection and effective \n        evaluation of on-going programs.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that:\n            (1) Understanding which programs are effective in reducing \n        underage drinking will maximize scarce Federal resources and \n        help the nation confront underage drinking in a more effective \n        and cost-efficient manner and enable local communities to \n        implement the most effective tactics to reduce underage \n        drinking.\n            (2) Evaluation is necessary. Therefore the Substance Abuse \n        and Mental Health Services Administration should explore ways \n        to expand and improve evaluation efforts while preserving and \n        continuing current programs and funding in the interest of \n        achieving maximum effectiveness.\n            (3) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n        Administration should continue to improve evaluation efforts \n        and national outcome measures (NOMS) reporting in the Substance \n        Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant and other grant \n        programs, when appropriate.\n            (4) Federal agencies should strive to evaluate all \n        federally funded underage drinking programs and modify programs \n        as needed to reach maximum effectiveness in reducing underage \n        drinking.\n\nSEC. 4.
