    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Second Chance Homes Promotion Act of \n2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has the highest rates of teenage \n        pregnancy and births in the western industrialized world.\n            (2) Teenage pregnancy costs the United States at least \n        $7,000,000,000 annually. Four in 10 young women become pregnant \n        at least once before they reach the age of 20, for a total of \n        nearly 1,000,000 teenage pregnancies a year. Eight in 10 of \n        these pregnancies are unintended, and 79 percent are to \n        unmarried teens.\n            (3) Teenage mothers are less likely than other teens to \n        complete high school. Only \\1/3\\ of teenage mothers receive a \n        high school diploma. Teenage mothers are also more likely than \n        other individuals to become dependent on welfare, with nearly \n        80 percent of unmarried teenage mothers ending up on welfare.\n            (4) The children of teenage mothers have lower birth \n        weights, are more likely to perform poorly in school, and are \n        at greater risk of abuse and neglect than are other children. \n        The sons of teenage mothers are 13 percent more likely than \n        other males to end up in prison, while daughters of teenage \n        mothers are 22 percent more likely than other females to become \n        teenage mothers themselves.\n            (5) In the amendments made by the 1996 welfare reform \n        legislation, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n        Reconciliation Act of 1996, Congress endorsed the concept of \n        ``second chance homes'' as an alternative for minor teenage \n        parents required by the law to live at home or under adult \n        supervision. The law required States to ``provide, or assist \n        the individual in locating, a second chance home, maternity \n        home, or other appropriate adult-supervised supportive living \n        arrangement''. According to a 1999 report by the Center for Law \n        and Social Policy, 18 States had no policy for helping families \n        with teenage parents find shelter. A 1998 survey by the Center \n        on Law and Social Policy found that in the 9 States that keep \n        data on minors ineligible for welfare, 1,300 teens were denied \n        assistance under State temporary assistance for needy families \n        programs because of their living situations.\n            (6) Second chance homes offer the 3 elements that teenage \n        welfare mothers need to change their lives--\n                    (A) socialization;\n                    (B) nurturing and support; and\n                    (C) structure and discipline.\n            (7) These homes have produced the following notable and \n        promising results:\n                    (A) Few second pregnancies.\n                    (B) Slightly higher adoption rates.\n                    (C) Less child abuse.\n                    (D) Better maternal and child health.\n                    (E) Dramatically increased school completion rates \n                for mothers.\n                    (F) Higher employment rates.\n                    (G) Reduced welfare dependency.\n\nSEC. 3.
