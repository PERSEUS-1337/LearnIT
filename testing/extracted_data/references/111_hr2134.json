FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n        Services Administration's (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Use \n        and Health, in 2008 in the United States, there were an \n        estimated 25,768,000 users of marijuana, 5,255,000 users of \n        cocaine, 850,000 users of methamphetamine, and 453,000 users of \n        heroin.\n            (2) Nearly 100 percent of the United States cocaine supply \n        originates in the Andean countries of Bolivia, Colombia, and \n        Peru and over 90 percent of the United States heroin supply \n        originates in Colombia and Mexico.\n            (3) In those countries, the cultivation, production and \n        trafficking of cocaine and heroin generate violence, \n        instability and corruption.\n            (4) In the transit countries of Central America, Mexico, \n        Venezuela, Ecuador, Haiti, and other Caribbean countries, drug \n        trafficking is central to the growing strength of organized \n        criminals to threaten local and national law enforcement, \n        political institutions, citizen security, rule of law, and \n        United States security and interests.\n            (5) Drug-related violence is on the rise in Mexico and \n        along the United States-Mexico border. 5,661 people died in \n        Mexico in 2008 alone as a result of drug-related violence. This \n        is more than double the 2007 total of 2,773.\n            (6) According to the Department of State's June 2009 \n        Trafficking in Persons report, organized criminal networks in \n        Mexico also ``traffic Mexican women and girls into the United \n        States for commercial sexual exploitation''.\n            (7) Extremist groups and their supporters in the Western \n        Hemisphere, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \n        Colombia (FARC) and Hezbollah, often use drug trafficking to \n        finance terrorist activities.\n            (8) From 1980-2008, United States counternarcotics \n        assistance from the State and Defense Departments to Latin \n        America and the Caribbean totaled about $11,300,000,000.\n\nSEC. 3.
