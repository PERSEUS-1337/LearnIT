    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Big Thicket National Preserve, located in East \n        Texas, was established by Congress in 1974 as the nation's \n        first Preserve.\n            (2) The Big Thicket, known as the ``biological crossroads \n        of North America,'' is home to species native of the Gulf \n        Coastal Plains, Eastern Forests, and the Central Plains, \n        including the bald eagle, the peregrine falcon, and whooping \n        crane, which make their home among rivers, baldcypress swamps, \n        pine savannahs, sandhills, and tall forests.\n            (3) In 1993, Congress approved an expansion of the \n        authorized boundary of the Big Thicket to incorporate more \n        biological diversity.\n            (4) In 2007, major owners of timberland in the region began \n        divesting property, some of which was ultimately purchased by \n        the National Park Service for Big Thicket.\n            (5) Because of these new additions, the Big Thicket has \n        reached its Congressionally authorized boundary of 97,000 \n        acres.\n\nSEC. 2. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT.\n\n    The first section of the Act titled ``An Act to authorize the \nestablishment of the Big Thicket National Preserve in the State of \nTexas, and for other purposes'' (16 U.S.C. 698), is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), and (e) as \n        subsections (d), (e), and (f), respectively;\n            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n    ``(c) Additional Lands.--The boundary of the preserve may also \ninclude any lands acquired from willing sellers totaling not more than \n100,000 acres of land near the Preserve as generally depicted on the \nmap titled `Big Thicket National Preserve Proposed Boundary Expansion', \nnumbered 175/80, 017A, and dated April 2008. The map shall be on file \nand available for inspection in the appropriate offices of the National \nPark Service.'';\n            (3) in subsection (d) (as redesignated by paragraph (1) \n        above)--\n                    (A) by striking ``owner: Provided further'' and all \n                that follows through ``exchange:'' and inserting a \n                colon; and\n                    (B) by striking ``After notifying'' through the end \n                of that sentence and inserting ``The Secretary may, if \n                the Secretary considers such that lands would make a \n                significant contribution to the purposes for which the \n                preserve was created, accept title to any lands, or \n                interests in lands, located outside of the boundaries \n                of the preserve, as established by subsections (b) and \n                (c), which the State of Texas or its political \n                subdivisions may acquire and offer to donate to the \n                United States or which any private person, \n                organization, or public or private corporation may \n                offer to donate to the United States. The Secretary may \n                administer such lands as a part of the preserve after \n                publishing notice to that effect in the Federal \n                Register.''; and\n            (4) by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(g) Private Landowner Withdrawal.--Any owner of private property \nincluded within the boundaries of the preserve shall have their \nproperty immediately removed from the boundary by submitting a written \nrequest for such withdrawal to the Secretary.''.\n\nSEC. 3. CANOPY WALKS, ELEVATED BOARDWALKS, AND ASSOCIATED \n              INTERPRETATION.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior shall construct, operate, and \nmaintain a system of canopy walks, elevated boardwalks, and associated \ninterpretation that connect visitors with the ecological diversity of \nBig Thicket National Preserve. In developing the system, the Secretary \nmay give special consideration to areas in Big Thicket National \nPreserve that are inaccessible to most visitors due to swamp, high \nvegetation, or fragile ecology.\n\nSEC. 4. BIG THICKET NATIONAL PRESERVE INTERPRETIVE CENTER.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior shall construct, operate, and \nmaintain a Big Thicket National Preserve interpretive center that is--\n            (1) easily accessible to a heavily traveled area (such as \n        Beaumont, Texas, near Interstate 10); and\n            (2) serves as an educational opportunity for children and \n        young adults to learn more about Big Thicket National Preserve, \n        wildlife, and the environment, and the importance of protecting \n        these resources.\n\nSEC. 5. CANOE AND KAYAKING TRAILS.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior shall construct, operate, and \nmaintain canoe and kayaking trails in Big Thicket National Preserve \nthat--\n            (1) are guided by Global Positioning System waypoints; and\n            (2) include platforms off the water for kayaks and canoes \n        to be docked safely.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of the \nInterior such sums as are necessary to carry out this Act and the \namendments made by this Act."
