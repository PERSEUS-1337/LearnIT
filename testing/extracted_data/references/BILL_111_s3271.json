SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Vehicle Event History Information \nCapturing Leads to Engineering Safety Improvements Act of 2010'' or the \n``VEHICLE Safety Improvements Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In August 2001, the National Highway Traffic Safety \n        Administration Research and Development Event Data Recorder \n        Working Group published the following findings:\n                    (A) ``EDRs [event data recorders] have the \n                potential to greatly improve highway safety, for \n                example, by improving occupant protection systems and \n                improving the accuracy of crash reconstructions.''.\n                    (B) ``EDR technology has potential safety \n                applications for all classes of motor vehicles.''.\n                    (C) ``A wide range of crash related and other data \n                elements have been identified which might usefully be \n                captured by future EDR systems.''.\n                    (D) ``NHTSA has incorporated EDR data collection in \n                its motor vehicle research databases.''.\n                    (E) ``Open access to EDR data (minus personal \n                identifiers) will benefit researchers, crash \n                investigators, and manufacturers in improving safety on \n                the highways.''.\n                    (F) ``Studies of EDRs in Europe and the U.S. have \n                shown that driver and employee awareness of an on-board \n                EDR reduces the number and severity of drivers' \n                crashes.''.\n                    (G) ``Given the differing nature of cars, vans, \n                SUVs, and other lightweight vehicles, compared to heavy \n                trucks, school buses, and motorcoaches, different EDR \n                systems may be required to meet the needs of each \n                vehicle class.''.\n                    (H) ``Most systems utilize proprietary technology \n                and require the manufacturer to download and analyze \n                the data.''.\n            (2) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n        (NHTSA) issued an event data recorder rule on August 28, 2006 \n        (71 Fed. Reg. 50998), that--\n                    (A) included a number of technical requirements for \n                event data recorders if they were provided in the motor \n                vehicle, including standardized data required to be \n                collected, the data format, and requirements for the \n                event data recorder to be readable following severe \n                crashes; and\n                    (B) did not require the installation of event data \n                recorders in any motor vehicle.\n            (3) Recent NHTSA investigations have highlighted the \n        importance of event data recorders in determining the nature \n        and cause of motor vehicle crashes and malfunctions.\n\nSEC. 3. EVENT DATA RECORDERS.\n\n    Section 30166 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:\n    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Model year.--The term `model year' means--\n                    ``(A) the annual production period of a \n                manufacturer that begins on September 1 of the year \n                preceding the calendar year for which the model year is \n                named;
