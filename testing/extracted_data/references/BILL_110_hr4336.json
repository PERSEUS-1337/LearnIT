FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since 1996, eight major commercial air accidents have \n        occurred in which the immediate cause was unknown and recovery \n        of flight data and cockpit voice recorder units (``black \n        boxes'') was significantly delayed. On average, it has taken \n        investigators 8 days to recover flight data recorders and 15 \n        days to recover cockpit voice recorders from the wreckage of \n        these accidents.\n            (2) Failure to recover the flight data and cockpit voice \n        recorder units aboard the commercial aircraft involved in the \n        events of September 11, 2001, demonstrated that fixed recorder \n        technology is not adequate.\n            (3) The 9/11 Commission staff recommendations state that \n        the Transportation Security Administration (referred to in this \n        Act as ``TSA'') and Federal Aviation Administration (referred \n        to in this Act as ``FAA'') should take steps to improve the \n        survivability of flight data recorders and cockpit voice \n        recorders to ensure that complete and reliable information is \n        available to investigators in the aftermath of a terrorist \n        attack.\n            (4) The thwarted August 10, 2006, terrorist bombing \n        attempt, which threatened multiple aircraft en route from the \n        United Kingdom to the United States, demonstrates that \n        continued threats to commercial airliners, particularly to \n        those aircraft operating long-distance flights over ocean \n        waters, remain a national security concern.\n            (5) The recent FAA ruling to increase the allowable \n        distance that extended-operation multiengine aircraft (known as \n        ETOPs) can travel from an emergency or diversion airport \n        increases the potential for more difficult location and \n        recovery of fixed flight data and cockpit voice recorder units.\n            (6) It is in the public interest that aircraft be equipped \n        with recorder units that can be recovered immediately after an \n        incident involving an aircraft.\n\nSEC. 3. REGULATIONS REQUIRING DEPLOYABLE RECORDERS AND OTHER PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 447 of title 49, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 44729. Installation of additional flight recorders\n    ``(a) Regulations.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n        enactment of this section, the Secretary of Transportation \n        shall issue regulations that require in accordance with this \n        section all commercial aircraft in extended-range operations \n        that are required to carry fixed cockpit voice recorder and \n        digital flight data recorder units also be equipped with a \n        second recorder system that utilizes deployable combination \n        cockpit voice and digital flight data recorder technology. The \n        second deployable recorder system shall be mounted as far rear \n        on the airframe as practicable.\n            ``(2) Minimum capabilities.--The deployable recorder system \n        shall be--\n                    ``(A) capable of recording all mandatory data \n                parameters covering the previous 25 hours of operation \n                and all cockpit audio, including controller-pilot data \n                link messages for the previous 2 hours of operation;\n                    ``(B) powered by the electrical bus to provide the \n                maximum reliability for operation without jeopardizing \n                service to essential or emergency loads; and\n                    ``(C) provided with an independent power source \n                that is located with the combination recorder and that \n                automatically engages and provides 10 minutes of \n                operation whenever normal aircraft power ceases.\n    ``(b) Schedule for Installation of Second Combined System.--The \nregulations shall require the installation of the deployable \ncombination recorder system required under this section on commercial \naircraft that are ordered by an air carrier on or after January 1, \n2009.\n    ``(c) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions \napply:\n            ``(1) Commercial aircraft.--The term `commercial aircraft' \n        means--\n                    ``(A) a jet aircraft with 10 or more seats or \n                greater than 12,500-pound maximum takeoff weight; and\n                    ``(B) a propeller-driven aircraft with greater than \n                19 seats or greater than 19,000-pound maximum takeoff \n                weight.\n            ``(2) Deployable recorder system.--The term `deployable \n        recorder system' means a digital flight data recorder, cockpit \n        voice recorder, and emergency locator transmitter housed as one \n        unit within an assembly that is designed to be mounted \n        conformal to the surface of the airframe, to eject from the \n        aircraft upon accident and safely land away from the crash \n        site, and to float indefinitely on water.\n            ``(3) Extended-range operations.--The term `extended-range \n        operations' means commercial aircraft operations in compliance \n        with the Federal Aviation Administration's extended operations \n        (ETOPs) of multiengine airplanes rule (RIN 2120-A103) \n        permitting multiengine, aircraft described in parts 121 and 135 \n        of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, to fly up to 240 \n        minutes of single-engine flying time from an adequate \n        airport.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The analysis for such chapter is amended \nby adding at the end the following:\n\n``44729. Installation of additional flight recorders.''.\n\nSEC. 4. PURCHASE OF DEPLOYABLE RECORDER SYSTEMS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall reimburse an \nair carrier (as defined in section 40102 of title 49, United States \nCode) for the costs of purchasing and installing deployable recorder \nsystems, including engineering, certification, equipment, and \ninstallation costs, in order for the air carrier to comply with the \nregulations issued under section 44729 of such title.\n    (b) Reasonable Amount.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue \nregulations that set forth what constitutes a reasonable amount for \nreimbursement under subsection (a)."
