and\n            (2) rules that prohibit, except as provided in subsection \n        (b), such providers from--\n                    (A) collecting personal information on individuals \n                who have expressed, via a mechanism that meets the \n                standards promulgated under paragraph (1), a preference \n                not to have such information collected;
