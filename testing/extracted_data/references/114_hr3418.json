COMPLIANCE WITH INTERAGENCY SECURITY COMMITTEE MINIMUM SECURITY \n              STANDARDS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On October 19, 1995, six months after the Oklahoma City \n        bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, President \n        Clinton issued Executive Order 12977, creating the Interagency \n        Security Committee to address continuing Government-wide \n        security for Federal facilities. The Committee's mandate is to \n        enhance the quality and effectiveness of physical security in, \n        and the protection of, non-military Federal facilities in the \n        United States, whether Government-owned, -leased, or -managed. \n        Today, the Committee is comprised of chief security officers \n        and other senior executives from 54 Federal agencies and \n        departments.\n            (2) On September 7, 2012, the primary members of the \n        Interagency Security Committee approved ``The Risk Management \n        Process: An Interagency Security Committee Standard'', which \n        was issued in August 2013.\n            (3) Consistent with Executive Order 12977, ``The Risk \n        Management Process: An Interagency Security Committee \n        Standard'' is intended to be applied to all facilities in the \n        United States occupied by Federal employees for non-military \n        activities. This standard defines the criteria and processes \n        that those individuals responsible for the security of such a \n        facility should use to determine such a facility's security \n        level, and provides an integrated, single source of physical \n        security countermeasures for all such non-military Federal \n        facilities.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nInteragency Security Committee standards for Federal facilities \nestablished by the Interagency Security Committee in the document \nentitled ``The Risk Management Process: An Interagency Security \nCommittee Standard'' published in August 2013 and successor documents \nshould be utilized, as appropriate, to protect all non-military Federal \nfacilities.\n    (c) Assessment.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the \nSenate an assessment of the degree to which the standards specified in \nthe ``The Risk Management Process: An Interagency Security Committee \nStandard'', approved by the Interagency Security Committee, is utilized \nby all non-military Federal facilities and what, if any, barriers exist \nto utilization of such standards.\n\nSEC. 4.
