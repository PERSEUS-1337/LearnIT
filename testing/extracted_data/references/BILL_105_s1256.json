FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) property rights have been abrogated by the application \n        of laws, regulations, and other actions by all levels of \n        government that adversely affect the value and the ability to \n        make reasonable use of private property;\n            (2) certain provisions of sections 1346 and 1402 and \n        chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as \n        the Tucker Act), that delineate the jurisdiction of courts \n        hearing property rights claims, frustrate the ability of a \n        property owner to obtain full relief for violation founded upon \n        the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the United States \n        Constitution;\n            (3) current law--\n                    (A) has no sound basis for splitting jurisdiction \n                between two courts in cases where constitutionally \n                protected property rights are at stake;\n                    (B) adds to the complexity and cost of takings and \n                litigation, adversely affecting taxpayers and property \n                owners;\n                    (C) forces a property owner, who seeks just \n                compensation from the Federal Government, to elect \n                between equitable relief in the district court and \n                monetary relief (the value of the property taken) in \n                the United States Court of Federal Claims;\n                    (D) is used to urge dismissal in the district court \n                in complaints against the Federal Government, on the \n                ground that the plaintiff should seek just compensation \n                in the Court of Federal Claims;\n                    (E) is used to urge dismissal in the Court of \n                Federal Claims in complaints against the Federal \n                Government, on the ground that the plaintiff should \n                seek equitable relief in district court; and\n                    (F) forces a property owner to first pay to \n                litigate an action in a State court, before a Federal \n                judge can decide whether local government has denied \n                property rights safeguarded by the United States \n                Constitution;\n            (4) property owners cannot fully vindicate property rights \n        in one lawsuit and their claims may be time barred in a \n        subsequent action;\n            (5) property owners should be able to fully recover for a \n        taking of their private property in one court;\n            (6) certain provisions of section 1346 and 1402 and chapter \n        91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as the \n        Tucker Act) should be amended, giving both the district courts \n        of the United States and the Court of Federal Claims \n        jurisdiction to hear all claims relating to property rights in \n        complaints against the Federal Government;\n            (7) section 1500 of title 28, United States Code, which \n        denies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain a \n        suit which is pending in another court and made by the same \n        plaintiff, should be repealed;\n            (8) Federal and local authorities, through complex, costly, \n        repetitive and unconstitutional permitting, variance, and \n        licensing procedures, have denied property owners their fifth \n        and fourteenth amendment rights under the United States \n        Constitution to the use, enjoyment, and disposition of, and \n        exclusion of others from, their property, and to \nsafeguard those rights, there is a need to determine what constitutes a \nfinal decision of an agency in order to allow claimants the ability to \nprotect their property rights in a court of law;\n            (9) a Federal judge should decide the merits of cases where \n        a property owner seeks redress solely for infringements of \n        rights safeguarded by the United States Constitution, and where \n        no claim of a violation of State law is alleged; and\n            (10) certain provisions of sections 1343, 1346, and 1491 of \n        title 28, United States Code, should be amended to clarify when \n        a claim for redress of constitutionally protected property \n        rights is sufficiently ripe so a Federal judge may decide the \n        merits of the allegations.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) establish a clear, uniform, and efficient judicial \n        process whereby aggrieved property owners can obtain \n        vindication of property rights guaranteed by the fifth and \n        fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution and \n        this Act;\n            (2) amend the Tucker Act, including the repeal of section \n        1500 of title 28, United States Code;\n            (3) rectify the unduly onerous and expensive requirement \n        that a property owner, seeking redress under section 1979 of \n        the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983) for \n        the infringement of property rights protected by the fifth and \n        fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution, is \n        required to first litigate Federal constitutional issues in a \n        State court before obtaining access to the Federal courts; and\n            (4) provide for uniformity in the application of the \n        ripeness doctrine in cases where constitutionally protected \n        property rights are allegedly infringed, by providing that a \n        final agency decision may be adjudicated by a Federal court on \n        the merits after--\n                    (A) the pertinent government body denies a \n                meaningful application to develop the land in question; \n                and\n                    (B) the property owner seeks a waiver by or brings \n                an appeal to an administrative agency from such denial.\n\nSEC. 4.
