    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Children and Family HIV/AIDS \nResearch and Care Act of 2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 2,000 children worldwide are infected with \n        HIV each day, the vast majority through mother to child \n        transmission.\n            (2) More than 3,700 children and youth in the United States \n        under the age of 13 are living with HIV and AIDS.\n            (3) Young people ages 15 through 24 represent 50 percent of \n        all new HIV infections worldwide.\n            (4) Each day more than 6,000 youth become infected with \n        HIV.\n            (5) Of the more than 40,000 Americans newly infected with \n        HIV every year, half are among people under 25 years old.\n            (6) Women account for more than a quarter of all new HIV \n        infections in the United States and young women represent 58 \n        percent of new HIV cases among people ages 13 to 19.\n            (7) Title IV of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources \n        Emergency Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-381) is a successful \n        model of family-centered, coordinated health care and \n        supportive services for women, children, youth and families.\n            (8) Most programs under title IV of the Ryan White \n        Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 are the \n        principal source of medical care for HIV-positive children, \n        youth, and pregnant women in their geographic area.\n            (9) Children and youth living with HIV and AIDS have unique \n        needs for specialized services in medical care and psychosocial \n        support.\n            (10) Title IV of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS \n        Resources Emergency Act of 1990, including its Adolescent \n        Initiative, is the leading national effort to link HIV-positive \n        youth to comprehensive medical care and support services.\n            (11) Each year more than 53,000 women, children, and youth \n        receive services funded under title IV of the Ryan White \n        Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990.\n            (12) With no preventive intervention, an HIV-positive \n        pregnant woman has a 25 percent chance of passing on the virus \n        to her baby. With optimal care, including preventive drug \n        interventions, the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV \n        drops to 1 to 2 percent.\n            (13) Services provided by programs funded under title IV of \n        the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of \n        1990 have been essential in reducing the number of mother-to-\n        child HIV infections in the United States from approximately \n        2,000 to fewer than 300 per year.\n            (14) The Institute of Medicine recommends routine, \n        voluntary HIV testing of pregnant women as a means to \n        increasing the proportion of women tested and, ultimately, \n        reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n            (15) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also \n        recommends a routine, voluntary approach to HIV testing of \n        pregnant women as an effective means to reduce mother-to-child \n        transmission of HIV.\n            (16) Experts believe that vaccines to prevent HIV infection \n        offer the best hope of controlling the global pandemic. \n        However, some of the populations hardest hit by the disease \n        (infants, preadolescents, and adolescents) are at risk of being \n        left behind in the search for an effective vaccine against the \n        virus.\n            (17) To date, the vast majority of HIV vaccine trials have \n        not included pediatric populations. Of the 110 trials that have \n        been completed, only two of them included these populations. Of \n        the 40 trials that are currently being conducted, only one \n        involves pediatric populations.\n            (18) Because we cannot assume that a vaccine tested in \n        adults will also be safe and effective when used in pediatric \n        populations, it will be important to ensure that promising \n        vaccines are tested in all relevant pediatric populations as \n        early as is medically and ethically appropriate.\n\nSEC. 3. ENSURING FAMILY-CENTERED, COORDINATED CARE FOR CHILDREN AND \n              FAMILIES OF HIV/AIDS.\n\n    Section 2671 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-71) \nis amended--\n            (1) in subsection (d)(1), by striking ``for'' and inserting \n        ``coordinated, family-centered care, including''; and\n            (2) in subsection (k), by striking ``1996 through 2000'' \n        and inserting ``2005 through 2010''.\n\nSEC. 4. EXPANDING CARE FOR YOUTH.\n\n    Section 2671(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-\n71(a)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n            ``(3) In the case of youth with HIV, providing health care \n        and other supportive services designed to recruit and retain \n        youth in care. For purposes of this paragraph, the term `youth \n        with HIV' means individuals ages 13 through 24 infected through \n        all modes of transmission including mother-to-child.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
