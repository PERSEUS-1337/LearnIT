FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the victimization of children in our Nation has reached \n        epidemic proportions; recent Department of Justice figures show \n        that--\n                    (A) 4,600 children were abducted by non-family \n                members;\n                    (B) two-thirds of the abductions of children by \n                non-family members involve sexual assault;\n                    (C) more than 354,000 children were abducted by \n                family members; and\n                    (D) 451,000 children ran away;\n            (2) while some local law enforcement officials have been \n        successful in the investigation and resolution of such crimes, \n        most local agencies lack the personnel and resources necessary \n        to give this problem the full attention it requires;\n            (3) a majority of the Nation's 17,000 police departments \n        have 10 or fewer officers; and\n            (4) locating missing children requires a coordinated law \n        enforcement effort; supplementing local law enforcement \n        agencies with a team of assigned active Federal agents will \n        allow Federal agents to pool their resources and expertise in \n        order to assist local agents in the investigation of the \n        Nation's most difficult cases involving missing children.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a task force comprised of \nlaw enforcement officers from pertinent Federal agencies to work with \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (referred to as \nthe ``Center'') and coordinate the provision of Federal law enforcement \nresources to assist State and local authorities in investigating the \nmost difficult cases of missing and exploited children.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF TASK FORCE.\n\n    Title IV of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of \n1974 (42 U.S.C. 5771 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating sections 407 and 408 as sections 408 \n        and 409, respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 406 the following new \n        section:\n\n                              ``task force\n\n    ``Sec. 407.
