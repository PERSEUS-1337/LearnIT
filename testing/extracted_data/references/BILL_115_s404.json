FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) There is a lack of transparency and consistency \n        concerning inspections by the Food and Drug Administration of \n        medical device establishments around the world, which leads to \n        inefficiencies and inconsistencies and undermines confidence in \n        United States standards.\n            (2) Inspections by the Food and Drug Administration of \n        foreign device establishments are often conducted more \n        efficiently than inspections of domestic device establishments.\n            (3) The frequency and nature of inspections of device \n        establishments are not consistently risk-based, and a \n        comprehensive, transparent, risk-based approach to inspections \n        would result in greater focus on the more significant risks to \n        public health while reducing the burdens on establishments with \n        a strong track record of compliance.\n            (4) There is a lack of transparency and consistency among \n        United States-based regional inspection offices with respect to \n        the frequency of inspections of device establishments and the \n        activities and concerns that trigger for-cause inspections of \n        such establishments.\n            (5) Greater transparency concerning the timing and nature \n        of routine inspections of device establishments would improve \n        the quality and efficiency of the inspection process.\n            (6) Enhancing communications before, during, and after \n        inspections in which deficiencies are identified, would assist \n        the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the device \n        industry in maintaining the safety and effectiveness of \n        devices.\n            (7) Guidance for device establishments is necessary to \n        provide transparency and consistency concerning inspection-\n        related communications.\n            (8) Enhanced training opportunities for device \n        establishment investigators would improve the consistency and \n        efficiency of the device inspection process.\n            (9) There is a lack of transparency in the export \n        certification process with respect to device establishments for \n        which FDA Form 483 has been used to document issues noticed \n        during an inspection conducted pursuant to section 704 of the \n        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 374) or \n        establishments that have received Warning Letters in connection \n        with such an inspection, and between domestic and foreign \n        establishments, resulting in devices that are lawfully marketed \n        for United States patients being denied certification for \n        marketing in other countries.\n            (10) Device establishments that have attempted to address \n        deficiencies identified by inspections carried out by the Food \n        and Drug Administration lack sufficient opportunities to \n        confirm that such corrective actions are appropriate.\n\nSEC. 2. RISK-BASED INSPECTIONS FOR DEVICES.\n\n    Paragraph (2) of section 510(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360(h)) is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(2) Risk-based schedule for devices.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary, acting through \n                one or more officers or employees duly designated by \n                the Secretary, shall inspect establishments described \n                in paragraph (1) that are engaged in the manufacture, \n                propagation, compounding, or processing of a device or \n                devices (referred to in this subsection as `device \n                establishments') in accordance with one risk-based \n                inspection schedule established by the Secretary, \n                applied consistently across regional offices.\n                    ``(B) Factors and considerations.--In establishing \n                the risk-based schedule under subparagraph (A), the \n                Secretary shall--\n                            ``(i) apply, to the extent applicable for \n                        device establishments, the factors identified \n                        in paragraph (4); and\n                            ``(ii) consider the participation of the \n                        device establishment, as applicable, in \n                        international device audit programs in which \n                        the United States participates or the United \n                        States recognizes for purposes of \n                        inspecting.''.\n\nSEC. 3. IMPROVEMENTS TO INSPECTIONS PROCESS FOR DEVICE ESTABLISHMENTS.\n\n    Section 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n374) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(h)(1) The Secretary shall adopt a uniform process and uniform \nstandards applicable to inspections of domestic and foreign device \nestablishments. Such process shall include--\n            ``(A) notifying the owner, operator, or agent in charge of \n        the establishment of the type and nature of the inspection;\n            ``(B) announcing the inspection the establishment within a \n        reasonable time before such inspection;\n            ``(C) in the case of inspections other than for-cause \n        inspections, providing a reasonable estimate of the timeframe \n        for the inspection, an opportunity for advance communications \n        between the officers or employees carrying out the inspection \n        under subsection (a)(1) and the owner, operator, or agent in \n        charge of the establishment concerning appropriate working \n        hours during the inspection, and, to the extent feasible, \n        advance notice of records that will be requested in order to \n        expedite the inspection; and\n            ``(D) daily communications with the owner, operator, or \n        agent in charge of the establishment regarding inspection \n        status, which may be recorded by either party with advance \n        notice.\n    ``(2) In the case of device establishments that have received a \nreport pursuant to subsection (b), and for which the owner, operator, \nor agent in charge of such establishment submits a timely response to \nsuch report that includes a request for feedback to the actions \nproposed in such response, the Secretary shall provide nonbinding \nfeedback regarding such proposed actions within 45 days of receipt of \nsuch request.\n    ``(3) Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the \nSecretary to conduct inspections otherwise permitted under this Act in \norder to ensure compliance with this Act.\n    ``(4)(A) Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \nsubsection, the Secretary shall issue draft guidance that--\n            ``(i) specifies how the Food and Drug Administration will \n        implement the process described in paragraph (1) and the \n        requirements described in paragraph (2);\n            ``(ii) provides for standardized templates for \n        communications described in such paragraphs;\n            ``(iii) establishes a standard timeframe over consecutive \n        days that is applicable to both domestic and foreign \n        inspections, to which each inspector shall adhere unless an \n        investigator can identify to the establishment a reason that \n        more time is needed; and\n            ``(iv) identifies practices for investigators and device \n        establishments to facilitate the continuity of inspections.\n    ``(B) Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this \nsubsection, after notice and opportunity for public comment on the \ndraft guidance described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall issue \nfinal guidance consistent with this subsection.''.\n\nSEC. 4.
