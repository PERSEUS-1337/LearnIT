FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the College Board, that the average \n        student at a 4-year university spent an estimated $1,222 per \n        year on college books and supplies.\n            (2) According to the National Association of College \n        Stores, the gross margin on new college textbooks was 25.6 \n        percent in 2012.\n            (3) The Government Accountability Office has found that \n        college textbook prices have risen at twice the rate of annual \n        inflation over the last two decades and that new textbook \n        prices increased 82 percent over the last decade.\n            (4) An open source material project that would make high \n        quality educational materials freely available to the general \n        public would reduce college textbook costs and increase \n        accessibility to such education materials.\n            (5) College-level open source course work materials in \n        math, physics, and chemistry represent a high-priority first \n        step in this area.\n            (6) The scientific and technical workforce at Federal \n        agencies, national laboratories, and federally funded research \n        and development centers could make a valuable contribution to \n        this effort.\n            (7) A Federal oversight role in the creation and \n        maintenance of standard, publicly vetted textbooks is desirable \n        to ensure that intellectual property is respected and that \n        public standards for quality, educational effectiveness, and \n        scientific accuracy are maintained.\n\nSEC. 3. OPEN SOURCE MATERIAL PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the Director shall begin development of college freshman-\nlevel, high quality, open source materials that--\n            (1) contain, at minimum, a comprehensive set of textbooks \n        or other educational materials covering topics in physics, \n        chemistry, and calculus;\n            (2) are posted on the Federal Open Source Material Website; \n        and\n            (3) are free of copyright violations.\n    (b) Posting Deadline.--Not later than 4 years after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Director shall have posted the materials \ndescribed in subsection (a) on the Federal Open Source Material \nWebsite.\n    (c) Screening Procedures.--Before publishing materials on the \nFederal Open Source Material Website, the Director shall, in \ncollaboration with the agencies described in section 5(b), develop, \nimplement, and establish procedures for checking the veracity, \naccuracy, and educational effectiveness of open source materials.\n\nSEC. 4.
