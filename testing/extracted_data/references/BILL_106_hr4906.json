FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Over 90 percent of United States companies engaged in \n        manufacturing are small and medium-sized businesses.\n            (2) Most of these manufacturers produce goods for \n        assemblage into products of large companies.\n            (3) The emergence of the World Wide Web and the \n        promulgation of international standards for product data \n        exchange greatly accelerated the movement toward electronically \n        integrated supply chains during the last half of the 1990's.\n            (4) A major Wall Street firm recently estimated that the \n        adoption of electronic commerce-based supply chains in various \n        manufacturing industries can reduce business costs from 10 \n        percent to 40 percent.\n            (5) European and Asian countries are investing heavily in \n        electronic enterprise standards development, and in preparing \n        their smaller manufacturers to do business in the new \n        environment. European efforts are well advanced in the \n        aerospace, automotive, and shipbuilding industries and are \n        beginning in other industries including home building, \n        furniture manufacturing, textiles, and apparel.\n            (6) If United States manufacturers are to remain \n        competitive, they must match their overseas competition by \n        making sure that standards, including application protocols, \n        developed for electronic business in their industry worldwide \n        reflect their needs and the needs of their customers and \n        suppliers.\n            (7) Many American small and medium-sized manufacturers run \n        the risk of losing their largest customers during the first \n        half of this decade unless they adopt computer aided design, \n        engineering, and manufacturing systems in their work places and \n        learn how to participate with customers and suppliers in \n        integrated electronic enterprises.\n            (8) Application protocols are very complex standards, often \n        running thousands of pages, and require the cooperation of \n        entire industries for their development.\n            (9) The National Institute of Standards and Technology, \n        because of the electronic commerce expertise in its \n        laboratories and quality program, its long history of working \n        cooperatively with manufacturers, and the nationwide reach of \n        its manufacturing extension program, is in a unique position to \n        help United States large and smaller manufacturers alike in \n        their responses to this challenge.\n            (10) It is, therefore, in the national interest for the \n        National Institute of Standards and Technology to accelerate \n        its efforts--\n                    (A) in helping major manufacturing industries \n                develop standards and enterprise integration processes \n                that are necessary to increase efficiency and lower \n                costs; and\n                    (B) in making sure that every small or medium-sized \n                manufacturer has the option of upgrading its \n                manufacturing capabilities to the point where it can be \n                part of an electronic supply chain of a major \n                manufacturing industry.\n\nSEC. 3. ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Director shall establish an initiative for \nadvancing enterprise integration within the United States. In carrying \nout this section, the Director shall involve, as appropriate, the \nvarious units of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nincluding the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nlaboratories, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program \nestablished under sections 25 and 26 of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278k and 278l), and the Malcolm \nBaldrige National Quality Program. This initiative shall begin with \nproduct data management and build upon ongoing efforts of the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology and of the private sector, shall \ninvolve consortia that include government and industry, and shall be \ndesigned to permit enterprise integration in each United States major \nmanufacturing industry at the earliest possible date.\n    (b) Assessment.--The Director shall work to identify all enterprise \nintegration standards and implementation activities for major \nmanufacturing industries underway in the United States and abroad. For \neach major manufacturing industry, the Director shall work with \nindustry representatives and organizations currently engaged in \nenterprise integration activities and other appropriate representatives \nas necessary. They shall assess the current state of enterprise \nintegration within the industry, identify the remaining steps in \nachieving enterprise integration, and work toward agreement on the \nroles of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and of the \nprivate sector in that process. Within 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Director shall report to the Congress on \nthese matters and on anticipated related National Institute of \nStandards and Technology activities for the then current fiscal year.\n    (c) Plans and Reports.--Within 180 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Director shall submit to the Congress a plan \nfor enterprise integration for each major manufacturing industry, \nincluding milestones for the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology portion of the plan, the dates of likely achievement of \nthose milestones, and anticipated costs to the Government and industry \nby fiscal year. Updates of the plans and a progress report for the past \nyear shall be submitted annually until for a given industry, in the \nopinion of the Director, enterprise integration has been achieved.\n    (d) Authorized Activities.--In order to carry out this Act and the \nplans prepared under subsection (c), the Director may--\n            (1) work with companies and trade associations within a \n        major manufacturing industry to raise awareness of enterprise \n        integration activities in the United States and abroad, \n        including convening meetings;\n            (2) work with an industry on the development of enterprise \n        integration roadmaps;\n            (3) support the development, testing, promulgation, and \n        adoption of standards, including application protocols;\n            (4) support the development, promulgation, integration, and \n        upgrading of standards related to enterprise integration;\n            (5) support pilot projects that include small and medium-\n        sized businesses for new standards and enterprise integration;\n            (6) ensure the training and regular upgrading of skills of \n        Manufacturing Extension Program employees;\n            (7) develop tool kits and employee training materials and \n        take other steps necessary to permit small and medium-sized \n        businesses to participate in an integrated enterprise; and\n            (8) set up mechanisms to permit the various Manufacturing \n        Extension Program centers to access expertise and materials \n        from each other.\n\nSEC. 4.
