FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Political stability and economic growth in Indonesia \n        are important to the national interests of the United States, \n        however, such stability and growth are disrupted by the denial \n        by the Government of Indonesia, including the denial by the \n        armed forces of Indonesia, of--\n                    (A) democratic freedoms, such as meaningful \n                elections, freedom of the press, and freedom of \n                assembly;\n                    (B) human rights, such as protection from torture \n                and murder and protection from imprisonment for the \n                nonviolent expression of political views;\n                    (C) labor rights; and\n                    (D) the rights of citizens to participate in \n                decisions affecting the environment.\n            (2) The Government of Indonesia is in a period of crisis, \n        as illustrated by--\n                    (A) the extensive violations of human rights by the \n                Government of Indonesia documented in the Department of \n                State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for \n                1996;\n                    (B) the suppression of peaceful dissent and extreme \n                interference by the government with the media;\n                    (C) the deposing of Megawati Sukarnoputri as the \n                head of the Democratic Party of Indonesia (PDI) in \n                1996; and\n                    (D) the rating by Transparency International of the \n                Government of Indonesia as one of the most corrupt \n                governments in the world.\n            (3) The armed forces of Indonesia play a key role in \n        preserving nondemocratic rule in Indonesia by deploying forces \n        at all levels of society to repress peaceful dissent and by \n        participating in nonmilitary economic ventures that are not \n        subject to public scrutiny or reported as sources of income to \n        international financial institutions.\n            (4) The parliamentary elections in Indonesia scheduled for \n        May 1997 may be jeopardized by the actions of the Government of \n        Indonesia, including the actions of the armed forces of \n        Indonesia, because the Government has repeatedly rendered past \n        elections meaningless by denying constitutionally-guaranteed \n        political rights to opposition candidates and their supporters.\n            (5) The Government of Indonesia recognizes only one \n        official trade union, has refused to register independent trade \n        unions such as the Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union (SBSI), \n        has arrested Mukhtar Pakpahan, the General Chairman of the \n        SBSI, on charges of subversion, and has closed the offices and \n        confiscated the materials of the SBSI.\n            (6) Civil society organizations in Indonesia, such as \n        environmental organizations, indigenous organizations, \n        election-monitoring organizations, legal aid organizations, \n        student organizations, trade union organizations, and community \n        organizations, have been harassed by the Government of \n        Indonesia through such means as detentions, interrogations, \n        denial of permission for meetings, banning of publications, \n        repeated orders to report to security forces or judicial \n        courts, and illegal seizure of documents.\n            (7) The armed forces of Indonesia continue to occupy East \n        Timor in violation of two United Nations Security Council \n        resolutions and eight United Nations General Assembly \n        resolutions, and according to the Department of State's Country \n        Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1996, the armed forces \n        continue to carry out torture and killings and other severe \n        violations of human rights in East Timor, and to detain and \n        imprison East Timorese for nonviolent expression of political \n        views.\n            (8)(A) The Nobel Prize Committee has awarded the 1996 Nobel \n        Peace Prize to Bishop Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo and Jose Ramos \nHorta for their tireless efforts to find a just and peaceful solution \nto the conflict in East Timor.\n            (B) Both men are an inspiration for those who desire peace \n        in East Timor.\n            (9) As stated in a citation for the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, \n        ``it has been estimated that one-third of the population of \n        East Timor has lost their lives due to starvation, epidemics, \n        war, and terror''.\n            (10) The people of East Timor have been forcibly deprived \n        of their right to self-determination by the refusal of the \n        Government of Indonesia to work with the United Nations to \n        resolve the political status of East Timor.\n            (11) In August 1993, the Indonesian military committed to a \n        reduction in the number of combat troops in East Timor.\n            (12) On August 1, 1996, former Secretary of State Warren \n        Christopher stated in testimony before the Committee on Foreign \n        Relations of the Senate, ``I think there's a strong interest in \n        seeing an orderly transition of power there [in Indonesia] that \n        will recognize the pluralism that should exist in a country of \n        that magnitude and importance''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote a peaceful \ntransition from nondemocratic to democratic rule in Indonesia by \nconditioning the provision of United States military assistance to the \nGovernment of Indonesia, including the armed forces of Indonesia, on \nthe establishment and implementation of specific democratic reforms.\n\nSEC. 3.
