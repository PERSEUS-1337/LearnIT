FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On February 22, 2014, the United Nations Security \n        Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2139 recognizing the \n        escalating level of violence in Syria.\n            (2) Credible sources estimate the death of more than \n        140,000 people in Syria, including 10,000 children.\n            (3) On February 27, 2014, the Department of State issued \n        its 2013 Human Rights Report on Syria, which described \n        President Bashar al Assad's use of ``indiscriminate and deadly \n        force'' in the conflict, including the August 21, 2013, use of \n        ``sarin gas and artillery to target East Ghouta and Moadamiya \n        al-Sham, suburbs of Damascus, which killed over 1,000 people.''\n            (4) The United Nations Independent International Commission \n        of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic reports that pro-\n        government forces have conducted attacks on Syrian civilian \n        populations, and have utilized murder, torture, assault, and \n        rape as war tactics. Anti-government groups have also committed \n        murder and torture, engaged in hostage-taking, attacked \n        protected objects, and shelled civilian neighborhoods.\n            (5) Internationally accepted rules of war require actors to \n        distinguish between civilians and combatants and that all \n        parties adhere to the principle of medical neutrality whereby \n        both sides ensure unhindered access to medical care.\n\nSEC. 3.
