FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Sexual and reproductive health problems account for an \n        estimated 10 percent of the total global burden of disease and \n        32 percent of the burden among women of reproductive age.\n            (2) More than four in 10 of the world's pregnant women \n        still have no access to skilled care at childbirth. Every \n        minute, a woman somewhere dies in pregnancy or childbirth--\n        529,000 deaths a year. Ninety-five percent of maternal deaths \n        occur in Africa and Asia while fewer that one percent occur in \n        the more developed regions of the world.\n            (3) A million or more children are left motherless each \n        year as a result of maternal mortality. These children are \n        three to 10 times more likely to die within two years than \n        children who live with both parents. Almost half of infant \n        deaths per year result from poor maternal health and inadequate \n        delivery care.\n            (4) Roughly 201 million women in low-income countries would \n        use safe, effective contraceptive methods but such methods are \n        not available to such women, including 25 percent of married \n        women in sub-Saharan Africa. If these women had access to \n        reliable family planning services, approximately 52 million \n        unplanned pregnancies would be avoided in the developing world \n        every year, resulting in 23 million unplanned births, 22 \n        million induced abortions, 7 million spontaneous abortions, 1.4 \n        million infant deaths, 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths, and \n        505,000 children from losing their mothers.\n            (5) Each day 14,000 people are infected with HIV. One-half \n        of all new HIV infections occur in women. In some places women \n        are six times more likely to be infected than men.\n            (6) Access to voluntary family planning services, including \n        contraception, is essential in helping to reduce the number of \n        unintended pregnancies and, consequently, the incidence of \n        abortion.\n            (7) In the process of helping women to achieve their \n        childbearing goals, enormous amounts of government funds are \n        saved. A study in Mexico found that for every peso the Mexican \n        social security system spent on voluntary family planning \n        services between 1972 and 1984, it saved nine pesos in expenses \n        for treating complications of unsafe abortions and providing \n        maternal and infant care. Every dollar invested in Thailand's \n        voluntary family planning program saved the Thai Government \n        more than $16.\n            (8) The growing global population and its consumption \n        patterns have profound consequences for the global environment, \n        including species extinction, deforestation, desertification, \n        climate change, and the destruction of natural ecosystems. \n        These global environmental impacts pose a significant threat to \n        the earth's sustainability and impact the quality of life of \n        humans in all regions of the world.\n            (9) Demographic factors have been found to be linked to an \n        increased likelihood of the outbreak of civil conflict during \n        the 1990s. Countries in which young adults comprised more than \n        40 percent of the adult population were more than twice as \n        likely as countries with lower proportions of young adults to \n        the overall adult population to experience an outbreak of civil \n        conflict.\n            (10) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) was created \n        in 1969 with the support and assistance of the United States \n        Government. Today, UNFPA is the largest multilateral source of \n        funding, expertise, and programs targeted at voluntary family \n        planning, promotion of safe delivery, reduction of maternal and \n        infant mortality, and assisting women with sexual and \n        reproductive health needs during natural and man-made \n        emergencies. UNFPA also actively works to stop the spread of \n        HIV/AIDS and promote the rights, education, and livelihoods of \n        women in developing countries.\n            (11) UNFPA has family planning and reproductive health \n        programs in approximately 140 countries. The United States \n        Agency for International Development operates population \n        programs in about 60 countries.\n            (12) In 2006, 180 countries made financial contributions to \n        the UNFPA, including every nation in Latin America, the \n        Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. This represents an increase \n        from the 69 nations that made contributions in 1999. The United \n        States is the only developed nation not to make a contribution \n        to UNFPA, and the only nation to ever withhold contributions \n        for any reason other than budgetary considerations.\n            (13) United States funding has been withheld from UNFPA \n        since January 2002, despite the fact that Congress has \n        appropriated funds for UNFPA for every fiscal year since \n        January 2002 and the Administration's own Independent \n        Assessment Team of 2002 which found, ``[N]o evidence that UNFPA \n        has knowingly supported or participated in the management of a \n        program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in \n        the [People's Republic of China]. We therefore recommend that \n        not more than $34,000,000 which has already been appropriated \n        be released to UNFPA.''.\n            (14) UNFPA's pilot programs of assistance in China are \n        proving--as they were designed to--the advantages of voluntary, \n        informed, consent-based family planning over a top-down \n        administrative approach. In 32 countries that receive UNFPA \n        assistance, maternal deaths have declined, births with skilled \n        attendance have increased, knowledge of HIV/AIDS has risen, \n        knowledge of more than three modern contraceptives has risen, \n        knowledge of natural methods has increased, surgical \n        contraception has dropped, abortion rates have dropped from 24 \n        per 1,000 women to 10 per 1,000 women, home-based childbirths \n        have fallen, and choice of contraception by clients has grown.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \nStates Government should resume annual contributions to UNFPA to \nfacilitate the core mission of UNFPA to save and improve the lives of \nwomen, infants, and men and improve communities in foreign countries.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to provide financial and \nother support to the United Nations Population Fund to carry out \nactivities to save women's lives, limit the incidence of abortion and \nmaternal mortality associated with unsafe abortion, promote universal \naccess to safe and reliable family planning, and assist women, \nchildren, and men in developing countries to live better lives.\n\nSEC. 4.
