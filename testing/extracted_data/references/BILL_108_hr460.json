FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is an increasing threat of wildfire to millions \n        of acres of forest land and rangeland throughout the United \n        States;\n            (2) forest land and rangeland are degraded as a direct \n        consequence of land management practices (including practices \n        to control and prevent wildfires and the failure to harvest \n        subdominant trees from overstocked stands) that disrupt the \n        occurrence of frequent low-intensity fires that have \n        periodically removed flammable undergrowth;\n            (3) at least 39,000,000 acres of land of the National \n        Forest System in the interior West are at high risk of \n        wildfire;\n            (4) an average of 95 percent of the expenditures by the \n        Forest Service for wildfire suppression during fiscal years \n        1990 through 1994 were made to suppress wildfires in the \n        interior West;\n            (5) the number, size, and severity of wildfires in the \n        interior West are increasing;\n            (6) of the timberland in National Forests in the States of \n        Arizona and New Mexico, 59 percent of such land in Arizona, and \n        56 percent of such land in New Mexico, has an average diameter \n        of 9 to 12 inches diameter at breast height;\n            (7) the population of the interior West grew twice as fast \n        as the national average during the 1990s;\n            (8) efforts to prioritize forests and communities for \n        wildfire risk reduction have been inconsistent and insufficient \n        and have resulted in funding to areas that are not prone to \n        severe wildfires;\n            (9) catastrophic wildfires--\n                    (A) endanger homes and communities;\n                    (B) damage and destroy watersheds and soils; and\n                    (C) pose a serious threat to the habitat of \n                threatened and endangered species;\n            (10) a 1994 assessment of forest health in the interior \n        West estimated that only a 15- to 30-year window of opportunity \n        exists for effective management intervention before damage from \n        uncontrollable wildfire becomes widespread, with 8 years having \n        already elapsed since the assessment;\n            (11) following a catastrophic wildfire, certain forests in \n        the interior West do not return to their former grandeur;\n            (12) healthy forest and woodland ecosystems--\n                    (A) reduce the risk of wildfire to forests and \n                communities;\n                    (B) improve wildlife habitat and biodiversity;\n                    (C) increase tree, grass, forb, and shrub \n                productivity;\n                    (D) enhance watershed values;\n                    (E) improve the environment; and\n                    (F) provide a basis in some areas for economically \n                and environmentally sustainable uses;\n            (13) sustaining the long-term ecological and economic \n        health of interior West forests and woodland, and their \n        dependent human communities, requires preventing severe \n        wildfires before the wildfires occur and permitting natural, \n        low-intensity ground fires;\n            (14) more natural fire regimes cannot be accomplished \n        without the reduction of excess fuels and thinning of \n        subdorminant trees (which fuels and trees may be of commercial \n        value);\n            (15) ecologically-based forest and woodland ecosystem \n        restoration on a landscape scale will--\n                    (A) improve long-term community protection;\n                    (B) minimize the need for wildfire suppression;\n                    (C) improve resource values;\n                    (D) reduce rehabilitation costs;\n                    (E) reduce loss of critical habitat; and\n                    (F) protect forests for future generations;\n            (16) although the National Fire Plan, and the report \n        entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in Fire-\n        Adapted Ecosystems--A Cohesive Strategy'' (65 Fed. Reg. 67480), \n        advocate a shift in wildfire policy from suppression to \n        prevention (including restoration and hazardous fuels \n        reduction), Federal land managers are not dedicating sufficient \n        attention and financial resources to restoration activities \n        that simultaneously restore forest health and reduce the risk \n        of severe wildfire;\n            (17) although landscape scale restoration is needed to \n        effectively reverse degradation, scientific understanding of \n        landscape scale treatments is limited;\n            (18) the Federal wildfire research program is funded at \n        approximately 1/3 of the amount that is required to address \n        emerging wildfire problems, resulting in the lack of a cohesive \n        strategy to address the threat of catastrophic wildfires; and\n            (19) rigorous, understandable, and applied scientific \n        information is needed for--\n                    (A) the design, implementation, and adaptation of \n                landscape scale restoration treatments and improvement \n                of wildfire management technology;\n                    (B) the environmental review process; and\n                    (C) affected entities that collaborate in the \n                development and implementation of wildfire treatment.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n     The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to enhance the capacity to develop, transfer, apply, \n        and monitor practical science-based forest restoration \n        treatments that will reduce the risk of severe wildfires, and \n        improve forest and woodland health, in the interior West;\n            (2) to develop the practical scientific knowledge required \n        to implement forest and woodland restoration on a landscape \n        scale;\n            (3) to develop the interdisciplinary knowledge required to \n        understand the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of \n        wildfire control on ecosystems and landscapes;\n            (4) to require Federal agencies--\n                    (A) to use ecological restoration treatments to \n                reverse declining forest health and reduce the risk of \n                severe wildfires across the forest landscape;\n                    (B) to ensure that sufficient funds are dedicated \n                to wildlife prevention activities, including \n                restoration treatments; and\n                    (C) to monitor and use wildfire treatments based on \n                the use of adaptive ecosystem management;\n            (5) to develop, transfer, and assist land managers in \n        treating acres with restoration-based treatments and use new \n        management technologies (including the transfer of \n        understandable information, assistance with environmental \n        review, and field and classroom training and collaboration) to \n        accomplish the goals identified in--\n                    (A) the National Fire Plan;\n                    (B) the report entitled ``Protecting People and \n                Sustaining Resources in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems--A \n                Cohesive Strategy'' (65 Fed.
