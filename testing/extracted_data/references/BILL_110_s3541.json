DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) IDPs.--The term ``IDPs'' means internally displaced \n        people in Iraq.\n            (2) UNHCR.--The term ``UNHCR'' means the Office of the \n        United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n            (3) Vulnerable populations in iraq.--The term ``vulnerable \n        populations in Iraq'' includes IDPs, Iraqis from ethnically \n        mixed families, women at risk, unaccompanied children and \n        adolescents, the elderly, Iraqis with serious medical needs, \n        survivors of violence or torture, Iraqis who are members of \n        religious or other minority groups, including Chaldo Assyrian \n        Christians, Sabian Mandaens, Yazidis, Jews, and Baha'is, and \n        any other group determined to vulnerable by the Secretary of \n        State in consultation with the UNHCR.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, according to \n        the UNHCR, more than 2,000,000 Iraqis have fled their homes for \n        neighboring countries to avoid sectarian and other violence.\n            (2) According to the UNHCR, there are more than 2,700,000 \n        IDPs, many lacking adequate food, shelter, and other basic \n        services.\n            (3) The security situation in several locations within Iraq \n        reduces access to the Iraqi population by Iraqi Government \n        agencies and humanitarian aid providers and greatly limits the \n        provision of aid.\n            (4) The Iraq Study group predicted that ``[a] humanitarian \n        catastrophe could follow as more refugees are forced to \n        relocate across the country and the region.''.\n            (5) The dispersion of Iraqi refugees in poor urban areas of \n        host countries makes it exceedingly difficult for humanitarian \n        agencies to identify and reach these populations.\n            (6) Many Iraqis have put their lives and those of their \n        families at risk by working for the United States Government, \n        United States corporations, the United States media, and \n        nongovernmental organizations.\n            (7) Since March 2003, the United States has resettled less \n        than 20,000 Iraqi refugees, while Jordan and Syria have \n        provided temporary asylum to 2,000,000 Iraqis, and other \n        countries neighboring Iraq have received tens of thousands more \n        Iraqis.\n            (8) Since March 2003, Sweden has accepted 40,000 Iraqi \n        refugees, and Denmark evacuated and resettled 370 Iraqi \n        interpreters and other Iraqis who worked for Danish troops \n        prior to the Danish contingent's departure from Iraq in 2007.\n            (9) Current United States policies governing the processing \n        of refugees constrain United States Government agencies from \n        expediting the screening processes and increasing the number of \n        Iraqis accepted into the United States.\n            (10) The massive flow of Iraqi refugees into neighboring \n        host countries has overwhelmed existing social, economic, and \n        security capacities of such countries.\n            (11) While Iraqi refugees and IDPs are disproportionately \n        made up of vulnerable populations, many other segments of the \n        Iraqi population at large are also vulnerable.\n            (12) Increasing poverty and despair among displaced \n        populations may provide fertile ground for extremist ideologies \n        to take root and possible recruitment by extremist groups.\n            (13) The humanitarian crisis in Iraq and neighboring \n        countries threatens to destabilize the entire region.\n            (14) United States policy is to admit at least 50 percent \n        of the refugees referred by the UNHCR. In 2007, the UNHCR \n        referred more than 10,000 cases to the United States, and the \n        United States resettled 1,608 Iraqi refugees. The United States \n        has pledged to admit 12,000 Iraqi refugees during 2008.\n            (15) During 2008, the Government of Iraq has dedicated \n        $18,000,000 to its Ministry of Displaced and Immigration and \n        offered $25,000,000 to neighboring countries hosting Iraqi \n        refugees, even as the Government of Iraq is predicting it will \n        likely generate more than $32,000,000,000 in oil revenues \n        during 2008 alone.\n            (16) The United States has yet to disclose a long-term \n        comprehensive strategy to address humanitarian and security \n        crisis related to Iraqi refugees.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) Iraqi refugees and IDPs will have an impact on the \n        security of the region and the short- and long-term effects of \n        their displacement should be considered within overall United \n        States toward Iraq policy and be addressed at the highest \n        levels of Government;\n            (2) it is in the United States humanitarian and national \n        interests to demonstrate the United States commitment to \n        resettle Iraqi refugees and IDPs and the United States should \n        work with other governments, including the member states of the \n        Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to \n        encourage such governments to do the same; and\n            (3) the United States should express its gratitude and \n        support to host countries for providing humanitarian assistance \n        to Iraqi refugees and to countries that have already resettled \n        Iraqi refugees.\n\nSEC. 5. STATEMENTS OF POLICY.\n\n    The policy of the United States shall be the following:\n            (1) To lead an initiative to provide for the relief of \n        vulnerable populations in Iraq and Iraqi refugees in \n        neighboring countries and to take the lead in funding \n        assistance requests from the UNHCR, other humanitarian \n        agencies, and international organizations by funding at levels \n        well above the traditional United States share, and to assist \n        in the resettlement of Iraqi refugees.\n            (2) To develop immediately a long-term comprehensive \n        strategy for Iraq in coordination with the Government of Iraq \n        and host countries, the United Nations, and nongovernmental \n        organizations to meet the humanitarian and security needs of \n        Iraqi refugees and IDPs and to establish within the Executive \n        Office of the President a Special Coordinator for Iraqi \n        Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons to ensure expeditious \n        and effective implementation of such a strategy.\n            (3) To work with the Government of Iraq, the United \n        Nations, and nongovernmental organizations to help the \n        Government of Iraq improve its capacity and ability to provide \n        relief for vulnerable populations in Iraq in all communities \n        throughout Iraq and to provide assistance to Iraqi refugees in \n        neighboring countries.\n            (4) To commit to working with international partners, \n        including the United Nations, donor countries, international \n        financial institutions, international and indigenous \n        nongovernmental organizations, and other international \n        organizations to assist in providing for the emergency, medium-\n        , and long-term humanitarian needs of vulnerable populations in \n        Iraq and Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries.\n\nSEC. 6.
