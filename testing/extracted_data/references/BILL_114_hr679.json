FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 2009 report of the National Surface Transportation \n        Infrastructure Financing Commission recommends a transition \n        away from the fuel tax to a more stable funding source, noting \n        that a mileage-based fee system is the consensus choice for \n        policy leaders.\n            (2) The 2008 report of the National Surface Transportation \n        and Revenue Study Commission recommends further study of the \n        implementation of mileage-based fee systems at the State level \n        and of their compatibility with a national revenue system, \n        noting that in the long run, a mileage-based fee system seems \n        the most likely and appropriate method to be implemented.\n            (3) According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \n        revenue raised from the gas tax since its last increase in 1993 \n        has lost over one-third of its purchasing power due to \n        increasing fuel efficiency, changing transportation patterns, \n        and inflation.\n            (4) By 2030, the corporate average fuel economy standards \n        will have reduced Highway Trust Fund receipts by more than 20 \n        percent.\n            (5) The fuel tax revenue mechanism results in some \n        industries paying more than their commensurate road use.\n\nSEC. 3.
