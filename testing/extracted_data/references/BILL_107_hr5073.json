FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The length of time it takes to process immigration \n        applications within the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n        of the Department of Justice has created a serious national \n        security problem. This is demonstrated by the granting of \n        student visas to Mohamed Atta and Marwan Alshehhi six months \n        after their involvement in the World Trade Center bombings. The \n        mistake was attributed to delays in processing the paperwork, \n        huge backlogs of applicants, and antiquated computer systems.\n            (2) The INS currently has a backlog of immigration requests \n        estimated to be 5,000,000 applications.\n            (3) Currently 40 percent of all requests made to the INS to \n        obtain permanent resident status are filled out incorrectly. \n        This means that 40 percent of the files the INS receives must \n        be processed twice.\n            (4) There is currently no certified means of identifying \n        organizations that provide fair services. Many organizations \n        compete to sell immigration services to immigrants, but there \n        is no reliable way to distinguish between good and bad \n        information sources.\n            (5) It is estimated that in southern California, immigrants \n        often pay between $500 and $3,000 just to submit their \n        applications. At the low cost end, preparing a naturalization \n        application (form N-400) routinely costs about $500-$800. At \n        the high cost end, preparing the family-sponsored green card \n        application can cost between $2,000 and $3,000.\n            (6) President Clinton signed the Electronic Signatures in \n        Global and National Commerce Act into law in June of 2000, \n        making electronic signatures the legal equivalent of physical \n        signatures. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has implemented \n        electronic filing for sensitive tax information, requiring \n        verifiable electronic identification.\n            (7) The State Department is introducing a web-based arms \n        export license application system that will allow companies to \n        submit license applications and supporting technical documents, \n        blueprints, and other complex data over the Internet. This \n        information will be shared with the Commerce, Defense, and \n        Energy Departments. The State Department claims that this will \n        help strengthen inter-agency cooperation and cut down on \n        illegal arms trafficking.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to enhance the security \nprocedures and efficiency of the immigration, visa, border patrol, and \nnaturalization services of the United States Government by mandating \nthe implementation of an electronic application process utilizing \ncertified filing entities and e-file applications.\n\nSEC. 3.
