RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES FOR TRANSMISSION OF APPLICATIONS AND \n              RESCISSIONS.\n\n    The Congress recommends the following procedures to make uniform \nand simplify the process by which State legislatures make an \napplication, or a rescission of an application, under article V of the \nConstitution to call a convention for proposing amendments to the \nConstitution:\n            (1) Officers to transmit and receive applications.--After \n        the adoption by the legislature of a State of an application or \n        rescission, the secretary of state of the State, or if there be \n        no such officer, the person who is charged by the State law \n        with such function, should submit to Congress at least two \n        copies of the resolution or other measure containing the \n        application or rescission, one copy addressed to the President \n        of the Senate, and one copy to the Speaker of the House of \n        Representatives.\n            (2) Contents of resolution or measure.--Each copy of the \n        resolution or measure should contain--\n                    (A) its exact text, with the authenticating \n                signature of the relevant officer of the legislature; \n                and\n                    (B) the date on which the legislature adopted the \n                resolution or measure.\n            (3) Other forms of application or recision.--If a State \n        submits an application or rescission in a manner that is \n        inconsistent with this section, and the application or \n        rescission does not have an authenticating signature of a \n        member of the respective states legislature, the Clerk of the \n        House or the Secretary of the Senate shall confirm the \n        authenticity of the application or rescission through a search \n        of public records. If unable to confirm through a public \n        records search, the Clerk of the House or Secretary of the \n        Senate shall notify the appropriate State official and request \n        a letter from that State official, with the authenticating \n        signature of that State official, confirming the application or \n        rescission's authenticity.\n            (4) Noncompliance with the recommendations of this section \n        not a basis for congress to refuse to accept an application or \n        rescission.--The failure of a State legislature to comply with \n        any of the procedures recommended in this section is not a \n        basis for a refusal by Congress to accept or count an \n        application or rescission.\n\nSEC. 5.
