FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As part of the Food and Drug Administration's mission \n        to protect the public health, the Food and Drug Administration \n        approves generic drugs that help establish competitive markets \n        for treatments that improve the lives of millions of patients \n        in the United States.\n            (2) Rising health care costs, including prescription drug \n        costs, continue to be a major concern for patients in the \n        United States.\n            (3) Eighty-eight percent of prescription drugs dispensed in \n        the United States, or nearly 9 out of every 10 prescriptions \n        dispensed, are generic drugs.\n            (4) Studies suggest that generic drugs account for only 28 \n        percent of total prescription drug spending and were \n        responsible for $1,680,000,000,000 in estimated savings over \n        the period of 2005 to 2014.\n            (5) Increasing generic competition can be an effective way \n        to help keep prescription drug costs low for patients, the \n        health care system, and Federal and State government.\n            (6) Despite enactment of the Generic Drug User Fee \n        Amendments of 2012 (21 U.S.C. 379j-41 et seq.), which was \n        established to provide the Food and Drug Administration with \n        industry funding to ensure a more consistent timeline for \n        generic drug approvals, a significant backlog of abbreviated \n        new drug applications for generic drugs remains.\n            (7) The sudden, aggressive price hikes for a variety of \n        recently acquired off-patent drugs that have been used widely \n        for decades, for which there is no generic drug competitor, \n        also affects access to affordable prescriptions for patients \n        and the overall cost of health care in the United States.\n            (8) Improving the review of abbreviated new drug \n        applications and the approval of generic drugs would help to \n        improve competition and lower prices for patients.\n            (9) Establishing a clear timeframe for the Food and Drug \n        Administration to expedite the review of certain applications \n        for generic drugs would also help keep drug prices down and \n        improve timely access for patients.\n\n          TITLE I--REMOVING REGULATORY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION\n\nSEC. 101. IMPROVING GENERIC ACCESS.\n\n    Section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \nU.S.C. 355(j)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(11)(A) The Secretary shall prioritize the review, and act not \nlater than 150 calendar days after the date of the submission of an \napplication, on an application that has been submitted for review under \nthis subsection, or on a supplement to such an application, that is for \na drug that--\n            ``(i) has been introduced into interstate commerce by not \n        more than one manufacturer or sponsor, as applicable, in the \n        last 3 months and with respect to which tentative approval \n        under paragraph (5) has been granted for not more than 2 \n        applications; or\n            ``(ii) has been included on the list under section 506E.\n    ``(B) The fees pursuant to section 744B(a)(3) shall be waived with \nrespect to an application described in subparagraph (A), unless such \napplication contains a certification under paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV).\n    ``(C) The Secretary may expedite an inspection or reinspection \nunder section 704 of an establishment that proposes to manufacture a \ndrug described in subparagraph (A).''.\n\nSEC. 102.
