FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) although prescription drugs represent one of the most \n        frequently used medical care interventions in treating common \n        acute and chronic diseases, many Americans, especially the \n        elderly and other vulnerable populations, are unable to afford \n        their medication because of excessive and persistent drug price \n        inflation;\n            (2) between 1985 and 1991, the prices of the 20 top selling \n        prescription drugs, which account for almost a third of \n        prescription sales, rose 79 percent--nearly 4 times the general \n        rate of inflation;\n            (3) prescription drug manufacturers continue to make \n        enormous profits on the backs of the elderly, poor, and other \n        vulnerable populations that are unable to afford their \n        medications;\n            (4) because of the limited availability of private or \n        public prescription drug coverage for the elderly, prescription \n        drugs represent the highest out-of-pocket medical care cost for \n        3 of 4 elderly patients, surpassed only by the cost of long-\n        term care services;\n            (5) individuals over the age of 65 fill an average of 15 \n        prescriptions a year to treat chronic health conditions \n        compared to an annual average of 5 prescriptions for those \n        under the age of 65;\n            (6) 90 percent of Americans who are 60 years of age or \n        older take one or more medications daily;\n            (7) The United States spends several billion dollars on \n        biomedical and related health research and in 1994 the United \n        States spent $33 billion on such research and the \n        pharmaceutical industry only spent $14 billion on such research \n        in such year; and\n            (8) The pharmaceutical industry makes large profits off of \n        the sale of drugs produced from the benefit of research paid \n        for by the United States and, aside from royalties, none of \n        such profits are reimbursed back to the United States \n        taxpayers.\n\nSEC. 3. PRESCRIPTION DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n    The Public Health Service Act is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n\n          ``TITLE XXVIII--PRESCRIPTION DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n``SEC. 2801.
