FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Growing numbers of children live in an environment of \n        social and economic conditions that greatly increase their risk \n        of academic failure when they become students.\n            (2) Many academically at-risk students suffer the effects \n        of inadequate nutrition and health care, lack of child care, \n        overcrowded and unsafe living conditions and homelessness, \n        family and gang violence, substance abuse, sexual abuse and \n        child abuse, involuntary migration and limited English \n        proficiency that often create severe barriers to learning the \n        knowledge and skills needed to become literate, independent and \n        productive citizens.\n            (3) Almost half of all children and youths live in a single \n        parent family for some period of their lives, while many others \n        live in families with two full-time working parents, greatly \n        reducing parental involvement in their education.\n            (4) Services for at-risk students are often fragmented, \n        inconvenient, expensive, overregulated, ineffective and \n        duplicative, and focused on only a single narrow problem \n        without meeting the needs of the child and the family.\n            (5) School personnel, parents, and support service \n        providers often lack knowledge of, and access to, available \n        services for at-risk students and their families in the \n        community, are constrained by bureaucratic obstacles from \n        providing the services most needed, and have few resources or \n        incentives to coordinate services and make them accessible.\n            (6) Service providers, such as teachers, social workers, \n        health care and child care providers, juvenile justice workers \n        and others, are often trained in separate institutions, \n        practice in separate agencies, and pursue separate professional \n        activities that provide little support for coordination and \n        integration of services.\n            (7) Coordination and integration of services for at-risk \n        students emphasizing prevention and early intervention offer a \n        greater opportunity to break the cycle that leads to academic \n        failure, leaving school, low-skill levels, unemployment and low \n        income.\n            (8) Coordination of services is cost effective for schools \n        and support agencies because it reduces duplication, improves \n        quality of services, and substitutes prevention for expensive \n        crisis interventions, while ensuring that students are ready to \n        learn when they are in the classroom.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a program \nof grants to local education agencies to improve students' educational \nperformances by--\n            (1) removing barriers to their learning;\n            (2) coordinating and enhancing the effectiveness of support \n        services;\n            (3) making support services available, affordable, and \n        convenient for those who need them;\n            (4) replicating and disseminating successful high quality \n        coordinated service programs;\n            (5) increasing parental involvement in education;\n            (6) improving the capacity of school and support service \n        personnel to collaborate;\n            (7) integrating services, regulations, data bases, \n        eligibility procedures and funding sources whenever possible; \n        and\n            (8) focusing school and community resources on prevention \n        and early intervention strategies to address student needs and \n        to ensure that students are ready to learn when they are in the \n        classroom.\n\nSEC. 3.
