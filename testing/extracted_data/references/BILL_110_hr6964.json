FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) before acting on proposed Federal mandates, Congress \n        should carefully consider their effects on consumers, workers, \n        and small businesses;\n            (2) Congress has often acted without adequate information \n        concerning the costs of Federal mandates, instead focusing only \n        on their benefits;\n            (3) the implementation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n        of 1995 has resulted in increased awareness of \n        intergovernmental mandates without impacting existing \n        environmental, public health, or safety laws or regulations;\n            (4) the implementation of this Act will enhance public \n        awareness of prospective Federal mandates on the private \n        sector, State, local, and tribal governments without adversely \n        affecting the environment, public health, or safety laws or \n        regulations;\n            (5) the costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by consumers, in the form of higher prices and reduced \n        availability of goods and services;\n            (6) the costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by workers, in the form of lower wages, reduced benefits, \n        and fewer job opportunities; and\n            (7) the costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by small businesses, in the form of hiring disincentives \n        and stunted economic growth.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is--\n            (1) to improve the quality of Congress' deliberation with \n        respect to proposed mandates on the private sector, by--\n                    (A) providing Congress and the public with more \n                complete information about the effects of such \n                mandates; and\n                    (B) ensuring that Congress acts on such mandates \n                only after focused deliberation on their effects; and\n            (2) to enhance the ability of Congress and the public to \n        distinguish between Federal mandates that harm consumers, \n        workers, small businesses, State, local, and tribal governments \n        and mandates that help those groups.\n\nSEC. 4. APPLICATION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO POLICIES INVOLVING \n              CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OF GRANT AID.\n\n    Section 423(c) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended \nby striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (2), by striking the period \nand inserting ``; and'' at the end of paragraph (3), and by adding at \nthe end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(4) an assessment of the authorized level of funding to \n        determine if the prospective costs of carrying out changes to a \n        condition of Federal assistance being imposed on participating \n        State, local, or tribal governments, and how these costs \n        compare with the funds being authorized or, for \n        reauthorizations, of the additional costs of changes in those \n        conditions and how they compare with the changes in funding \n        being authorized; and in cases where a bill or joint resolution \n        provides such sums as are necessary, the assessment shall \n        contain an estimate of that amount.''.\n\nSEC. 5. EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF LEGISLATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO \n              INCLUDE INDIRECT COSTS.\n\n    (a) Indirect Costs.--Section 423(c) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 (as amended by section 4) is further amended--\n            (1) in its side heading, by inserting ``and Other Costs'' \n        after ``Mandates'' ; and\n            (2) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3), by \n        striking the period and inserting ``; and'' at the end of \n        paragraph (4), and by adding at the end the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(5) an identification and description of any reasonably \n        foreseeable indirect costs to State, local, or tribal \n        governments, or by the private sector, incurred as a result of \n        implementing the Federal mandate in the bill or joint \n        resolution.''.\n    (b) Definition.--Section 421 of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (10) through (13) as \nparagraphs (11) through (14), respectively and by adding after \nparagraph (9) the following new paragraph:\n            ``(10) Reasonably foreseeable indirect costs.--The term \n        `reasonably foreseeable indirect costs' means costs to the \n        affected entities resulting from implementation of a Federal \n        mandate other than their own direct costs to carry out any such \n        mandate. Such costs include lost income and secondary monetary \n        costs resulting from the Federal mandate.''.\n\nSEC. 6. EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO \n              INCLUDE INDIRECT COSTS.\n\n    Section 202(a) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 is \namended by striking ``the expenditure by'' and inserting ``direct or \nreasonably foreseeable indirect costs to''.\n\nSEC. 7.
