FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) in 1996, Congress enacted and the President signed into \n        law the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was intended to \n        provide a procompetitive, deregulatory framework designed to \n        facilitate the continuing transition to a more competitive \n        communications market;\n            (2) since the enactment and implementation of the \n        Telecommunications Act of 1996, rapid advances in technology \n        and marketplace developments have further increased the \n        existence of competition in all communications markets and the \n        likelihood of the continuing existence and increasing intensity \n        of competition;\n            (3) competition in a dynamic communications marketplace is \n        the most effective and efficient means for protecting consumers \n        and enhancing the consumer welfare of all the people of the \n        United States in terms of achieving the optimum mix of price, \n        quality, and consumer choice; and\n            (4) unnecessary regulation regarding protection of \n        consumers and enhancement of consumer welfare deters--\n                    (A) investment in new and advanced communications \n                facilities; and\n                    (B) the development of new services and \n                applications.\n    (b) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States \nGovernment--\n            (1) to promote the widespread availability of \n        communications services for all Americans in order to assure \n        that the American people have access to a diversity of \n        information sources necessary for democratic government;\n            (2) to promote the integrity, reliability, and efficiency \n        of communications facilities in a manner consistent with--\n                    (A) the encouragement of investment in advanced \n                communications networks; and\n                    (B) innovation in communications services and \n                applications;\n            (3) that economic regulation of communications markets \n        should be presumed unnecessary absent circumstances that \n        demonstrate the existence of a significant threat of abuse of \n        market power that poses a substantial and nontransitory risk to \n        consumer welfare; and\n            (4) that in order to ensure that the actions of the Federal \n        Communications Commission are consistent with the findings in \n        subsection (a), and to effectuate the deregulatory policy \n        declared in this subsection, the decisions of the Commission \n        should be based on jurisprudential principles grounded in \n        market-oriented competition analysis such as those commonly \n        employed by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of \n        Justice in enforcing the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \n        U.S.C. 41 et seq.) and the antitrust laws of the United States.\n\nSEC. 4. PROHIBITION OF UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION.\n\n    (a) In General.--It shall be unlawful for any provider of \nelectronic communications service, including any State, or any general \npurpose political subdivision of a State, to engage or participate, or \nto attempt to engage or participate, in--\n            (1) unfair methods of competition in or affecting \n        electronic communications networks and electronic \n        communications services; or\n            (2) unfair or deceptive practices in or affecting \n        electronic communications networks and electronic \n        communications services.\n    (b) Rulemaking Authority.--\n            (1) In general.--The Commission may, by rule, define with \n        specificity, the acts or practices that shall constitute unfair \n        methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices \n        as described in subsection (a).\n            (2) Content of rules.--Rules promulgated under paragraph \n        (1) may include such requirements as the Commission determines \n        necessary to prevent any methods, acts, or practices prohibited \n        by this section.\n            (3) Limitation.--\n                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1) and \n                except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission \n                shall have no authority to issue rules that declare \n                unlawful an act or practice on the grounds that such \n                act or practice is an unfair method of competition or \n                unfair or deceptive act or practice.\n                    (B) Exception.--The Commission may declare an act \n                or practice unlawful if the Commission determines, \n                based on a showing of clear and convincing evidence \n                presented in a rulemaking proceeding, that--\n                            (i) marketplace competition is not \n                        sufficient to adequately protect consumer \n                        welfare; and\n                            (ii) such act or practice--\n                                    (I) causes or is likely to cause \n                                substantial injury to consumers; and\n                                    (II) is not--\n                                            (aa) avoidable by consumers \n                                        themselves; and\n                                            (bb) outweighed by \n                                        countervailing benefits to \n                                        consumers or to competition.\n            (4) Sunset of rules.--Any rule promulgated under paragraph \n        (1) shall terminate on the day that is 5 years after the date \n        on which such rule became effective unless the Commission, in a \n        proceeding in which the public is afforded notice and an \n        opportunity to comment, makes an affirmative determination, \n        based on a showing of clear and convincing evidence presented \n        in such proceeding, that the rule continues to be necessary \n        because marketplace competition is not sufficient to adequately \n        protect consumers from substantial injury which is not--\n                    (A) avoidable by consumers themselves; and\n                    (B) outweighed by countervailing benefits to \n                consumers or to competition.\n\nSEC. 5.
