    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Nicholas and Zachary Burt Memorial \nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced \n        by burning any fuel. Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon \n        monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a serious \n        health condition that could result in death.\n            (2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from motor \n        vehicles and the abnormal operation of fuel-burning appliances, \n        such as furnaces, water heaters, portable generators, and \n        stoves, kills more than 400 people each year and sends more \n        than 20,000 to hospital emergency rooms for treatment.\n            (3) Research shows that purchasing and installing carbon \n        monoxide alarms close to the sleeping areas in residential \n        homes and other dwelling units can help avoid fatalities.\n            (4) Congress should promote the purchase and installation \n        of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes and dwelling \n        units nationwide in order to promote the health and public \n        safety of citizens throughout the Nation.\n\nSEC. 3.
