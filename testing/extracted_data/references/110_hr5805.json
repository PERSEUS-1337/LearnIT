    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Zeroing In American Energy Act of \n2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Establishing a clean energy future requires new \n        innovative technologies.\n            (2) Solar energy offers the United States tremendous \n        domestic energy opportunities.\n            (3) The Southwestern United States is the Saudi Arabia of \n        solar energy.\n            (4) The publication Scientific American, in its January of \n        2008 issue, theorized a ``Grand Plan for Solar'' that suggests \n        theoretically solar power could provide 69 percent of America's \n        electricity by 2050.\n            (5) Establishing a new solar energy future will require a \n        strong public-private partnership.\n\nSEC. 3.
