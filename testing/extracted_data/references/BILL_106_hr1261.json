REVISION OF MEDICAID LIMITATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1917(b)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act \n(42 U.S.C. 1396p(b)(1)(C)) is amended--\n            (1) in clause (i), by inserting ``or clause (iii)'' after \n        ``such clause''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new clause:\n            ``(iii) In the case of an individual who receives medical \n        assistance under a State plan not described in clause (ii) of a \n        State which has a State plan amendment approved which provides \n        for the disregard of any assets or resources in the manner \n        described in such clause, clause (i) shall not apply to 75 \n        percent of the amounts of the assets or resources so \n        disregarded.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) take \neffect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. DISSEMINATING INFORMATION ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE POLICIES AND \n              MEDICARE COVERAGE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) As the baby boom generation begins to retire, funding \n        Social Security and Medicare will put a strain on the financial \n        resources of younger Americans.\n            (2) Medicaid was designed as a program for the poor, but in \n        many States Medicaid is being used for middle income elderly \n        people to fund long-term care expenses.\n            (3) In the coming decade, people over age 65 will represent \n        up to 20 percent or more of the population, and the proportion \n        of the population composed of individuals who are over age 85, \n        who are most likely to be in need of long-term care, may double \n        or triple.\n            (4) With nursing home care now costing $40,000 to $50,000 \n        on average per year, long-term care expenses can have a \n        catastrophic effect on families, wiping out a lifetime of \n        savings before a spouse, parent, or grandparent becomes \n        eligible for Medicaid.\n            (5) Many people are unaware that most long-term care costs \n        are not covered by Medicare and that Medicaid covers long-term \n        care only after the person's assets have been exhausted.\n            (6) Widespread use of private long-term care insurance has \n        the potential to protect families from the catastrophic costs \n        of long-term care services while, at the same time, easing the \n        burden on Medicaid as the baby boom generation ages.\n            (7) The Federal Government has endorsed the concept of \n        private long-term care insurance by establishing Federal tax \n        rules for tax-qualified policies in the Health Insurance \n        Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n            (8) The Federal Government has ensured the availability of \n        quality long-term care insurance products and sales practices \n        by adopting strict consumer protections in the Health Insurance \n        Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n    (b) Dissemination of Information.--\n            (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Social Security \n        Administration, in cooperation with the Administrator of the \n        Health Care Financing Administration, shall take all \n        appropriate steps to inform the public--\n                    (A) about the financial risks posed by rapidly \n                increasing long-term care costs and about the need for \n                families to plan for their long-term care needs; and\n                    (B) that Medicare does not cover most long-term \n                care costs and that Medicaid covers long-term care \n                costs only when the beneficiary has exhausted his or \n                her assets.\n            (2) Encouragement of employer-sponsored coverage.--The \n        Secretary of Labor, in cooperation with the Administrator of \n        the Health Care Financing Administration, shall take all \n        appropriate steps not only to encourage employers to offer \n        private long-term care insurance coverage to employees, but \n        also to encourage both working-aged people and older citizens \n        to obtain long-term care insurance either through their \n        employers or on their own."
