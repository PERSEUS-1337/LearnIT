WELCOME HOME VIETNAM VETERANS DAY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Vietnam War was fought in the Republic of South \n        Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, and involved North Vietnamese \n        regular forces and Viet Cong guerrilla forces in armed conflict \n        with United States Armed Forces, allies of the United States, \n        and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam;\n            (2) the United States Armed Forces became involved in \n        Vietnam because the United States Government wanted to provide \n        direct military support to the Government of South Vietnam to \n        defend itself against the growing Communist threat from North \n        Vietnam;\n            (3) members of the United States Armed Forces began serving \n        in an advisory role to the Government of the Republic of South \n        Vietnam in 1961;\n            (4) as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on August 2 \n        and 4, 1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf of Tonkin \n        Resolution (Public Law 88-408), on August 7, 1964, which \n        provided the authority to the President of the United States to \n        prosecute the war against North Vietnam;\n            (5) in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat units \n        arrived in Vietnam;\n            (6) by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United States \n        troops in Vietnam, and by 1969, a peak of approximately 543,000 \n        troops was reached;\n            (7) on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was signed, \n        which required the release of all United States prisoners-of-\n        war held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of all United \n        States Armed Forces from South Vietnam;\n            (8) on March 29, 1973, the United States Armed Forces \n        completed the withdrawal of combat units and combat support \n        units from South Vietnam;\n            (9) on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese regular forces \n        captured Saigon, the capitol of South Vietnam, effectively \n        placing South Vietnam under Communist control;\n            (10) more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed \n        Forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 \n        members of the Armed Forces were wounded;\n            (11) in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated \n        in the District of Columbia to commemorate those members of the \n        United States Armed Forces who died or were declared missing-\n        in-action in Vietnam;\n            (12) the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue among \n        the people of the United States and a conflict that caused a \n        generation of veterans to wait too long for the United States \n        public to acknowledge and honor the efforts and services of \n        such veterans;\n            (13) members of the United States Armed Forces who served \n        bravely and faithfully for the United States during the Vietnam \n        War were often wrongly criticized for the policy decisions made \n        by 4 presidential administrations in the United States;\n            (14) the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans \n        Day'' would be an appropriate way to honor those members of the \n        United States Armed Forces who served in South Vietnam and \n        throughout Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War; and\n            (15) March 29 would be an appropriate day to establish as \n        ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day''.\n    (b) Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day.--Chapter 1 of title 36, \nUnited States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 145.
