LIMITATION.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall restrict the right of a person or State \nto assert any claims against an association which may accrue under--\n            (1) section 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 2) for the \n        monopolization of trade by the association to such an extent \n        that the price of natural gas is unduly depressed or unduly \n        enhanced by reason thereof or by reason of a denial of access \n        to essential facilities,\n            (2) section 2 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 13) for undue \n        discrimination in price by the association,\n            (3) section 3 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 14) for \n        imposition of exclusive dealing arrangements by the \n        association, or\n            (4) any State common purchaser law, State common carrier \n        law, or State law enacted to prevent discrimination as to price \n        or access to market.\n\nSEC. 5.
