the amounts available \n        for obligation in a year under subsection (a), the Secretary, \n        acting through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & \n        Medicaid Services, shall pay the amount determined under \n        paragraph (2) directly to an eligible dually-certified facility \n        for the purpose of providing funding to reimburse such facility \n        for

(C), the payment amount determined under this paragraph \n                for a year for an eligible dually-certified facility \n                shall be an amount determined by the Secretary as \n

   such facility as reported on the facility's latest \n                available Medicare cost report.\n                    (C) Pro-rata reduction.--If the amount available \n                for obligation under subsection (a) for a year (as \n                reduced by allowable administrative costs under this \n                section) is insufficient to ensure that each eligible \n                dually-certified facility receives the amount of \n                payment calculated under subparagraph (A), the \n                Secretary shall reduce that amount of payment with \n                respect to each such facility in a pro-rata manner to \n                ensure that the entire amount available for such \n                payments for the year be paid.\n

facility's latest \n                available Medicare cost report, that is significantly \n                less (as determined by the Secretary) than the \n                allowable costs (as
