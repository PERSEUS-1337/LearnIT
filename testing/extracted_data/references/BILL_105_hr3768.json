FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children spend some \n        part of their day in child care.\n            (2) 54 percent of mothers with children between the ages of \n        0 and 3 years are in the work force. Labor force participation \n        rises to 63 percent for mothers with children under 6 years of \n        age.\n            (3) Every day 3 out of 5 preschoolers go to child care \n        centers or homes while their parents work.\n            (4) The number of single-parent households and 2-parent \n        households in which the single parent or both parents work is \n        increasing significantly.\n            (5) The availability of child care that is reliable, \n        convenient, and affordable helps parents to reach and maintain \n        self-sufficiency and is essential to making the transition from \n        welfare to work.\n            (6) Only an estimated 1 out of 10 eligible families receive \n        assistance in paying for child care from Federal funds.\n            (7) Full-day child care can cost between $4,000 and $9,000 \n        per year.\n            (8) In many instances, high quality child care services \n        cost little more than mediocre child care services. An \n        investment of only an additional 10 percent has been found to \n        have a significant impact on the quality of child care \n        services.\n            (9) Children placed in poor quality child care settings \n        have been found to have delayed language and reading skills, as \n        well as increased aggressive behavior toward other children and \n        adults.\n            (10) School based child care may utilize existing resources \n        such as art supplies, sports equipment, musical instruments, \n        and playgrounds to provide quality programs.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT \n              CARRY OUT QUALIFIED SCHOOL-BASED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS.\n\n    It is the sense of the Congress that local education agencies that \ncarry out qualified school-based child care programs should seek to \nbecome accredited child care centers and seek to hire credentialed \nchild care professionals.\n\nSEC. 4. GRANTS TO STATES FOR SCHOOL-BASED CHILD CARE.\n\n    Part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601-619) \nis amended by inserting after section 418 the following:\n\n``SEC. 418A.
