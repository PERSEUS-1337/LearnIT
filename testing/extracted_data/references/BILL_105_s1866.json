FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) There is increased emphasis on using evidence of \n        improved health care outcomes and cost effectiveness to justify \n        changes in our health care system.\n            (2) There is a growing movement to use health care quality \n        measures to ensure that health care services provided are \n        appropriate and likely to improve health.\n            (3) Few health care quality measures exist for children, \n        especially for the treatment of acute and chronic conditions.\n            (4) A significant number of children in the United States \n        have health problems, and the percentage of children with \n        special health care needs is increasing.\n            (5) Children in the health care marketplace have unique \n        health attributes, including a child's developmental \n        vulnerability, differential morbidity, and dependency on \n        adults, families, and communities.\n            (6) Children account for less than 15 percent of the \n        national health care spending, and do not command a large \n        amount of influence in the health care marketplace.\n            (7) The Federal government is the major payer of children's \n        health care in the United States.\n            (8) Numerous scientifically sound measures exist for \n        assessing quality of health care for adults, and similar \n        measures should be developed for assessing the quality of \n        health care for children.\n            (9) The delivery structures and systems that provide care \n        for children are necessarily different than systems caring for \n        adults, and therefore require appropriate types of quality \n        measurements and improvement systems.\n            (10) Improving quality measurement and monitoring will--\n                    (A) assist health care providers in identifying \n                ways to improve health outcomes for common and rare \n                childhood health conditions;\n                    (B) assist consumers and purchasers of health care \n                in determining the value of the health care products \n                and services they are receiving or buying; and\n                    (C) assist providers in selecting effective \n                treatments and priorities for service delivery.\n            (11) Because of the prevalence and patterns of children's \n        medical conditions, research on improving care for relatively \n        rare or specific conditions must be conducted across multiple \n        institutions and practice settings in order to guarantee the \n        validity and generalizability of research results.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) High priority areas.--the term ``high priority areas'' \n        means areas of research that are of compelling scientific or \n        public policy significance, that include high priority areas of \n        research identified by the Conference on Improving Quality of \n        Health Care for Children: An Agenda for Research (May, 1997), \n        and that--\n                    (A) are consistent with areas of research as \n                defined in paragraphs (1)(A) and (2) of section 1142(a) \n                of the Social Security Act;\n                    (B) are relevant to all children or to specific \n                subgroups of children; or\n                    (C) are consistent with such other criteria as the \n                Secretary may require.\n            (2) Local community.--The term ``local community'' means \n        city, county, and regional governments, and research institutes \n        in conjunction with such cities, counties, or regional \n        governments.\n            (3) Pediatric quality of care and outcomes research.--The \n        term ``pediatric quality of care and outcomes research'' means \n        research involving the process of health care delivery and the \n        outcomes of that delivery in order to improve the care \n        available for children, including health promotion and disease \n        prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation services, \n        including research to--\n                    (A) develop and use better measures of health and \n                functional status in order to determine more precisely \n                baseline health status and health outcomes;\n                    (B) evaluate the results of the health care process \n                in real-life settings, including variations in medical \n                practices and patterns, as well as functional status, \n                clinical status, and patient satisfaction;\n                    (C) develop quality improvement tools and evaluate \n                their implementation in order to establish benchmarks \n                for care for specific childhood diseases, conditions, \n                impairments, or populations groups;\n                    (D) develop specific measures of the quality of \n                care to determine whether a specific health service has \n                been provided in a technically appropriate and \n                effective manner, that is responsive to the clinical \n                needs of the patient, and that is evaluated in terms of \n                the clinical and functional status of the patient as \nwell as the patient's satisfaction with the care; or\n                    (E) assess policies, procedures, and methods that \n                can be used to improve the process and outcomes of the \n                delivery of care.\n            (4) Provider-based research networks.--The term ``provider-\n        based research network'' refers to 1 of the following which \n        exist for the purpose of conducting research:\n                    (A) A hospital-based research network that is \n                comprised of a sufficient number of children's \n                hospitals or pediatric departments of academic health \n                centers.\n                    (B) A physician practice-based research network \n                that is comprised of a sufficient number of groups of \n                physicians practices.\n                    (C) A managed care-based research network that is \n                comprised of a sufficient number of pediatric programs \n                of State-licensed health maintenance organizations or \n                other State certified managed care plans.\n                    (D) A combination provider-based research network \n                that is comprised of all or part of a hospital-based \n                research network, a physician practice-based research \n                network, and a managed care-based research network.\n            (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services.\n\nSEC. 4.
