SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Home Lead Safety \nTax Credit Act of 2003''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n            (1) Of the 98,000,000 housing units in the United States, \n        38,000,000 have lead-based paint.\n            (2) Of the 38,000,000 housing units with lead-based paint, \n        25,000,000 pose a hazard, as defined by Environmental \n        Protection Agency and Department of Housing and Urban \n        Development standards, due to conditions such as peeling paint \n        and settled dust on floors and windowsills that contain lead at \n        levels above Federal safety standards.\n            (3) Though the number of children in the United States ages \n        1 through 5 with blood levels higher than the Centers for \n        Disease Control action level of 10 micrograms per deciliter has \n        declined to 300,000, lead poisoning remains a serious, entirely \n        preventable threat to a child's intelligence, behavior, and \n        learning.\n            (4) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n        established a national goal of ending childhood lead poisoning \n        by 2010.\n            (5) Current Federal lead abatement programs, such as the \n        Lead Hazard Control Grant Program of the Department of Housing \n        and Urban Development, only have resources sufficient to make \n        approximately 7,000 homes lead-safe each year. In many cases, \n        when State and local public health departments identify a lead-\n        poisoned child, resources are insufficient to reduce or \n        eliminate the hazards.\n            (6) Approximately 15 percent of children are lead-poisoned \n        by home renovation projects performed by remodelers who fail to \n        follow basic safeguards to control lead dust.\n            (7) Old windows typically pose significant risks because \n        wood trim is more likely to be painted with lead-based paint, \n        moisture causes paint to deteriorate, and friction generates \n        lead dust. The replacement of old windows that contain lead \n        based paint significantly reduces lead poisoning hazards in \n        addition to producing significant energy savings.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage the safe \nremoval of lead hazards from homes and thereby decrease the number of \nchildren who suffer reduced intelligence, learning difficulties, \nbehavioral problems, and other health consequences due to lead-\npoisoning.\n\nSEC. 2. LEAD ABATEMENT TAX CREDIT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 \n(relating to foreign tax credit, etc.) is amended by adding at the end \nthe following new section:\n\n``SEC. 30B.
