FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Capture and long-term storage of carbon dioxide from \n        coal, natural gas, and biomass-fired power plants, as well as \n        from industrial sectors such as oil refining and production of \n        fertilizer, cement, and ethanol, can help protect the \n        environment while improving the economy and national security \n        of the United States.\n            (2) The United States is a world leader in the field of \n        carbon dioxide capture and long-term storage, as well as the \n        beneficial use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery \n        operations, with many manufacturers and licensors of carbon \n        dioxide capture technology based in the United States.\n            (3) While the prospects for large-scale carbon capture in \n        the United States are promising, costs remain relatively high. \n        Lowering the financing costs for carbon dioxide capture \n        projects would accelerate the deployment of this technology, \n        and if the captured carbon dioxide is subsequently sold for \n        industrial use, such as for use in enhanced oil recovery \n        operations, the economic prospects are further improved.\n            (4) Since 1968, tax-exempt private activity bonds have been \n        used to provide access to lower-cost financing for private \n        businesses that are purchasing new capital equipment for \n        certain specified environmental facilities, including \n        facilities that reduce, recycle, or dispose of waste, \n        pollutants, and hazardous substances.\n            (5) Allowing tax-exempt financing for the purchase of \n        capital equipment that is used to capture carbon dioxide will \n        reduce the costs of developing carbon dioxide capture projects, \n        accelerate their deployment, and, in conjunction with carbon \n        dioxide utilization and long-term storage, help the United \n        States meet critical environmental, economic, and national \n        security goals.\n\nSEC. 3. CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nis amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)--\n                    (A) in paragraph

subsection:\n    ``(n) Qualified Carbon Dioxide Capture Facility.--\n            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a)(16), the \n        term `qualified carbon dioxide capture facility'
