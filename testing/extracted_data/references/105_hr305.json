FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) rape and sexual assaults continue to be serious threats \n        to the safety of communities across America;\n            (2) sexual offenders are much more likely than any other \n        category of criminals to repeat their crimes again and again, \n        even after serving time in prison;\n            (3) the average rape sentence is just 10\\1/2\\ years, and \n        the average time served is half of that, approximately 5 years; \n        and\n            (4) repeat sexual offenders frequently strike in more than \n        one State and, while States have primary responsibility for the \n        prosecution of sexual offenders, the option of Federal \n        prosecution provides a needed additional tool to safeguard \n        communities victimized by these individuals.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) States should more seriously consider the relatively \n        high recidivism rate of sexual offenders when deciding whether \n        to plea bargain with a first-time sexual offender and whether \n        to grant parole to sexual offenders; and\n            (2) States should review their treatment and parole \n        supervision programs for sexual offenders to assure that these \n        programs are fulfilling their goals, and, if they are not, \n        these programs should be immediately replaced or abandoned.\n\nSEC. 3. FEDERAL JURISDICTION OVER RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES.\n\n    Section 2241 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding \nat the end the following:\n    ``(e) Punishment for Sexual Predators.--(1) Whoever, in a \ncircumstance described in paragraph (2) of this subsection--\n            ``(A) violates this section; or\n            ``(B) engages in conduct that would violate this section, \n        if the conduct had occurred in the special maritime and \n        territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and--\n                    ``(i) that conduct is in interstate or foreign \n                commerce;\n                    ``(ii) the person engaging in that conduct crossed \n                a State line with intent to engage in the conduct; or\n                    ``(iii) the person engaging in that conduct \n                thereafter engages in conduct that is a violation of \n                section 1073(1) with respect to an offense that \n                consists of the conduct so engaged in;\nshall be imprisoned for life.\n    ``(2) The circumstance referred to in paragraph (1) of this \nsubsection is that the defendant has previously been convicted of \nanother State or Federal offense for conduct which--\n            ``(A) is an offense under this section or section 2242 of \n        this title; or\n            ``(B) would have been an offense under either of such \n        sections if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or \n        territorial jurisdiction of the United States.''.\n\nSEC. 4. ADDITIONAL CONDITION FOR TRUTH IN SENTENCING GRANTS.\n\n    Section 20104 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \nof 1994 is amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) Additional Requirement.--A State is not eligible for a grant \nunder this section unless such State has provided assurances to the \nAttorney General that such State has in effect laws which allow the \ncourt to impose a sentence of life in prison without parole on a \ndefendant in a criminal case who is convicted of a State offense for \nconduct that--\n            ``(1) is an offense under section 2241 or 2242 of title 18, \n        United States Code; or\n            ``(2) would have been an offense under either of such \n        sections if the offense had occurred in the special maritime or \n        territorial jurisdiction of the United States;\nafter having previously been convicted of another State or Federal \noffense for conduct that was an offense described in paragraph (1) or \n(2).''.\n\nSEC. 5. STUDY OF PERSISTENT SEXUAL PREDATORS.\n\n    The National Institute of Justice, either directly or through \ngrant, shall carry out a study of persistent sexual predators. Not \nlater than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, such \nInstitute shall report to Congress and the President the results of \nsuch study. Such report shall include--\n            (1) a synthesis of current research in psychology, \n        sociology, law, criminal justice, and other fields regarding \n        persistent sexual offenders, including--\n                    (A) common characteristics of such offenders;\n                    (B) recidivism rates for such offenders;\n                    (C) treatment techniques and their effectiveness;\n                    (D) responses of offenders to treatment and \n                deterrence; and\n                    (E) the possibility of early intervention to \n                prevent people from becoming sexual predators; and\n            (2) an agenda for future research in this area."
