    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Teen Pregnancy Prevention, \nResponsibility, and Opportunity Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States has the highest teen-pregnancy rate \n        and teen birth rate in the western industrialized world, \n        costing the United States at least $7 billion annually.\n            (2) About one out of three of all young women in America \n        become pregnant before they reach the age of 20.\n            (3) Teen pregnancy has serious consequences for young \n        women, their children, and communities as a whole. Too-early \n        childbearing increases the likelihood that a young woman will \n        drop out of high school and that she and her child will live in \n        poverty.\n            (4) Statistically, the sons of teen mothers are more likely \n        to end up in prison. The daughters of teen mothers are more \n        likely to end up teen mothers too.\n            (5) Teens that grow up in disadvantaged economical, social, \n        and familial circumstances are more likely to engage in risky \n        behavior and have a child during adolescence.\n            (6) Teens with strong emotional attachments to their \n        parents are more likely to become sexually active at a later \n        age. Seven out of ten teens say that they are prepared to \n        listen to things parents thought they were not ready to hear.\n            (7) 78 percent of white and 70 percent of African American \n        teenagers report that lack of communication between a teenage \n        girl and her parents is frequently a reason a teenage girl has \n        a baby.\n            (8) One study found that the likelihood of teens having sex \n        for the first time increased with the number of unsupervised \n        hours teens have during a week.\n            (9) After-school programs reduce teen risky behavior by \n        involving teens in activities that provide alternatives to sex. \n        Teenage girls who play sports, for instance, are more likely to \n        delay sex and have fewer partners and less likely to become \n        pregnant.\n            (10) After-school programs help prevent teen pregnancy by \n        advancing good decision-making skills and providing teens \n        health education and positive role models in a supervised \n        setting.\n            (11) Eight in 10 girls and six in 10 boys report that they \n        wish they had waited until they were older to have sex.\n\nSEC. 3.
