FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) A growing body of evidence demonstrates that patient-\n        level financial barriers, including copayments and coinsurance \n        for medications, systematically reduce the use of high value \n        medical services.\n            (2) Empirical studies demonstrate that reductions in cost-\n        sharing can mitigate the adverse health consequences \n        attributable to cost related decreases in the utilization of \n        prescription medications and reduce aggregate medical \n        expenditures as a result.\n            (3) Financial barriers to prescription medications that are \n        of high value should be reduced or eliminated to increase \n        adherence to prescribed medication.\n            (4) Value-Based Insurance Design recognizes that medical \n        services and prescription medications differ in the clinical \n        benefit achieved and that patient out-of-pocket costs should be \n        adjusted according to the value of the services provided.\n            (5) The current ``one size fits all'' copayment or \n        coinsurance design for medications provided under the Medicare \n        program does not recognize the well-established value \n        differences in health outcomes produced by various medical \n        interventions.\n            (6) The establishment by Medicare of copayment and \n        coinsurance requirements for medications using Value-Based \n        Insurance Design will optimize clinical gains for each dollar \n        spent, which would be a benefit to seniors and a fiscally \n        responsible use of taxpayer dollars.\n\nSEC. 3.
