FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and \n        Competition Act of 1992, Congress stated its policy of \n        promoting competition in cable services and making available to \n        the public a diversity of views and information through cable \n        television and other video media.\n            (2) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress stated \n        its policy of securing lower prices and higher quality service \n        for American telecommunications consumers and encouraging the \n        rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.\n            (3) Notwithstanding the intent of Congress as expressed in \n        the 1992 Cable Act and the 1996 Telecommunications Act, in most \n        places throughout America, cable television system operators \n        still do not face effective competition from other providers of \n        multichannel video service.\n            (4) Absent effective competition, the market power \n        exercised by cable television operators enables them to raise \n        the price of cable service to consumers, and to control the \n        price and availability of cable programming services to other \n        multichannel video service providers.\n            (5) Direct Broadcast Satellite service has over 8 million \n        subscribers and constitutes the most significant competitive \n        alternative to cable television service. However, Direct \n        Broadcast Satellite Service currently suffers from a number of \n        statutory, regulatory, and technical barriers that keep it from \n        being an effective competitor to cable television in the \n        provision of multichannel video services. The most prominent of \n        these barriers is its inability to provide subscribers with \n        local television broadcast signals. Other barriers include the \n        higher cost consumers must pay for equipment, installation, and \n        additional equipment to receive service on additional \n        television sets.\n            (6) Permitting providers of direct broadcast satellite \n        service to retransmit local television signals to their \n        subscribers would greatly enhance the ability of direct \n        broadcast satellite service to compete effectively in the \n        provision of multichannel video services.\n            (7) Unlike cable television systems, providers of direct \n        broadcast satellite service cannot carry all local television \nbroadcast signals in all the local television markets they serve.\n            (8) It would be in the public interest for providers of \n        direct broadcast satellite service to fully comply with the \n        mandatory signal carriage rules at such time as terrestrial or \n        satellite-based technology enables them to do so. In the \n        interim, requiring full compliance with the mandatory signal \n        carriage rules would substantially harm the ability of direct \n        broadcast satellite service providers to compete in the \n        provision of multichannel video services and would not serve \n        the public interest.\n            (9) Local television broadcast licensees whose stations are \n        not carried by providers of direct broadcast satellite services \n        are entitled to be compensated for any demonstrable loss of \n        revenue that will result.\n            (10) Millions of subscribers to direct broadcast satellite \n        service currently receive the signals of network-affiliated \n        stations not located in these subscribers' local television \n        markets. In many cases, distant network signals may be these \n        subscribers' only source of network television service.\n            (11) Notwithstanding the prevalence of distant network \n        signals and their importance as a component of direct broadcast \n        satellite service to millions of subscribers, a recent ruling \n        by a federal district court will result in many subscribers \n        losing these signals, regardless of whether local network \n        signals are actually viewable off-air or not.\n            (12) Widespread carriage of distant network stations in \n        local network affiliates' markets can cause local affiliates to \n        lose audience share and revenues, which would in turn harm \n        their ability to serve their local community. Therefore, it \n        would best serve the public interest to ensure that distant \n        network stations are carried only where local network stations \n        cannot be received off-air.\n            (13) Abrupt termination of satellite carriers provision of \n        distant network signals would deprive direct broadcast \n        satellite subscribers of an important component of their \n        existing satellite television service, and have a severely \n        negative impact on the ability of direct broadcast satellite \n        service to compete effectively in the provision of multichannel \n        video services.\n            (14) It is in the public interest for direct broadcast \n        satellite subscribers who cannot receive acceptable over-the-\n        air service from their local network-affiliated stations to \n        continue to receive distant network signals for an interim \n        period sufficient to permit the Federal Communications \n        Commission to redefine those situations in which the permanent \n        carriage of distant network signals would be appropriate.\n            (15) Improving the ability of providers of direct broadcast \n        service to compete effectively in the provision of multichannel \n        video services by eliminating remaining statutory and \n        administrative barriers to competition would be consistent with \n        the intent of Congress as expressed in the terms of the 1992 \n        Cable Act and the 1996 Telecommunications Act.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to promote the growth of competition in \nthe provision of multichannel video services by expeditiously removing \ncertain statutory and regulatory barriers that prevent providers of \nDirect Broadcast Satellite Services from competing effectively with \ncable television systems.\n\nSEC. 4. MUST-CARRY FOR SATELLITE CARRIERS RETRANSMITTING TELEVISION \n              BROADCAST SIGNALS.\n\n    Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n\n``SEC. 337.

In any \n        proceeding on such a petition, the burden of proof shall lie \n        with the petitioner.\n            ``(4) Compensation limited to formula amount absent unusual \n        or compelling circumstances.--The Commission may not grant \n        compensation under this subsection for any projected revenue \n        loss except in accordance with the formula prescribed by the \n        Commission under paragraph (2) unless the Commission determines \n        that unusual or compelling circumstances warrant additional \n        compensation.\n            ``(5) Additional compensation.--If the petitioner shows \n        that the compensation determined under the formula would be \n        insufficient to enable the petitioner to operate in the public \n        interest, the Commission shall award additional compensation \n        under this section.\n            ``(6) Time limit for commission action.--The Commission \n        shall issue a decision on any petition filed under paragraph \n        (3) no later than 150 days after the petition is filed.\n    ``(e) Good Signal Required.--A local television broadcast station \neligible for carriage under subsection (b) shall be required to bear \nthe costs associated with delivering a good quality signal for \nretransmission by the satellite carrier.''.\n\nSEC. 5. CARRIAGE OF DISTANT NETWORK SIGNALS BY SATELLITE CARRIERS.\n\n    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to promote competition \nin the provision of multichannel video services by enabling direct \nbroadcast satellite providers to offer distant network signals to \nconsumers in areas receiving inadequate over-the-air reception of local \ntelevision signals.\n    (b) Continued Retransmission of Distant Network Signals.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, satellite carriers \nretransmitting the signal of a distant network station to households \nlocated within an area served by a local affiliate of the same network \nand receiving service as of July 10, 1998, shall not be required to \ndiscontinue carriage of the distant network station to such households \nprior to February 28, 1999. Nothing in this subsection is intended to \nmodify the duration of the license granted in section 119 of title 17, \nUnited States Code.\n    (c) Rulemaking Required.--The Federal Communications Commission \nshall complete a single rulemaking proceeding in which it shall rule on \nany petitions or similar matters regarding the definition of unserved \nareas or households. Any definition adopted by the Commission must \nconsist of an objective measure of a satisfactory signal obtainable by \nuse of generally-available off-air reception devices of the type used \nby the average viewer. The Commission shall complete this rulemaking \nproceeding within such time as to enable any rule change to become \neffective no later than February 28, 1999.\n    (d) No Remission of Penalty.--No action taken by the Commission \npursuant to subsection (c) shall indemnify any provider of direct \nbroadcast satellite service from any liability for any prior violation \nof section 119(a)(5)(D) of title 17, United States Code, or from the \nimposition of any penalty therefor.\n\nSEC. 6. RETRANSMISSION CONSENT.\n\n    (a) Amendments.--Section 325(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 \n(47 U.S.C. 325(b)) is amended--\n            (1) by striking the subsection designation and paragraphs \n        (1) and (2) and inserting the following:\n    ``(b)(1) No cable system or other multichannel video programming \ndistributor shall retransmit the signal of a broadcasting station, or \nany part thereof, except--\n            ``(A) with the express authority of the station;\n            ``(B) pursuant to section 614, in the case of a station \n        electing, in accordance with this subsection, to assert the \n        right to carriage under such section;
