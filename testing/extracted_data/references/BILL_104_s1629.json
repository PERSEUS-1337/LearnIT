FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n    (a) in most areas of governmental concern, State governments \npossess both the Constitutional authority and the competence to discern \nthe needs and the desires of the People and to govern accordingly;\n    (b) Federal laws and agency regulations, which have interfered with \nState powers in areas of State jurisdiction, should be restricted to \npowers delegated to the Federal Government by the Constitution;\n    (c) the framers of the Constitution intended to bestow upon the \nFederal Government only limited authority over the States and the \nPeople;\n    (d) under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, the powers not \ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by \nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the \npeople; and\n    (e) the courts, which have in general construed the Tenth Amendment \nnot to restrain the Federal Government's power to act in areas of state \njurisdiction, should be directed to strictly construe Federal laws and \nregulations which interfere with State powers with a presumption in \nfavor of State authority and against Federal preemption.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION.\n\n    (a) On or after January 1, 1997, any statute enacted by Congress \nshall include a declaration--\n            (1) that authority to govern in the area addressed by the \n        statute is delegated to Congress by the Constitution, including \n        a citation to the specific Constitutional authority relied \n        upon;\n            (2) that Congress specifically finds that it has a greater \n        degree of competence than the States to govern in the area \n        addressed by the statute; and\n            (3) if the statute interferes with State powers or preempts \n        any State or local government law, regulation or ordinance, \n        that Congress specifically intends to interfere with State \n        powers or preempt State or local government law, regulation, or \n        ordinance, and that such preemption is necessary.\n    (b) Congress must make specific factual findings in support of the \ndeclarations described in this section.\n\nSEC. 4. POINT OF ORDER.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Information required.--It shall not be in order in \n        either the Senate or House of Representatives to consider any \n        bill, joint resolution, or amendment that does not include a \n        declaration of Congressional intent as required under section \n        3.\n            (2) Supermajority required.--The requirements of this \n        subsection may be waived or suspended in the Senate or House of \n        Representatives only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of \n        the Members of that House duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n        vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate or House of \n        Representatives duly chosen and sworn shall be required to \nsustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on a point of order raised \nunder this subsection.\n    (b) Rule Making.--This section is enacted--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rule-making power of the Senate \n        and House of Representatives, and as such, it is deemed a part \n        of the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives, but is \n        applicable only with respect to the matters described in \n        sections 3 and 4 and supersedes other rules of the Senate or \n        House of Representatives only to the extent that such sections \n        are inconsistent with such rules; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the Constitutional right of \n        the Senate or House of Representatives to change such rules at \n        any time, in the same manner as in the case of any rule of the \n        Senate or House of Representatives.\n\nSEC. 5.

PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.\n\n    ``(a) No executive department or agency or independent agency shall \nconstrue any statutory authorization to issue regulations as \nauthorizing preemption of State law or local ordinance by rule-making \nor other agency action unless--\n            ``(1) the statute expressly authorizes issuance of \n        preemptive regulations; and\n            ``(2) the executive department, agency or independent \n        agency concludes that the exercise of State power directly \n        conflicts with the exercise of Federal power under the Federal \n        statute, such that the State statutes and the Federal rule \n        promulgated under the Federal statute cannot be reconciled or \n        consistently stand together.\n    ``(b) Any regulatory preemption of State law shall be narrowly \ntailored to achieve the objectives of the statute pursuant to which the \nregulations are promulgated and shall explicitly describe the scope of \npreemption.\n    ``(c) When an executive branch department or agency or independent \nagency proposes to act through rule-making or other agency action to \npreempt State law, the department or agency shall provide all affected \nStates notice and an opportunity for comment by duly elected or \nappointed State and local government officials or their designated \nrepresentatives in the proceedings.\n            ``(1) The notice of proposed rule-making must be forwarded \n        to the Governor, the Attorney General and the presiding officer \n        of each chamber of the Legislature of each State setting forth \n        the extent and purpose of the preemption. In the table of \n        contents of each Federal Register, there shall be a separate \n        list of preemptive regulations contained within that Register.\n    ``(d) Unless a final executive department or agency or independent \nagency rule or regulation contains an explicit provision declaring the \nFederal Government's intent to preempt State or local government powers \nand an explicit description of the extent and purpose of that \npreemption, the rule or regulation shall not be construed to preempt \nany State or local government law, ordinance or regulation.\n    ``(e) Each executive department or agency or independent agency \nshall publish in the Federal Register a plan for periodic review of the \nrules and regulations issued by the department or agency that preempt, \nin whole or in part, State or local government powers. This plan may be \namended by the department or agency at any time by publishing a \nrevision in the Federal Register.\n            ``(1) The purpose of this review shall be to determine \n        whether and to what extent such rules are to continue without \n        change, consistent with the stated objectives of the applicable \n        statutes, or are to be altered or repealed to minimize the \n        effect of the rules on State or local government powers.''.\n    (b) Any Federal rule or regulation promulgated after January 1, \n1997, that is promulgated in a manner inconsistent with this section \nshall not be binding on any State or local government, and shall not \npreempt any State or local government law, ordinance, or regulation.\n    (c) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 5 of \ntitle 5, United States Code, is amended by adding after the item for \nsection 559 the following:\n\n``560. Preemption of State Law.''.\n\nSEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    (a) No statute, or rule promulgated under such statute, enacted \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, shall be construed by courts \nor other adjudicative entities to preempt, in whole or in part, any \nState or local government law, ordinance or regulation unless the \nstatute, or rule promulgated under such statute, contains an explicit \ndeclaration of intent to preempt, or unless there is a direct conflict \nbetween such statute and a State or local government law, ordinance, or \nregulation, such that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently \nstand together.\n    (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any ambiguities in \nthis Act, or in any other law of the United States, shall be construed \nin favor of preserving the authority of the States and the People.\n    (c) If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any \nperson or circumstance, is held invalid, the validity of the remainder \nof the Act and the application of such provision to other persons and \ncircumstances shall not be affected thereby."
