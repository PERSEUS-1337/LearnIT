    "content": "In addition to the Senate and House of Representatives, the legislative branch bill typically funds Joint Items, including the Joint Economic Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, Office of the Attending Physician, and Office of Congressional Accessibility Services; Capitol Police; Office of Compliance (OOC); Congressional Budget Office (CBO); Architect of the Capitol (AOC); Library of Congress (LOC), including the Congressional Research Service (CRS); Government Publishing Office (GPO); Government Accountability Office (GAO); and Open World Leadership Center.  Table 1 provides information on the enacted funding levels provided for the legislative branch from FY2008 to FY2019. The table includes annual and supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and the FY2013 sequestration.   Figure 1 shows the distribution of budget authority across the legislative branch in FY2019.  Table 2 provides information on funding levels for the Senate, House of Representatives, and legislative branch agencies in recent years as well as the requested, House-passed, Senate-passed, and enacted levels for FY2019. The FY2019 legislative branch budget request of $4.960 billion was submitted on February 12, 2018, prior to the enactment of FY2018 funding on March 23, 2018. Agency assessments for FY2019 may subsequently have been revised\u2014for example, to account for items funded or not funded in the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Subsequent discussions may vary from the levels or language included in the budget request due to this timing. By law, the President includes the legislative branch request in the annual budget submission without change. The House passed H.R. 5895 , which contained funding for the legislative branch, on June 8, 2018.  The Senate passed H.R. 5895 , as amended ( S.Amdt. 2910 ), on June 25, 2018. The Senate agreed to the conference report ( H.Rept. 115-929 ) on H.R. 5895 on September 12, 2018. The House agreed to the conference report on September 13, 2018. H.R. 5895 was signed into law on September 21, 2018 ( P.L. 115-244 ; the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019). The President has no formal role in the development of the legislative branch budget request, even though it is included in the President's annual budget request documents.  By long-standing law and practice, the legislative branch request and any supplemental requests are submitted to the President and included in the budget without change. While the executive branch budget submissions generally involve interaction between an agency and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the legislative branch requests do not. The executive branch does not review or maintain documentation in support of the legislative branch requests.  Since FY1976, the legislative branch as a proportion of total discretionary budget authority has averaged approximately 0.40%. The maximum level, 0.48%, was in FY1995 and the minimum, 0.31%, was in FY2009. Discretionary budget authority is provided and controlled by the annual appropriations acts. Since FY1976, the legislative branch as a proportion of total budget authority has averaged 0.17%. The maximum level, 0.23%, was in FY1977, and the minimum, 0.11%, was in FY2017. Total budget authority includes both budget authority controlled by the annual appropriations acts and budget authority controlled by previous laws, including entitlements. No, salaries for Members of Congress are neither funded nor increased in the legislative branch bill.  Member salaries have been included as mandatory spending since FY1983, and the amount of potential Member pay adjustments is calculated pursuant to the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, which established a formula based on changes in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustment automatically takes effect unless (1) Congress statutorily prohibits the adjustment; (2) Congress statutorily revises the adjustment; or (3) the annual base pay adjustment of General Schedule (GS) federal employees is established at a rate less than the scheduled increase for Members, in which case the percentage adjustment for Member pay is automatically lowered to match the percentage adjustment in GS base pay. Members of Congress last received a pay adjustment in January 2009. Since then, the compensation for most Senators, Representatives, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico has been $174,000. The maximum potential January 2019 member pay adjustment was 2.3%, or $4,000. The FY2019 act included a provision prohibiting this adjustment. As in prior years, the Member pay adjustment prohibition was included in the legislation as introduced, and no separate votes were held on the pay issue. Although discussion of Member pay is often associated with appropriations bills, these bills do not contain language funding or increasing Member pay, and a prohibition on the automatic annual Member pay adjust ments could be included in any bill, or be introduced as a separate bill. For a list of the laws that have previously contained provisions prohibiting the annual pay adjustments, see \"Table 3. Legislative Vehicles Used for Pay Prohibitions, Enacted Dates, and Pay Language\" in CRS Report 97-1011, Salaries of Members of Congress: Recent Actions and Historical Tables , by Ida A. Brudnick. In contrast, the salaries and benefits for legislative branch employees are provided by the legislative branch appropriations acts, although they generally do not address pay adjustments.  The House and Senate both consider funding levels for the legislative branch agencies and joint entities. By long-standing tradition, however, the House bill does not propose funding levels for Senate items, including the account that funds the Senate and the Senate office buildings account within the Architect of the Capitol. Similarly, the Senate does not comment on House items, including the account that funds the House or the House office buildings account within the Architect of the Capitol. The House, Senate, and conference reports on legislative branch appropriations bills regularly contain language illustrating the deference of each chamber to the internal practices of the other. If comparing the House and Senate bill totals, or the total provided to the Architect of the Capitol at different stages of consideration, adjustments may be necessary to address any omissions due to this practice."
