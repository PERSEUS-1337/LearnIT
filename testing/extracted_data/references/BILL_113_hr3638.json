FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The 2009 report of the National Surface Transportation \n        Infrastructure Financing Commission recommends a transition \n        away from the fuel tax to a more stable funding source, noting \n        that a mileage-based fee system is the consensus choice for \n        policy leaders.\n            (2) The 2008 report of the National Surface Transportation \n        and Revenue Study Commission recommends further study of the \n        implementation of mileage-based fee systems at the State level \n        and of their compatibility with a national revenue system, \n        noting that in the long run, a mileage-based fee system seems \n        the most likely and appropriate method to be implemented.\n            (3) According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \n        revenue raised from the gas tax since its last increase in 1992 \n        has lost over one-third of its purchasing power due to \n        increasing fuel efficiency, changing transportation patterns, \n        and inflation.\n            (4) By 2030, the corporate average fuel economy standards \n        will have reduced Highway Trust Fund receipts by more than 20 \n        percent.\n            (5) The fuel tax revenue mechanism results in some \n        industries paying more than their commensurate road use.\n            (6) Since 1990, while gas tax revenues have consistently \n        decreased, the number of vehicle miles traveled nationally has \n        consistently increased.\n\nSEC. 3. ROAD USAGE FEE PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of the Treasury (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a competitive grant \nprogram to be known as the Road Usage Fee Pilot Program (in this Act \nreferred to as the ``Program'') to make grants to eligible entities \nto--\n            (1) conduct pilot studies of methods for recording and \n        reporting the number of miles traveled by particular vehicles;\n            (2) conduct pilot studies of payment, enforcement, and \n        privacy protection methods for mileage-based fee systems; and\n            (3) implement mileage-based fee systems in jurisdictions \n        that have adopted a plan for such systems.\n    (b) Application Required.--To be eligible for a grant under the \nProgram, an eligible entity shall submit to the Secretary an \napplication at such time, in such form, and containing such information \nand assurances as the Secretary may require.\n    (c) Selection of Pilot Studies.--In awarding grants under the \nProgram, the Secretary shall select pilot studies that, in combination, \nexplore means to address the following concerns:\n            (1) Protection of personal privacy.\n            (2) Ease of public compliance.\n            (3) Level of public acceptance.\n            (4) Geographic and income equity.\n            (5) Integration with State and local transportation revenue \n        mechanisms.\n            (6) Administrative issues.\n            (7) Cost.\n            (8) Enforcement issues.\n            (9) Potential for fraud or evasion.\n            (10) Feasibility of implementation.\n    (d) Priority.--In awarding grants under the Program, the Secretary \nshall give priority to pilot studies that--\n            (1) serve as a model for broad implementation of a mileage-\n        based fee system;\n            (2) address concerns of rural and urban user equity;\n            (3) involve multistate projects;\n            (4) have a high volume of enrolled vehicles;\n            (5) integrate with State and local revenue systems;\n            (6) integrate with local demand management plans;\n            (7) are likely to lead to implementation of mileage-based \n        fee systems, dependent on the results of the program;\n            (8) integrate with other intelligent transportation system \n        technologies; and\n            (9) test the proposed revenue collection system by \n        collecting and distributing revenue.\n    (e) Required Minimum Funds for Planning Organizations.--In awarding \ngrants under the Program, the Secretary shall ensure that not less than \n10 percent of funds available under the Program in a fiscal year are \nreserved for pilot studies carried out in conjunction with metropolitan \nplanning organizations or regional transportation planning \norganizations.\n    (f) Cost Sharing.--An eligible entity that receives a grant under \nthis Act shall provide funds, from non-Federal sources, in an amount \nequal to 20 percent of the amount of grant funds provided to the entity \nto carry out the activities supported by the grant.\n\nSEC. 4.
