    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health on Campus Improvement \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The 2007 National Survey of Counseling Center Directors \n        found that the average ratio of counselors to students on \n        campus is nearly 1 to 2,000 and is often far higher on large \n        campuses. The International Association of Counseling Services \n        accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per 1,000 to \n        1,500 students.\n            (2) College counselors report that 8.5 percent of enrolled \n        students sought counseling in the past year, totaling an \n        estimated 1,600,000 students.\n            (3) Over 90 percent of counseling directors believe there \n        is an increase in the number of students coming to campus with \n        severe psychological problems. The majority of counseling \n        directors report concerns that the demand for services is \n        growing without an increase in resources.\n            (4) A 2008 American College Health Association survey \n        revealed that 43 percent of students at colleges and \n        universities report having felt so depressed it was difficult \n        to function, and one out of every 11 students seriously \n        considered suicide within the past year.\n            (5) Research conducted between 1989 and 2002 found that \n        students seen for anxiety disorders doubled, for depression \n        tripled, and for serious suicidal intention tripled.\n            (6) Many students who need help never receive it. \n        Counseling directors report that, of the students who committed \n        suicide on their campuses, only 22 percent were current or \n        former counseling center clients. Directors did not know the \n        previous psychiatric history of 60 percent of those students.\n            (7) A survey conducted by the University of Idaho Student \n        Counseling Center in 2000 found that 77 percent of students who \n        responded reported that they were more likely to stay in school \n        because of counseling and that their school performance would \n        have declined without counseling.\n            (8) A 6-year longitudinal study of college students found \n        that personal and emotional adjustment was an important factor \n        in retention and predicted attrition as well as, or better \n        than, academic adjustment (Gerdes & Mallinckrodt, 1994).\n\nSEC. 3. IMPROVING MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.\n\n    Title V of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting \nafter section 520E-2 (42 U.S.C. 290bb-36b) the following:\n\n``SEC. 520E-3.
