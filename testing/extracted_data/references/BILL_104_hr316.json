FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress hereby finds the following:\n            (1) Excessive and groundless litigation against innocent \n        directors and officers of failed financial institutions is \n        adversely affecting the national economy by creating an \n        environment where bankers are reluctant to make loans.\n            (2) The efforts by Federal banking regulators to impose \n        liability on bank officials for good faith business decisions \n        is impeding our banking system by making it difficult for \n        financial institutions to attract officers and directors.\n            (3) Since 1989, Federal regulators have used enhanced \n        powers to pursue not only culpable individuals but also \n        countless innocent people who are targeted because of their \n        financial condition.\n            (4) Tactics used by regulators to induce settlements \n        include the threat of attachment of assets and the use of \n        taxpayer-funded outside fee counsel to file lawsuits, the costs \n        of which often bankrupt individuals trying to clear their \n        names.\n            (5) Reform of the banking laws are needed to curtail \n        regulatory abuse and to ensure that directors and officers have \n        due process protections and the ability to make good faith \n        lending decisions.\n\nSEC. 3. FACTORS AND STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS.\n\n    Section 8(i) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n            ``(5) Affirmative defenses applicable with respect to \n        certain administrative and judicial proceedings.--In the \n        determination of whether any director, officer, or institution-\n        affiliated party of an insured depository institution has \n        committed any violation or breach of duty for purposes of this \n        section or section 11(k), the following affirmative defenses \n        shall be available to the director, officer, or institution-\n        affiliated party in any civil action against the director, \n        officer, or party before a Federal banking agency or a court of \n        jurisdiction:\n                    ``(A) Business judgment.--A director, officer, or \n                institution-affiliated party of an insured depository \n                institution shall not be deemed to have committed any \n                violation or breach of duty in the making of any \n                business judgment (without regard to whether such \n                business judgment is later determined to have been in \n                error), if--\n                            ``(i) in a case in which the director, \n                        officer, or institution-affiliated party had an \n                        interest in the subject of the business \n                        judgment, the director, officer, or party--\n                                    ``(I) disclosed that interest at or \n                                before the time the business judgment \n                                was made;
