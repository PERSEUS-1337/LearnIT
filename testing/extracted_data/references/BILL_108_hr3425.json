FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Nearly one-third of American women report being \n        physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some \n        point in their lives.\n            (2) Family violence costs the nation between $5,000,000,000 \n        and $10,000,000,000 each year in medical expenses, police and \n        court costs, shelters and foster care, sick leave, absenteeism, \n        and nonproductivity.\n            (3) The United States is becoming increasingly \n        multicultural, and racial and ethnic minorities are expected to \n        constitute approximately 50 percent of the United States \n        population by 2050.\n            (4) Two-thirds of female immigrants to the United States \n        originate from Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the \n        Middle East, and they migrate here to seek economic security, \n        reunify their families, or escape prosecution.\n            (5) Racial and ethnic minority women and immigrant women \n        face unique challenges to reporting and getting help for \n        domestic violence.\n            (6) Structural inequalities experienced by racial and \n        ethnic minority communities and immigrant communities, \n        including poverty and discrimination, may contribute to higher \n        rates of violence.\n            (7) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for \n        immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of their \n        family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to file \n        immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and children \n        as powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant women from \n        seeking help, trapping battered immigrant women in violent \n        homes because of fear of deportation.\n            (8) Many racial and ethnic minority women and immigrant \n        women face cultural barriers to reporting abuse or seeking help \n        for domestic violence, including but not limited to strong \n        religious beliefs that stress the importance of keeping family \n        intact, fear of dishonor, or a belief that negative events \n        occur regardless of attempts to prevent them.\n            (9) Many racial and ethnic minority women and immigrant \n        women also face institutional barriers to reporting abuse or \n        seeking help for domestic violence, including but not limited \n        to restrictions on public assistance, limited access to \n        immigration relief, lack of translators or bilingual \n        professionals, little educational material in the woman's \n        native language, treatment programs that do not take into \n        account ethnic and cultural differences, prohibitive fee \n        structures, and inflexible or inconvenient hours of operation.\n\nSEC. 3.
