FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Asian elephant populations in nations within the range \n        of Asian elephants have continued to decline to the point that \n        the long-term survival of the species in the wild is in serious \n        jeopardy.\n            (2) The Asian elephant is listed as an endangered species \n        under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and under \n        appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in \n        Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n            (3) Because the challenges facing the conservation of Asian \n        elephants are so great, resources to date have not been \n        sufficient to cope with the continued loss of habitat and the \n        consequent diminution of Asian elephant populations.\n            (4) The Asian elephant is a flagship species for the \n        conservation of tropical forest habitats in which it is found \n        and provides the consequent benefit from such conservation to \n        numerous other species of wildlife including many other \n        endangered species.\n            (5) Among the threats to the Asian elephant in addition to \n        habitat loss are population fragmentation, human-elephant \n        conflict, poaching for ivory, meat, hide, bones and teeth, and \n        capture for domestication.\n            (6) To reduce, remove, or otherwise effectively address \n        these threats to the long-term viability of populations of \n        Asian elephants in the wild will require the joint commitment \n        and effort of nations within the range of Asian elephants, the \n        United States and other countries, and the private sector.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To perpetuate healthy populations of Asian elephants.\n            (2) To assist in the conservation and protection of Asian \n        elephants by supporting the conservation programs of Asian \n        elephant range states and the CITES Secretariat.\n            (3) To provide financial resources for those programs.\n\nSEC. 4.
