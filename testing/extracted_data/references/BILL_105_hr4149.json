FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Over the last several years, indirect expenditures and \n        other overhead costs within the Forest Service have increased \n        substantially, both in total dollar amounts and as a percentage \n        of total expenditures. Rising indirect expenditures and other \n        overhead costs have hindered the ability of the Forest Service \n        to carry out its core mission of managing the National Forest \n        System.\n            (2) According to the Comptroller General, indirect \n        expenditures associated with Forest Service management of five \n        off-budget funds established by law to provide funds for site \n        restoration, reforestation, habitat improvement, brush disposal \n        and other critical management activities has increased by 80 \n        percent and now exceeds 27 percent of the total annual \n        expenditures from these off-budget funds. Considerable debate \n        continues regarding whether such expenditures exceed spending \n        authority provided by Congress.\n            (3) Forest Service data show that annual general \n        administration costs associated with the Federal timber sale \n        program increased by 46 percent between 1992 and 1996 and now \n        comprise 31 percent of the total costs of the program. Such \n        data show that annual general administration costs exceed the \n        total annual costs of all of the following combined:\n                    (A) Environmental analysis.\n                    (B) Appeals and litigation.\n                    (C) Road design, construction, and maintenance.\n                    (D) Brush disposal.\n                    (E) Reforestation and other site improvements.\n                    (F) Transportation planning.\n                    (G) Silvicultural examinations.\n            (4) The Forest Service does not presently have an adequate \n        financial accounting system in place to identify and manage the \n        indirect and total expenditures associated with the programs it \n        administers. The lack of such a system, and accompanying \n        safeguards to prevent inappropriate use of appropriated funds \n        and off-budget funds, may be contributing substantially to \ndeclines in the goods and services the Forest Service is able to \nprovide to the American public and other users of the National Forest \nSystem.\n            (5) The Forest Service is in need of a comprehensive \n        strategy for identifying and reducing, where appropriate, \n        indirect and total expenditures associated with management of \n        the National Forest System. Such a strategy must include clear, \n        tangible objectives and performance measures that will make it \n        possible to measure agency performance and identify results.\n            (6) Any comprehensive strategy ultimately adopted by the \n        Forest Service to better manage indirect and total expenditures \n        associated with management of the National Forest System must \n        be designed so as to maintain or increase the goods and \n        services provided to the American public and other users of the \n        National Forest System as a result of its implementation.\n\nSEC. 3.
