CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that Saltville and its environs possess--\n            (1) a remarkably rich natural and cultural heritage, \n        including superlative examples of several themes of great \n        interest to the general public and of marked historical and \n        scientific significance;\n            (2) waterways among the headwaters of the Cumberlandian \n        Zoogeographic Province, which contains one of the oldest and \n        most diverse freshwater aquatic faunas in North America;\n            (3) stream and lacustrine sediments in Saltville Valley \n        spanning at least the past 25,000 years and containing the most \n        lengthy and best resolved known continuous record of biotic, \n        hydrologic, and climatic change located in an open-air site in \n        the middle Appalachians;\n            (4) an archaeological record that spans at least the past \n        11,000 years, and probably 13,000-14,000 years, making this \n        potentially one of the best resolved and oldest early man sites \n        in North America;\n            (5) a lengthy record of colonization and occupation by \n        Euro-Americans moving south through the Valley of Virginia and \n        into choice areas of the Valley and Ridge, so that the area \n        contains a record of early settlement and land use in the area \n        and of the transfer of cultural elements into the newly \n        occupied region, and provides insight into the perceptions of \n        these Euro-Americans regarding land and resources;\n            (6) a 200-year industrial history that includes the \n        development of a significant part of the technology of inland \n        salt manufacture in North America, beginning with crude \n        pioneering efforts in the latter half of the 18th century and \n        continuing into the 1970's;\n            (7) an industrial history that is intimately associated \n        with the development of a rich and varied array of water- and \n        land-based transportation systems;\n            (8) a rare example of a relatively well-preserved fortified \n        industrial center of the Civil War period, containing \n        significant whole or partial examples of the industrial and \n        defensive works;\n            (9) well-preserved remnants of a company-managed industrial \n        complex and town that developed from the late 19th through \n        middle 20th centuries and that is representative of the \n        American industrial age as expressed in rural America and the \n        company town;\n            (10) a legacy of environmental traumas that emanated from \n        the industrial age, including excessively polluted waters and \n        attendant depauperization of the aquatic biota, and expedient \n        but devastating disposition of toxic wastes that led to the \n        creation of an Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site;\n            (11) sites affected by regulated land use changes that have \n        produced some of the most noteworthy recent water quality \n        improvements in Virginia; and\n            (12) a beautiful setting incorporating landforms, waters, \n        and biota that blend with, and in cases overwhelm, the cultural \n        imprint on and near this tiny valley.\n\nSEC. 3.
