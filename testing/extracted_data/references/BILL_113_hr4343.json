FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Article I, section 1 of the United States Constitution vests \nthe legislative powers enumerated therein in the United States \nCongress, consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives, \nsubject only to the veto power of the President as provided in article \nI, section 7, clause 2.\n    (b) Article II, section 1 of the United States Constitution vests \nthe executive power of the United States in a President of the United \nStates, except as enumerated in article II, section 2.\n    (c) Article III, section 1 of the United States Constitution vests \nthe judicial power of the United States in ``one supreme Court, and in \nsuch inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and \nestablish,'' subject only to the jurisdictional limitations set forth \nin article III, section 2.\n    (d) ``In the main, [the United States Constitution] has blocked out \nwith singular precision, and in bold lines, in its three primary \nArticles, the allotment of power to the executive, the legislative, and \njudicial departments of the government [and] the powers confided by the \nConstitution to one of these departments cannot be exercised by \nanother.'' Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 191 (1881).\n    (e) ``It is . . . essential to the successful working of this \nsystem, that the persons entrusted with power in any of these branches \nshall not be permitted to encroach upon the powers confided to others, \nbut that each shall by the law of its creation be limited to the \nexercise of the powers of its own department and no other.'' Kilbourn \nv. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 191 (1881).\n    (f) ``The increase in the number of States, in their population and \nwealth, and in the amount of power . . . [has] present[ed] powerful and \ngrowing temptations to those to whom that exercise is intrusted, to \noverstep the just boundaries of their own department, and enter upon \nthe domain of one of the others, or to assume powers not intrusted to \neither of them.'' Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 191-192 (1881).\n    (g) Succumbing to these ``powerful and growing'' temptations, and \nbeginning in the late nineteenth century with the Interstate Commerce \nCommission and continuing to the present time, Congress has \nunconstitutionally created numerous administrative agencies with \nblended powers, namely, (i) the exercise of legislative power vested by \nthe Constitution in Congress, (ii) the exercise of executive power \nvested by the Constitution in the President and (iii) the exercise of \njudicial power vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court and \nlower Federal courts.\n    (h) By delegating legislative, executive and judicial power to the \nvarious administrative agencies, Congress has departed from the \nseparation of powers structure of the United States Constitution, and \nignored the warning of the framers of that instrument that ``[T]he \naccumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in \nthe same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, \nself-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very \ndefinition of tyranny.'' James Madison, The Federalist No. 47.\n    (i) Further, by delegating legislative, executive, and judicial \npowers to various administrative agencies, Congress has \nunconstitutionally established a Star Chamber-like system of rules \npromulgated, executed and adjudicated by administrative agencies that \nare functionally a part of the executive branch of government in \nviolation of the due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment that \nsecures a system of rules promulgated by Congress, executed by the \nPresident, and adjudicated by the courts independent from the \nlegislative and executive branches of government.\n    (j) By the very nature of legislative power, and by the express \nterms of article I, section 1 of the United States Constitution, \nCongress may not delegate any legislative power to any other branch of \ngovernment or other entity, including any administrative agency. As \nChief Justice John Marshall stated: ``It will not be contended that \ncongress can delegate to the courts, or to any other tribunals, powers \nwhich are strictly and exclusively legislative.'' Wayman v. Southard, \n10 Wheat. 23 U.S. 1, 41 (1825).\n    (k) As Chief Justice Melville Fuller explained, a ``criminal \noffense'' created or clarified by an Executive Branch agency is not \nvalid unless the offense ``is fully and completely defined by the act'' \nof Congress. In re Kollock, 165 U.S. 526 (1897).\n    (l) By vesting legislative power in the Congress, the Constitution \nrequires the Senate and the House of Representatives to enact statutes \ncontaining general rules to be executed by the President, as provided \nin article II, section 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and \nto be adjudicated in a case or controversy by such inferior courts as \nCongress may from time to time establish, or in the Supreme Court, as \nprovided in article III, sections 1 and 2.\n    (m) By abdicating its constitutional legislative responsibility to \nwrite the laws whereby the people are governed, and having \nunconstitutionally delegated that power to unelected bureaucrats, \nCongress has undermined the constitutional protections of (i) the \nchecks and balances of a bicameral legislative body and (ii) of a \npresidential veto.\n    (n) As a direct consequence of Congress having abdicated its \nresponsibility to properly exercise the legislative power vested by the \nConstitution, Congress has: (i) imposed onerous and unreasonable \nburdens upon the American people; and (ii) violated the constitutional \nprinciple of the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial \nprocesses and functions.\n    (o) As Chief Justice Roberts observed, ``the danger posed by the \ngrowing power of the administrative state cannot be dismissed,'' as \nthere are now ``hundreds of federal agencies poking into every nook and \ncranny of daily life.'' City of Arlington v. FCC. 569 U.S._(2013) \n(Roberts, C.J., dissenting).\n\nSEC. 3. RESTORING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS.\n\n    Title 1 of the United States Code, shall be amended by inserting at \nthe end of chapter 2 a new chapter, 2B entitled ``SEPARATION OF \nPOWERS'', including section 101, as follows:\n``Sec. 101. Nondelegation of legislative power\n    ``(a) Effective 90 calendar days after the enactment of this bill \ninto law no bills passed by Congress shall contain any `delegation of \nlegislative powers' whatsoever, whether to (a) any component within the \nLegislative Branch of government, (b) the President of the United \nStates or any other member of the Executive Branch of government, (c) \nthe Judicial Branch of government, (d) any federal administrative \nagency, (e) any quasi-public agency, (f) any state or instrumentality \nthereof, or (g) any other organization or individual.\n    ``(b)(1) A prohibited `delegation of legislative powers' in this \nsection shall include: (a) the creation or clarification of any \ncriminal or civil offense; and (b) the creation or clarification of any \nnon-criminal regulation, prohibition or limitation applicable to the \npublic, or some subset thereof, that is not fully and completely \ndefined by Congress, except that the Executive Branch of government may \nbe delegated authority to make factual findings that will determine the \ndate upon which such statute is implemented, suspended, or revived.\n    ``(2) A prohibited `delegation of legislative powers' in this \nsection shall not include the issuance of any presidential \nproclamation, or the issuance by any rule or regulation governing the \ninternal operation of any government agency, or conditions made upon \ngrants or contracts issued by any government agency.\n    ``(c) Effective 90 calendar days after the enactment of this bill \ninto law, no new presidential directive, adjudicative decision, rule, \nor regulation, or change to an existing presidential directive, \nadjudicative decision, rule, or regulation governing, limiting, \nimposing a penalty on, or otherwise regulating any activity of any \nperson or entity, other than an officer or employee of the United \nStates government, shall be promulgated or put into effect, unless said \ndirective, decision, rule or regulation is authorized by a bill written \nin compliance with this section, and duly enacted according to the \nprocess of Article I, Section 7 of the United States Constitution.\n    ``(d) Within six months after the effective date of this Act, the \nComptroller General of the United States, shall report to Congress \nidentifying all statutes enacted prior to the effective date of this \nstatute which contain any `delegation of legislative powers' prohibited \nin this section, to the end that Congress may take action to repeal or \namend any such statutes.''.\n\nSEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT CLAUSE.\n\n    Title 1 of the United States Code shall be further amended by \nadding to new said chapter 2B, as follows:\n``Sec. 102. Enforcement clause\n    ``(a) Effective 90 days after the enactment of this bill, no bill \nshall become law, nor enforced or applied as law, without Congress \nhaving complied fully with the requirements of Section 101(A) and (B) \nof Chapter 2B of Title 1 of the United States Code, and any persons \nagainst whom such a law is enforced or applied may invoke such \nnoncompliance as a complete defense to any legal, equitable, or \nregulatory action, civil or criminal, brought against him under said \nlaw, or the color thereof.\n    ``(b) Any person aggrieved by any action of any executive officer \nor administration agency pursuant to any statute that does not comply \nwith the provisions of this Act shall have a cause of action under \nSections 2201 and 2202, Title 28, United States Code, and Rules 57 and \n65, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, against the United States to seek \nappropriate relief, including an injunction against enforcement of any \nlaw, the contents of which did not conform to the requirements of this \nAct.\n    ``(c) In any judicial action brought pursuant to subsection (B) of \nthis section, the standard of review shall be de novo.''.\n\nSEC. 5. SEVERABILITY CLAUSE.\n\n    If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof, to any \nperson or circumstance is held invalid for any reason in any court of \ncompetent jurisdiction, such invalidity does not affect other \nprovisions or other applications of this Act which can be given effect \nwithout the invalid provision or application, and for this purpose the \nprovisions of this Act are declared severable."
