        subsidiary entity shall be treated as a qualified real \n                property interest if such interest would be so treated \n                if held directly by the exempt REIT or the

or stapled entity increases its ownership \n        interest in a subsidiary entity to which paragraph (2)(B) \n        applies above its ownership interest in such subsidiary entity \n        as of such date, the additional portion of each interest in \n        real property which is treated as held by the exempt REIT or \n        stapled entity by reason of such increased ownership shall be \n        treated as a nonqualified real property interest.\n            (4) Special rules for determining ownership.--For purposes \n        of this subsection--\n                    (A) percentage

acquired on March 26, 1998, and\n                    (C) except as provided in guidance prescribed by \n                the Secretary, any change in proportionate ownership \n                which is attributable solely to fluctuations in the \n                relative fair market values of different classes of \n                stock shall not be taken into account.\n    (d) Treatment of Property Secured by Mortgage Held by Exempt REIT \nor Member of Stapled REIT Group.--\n            (1) In general.--In the case of any nonqualified obligation \n        held by an exempt REIT or any member of the stapled REIT group, \n        the REIT gross income provisions shall be applied by treating \n        the exempt REIT as having impermissible tenant service income \n        equal to--\n                    (A) the interest income from such obligation which \n                is properly allocable to the property described in \n                paragraph (2), and\n                    (B) the income of any member of the stapled REIT \n                group from services described in paragraph (2) with \n                respect to such property.\n        If the income referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) is of a \n        10-percent subsidiary entity, only the portion of such income \n        which is properly allocable to the exempt REIT's or the stapled \n        entity's interest in the subsidiary entity shall be taken into \n        account.\n            (2) Nonqualified obligation.--Except as otherwise provided \n        in this subsection, the term ``nonqualified obligation'' means \n        any obligation secured by a mortgage on an interest in real \n        property if the income of any member of the stapled REIT group \n        for services furnished with respect to such property would be \n        impermissible tenant service income were such property held by \n        the exempt REIT and such services furnished by the exempt REIT.\n            (3) Exception for certain market rate obligations.--Such \n        term shall not include any obligation--\n                    (A) payments under which would be treated as \n                interest if received by a REIT, and\n                    (B) the rate of interest on which does not exceed \n                an arm's length rate.\n            (4) Exception for existing obligations.--Such term shall \n        not include any obligation--\n                    (A) which is secured on March 26, 1998, by an \n                interest in real property, and\n                    (B) which is held
