    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\n(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to clarify that pawnbrokers and other secondhand dealers are to report their acquisition of tangible personal property received in pledge, trade, consignment, or auction or by purchase using plain text, in descriptive language historically used in the pawn and secondhand industries when reporting to the single, statewide, and uniform electronic reporting system operated by the Department of Justice, or if not yet implemented in their respective jurisdictions, on paper forms sent to the local police chief or sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the secondhand dealer is physically located.\n(b) It is further the intent of the Legislature that by specifying this manner of reporting, it will relieve all secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers of the inherent costs and burdens imposed under existing law that requires these businesses to report their daily acquisitions of secondhand tangible personal property on paper forms limited to a single transaction, or where the electronic reporting system is implemented, the cost associated with converting industry standard descriptions to specific law enforcement categories, the ongoing costs of training to that standard, and the costs of implementing software to maintain that standard.\n(c) Further, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Department of Justice shall continue to accept the plain text descriptive language historically used in the pawn and secondhand industries and may provide article field descriptors to secondhand dealers in order to facilitate communication between the single, statewide, and uniform electronic reporting system and law enforcement databases. It is the intent of the Legislature that only properly trained law enforcement personnel of the Department of Justice or local law enforcement classify and encode for law enforcement databases property reported by pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 21627.5 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:\n21627.5.\n\u201cCAPSS\u201d means the California Pawn and SecondhandDealer System, which is a single, statewide, uniform electronic reporting system that receives secondhand dealer reports and is operated by the Department of Justice consistent with Resolution Chapter 16 of the Statutes of 2010. The maintenance and operation of CAPSS is funded by the Secondhand Dealer and Pawnbroker Fund established pursuant to Section 21642.5.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 21628 of the Business and Professions Code, as amended by Section 1 of Chapter 169 of the Statutes of 2015, is amended to read:\n21628.\n(a) Every secondhand dealer or coin dealer described in Section 21626 shall report daily, or no later than the next business day excluding weekends and holidays after receipt or purchase of secondhand tangible personal property, to CAPSS, all secondhand tangible personal property, except for firearms, which he or she has purchased, taken in trade, taken in pawn, accepted for sale on consignment, or accepted for auctioning, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21630 and subdivision (d). The report shall be legible, prepared in English, completed where applicable, and include only the following information:\n(1) The name and current address of the intended seller or pledger of the property.\n(2) The identification of the intended seller or pledger. The identification of the seller or pledger of the property shall be verified by the person taking the information, who may use technology, including, but not limited to, cameras or software, or both, to obtain information and verify identity remotely. The verification shall be valid if the person taking the information reasonably relies on any one of the following documents, provided that the document is currently valid or has been issued within five years and contains a photograph or description, or both, of the person named on it, and, where applicable, is signed by the person, and bears a serial or other identifying number:\n(A) A passport of the United States.\n(B) A driver\u2019s license issued by any state or Canada.\n(C) An identification card issued by any state.\n(D) An identification card issued by the United States.\n(E) A passport from any other country in addition to another item of identification bearing an address.\n(F) A Matricula Consular in addition to another item of identification bearing an address.\n(3) (A) A property description.

The cost associated with opening the watch shall be borne by the pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, or customer.\n(B) A secondhand dealer shall utilize in the article field either an article field descriptor, the format of which shall be provided by the Department of Justice, or a properly spelled and non-abbreviated plain text descriptor commonly recognized and utilized by the pawn and secondhand dealer industry. The lack of an article field descriptor provided by the Department of Justice shall not be relevant to any determination as to whether the secondhand dealer has received evidence of authority to sell or pledge the property pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) so long as the secondhand dealer reports an article field descriptor consistent with this subdivision.\n(C) In the case of the receipt or purchase of a handheld electronic device by a secondhand dealer, the serial number reported pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be the International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI), the mobile equipment identifier (MEID), or other unique identifying number assigned to that device by the device manufacturer.

This requirement does not apply to a coin dealer, unless required pursuant to local regulation.\n(7) A report submitted by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Department of Justice if a good faith effort has been made to supply all of the required information. An error or omission on the report shall be noted, and the reporting pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall be notified of the error or omission by the Department of Justice. A reporting pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall have three business days from that notice to amend or correct the report before being subject to any enforcement violation.\n(b) (1) When a secondhand dealer complies with all of the provisions of this section, he or she shall be deemed to have received from the seller or pledger adequate evidence of authority to sell or pledge the property for all purposes included in this article, and Division 8 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Financial Code.\n(2) In enacting this subdivision, it is the intent of the Legislature that its provisions shall not adversely affect the implementation of, or prosecution under, any provision of the Penal Code.\n(c) Any person who conducts business as a secondhand dealer at any gun show or event, as defined in Section 478.100 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or its successor, outside the jurisdiction that issued the secondhand dealer license in accordance with subdivision (d) of Section 21641, may be required to submit a duplicate of the transaction report prepared pursuant to this section to the local law enforcement agency where the gun show or event is conducted.\n(d) (1) The Department of Justice shall recognize and accept the properly spelled and non-abbreviated plain text property descriptors generally accepted in the pawn and secondhand industries provided by pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers, as has been the longstanding practice of chiefs of police and sheriffs when they had received paper reports from pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers.\n(2) A report required of a secondhand dealer pursuant to this section shall be transmitted by electronic means to CAPSS by the secondhand dealer.\n(3) Unless specifically identified in this section, the Department of Justice, chiefs of police, and sheriffs shall not require a secondhand dealer to include any additional information concerning the seller, the pledger, or the property received by the secondhand dealer in the report required by this section.\n(4) If there is a future change to the reporting requirements of CAPSS that substantively alters the reporting standards provided by this article, those changes shall be implemented and operated in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code). In implementing and operating a future change to CAPSS, the Department of Justice, chiefs of police, and sheriffs shall comply with Sections 21637 and 21638. Notwithstanding any other law, the Department of Justice shall not take any action with respect to the implementation, operation, or maintenance of CAPSS required by this chapter by adoption of an emergency regulation.\n(5) On or before July 1, 2017, the Department of Justice shall convene a meeting with the Department of Technology to discuss issues pertaining to any proposed changes or upgrades to CAPSS required by this chapter.
