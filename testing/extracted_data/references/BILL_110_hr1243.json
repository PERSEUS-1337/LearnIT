FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) 43 percent of businesses that close following a natural \n        disaster never reopen;\n            (2) an additional 29 percent of businesses close down \n        permanently within 2 years of a natural disaster;\n            (3) Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast of the United \n        States on August 29, 2005, negatively impacting small business \n        concerns and disrupting commerce in the States of Louisiana, \n        Mississippi, and Alabama;\n            (4) Hurricane Rita struck the Gulf Coast of the United \n        States on September 24, 2005, negatively impacting small \n        business concerns and disrupting commerce in the States of \n        Texas and Louisiana;\n            (5) according to the United States Chamber of Commerce, \n        more than 125,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in the \n        Gulf Coast were disrupted by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane \n        Rita;\n            (6) due to a slow initial Federal response and the \n        widespread devastation in the affected States, businesses \n        impacted by Hurricane Katrina are in dire need of increased \n        access to capital and technical assistance to recover and \n        prosper; and\n            (7) without the full recovery and prosperity of affected \n        businesses, the Gulf Coast and the rest of the United States \n        will be negatively impacted.\n\nSEC. 3.
