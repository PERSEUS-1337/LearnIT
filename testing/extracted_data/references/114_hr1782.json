FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) United States foreign policy towards the Government of \n        Cuba is governed by a variety of Federal laws, including the \n        Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the International Claims \n        Act of 1949, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Cuban \n        Assets Control Regulations of 1963, the International Economic \n        Powers Act of 1977, the Food Security Act of 1985, the Internal \n        Revenue Code of 1986, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, the \n        Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, the \n        Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \n        of 1999, and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement \n        Act of 2000.\n            (2) Since 1961, it has been the stated policy of the United \n        States to institute a commercial and economic embargo against \n        the Government of Cuba, supported and buttressed by the Federal \n        laws referred to in paragraph (1), with the Cuban Assets \n        Control Regulations of 1963 being the principal means through \n        which the United States enforces its embargo against Cuba. \n        These Federal laws and related regulations regulate commerce, \n        trade, travel, and telecommunications with Cuba.\n            (3) The Cuban regime, which is effectively synonymous with \n        the Communist Party of Cuba, forbids public challenge to the \n        legitimacy of its single-party rule, and restricts freedom of \n        assembly, association, expression, press, religion, and speech, \n        as well as tightly limits access to the Internet and \n        telecommunications. This includes attempts to jam access to the \n        Internet and the signals of some foreign radio and television \n        stations, including the United States sponsored Radio y \n        Televisioon Martii.\n            (4) The Government of Cuba continues to harbor fugitives \n        wanted in the United States, such as Joanne Chesimard, who is \n        on the top of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Most Wanted \n        Terrorist List. Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur, was \n        convicted of murdering New Jersey State trooper Werner \n        Foerster. After escaping prison, Chesimard fled to Cuba, where \n        Fidel Castro granted her political asylum. This deplorable \n        failure to extradite has caused ongoing suffering and stress to \n        Mr. Foerster's surviving family and friends.\n            (5) The Government of Cuba continues to detain, imprison, \n        place under house arrest, convict, or otherwise restrict its \n        citizens for peacefully expressing any dissenting political \n        views, deny workers the right of free association and the \n        related right to organize and collectively bargain outside the \n        state monopoly on power, and limit freedom of religion, \n        restrict the operations of independent religious organizations, \n        and persecute believers whose religious activities or views the \n        Government of Cuba regards as a potential threat to its \n        monopoly on power.\n            (6) The Government of Cuba, through its Office of Religious \n        Affairs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba \n        and the Ministry of Justice, controls all religious activity on \n        the island and often represses religious freedom, including the \n        harassment, beating, detainment, and jailing of individuals \n        involved in religious activities, typically on a weekly basis. \n        The Government of Cuba also unjustly uses treason laws to \n        repress religious freedom by accusing religious peoples of \n        being ``counter-revolutionaries'' and then illegally harassing, \n        beating, detaining, and jailing them.\n            (7) Individuals arrested by the Government of Cuba because \n        of their political or religious affiliations and activities are \n        not accorded due legal process as they lack full access to \n        lawyers of their choice, may experience closed trials, have \n        often been detained for years without trial, and have been \n        subjected to the use of torture to admit to crimes that they \n        did not commit or to falsely denounce others.\n            (8) Cuba continues to be a destination country for the \n        commercial sexual exploitation of women and young girls in the \n        form of sex tourism, as well as a source country for the forced \n        labor of individuals who subsequently face conditions of debt \n        bondage or forced labor.\n            (9) The United Nations Commission on Human Rights and \n        several Latin American countries have passed resolutions \n        condemning the human rights abuses of the Government of Cuba.\n            (10) In anticipation of the Summit of the Americas in \n        Panama, on April 8, 2015, persons affiliated with the Castro \n        regime attacked Cuban pro-democracy activists Jorge Luis Garcia \n        Perez ``Antunez'', Yris Perez Aguilera, Juan Carlos Gonzaalez \n        Leyva, Leticia Ramos Herreriia, and Rolando Rodriiguez Lobaina \n        and United States citizens Orlando Gutierrez, Silvia Iriondo, \n        and Gus Monge during a peaceful gathering.\n            (11) According to media reports, Colonel Alexis Frutos \n        Weeden, who is the head of Cuban intelligence in Venezuela, was \n        identified as one of the assailants in Panama who attacked the \n        Cuban pro-democracy activists and United States citizens.\n            (12) Despite the continued presence of these aggravating \n        circumstances, President Obama recently announced his intention \n        to comprehensively modify and normalize relations between the \n        United State and Cuba, all without the advice and consent of \n        Congress or with any attempt to amend or modify the myriad of \n        Federal laws and regulations that govern the United States-Cuba \n        relationship or the related embargo.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the United States-Cuba \nrelationship should not be changed, nor should any Federal law or \nregulation be amended, until the Government of Cuba ceases violating \nthe human rights of the people of Cuba.\n\nSEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It should be the policy of the United States to--\n            (1) continue to vigorously oppose and denounce the human \n        rights violations of the Government of Cuba;\n            (2) maintain the status quo of Federal law with respect to \n        the Government of Cuba, including sanctions and embargo, on the \n        Government of Cuba so long as it continues to violate the human \n        rights of the people of Cuba, and to deny the Government of \n        Cuba any embassy or consulates in the United States due to \n        security concerns stemming from past illicit espionage \n        activities;\n            (3) seek the cooperation of other democratic countries in \n        this policy;\n            (4) make clear to other countries that, in determining its \n        relations with them, the United States will take into account \n        their willingness to cooperate in such a policy; and\n            (5) not amend the Federal laws and regulations referred to \n        in section 2(1) and not reduce the sanctions against the \n        Government of Cuba until the Government of Cuba ceases \n        violating and, in fact, protects, the human rights of the \n        people of Cuba, including--\n                    (A) releasing all political and religious \n                prisoners;\n                    (B) respecting the right to freedom of religion, \n                including the right to participate in religious \n                activities and institutions without interference, \n                harassment, or involvement of the Government of Cuba \n                for all of Cuba's religious communities;\n                    (C) returning estates and properties confiscated \n                from churches and religious communities;\n                    (D) respecting the right to freedom of assembly, \n                association, expression, press, and speech, including \n                releasing all independent journalists, bloggers, and \n                democracy and labor activists;\n                    (E) repealing or revising laws that criminalize \n                peaceful dissent, independent media, unsanctioned \n                religious activity, and nonviolent demonstrations and \n                rallies, in accordance with international standards and \n                treaties to which Cuba is a party;\n                    (F) allowing Cuban nationals free and open access \n                to United States refugee programs;\n                    (G) respecting the human rights of members of all \n                racial and ethnic minorities, including Afro-Cubans, \n                who face discrimination;\n                    (H) taking all appropriate steps to end any \n                complicity of officials of the Government of Cuba or \n                companies wholly or partly owned or controlled by the \n                Government of Cuba in human rights violations, \n                including severe forms of trafficking in persons, and \n                vigorously investigating, prosecuting, convicting, and \n                sentencing such officials and the complicit individuals \n                in such companies for such conduct;\n                    (I) satisfying, to the satisfaction of the \n                individual claims holders, all claims outstanding under \n                the International Claims Act of 1949 and the Cuban \n                Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, which \n                now total roughly $7 billion;\n                    (J) returning all fugitives from justice convicted \n                in the United States of crimes, including Joanne \n                Chesimard, Guillermo Morales, Victor Manuel Gerena, and \n                Charles Hill; and\n                    (K) ceasing the sponsorship of terrorist \n                organizations abroad or otherwise giving support and \n                refuge to such terrorist organizations, including the \n                Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FARC) of Colombia, the \n                Basque separatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), \n                and the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacioon Nacional (FALN) \n                of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nSEC. 5.
