SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart 14 of title V of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7269 et seq.) is amended--\n            (1) by inserting after the subpart heading the following:\n\n   ``CHAPTER A--SYSTEMS INTEGRATION; PROMOTION OF SCHOOL READINESS'';\n\n    and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n ``CHAPTER B--SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS\n\n``SEC. 5545. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds the following:\n            ``(1) The Surgeon General of the Public Health Service has \n        found that although 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer \n        from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of \n        impairment, in any given year fewer than 1 in 5 of these \n        children receives needed treatment. The short- and long-term \n        consequences of untreated childhood mental disorders are \n        costly, in both human and fiscal terms.\n            ``(2) School counselors, school psychologists, other \n        qualified psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, \n        and school social workers are needed to help these children and \n        to provide a variety of crucial support services.\n            ``(3) Across the United States, there are insufficient \n        resources for school-based counseling professionals, and often \n        students do not get the help they need. The current national \n        average ratio of students to school counselors in elementary \n        and secondary schools is 561 to 1.\n            ``(4) United States schools need more mental health \n        professionals, and they need the flexibility to hire the \n        professionals that will best serve their students.\n            ``(5) According to the Institute of Medicine of the \n        National Academy of Sciences, the maximum recommended ratio \n        of--\n                    ``(A) students to school counselors is 250 to 1;\n                    ``(B) students to school psychologists is 1,000 to \n                1; and\n                    ``(C) students to school social workers is 800 to \n                1.\n            ``(6) In some States, 1 school counselor typically serves \n        over 1,000 students. Ratios for school psychologists and school \n        social workers are also extremely high. In some schools, there \n        are no school-based mental health and student service providers \n        available to assist students in times of crisis, or at any \n        other time.\n            ``(7) The number of students is expected to grow \n        significantly over the next few years. During this time, many \n        school-based mental health professionals who currently serve \n        the Nation's youth will retire.\n            ``(8) Model programs using school-based mental health and \n        student service providers have reduced school suspensions, \n        reduced referrals to the principal's office, reduced the use of \n        weapons, force, and threats, and increased students' feelings \n        of safety.\n\n``SEC. 5546. PURPOSES.\n\n    ``The purposes of this chapter are to assist States and local \neducational agencies in hiring additional school-based mental health \nproviders, including additional school counselors, school \npsychologists, other qualified psychologists, child and adolescent \npsychiatrists, and school social workers to achieve each of the \nfollowing:\n            ``(1) To reduce the ratios of school-based mental health \n        and student service providers to students in elementary and \n        secondary schools in the United States to the following minimum \n        ratios recommended by the Institute of Medicine of the National \n        Academy of Sciences in its 1997 report `Schools and Health: Our \n        Nation's Investment':\n                    ``(A) 1 school counselor for every 250 students;\n                    ``(B) 1 school psychologist for every 1,000 \n                students; and\n                    ``(C) 1 school social worker for every 800 \n                students.\n            ``(2) To provide school-based mental health and student \n        services.\n            ``(3) To remove emotional, behavioral, and psychosocial \n        barriers to learning so as to enhance students' classroom \n        preparedness and ability to learn.\n            ``(4) To support school staff and teachers in improving \n        classroom management, conducting behavioral interventions to \n        improve school discipline, and developing the awareness and \n        skills to identify early warning signs of violence and the need \n        for mental health services.\n            ``(5) To support parental involvement in improving the \n        school behavior and academic success of their children.\n\n``SEC. 5547.
