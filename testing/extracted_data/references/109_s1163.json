FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than \\1/3\\ of the Nation's current workforce lacks \n        the basic skills necessary to succeed in today's labor market.\n            (2) Globalization of the economy is leading to losses of \n        jobs in key domestic industries, as well as challenges to \n        competitiveness and productivity in other domestic industries.\n            (3) To remain economically vital and competitive, the \n        Nation must invest in generating jobs and train a workforce \n        skilled enough to contribute productively to the United States \n        economy.\n            (4) Strategic planning that links workforce development and \n        economic development, and the targeting of resources to \n        industries that can build strong regional economies and create \n        jobs with living wages for workers, need to be priorities for \n        the workforce investment system.\n            (5) States and local workforce investment boards can play \n        lead roles in guiding a more strategic process for achieving \n        economic growth through workforce development.\n\nSEC. 3.
