    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Combined Heat and Power Advancement \nAct of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the removal of barriers to the development and \n        deployment of combined heat and power technologies and systems, \n        an example of an array of innovative energy-supply and energy-\n        efficient technologies and systems, would--\n                    (A) encourage technological innovation;\n                    (B) reduce energy prices;\n                    (C) spur economic development;\n                    (D) enhance productivity;\n                    (E) increase employment; and\n                    (F) improve environmental quality and energy self-\n                sufficiency;\n            (2) the level of efficiency of the United States \n        electricity-generating system has been stagnant over the past \n        several decades;\n            (3) technologies and systems available as of the date of \n        enactment of this Act, including a host of innovative onsite, \n        distributed generation technologies, could--\n                    (A) dramatically increase productivity;\n                    (B) double the efficiency of the United States \n                electricity-generating system; and\n                    (C) reduce emissions of regulated pollutants and \n                greenhouse gases;\n            (4) innovative electric technologies emit a much lower \n        level of pollutants as compared to the average quantity of \n        pollutants generated by United States electric generating \n        plants as of the date of enactment of this Act;\n            (5) a significant proportion of the United States energy \n        infrastructure will need to be replaced by 2010;\n            (6) the public interest would best be served if that \n        infrastructure were replaced by innovative technologies that \n        dramatically increase productivity, improve efficiency, and \n        reduce pollution;\n            (7) financing and regulatory practices in effect as of the \n        date of enactment of this Act do not recognize the \n        environmental and economic benefits to be obtained from the \n        avoidance of transmission and distribution losses, and the \n        reduced load on the electricity-generating system, provided by \n        onsite, combined heat and power production;\n            (8) many legal, regulatory, informational, and perceptual \n        barriers block the development and dissemination of combined \n        heat and power and other innovative energy technologies; and\n            (9) because of those barriers, United States taxpayers are \n        not receiving the benefits of the substantial research and \n        development investment in innovative energy technologies made \n        by the Federal Government.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to encourage energy productivity and \nefficiency increases by removing barriers to the development and \ndeployment of combined heat and power technologies and systems.\n\nSEC. 4.
