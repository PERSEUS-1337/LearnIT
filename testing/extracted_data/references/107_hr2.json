FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and strong economic \n        growth have ended decades of deficit spending;\n            (2) the Government is able to meet its current obligations \n        without using the social security and medicare surpluses;\n            (3) fiscal pressures will mount as an aging population \n        increases the Government's obligations to provide retirement \n        income and health services;\n            (4) social security and medicare hospital insurance \n        surpluses should be used to reduce the debt held by the public \n        until legislation is enacted that reforms social security and \n        medicare;\n            (5) preserving the social security and medicare hospital \n        insurance surpluses would restore confidence in the long-term \n        financial integrity of social security and medicare; and\n            (6) strengthening the Government's fiscal position through \n        debt reduction would increase national savings, promote \n        economic growth, and reduce its interest payments.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) prevent the surpluses of the social security and \n        medicare hospital insurance trust funds from being used for any \n        purpose other than providing retirement and health security; \n        and\n            (2) use such surpluses to pay down the national debt until \n        such time as medicare and social security reform legislation is \n        enacted.\n\nSEC. 3. PROTECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE SURPLUSES.\n\n    (a) Protection of Social Security and Medicare Surpluses.--Title \nIII of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the \nend the following new section:\n\n    ``lock-box for social security and hospital insurance surpluses\n\n    ``Sec. 316.
