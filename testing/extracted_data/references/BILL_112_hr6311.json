FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention, a drug overdose fatality occurs in the United \n        States every 14 minutes. More people now die from drug-related \n        deaths than traffic fatalities in the United States.\n            (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n        that nearly 36,500 people in the United States died from a drug \n        overdose in 2008 alone. More than 75 percent of these deaths \n        were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many could have \n        been prevented.\n            (3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses \n        increased more than 400 percent between 1980 and 1999, and more \n        than doubled between 1999 and 2008.\n            (4) Ninety-one percent of all unintentional poisoning \n        deaths are due to drugs. Poisoning deaths cost society \n        $93,464,000 in direct medical costs and $28,142,598,000 in lost \n        productivity costs in the year 2005 alone.\n            (5) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden \n        on public health and public safety resources, yet no Federal \n        agency has been tasked with stemming this crisis.\n            (6) Opioid pain medications such as oxycodone and \n        hydrocodone are involved in more than 40 percent of all drug \n        poisoning deaths. Six times as many people died of an overdose \n        from methadone prescribed to treat pain in 2009 than a decade \n        before. Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately \n        affected by opioid prescription overdoses.\n            (7) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses overdose \n        from heroin and opioid pain medications.\n            (8) In April 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n        held a public workshop in collaboration with the National \n        Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention (CDC), and with participation from the \n        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n        (SAMHSA) and the Office of National Drug Control Policy \n        (ONDCP), to discuss making naloxone more widely available \n        outside of conventional medical settings to reduce the \n        incidence of opioid overdose fatalities.\n            (9) Health practitioners often do not adequately inform \n        patients and caregivers on how to recognize overdose symptoms \n        and effectively respond by seeking emergency assistance and \n        providing naloxone and other first aid in order to save a life.\n            (10) The American Medical Association (AMA), the Nation's \n        largest physician organization, supports further implementation \n        of community-based programs that offer naloxone and other \n        opioid overdose prevention services.\n            (11) Community-based overdose prevention programs have \n        successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making \n        rescue trainings and naloxone available to first responders, \n        parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. A \n        CDC report credits overdose prevention programs with saving \n        more than 10,000 lives since 1996.\n            (12) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are \n        operating in the United States, including in major cities such \n        as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, San \n        Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New Mexico, \n        Massachusetts, and New York. In New Mexico, which has one of \n        the highest drug overdose death rates in the country, health \n        officials estimate the statewide naloxone distribution program \n        that began in 2001 has reversed 3,000 overdoses. Another \n        program in Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced overdose \n        deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011.\n            (13) Overdose prevention programs are needed in \n        correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and \n        other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing \n        after a period of abstinence.\n            (14) A real-time overdose surveillance and reporting \n        database is needed to monitor fatal and nonfatal drug \n        overdoses, identify areas of the country in need of \n        programmatic support, monitor the outcomes of overdose \n        occurrences, and enhance evaluation of community programs and \n        interventions.\n\nSEC. 3.
