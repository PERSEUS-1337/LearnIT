    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Cookstoves and Fuels Support \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Nearly one-half of the world's population cooks their \n        food over open fires or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe \n        cookstoves using wood, agricultural waste, dung, coal, or other \n        solid fuels. Smoke from the use of these traditional cookstoves \n        and open fires is associated with a number of chronic and acute \n        diseases and injuries, including respiratory illnesses such as \n        pneumonia, heart disease, and cancer, with women and young \n        children affected disproportionately.\n            (2) The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (referred to in \n        this paragraph as the ``Study'') doubled the mortality \n        estimates for exposure to smoke from cookstoves, referred to as \n        ``household air pollution'', from 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 deaths \n        annually, which the Study indicates is more than the deaths \n        from malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS combined. The Study \n        attributes 3,500,000 deaths to cookstoves smoke exposures \n        indoors and 500,000 deaths to the contribution of cookstoves to \n        outdoor air pollution. Millions more are sickened from the \n        toxic smoke and thousands suffer burns annually from open fires \n        or unsafe cookstoves and fuels. More recently, the World Health \n        Organization found that this type of household air pollution \n        claimed 4,300,000 lives in 2012. The Study ranks household air \n        pollution as the fourth worst overall health risk factor in the \n        world and as the second worst health risk factor in the world \n        for women and girls. Cookstove smoke exposures are particularly \n        prominent in developing regions of Asia and Africa.\n            (3) The amount of biomass cooking fuel required each year \n        can reach up to 2 tons per family. Where demand for local \n        biomass outstrips the natural regrowth of resources, local \n        environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity often \n        result.\n            (4) Tremendous amounts of time, a burden shouldered \n        disproportionately by women and children, is spent collecting \n        and managing cooking fuel resources. As nearby fuel supplies \n        dwindle, women are forced to go farther to find fuel to cook \n        their families' meals. In some areas, such as conflict zones or \n        refugee camps, women and girls risk rape and gender-based \n        violence during the up to 20 hours per week they spend away \n        from their communities gathering firewood.\n            (5) Recent studies show that black carbon created from \n        traditional cookstoves significantly contributes to regional \n        air pollution and climate change. Black carbon emissions from \n        residential cookstoves in developing countries account for an \n        estimated 21 percent of the total global inventory, and \n        mitigation in this sector represents a large potential public \n        health and environmental benefit.\n            (6) The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is an \n        innovative public-private partnership hosted by the United \n        Nations Foundation that was created to enable the adoption of \n        clean and efficient stoves in 100,000,000 homes by 2020. The \n        Alliance works with public, private, and non-profit partners to \n        overcome market barriers that currently impede the production, \n        deployment, and use of clean cookstoves and fuels in the \n        developing world.\n            (7) The United States Government has invested more than \n        $114,000,000 to the sector, including approximately $76,000,000 \n        in research, $31,000,000 in field implementation activities, \n        and $7,000,000 in financing, through the first 5 years of the \n        Alliance to help spur the adoption of clean cookstoves and \n        fuels in 100,000,000 households by 2020. For the second 5 years \n        of the Alliance, beginning with fiscal year 2016, the United \n        States Government anticipates support of up to $175,000,000 to \n        the sector as follows:\n                    (A) $125,000,000 from the United States Agency for \n                International Development.\n                    (B) $30,000,000 from the Department of Health and \n                Human Services through the National Institutes of \n                Health.\n                    (C) $5,000,000 from the Department of Health and \n                Human Services through the Centers for Disease Control \n                and Prevention.\n                    (D) $15,000,000 from the Environmental Protection \n                Agency.\n                    (E) The Overseas Private Investment Corporation has \n                renewed its commitment of up to $50,000,000 in debt \n                financing or insurance that meet their credit and \n                lending standards to support projects that provide \n                clean, consistent, and affordable access to energy and \n                energy savings through the manufacture, sale, and \n                purchase of cookstoves.\n            (8) This commitment targets a wide range of work, including \n        expanded research on cookstoves performance, marketing, and \n        adoption; expanded research on the health, climate and air \n        quality benefits of clean cookstoves; and expanded field \n        efforts in Kenya, Haiti, Bangladesh, and Nigeria.\n            (9) Additional Federal support may be provided to the clean \n        cooking sector, including by the Department of Energy, the \n        Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n        Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Peace \n        Corps.\n            (10) The Millennium Challenge Corporation, in 2010, prior \n        to the launch of the Alliance, committed the largest stoves-\n        related investment to date in Mongolia. The $45,300,000 \n        commitment focused on economic growth from energy efficiency \n        and improved air quality.\n\nSEC. 3.
