    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Small Business \nDevelopment Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Approximately 60 percent of Indian tribe members and \n        Alaska Natives live on or adjacent to Indian lands, which \n        suffer from an average unemployment rate of 45 percent.\n            (2) Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives own more than \n        197,000 businesses and generate more than $34,000,000,000 in \n        revenues. The service industry accounted for 17 percent of \n        these businesses (of which 40 percent were engaged in business \n        and personal services) and 15.1 percent of their total \n        receipts. The next largest was the construction industry (13.9 \n        percent and 15.7 percent, respectively). The third largest was \n        the retail trade industry (7.5 percent and 13.4 percent, \n        respectively).\n            (3) The number of businesses owned by Indian tribe members \n        and Alaska Natives grew by 84 percent from 1992 to 1997, and \n        their gross receipts grew by 179 percent in that period. This \n        is compared to all businesses which grew by 7 percent, and \n        their total gross receipts grew by 40 percent, in that period.\n            (4) The Small Business Development Center program is cost \n        effective. Clients receiving long-term counseling under the \n        program in 1998 generated additional tax revenues of \n        $468,000,000, roughly 6 times the cost of the program to the \n        Federal Government.\n            (5) Using the existing infrastructure of the Small Business \n        Development Center program, small businesses owned by Indian \n        tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians receiving \n        services under the program will have a higher survival rate \n        than the average small business not receiving such services.\n            (6) Business counseling and technical assistance is \n        critical on Indian lands where similar services are scarce and \n        expensive.\n            (7) Increased assistance through counseling under the Small \n        Business Development Center program has been shown to reduce \n        the default rate associated with lending programs of the Small \n        Business Administration.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To stimulate economies on Indian lands.\n            (2) To foster economic development on Indian lands.\n            (3) To assist in the creation of new small businesses owned \n        by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians \n        and expand existing ones.\n            (4) To provide management, technical, and research \n        assistance to small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, \n        Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.\n            (5) To seek the advice of the governing bodies of Indian \n        tribes, corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n        Claims Settlement Act and other Alaska Native entities, and \n        Native Hawaiian organizations on where small business \n        development assistance is most needed.\n            (6) To ensure that Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, \n        and Native Hawaiians have full access to existing business \n        counseling and technical assistance available through the Small \n        Business Development Center program.\n\nSEC. 3.
