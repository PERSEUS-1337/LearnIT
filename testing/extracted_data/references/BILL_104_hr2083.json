Any such declaration shall be transmitted to \n        the Congress.\n            (2) Temporary tax modifications.--If the President \n        transmits a declaration under paragraph (1) to the

specified \n                        in such declaration--\n                                    (I) the rates applicable to the \n                                first income bracket in the tax tables

to exceed 3 \n                                percent) specified in such declaration, \n                                and\n                                    (II) the amounts set fourth as tax \n                                in such tables shall be adjusted to \n                                reflect such rate reduction.\n                            (ii) Withholding adjustments.--The \n                        withholding tables or procedures prescribed by \n                        the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate \n                        under section 3402(a) of such\n

the \ncalendar year after such declaration.\n                    (B) Temporary surtax where economic growth \n                requirements subsequently satisfied.--\n                            (i) In general.--Effective for taxable \n                        years beginning in the first subsequent \n                        calendar year for which the economic growth \n                        requirements of paragraph (3) are satisfied--\n                                    (I) each rate of tax in the tax \n                                tables contained in section 1 of the \n                                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be \n                                increased by the percentage determined \n                                under paragraph (4) for such year, \n                                except the tax rate for individuals \n                                with Adjusted Gross Income of less than \n                                $50,000 and taxpayers

for such subsequent calendar year, the \n                        withholding tables or procedures prescribed by \n                        the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate \n                        under section 3402(a) of such Code shall be \n                        modified to reflect the increase in tax rates \n                        under clause (i).\n            (3) Economic growth requirements.--The economic growth \n        requirements of this paragraph are satisfied for any calendar \n        year if, before the beginning of such calendar year, the \n        President determines (and publishes such determination in the \n        Federal Register) that for such calendar year and the \n        immediately preceding calendar year--\n                    (A) economic growth as measured by the change in \n                the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to \n                be greater than 4.5 percent, and\n                    (B) the rate of national unemployment (seasonally \n                adjusted) is estimated to be less than 5.5 percent.\n            (4) Rate increase percentage.--The percentage determined \n        under this paragraph is the percentage increase in the tax \n        rates contained in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n        1986 which the President estimates will result in an aggregate \n        increase in receipts under chapter 1 of such Code equal to the \n        aggregate decrease in receipts under such Code by reason of \n        subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) without increasing the tax \n        rate for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income of less than \n        $50,000 and taxpayers filing jointly with Adjusted Gross Income \n        of less than $75,000 above the rates established in the year \n        prior to the temporary tax reduction. Such percentage shall be \n        published in the Federal Register before the beginning of the \n        calendar year for which the economic requirements of paragraph \n        (2) are satisfied.\n\nSEC. 3. TREATMENT UNDER PAY-AS-YOU-GO PROCEDURES.\n\n    Any reduction or increase in receipts resulting from section 2 of \nthis Act shall not be considered for any purpose under the Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
