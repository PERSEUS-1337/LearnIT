    "content": "The cases included in this report were compiled by searching all federal cases in the LexisAdvance legal database for \"writtenby(Kavanaugh).\" A search was then conducted of all federal cases in the Westlaw legal database using \"wb(Kavanaugh)\" as a cross-check because editors of different legal databases may vary in how they identify cases. These search results were then compared to the listing of authored opinions submitted by Judge Kavanaugh to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. These results were last compared on July 23, 2018. Not every identified result proved relevant. Moreover, in a handful of cases, an opinion authored by Judge Kavanaugh was subsequently republished with minimal, and sometimes only stylistic, changes. In cases where there are little, if any, substantive changes between two versions of a judicial opinion, only the most recent published version is listed. On the other hand, if there is a meaningful substantive difference between the two versions, both are included. Ultimately, this methodology was used to identify 306 cases in which Judge Kavanaugh is credited authoring an opinion: 301 cases decided by the D.C. Circuit and 5 cases decided on three-judge district court panels (Judge Kavanaugh is not credited as an author of any opinions issued by Eighth or Ninth Circuit panels on which he served).
