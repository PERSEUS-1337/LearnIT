    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``American Discoveries and American \nJobs Commission Act of 2011'' or the ``Herb Vederman Commission on \nAmerican Discoveries and American Jobs Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    There is established a commission to be known as the ``Commission \non American Discoveries and American Jobs'' (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Commission'').\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Federal Government is estimated to have spent \n        $147,400,000,000 in fiscal year 2010 on research and \n        development (not including funds allocated under the American \n        Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Public Law 111-5)) to meet the \n        mission requirements of the Federal departments and agencies.\n            (2) Federal Government research and development has led to \n        new products and processes for the commercial marketplace, \n        including antibiotics, plastics, airplanes, computers, \n        microwaves, and bioengineered drugs.\n            (3) There are many other technologies and techniques \n        generated in the Federal laboratory system that could have \n        market value if further developed by the industrial community, \n        and the knowledge base created by the research and development \n        activities of such system can serve as a foundation for \n        additional commercially relevant efforts in the private sector.\n            (4) Technological progress is responsible for up to half \n        the growth of the United States economy and is the principal \n        driving force behind long-term economic growth and increases in \n        our standard of living.\n            (5) It is only through commercialization, a function of the \n        business sector, that a significant stimulus to economic growth \n        occurs. Thus, there is congressional interest in accelerating \n        development and commercialization activities in the private \n        sector through legislation.\n            (6) Royalties derived from intellectual property rights \n        provide the academic community a way to support further \n        research and the business sector a means to obtain a return on \n        their financial contributions to such research.\n\nSEC. 4. DUTIES OF COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study to examine--\n            (1) the state of technology transfer from federally funded \n        research to the private sector;\n            (2) the possibilities for the Federal Government to collect \n        royalties from early research that leads to the \n        commercialization of a profitable product or technology;\n            (3) the potential adverse consequences of such royalties on \n        technology transfer, commercialization, and economic growth; \n        and\n            (4) the potential benefits of reinvesting revenues from \n        Federal royalties into science, technology, engineering, and \n        math education, and seeding future federally funded research;\n    (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the first meeting of the \nCommission, the Commission shall submit to Congress a written report of \nthe results of the study conducted under subsection (a) and \nrecommendations of regulatory and statutory changes that would enable \nthe Federal Government to--\n            (1) claim royalties from the investment of the Federal \n        Government in early research;\n            (2) reinvest such royalties in science, technology, \n        engineering, and math education and future Federal research;\n            (3) ensure products resulting from Federal research are \n        manufactured in the United States; and\n            (4) affix a symbol, marker, or insignia on commercialized \n        products to show that they had originated from federally \n        supported research.\n\nSEC. 5.
