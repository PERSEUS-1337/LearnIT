FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States faces increasing danger related to \n        methamphetamine trafficking, production, and abuse.\n            (2) Methamphetamine is a highly addictive drug that can be \n        readily made from products and precursors purchased from retail \n        stores. Step-by-step recipes can easily be found on the \n        Internet, which is a factor in the dramatic increase in the \n        number of clandestine labs in recent years.\n            (3) Methamphetamine-producing clandestine laboratories have \n        been identified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a \n        significant threat to the Nation's public health and safety. \n        The manufacture of methamphetamine produces highly toxic and \n        unstable chemicals that threaten the well-being of first \n        responders, law enforcement officers, and the community at-\n        large.\n            (4) Methamphetamine production, once exclusively found in \n        West Coast States, has rapidly moved eastward to the Midwest. \n        Production can now be found on the East Coast, in the States of \n        New York and Florida.\n            (5) Methamphetamine abuse is indiscriminate of age, \n        socioeconomic level, or race.\n            (6) Pseudoephedrine is a necessary precursor chemical in \n        the production of methamphetamine, which prompted the Drug \n        Enforcement Administration to initiate investigations regarding \n        the chemical's sale and distribution.\n            (7) Efforts to reduce access to pseudoephedrine by \n        methamphetamine producers, such as blister packaging and sales \n        thresholds, have not been effective deterrents, and \n        pseudoephedrine tablets remain pervasive in the illicit \n        production of methamphetamine.\n            (8) Pseudoephedrine in liquid gel and liquid forms have not \n        been found to be used in methamphetamine production.\n            (9) As States and communities attempt to combat and control \n        methamphetamine through restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine \n        products, it is incumbent upon the Congress to develop a \n        uniform standard for the distribution of pseudoephedrine in \n        tablet form.\n\nSEC. 2. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES; ADDITION OF EPHEDRINE ALKALOIDS TO \n              SCHEDULE V.\n\n    (a) In General.--Effective upon the expiration of 30 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, ephedrine alkaloids (including \nephedrine and pseudoesphedrine), and their salts, optical isomers, and \nsalts of optical isomers, shall be considered to be listed in schedule \nV of the schedules of controlled substances established under section \n202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act, subject to subsection (b). The \nAttorney General shall amend part 1308 of title 21, Code of Federal \nRegulations, accordingly.\n    (b) Certain Forms of Pseudoephedrine.--Subject to the authority of \nthe Attorney General under the Controlled Substances Act to designate \ndrugs or other substances as controlled substances or listed \nchemicals--\n            (1) subsection (a) does not apply to pseudoephedrine when \n        contained in a drug that is in liquid or gel form and is \n        marketed or distributed lawfully in the United States under the \n        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and\n            (2) pseudoephedrine when so contained shall be considered a \n        listed chemical.\n\nSEC. 3. REGULATION OF TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING LISTED CHEMICALS; \n              EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN DOSAGE FORMS OF PSEUDOEPHEDRINE.\n\n    (a) Definition of Regulated Transaction.--Section 102(39)(A)(iv) of \nthe Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(39)(A)(iv)) is amended--\n            (1) in the matter preceding subclause (I), by striking \n        ``unless--'' and inserting ``unless, subject to clause (v)--'';\n            (2) in subclause (I), by inserting ``in liquid or gel \n        form'' after ``pseudoephedrine'' the first place such term \n        appears; and\n            (3) in subclause (II)--\n                    (A) by inserting ``in liquid or gel form'' after \n                ``pseudoephedrine'' the first place such term appears; \n                and\n                    (B) by striking ``except that'' and all that \n                follows and inserting the following: ``except that the \n                threshold for any sale of products containing \n                pseudoephedrine products in liquid or gel form, or \n                containing phenylpropanolamine products, by retail \n                distributors or by distributors required to submit \n                reports by section 310(b)(3) shall be 9 grams of \n                pseudoephedrine or 9 grams of phenylpropanolamine in a \n                single transaction and sold in package sizes of not \n                more than 3 grams of pseudoephedrine base or 3 grams of \n                phenylpropanolamine base; or''.\n    (b) Definition of Ordinary Over-The-Counter Pseudoephedrine or \nPhenylpropanolamine Product.--Section 102(45) of the Controlled \nSubstances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(45)) is amended in the matter preceding \nsubparagraph (A) by striking ``containing pseudoephedrine or \nphenylpropanolamine that'' and inserting ``containing pseudoephedrine \nin liquid or gel form, or containing phenylpropanolamine, that''."
