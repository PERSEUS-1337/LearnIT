COMBUSTION OF TIRE-DERIVED FUEL.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n            (2) Eligible mill.--The term ``eligible mill'' means any \n        pulp or paper mill (SIC code 2611 or 2621) that burns or \n        proposes to burn tire-derived fuel.\n            (3) Emission.--The term ``emission'' means an emission into \n        the air of--\n                    (A) a criteria pollutant, including a fine \n                particulate; or\n                    (B) a hazardous air pollutant.\n            (4) Tire-derived fuel.--The term ``tire-derived fuel'' \n        means fuel derived from whole or shredded tires, including in \n        combination with another fuel.\n    (b) Requirements for Approval.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n        notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Administrator \n        shall not issue a permit under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7401 et seq.), and shall object to the issuance of a permit \n        under section 505(b) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 7661d(b)), \n        authorizing the burning of tire-derived fuel at an eligible \n        mill that is a major stationary source (as defined in section \n        111(a) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 7411(a))) unless--\n                    (A) the Administrator has listed the source as part \n                of a source category for which a performance standard \n                has been established under subsection (c); and\n                    (B) the source demonstrates to the satisfaction of \n                the Administrator that the source--\n                            (i) will install any control equipment \n                        required or make the necessary process changes \n                        before the date on which the source begins \n                        operation; and\n                            (ii) will operate at or below the required \n                        emissions performance standards as demonstrated \n                        by data from a continuous emissions monitoring \n                        device.\n            (2) Interim permits.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the \n        Administrator may approve an interim permit (including a trial \n        permit) to burn tire-derived fuel at a new eligible mill, or an \n        eligible mill in existence on the date of enactment of this \n        Act, that is a major stationary source (as defined in section \n        111(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411(a))) that \n        demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the \n        source--\n                    (A) will install--\n                            (i) an electrostatic precipitator;\n                            (ii) a Kevlar baghouse; or\n                            (iii) any other technology that achieves a \n                        reduction in emissions that is equivalent to \n                        the reduction achieved using an electrostatic \n                        precipitator or a Kevlar baghouse; and\n                    (B) will operate at or below the required emissions \n                performance standards as demonstrated by data from a \n                continuous emissions monitoring device.\n    (c) Standards for Certain Pulp and Paper Mills.--\n            (1) Establishment.--\n                    (A) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the \n                date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall \n                establish performance standards for fine particulates \n                for--\n                            (i) new eligible mills; and\n                            (ii) eligible mills in existence on the \n                        date on which the standards are proposed.\n                    (B) Requirements.--In establishing standards under \n                subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall--\n                            (i) ensure that the standards would result \n                        in reductions in emission levels that are at \n                        least equal to reductions achieved through the \n                        use of an electrostatic precipitator or Kevlar \n                        baghouse; and\n                            (ii) require pulp and paper mills that are \n                        in operation as of the date on which the \n                        standards are proposed, but that are not in \n                        compliance with those standards, to come into \n                        compliance with the standards by not later than \n                        18 months after the effective date of the \n                        standards.\n            (2) Study and report on general health effects.--Not later \n        than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n        Administrator shall conduct a study, and submit to Congress a \n        report, on the impact on human health of increased emissions, \n        especially fine particulates, from the use of tire-derived \n        fuel.\n            (3) Report on health effects on certain children.--As soon \n        as practicable after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n        Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and \n        Human Services, shall submit to Congress a report that \n        describes the rates of birth defects and childhood diseases \n        (particularly respiratory and immune system diseases) of \n        children that live or attend school within a 20-mile radius of \n        any pulp and paper mill that burns tire-derived fuel."
