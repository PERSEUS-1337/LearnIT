FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Over 1,000,000 veterans attended institutions of higher \n        education in 2012.\n            (2) Veterans face unique hardships in transitioning from \n        the battlefield to the classroom and eventually to the \n        workforce.\n            (3) The National Endowment for the Humanities' Warrior-\n        Scholar Project found that ``veterans transitioning to college \n        likely have not used academic skills since high school and have \n        difficulty adjusting to a fundamentally different social and \n        cultural environment, [leading] to veterans dropping out of \n        college before earning their degree''.\n            (4) The National Education Association found that veteran \n        students can feel lonely and vulnerable on campus and that \n        ``connecting student veterans can effectively ease this \n        isolation'' by bringing together new veteran students with \n        those who have already successfully navigated the first few \n        semesters of college.\n            (5) The unemployment rate for post--9/11 veterans far \n        outpaces both the overall non-veteran unemployment rate and the \n        unemployment rate for non-veterans entering the workforce for \n        the first time.\n            (6) According to Mission United--a United Way program that \n        helps veterans re-acclimate to civilian life--it is often \n        ``essential'' for veteran students to be mentored by ``another \n        veteran who understands their mindset and experience''.\n            (7) Veteran student centers are recognized as an \n        institutional best practice by the Student Veterans of America.\n            (8) The American Council on Education, which represents \n        more than 1,700 institutions of higher education across the \n        country, has called having a dedicated space for veterans on \n        campus ``a promising way for colleges and universities to \n        better serve veterans on campus'' and a ``critical'' component \n        of many colleges' efforts to serve their veteran students.\n            (9) Budget constraints often make it difficult or \n        impossible for institutions of higher education to dedicate \n        space to veteran offices, lounges, or student centers.\n            (10) The 110th Congress authorized the funding of veteran \n        student centers through the Centers of Excellence for Veteran \n        Student Success under part T of title VIII of the Higher \n        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1161t).\n            (11) According to the Department of Education, federally \n        funded veteran student centers and staff have generated \n        improved recruitment, retention, and graduation rates, have \n        helped veteran students feel better connected across campus, \n        and have directly contributed to student veterans' successful \n        academic outcomes.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN, AND IMPROVE VETERAN \n              STUDENT CENTERS.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--From the amounts appropriated to carry out this \nAct, the Secretary of Education shall establish a program to award \ngrants to institutions of higher education to assist in the \nestablishment, maintenance, and improvement of veteran student centers.\n    (b) Eligibility.--\n            (1) Application.--An institution of higher education \n        seeking a grant under subsection (a) shall submit to the \n        Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and \n        containing such information as the Secretary may require.\n            (2) Criteria.--The Secretary may award a grant under \n        subsection (a) to an institution of higher education if the \n        Secretary determines that the institution of higher education \n        meets the following criteria:\n                    (A) The institution has a population of not less \n                than 15,000 students, of which not less than one \n                percent are veterans or members of the Armed Forces.\n                    (B) The institution is located in a region or \n                community that has a significant population of \n                veterans.\n                    (C) The institution carries out programs or \n                activities that assist veterans in the local community.\n                    (D) The institution presents a sustainability plan \n                to demonstrate that its veteran student center will be \n                maintained and will continue to operate after the term \n                of the grant has ended.\n    (c) Use of Funds.--An institution of higher education that is \nawarded a grant under subsection (a) shall use such grant to establish, \nmaintain, or improve a veteran student center.\n    (d) Amounts Awarded.--\n            (1) Duration.--Each grant awarded under subsection (a) \n        shall be for a 4-year period.\n            (2) Total amount of grant and schedule.--Each grant awarded \n        under subsection (a) may not exceed a total of $500,000. \n        Subject to subsection (e), the Secretary shall disburse to the \n        institution of higher education the amounts awarded under the \n        grant in such amounts and at such times during the grant period \n        as the Secretary determines appropriate.\n    (e) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall annually evaluate each \ninstitution of higher education that is awarded a grant under \nsubsection (a) to determine whether the institution uses the grant in \naccordance with this section.
