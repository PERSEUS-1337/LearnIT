and\n            (3) to protect the substantial Federal investment in the \n        Point Reyes National Seashore by protecting nearby eligible \n        lands and water resources that maintain the relatively \n        undeveloped nature of the lands adjacent to Tomales and Bodega \n        Bays.\n    (c) Grants for Purchase of Easements.--To promote the purposes of \nthis section, the Secretary may make grants to eligible entities to \nprovide the Federal share of the cost of purchasing permanent \nconservation easements on eligible lands from willing sellers for the \npurpose of preserving agricultural lands.\n    (d) Negotiation, Acquisition, and Administration of Easements.--\n            (1) Acquisition of permanent easements.--Easements acquired \n        using funds provided by the Secretary under subsection (c) \n        shall be in perpetuity.\n            (2) Negotiation.--The acquisition of an easement using \n        funds provided by the Secretary under subsection (c) shall be \n        negotiated and transacted between the willing seller and the \n        eligible entity.\n            (3) Administration.--Easements acquired by an eligible \n        entity using funds provided by the Secretary under subsection \n        (c) shall be held by the eligible entity.\n            (4) Executory limitation.--If an eligible entity holding an \n        easement acquired using funds provided by the Secretary under \n        subsection (c) ceases to exist or ceases to be a nonprofit \n        organization, the eligible entity's rights and obligations \n        under the easement shall vest in the United States.\n    (e) Protection of Private Property.--\n            (1) Consent of owner required.--No interest in eligible \n        lands may be acquired using funds provided by the Secretary \n        under subsection (c) without the consent of the owner of the \n        eligible lands.\n            (2) Prohibition on land purchases.--Funds provided by the \n        Secretary under subsection (c) may not be used, or combined \n        with other funds, to acquire land in fee title.\n            (3) Regulation.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n        authorize the Secretary or any other Federal agency or official \n        to regulate the use or enjoyment of privately owned eligible \n        lands, including lands subject to easements held by an eligible \n        entity.\n    (f) Matching Funds.--\n            (1) Matching requirement.--Subject to paragraph (2), the \n        Federal share of the costs for acquiring a conservation \n        easement in eligible lands may not exceed one half of the total \n        costs of such acquisition. The non-Federal share of the \n        acquisition costs may be provided in the form of property, \n        monies, services, or in-kind contributions, fairly valued.\n            (2) Recognition of previous conservation efforts.--To the \n        extent that an eligible entity holds conservation easements on \n        eligible lands as of the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n        Secretary shall waive the match requirement of paragraph (1) \n        for that eligible entity until such time as Federal funds are \n        provided to that eligible entity under subsection (c) in an \n        amount equal to the fair market value of the conservation \n        easements, as determined by the Secretary.\n    (g) Relationship to Other Land Preservation Efforts.--The authority \nprovided by this section is in addition to, and shall not preclude the \nuse of, other authorities that may be available to the Federal \nGovernment to preserve eligible lands.\n    (h) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated $60,000,000 to the Secretary to make grants under this \nsection."
