    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Chief Martin Congressional Gold \nMedal Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) For more than 45 years, Chief Phillip Martin has \n        provided extraordinary leadership to the Mississippi Band of \n        Choctaw Indians, a federally recognized Indian tribe located in \n        the State of Mississippi, as the tribe has undertaken a long \n        and courageous journey to preserve social and cultural identity \n        while developing relative prosperity.\n            (2) The vision, guidance, and determination of Chief Martin \n        has led to the emergence of a virtual economic miracle, the \n        creation and development of a new government, and the \n        revitalization of an ancient society, a claim few governmental \n        leaders of our time are able to make.\n            (3) Chief Martin has led efforts designed to create a \n        vibrant tribal economy that would first provide jobs, then \n        dignity, and over time a higher quality of life for the Choctaw \n        people as well as neighboring communities.\n            (4) Once described as ``the worst poverty pocket in the \n        poorest State of the Union'', the Choctaws under Chief Martin's \n        leadership have evolved from subsistence sharecroppers to \n        become proprietors of a multi-enterprise, industrial and \n        commercial powerhouse.\n            (5) With the creation of nearly 9,000 permanent, full-time \n        jobs, the Choctaw tribe is now 1 of the 5 largest employers in \n        the State of Mississippi.\n            (6) Chief Martin has been guided by a belief that self-\n        reliance breeds opportunity.\n            (7) Early developments on the Choctaw reservation, while \n        modest in retrospect, were nonetheless ambitious and \n        challenging in their beginnings.\n            (8) Faced with active opposition from Federal authorities \n        and expectations of failure from many others, Chief Martin \n        tenaciously led the Choctaw tribe to establish a tribally-owned \n        construction company, then a small industrial park which \n        produced the first large scale reservation-based manufacturing \n        jobs in the Nation.\n            (9) In addition to more usual government-operated \n        enterprises, such as a transit authority, a utility commission, \n        and a public works department, the Chief also created many \n        fruitful partnerships with the private sector.\n            (10) These dynamic developments have now given the tribe a \n        solid economic foundation.\n            (11) Recognizing that the most valuable asset of any \n        community is its people, Chief Martin led the Choctaws to take \n        over direct operation of its own education system from the \n        Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n            (12) The tribe today operates the largest unified tribal \n        school system in the Nation, with 6 elementary schools, a \n        middle school, and a high school.\n            (13) Chief Martin has continued toward the goal of \n        producing a new generation of well-educated and well-trained \n        tribal members through establishment of the Choctaw Indian \n        Scholarships Program, giving all Mississippi Choctaw students \n        the opportunity to attend colleges and universities of their \n        choice.\n            (14) With the passage of the Indian Self-Determination and \n        Education Assistance Act in 1975, the Congress established the \n        concepts of self-determination, self-reliance, and tribal \n        initiative as the basis for a new covenant between the Federal \n        Government and the American Indian peoples.\n            (15) However, it has only been through the extraordinary \n        commitment and ceaseless efforts of tribal leaders, such as \n        Chief Martin, that these concepts were given life and put into \n        practice.\n            (16) ``Choctaw Self Determination'' became Chief Martin's \n        clarion call (and it remains the tribe's unofficial slogan) to \n        motivate an impoverished reservation that institutionalized \n        poverty and hopelessness to transform itself into the vibrant \n        entity that today serves as a beacon of success for other \n        tribal and non-tribal communities.\n            (17) Deeply devoted to tribal sovereignty, trust land, and \n        economic development issues, Chief Martin has improved the \n        lives of thousands in Mississippi, and is perhaps the most \n        recognized American Indian leader: he has been called ``one of \n        Indian Country's greatest leaders''.\n            (18) The outstanding example of Chief Phillip Martin \n        deserves to be recognized and honored by the United States \n        Congress.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate shall make \nappropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of the \nCongress, of a gold medal of appropriate design, to Chief Phillip \nMartin in recognition of his leadership of the Mississippi Band of \nChoctaw Indians for over 45 years, and for his invaluable contributions \nnationally to the American Indian community and particularly to the \nnative and non-native communities of Mississippi.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation referred \nto in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in \nthis Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with suitable \nemblems, devices, and inscriptions to be determined by the Secretary.\n\nSEC. 4.
