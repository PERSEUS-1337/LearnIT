An idle well does not include an active observation well.\n(e) \u201cLong-term idle well\u201d means any well that has not produced oil or natural gas or has not been used for injection for six consecutive months of continuous operation during the last 10 or more years. A long-term idle well does not include an active observation well.\n(f) \u201cEnhanced oil recovery method\u201d means the process of obtaining oil, not recovered from an oil reservoir, by utilizing certain extraction processes, including, but not limited to, thermal recovery, gas injection, chemical injection, and water flooding.\n(g) \u201cConfidential well\u201d means an exploratory well with records that the division maintains as confidential information in accordance with Section 3234.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 3106 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n3106.\n(a) The supervisor shall\nauthorize\nsupervise\nthe exploration and production of hydrocarbons, including\n, but not limited to, the\ndrilling, stimulation,\nthe\nuse of enhanced oil recovery methods and well completion techniques, operation, reworking, maintenance, and abandonment of wells and the operation, maintenance, and removal or abandonment of tanks and facilities attendant to oil and gas production, including pipelines not subject to regulation pursuant to Chapter 5.5 (commencing with Section 51010) of Part 1 of Division 1 of Title 5 of the Government Code that are within an oil and gas\nfield. These activities shall be authorized in a manner\nfield,\nso as to prevent, as far as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources; damage to underground oil and gas deposits from infiltrating water and other causes; loss of oil, gas, or reservoir energy; and damage to underground and surface waters suitable for irrigation or domestic purposes or otherwise uncontaminated waters that could be treated to be suitable for irrigation or domestic purposes.\n(b) The supervisor may allow an owner or operator of a well to drill, operate, maintain, and abandon wells utilizing all methods and practices known to the oil industry to increase the ultimate recovery of underground hydrocarbons if the supervisor finds that those methods and practices are consistent with this division. To further the elimination of waste by increasing the recovery of underground hydrocarbons, it is hereby declared as a policy of this state that the grant in an oil and gas lease or contract to a lessee or operator of the right or power, in substance, to explore for and remove all hydrocarbons from any lands in the state, in the absence of an express provision to the contrary contained in the lease or contract, is deemed to allow the lessee or contractor, or the lessee\u2019s or contractor\u2019s successors or assigns, to do what a prudent operator using reasonable diligence would do, having in mind the best interests of the lessor, lessee, and the state in producing and removing hydrocarbons, including, but not limited to, the injection of air, gas, water, or other fluids into the productive strata, the application of pressure, heat, or other means for the reduction of viscosity of the hydrocarbons, the supplying of additional motive force, or the creation of enlarged or new channels for the underground movement of hydrocarbons into production wells, when these methods or processes employed have been approved by the supervisor, except that nothing contained in this section imposes a legal duty upon the lessee or contractor, or the lessee\u2019s or contractor\u2019s successors or assigns, to conduct these operations.\n(c) The supervisor may require an operator to implement a monitoring program, designed to detect releases to the soil and water, including both groundwater and surface water, for aboveground oil production tanks and facilities.\n(d) The supervisor shall administer this division in conformance with Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 65920) of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 3203 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n3203.\n(a) The operator of any well, before commencing the work of drilling the well, shall file with the supervisor or the district deputy a written application for approval to commence drilling.

The application shall also demonstrate that the drilling and any method utilized will pose de minimis risk to public health and safety. Drilling shall not commence until written approval is given by the supervisor or the district deputy, finding that the project is consistent with Section 3106.
