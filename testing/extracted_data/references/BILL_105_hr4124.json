FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Internet has become a critical mode of global \n        communication and now presents unprecedented opportunities for \n        the development and growth of global commerce and an integrated \n        worldwide economy.\n            (2) The receipt of unsolicited commercial e-mail may result \n        in undue monetary costs to recipients who cannot refuse to \n        accept such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such \n        mail, or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and \n        discarding such mail, or for both.\n            (3) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited \n        commercial e-mail purposefully disguise the source of such mail \n        so as to prevent recipients from responding to such mail \n        quickly and easily.\n            (4) Because recipients of unsolicited commercial e-mail \n        that does not provide a return address are unable to avoid the \n        receipt of such mail through reasonable means, such mail may \n        threaten the privacy of recipients.\n            (5) By providing remedies similar to those provided with \n        respect to unsolicited facsimile transmissions and automated \n        dialing equipment in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of \n        1991, the Congress can provide privacy protections without \n        infringing important Constitutional rights or imperiling the \n        commercial development of the Internet.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL E-MAIL.\n\n    Part 1 of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by \ninserting after section 230 (47 U.S.C. 230) the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 231.
