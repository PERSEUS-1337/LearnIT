FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) record volumes of natural gas production in the United \n        States as of the date of enactment of this Act are providing \n        enormous benefits to the United States, including by--\n                    (A) reducing the need for imports of natural gas, \n                thereby directly reducing the trade deficit;\n                    (B) strengthening trade ties among the United \n                States, Canada, and Mexico;\n                    (C) providing the opportunity for the United States \n                to join the emerging global gas trade through the \n                export of liquefied natural gas;\n                    (D) creating and supporting millions of new jobs \n                across the United States;\n                    (E) adding billions of dollars to the gross \n                domestic product of the United States every year;\n                    (F) generating additional Federal, State, and local \n                government tax revenues; and\n                    (G) revitalizing the manufacturing sector by \n                providing abundant and affordable feedstock;\n            (2) large quantities of natural gas are lost due to venting \n        and flaring, primarily in areas where natural gas \n        infrastructure has not been developed quickly enough, such as \n        States with large quantities of Federal land and Indian land;\n            (3) permitting processes can hinder the development of \n        natural gas infrastructure, such as pipeline lines and \n        gathering lines on Federal land and Indian land; and\n            (4) additional authority for the Secretary of the Interior \n        to approve natural gas pipelines and gathering lines on Federal \n        land and Indian land would--\n                    (A) assist in bringing gas to market that would \n                otherwise be vented or flared; and\n                    (B) significantly increase royalties collected by \n                the Secretary of the Interior and disbursed to Federal, \n                State, and tribal governments and individual Indians.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO APPROVE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES.\n\n    Section 1 of the Act of February 15, 1901 (31 Stat. 790, chapter \n372; 16 U.S.C. 79) is amended by inserting ``, for natural gas \npipelines'' after ``distribution of electrical power''.\n\nSEC. 4.
