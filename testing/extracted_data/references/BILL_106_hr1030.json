NATIONAL COMMISSION TO ENSURE CONSUMER INFORMATION AND CHOICE \n              IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The continued success of a deregulated airline system \n        requires that consumers have full access to complete \n        information concerning airline fares, routes, and other \n        services.\n            (2) The means of distributing information about the \n        products and services of the airline industry are changing; \n        during the past four years, airlines have begun selling a \n        larger percentage of their products and services directly to \n        consumers, and Internet businesses are now offering services \n        that allow consumers to compare prices for these products and \n        services.\n            (3) Airline policies with respect to travel agencies, who \n        historically have sold a majority of the airline industry's \n        products and services, threaten the ability of consumers to \n        gather the information necessary to evaluate market prices, \n        routes, and services.\n            (4) Further reductions in the number of travel agents and \n        greater marketplace reliance on direct airline sales may result \n        in a marketplace in which consumers lack sufficient information \n        and are thereby forced to pay higher prices.\n    (b) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be known \nas the ``National Commission to Ensure Consumer Information and Choice \nin the Airline Industry'' (hereinafter in this section referred to as \nthe ``Commission'').\n    (c) Duties.--\n            (1) Study.--The Commission shall undertake a study of--\n                    (A) consumer access to information about the \n                products and services of the airline industry;\n                    (B) the effect on the marketplace of the emergence \n                of new means of distributing such products and \n                services;\n                    (C) the effect on consumers of the declining \n                financial condition of travel agents in the United \n                States; and\n                    (D) the impediments imposed by the airline industry \n                on distributors of the industry's products and \n                services, including travel agents and Internet-based \n                distributors.\n            (2) Policy recommendations.--Based on the results of the \n        study described in paragraph (1), the Commission shall \n        recommend to the President and Congress policies necessary--\n                    (A) to ensure full consumer access to complete \n                information concerning airline fares, routes, and other \n                services;\n                    (B) to ensure that the means of distributing the \n                products and services of the airline industry, and of \n                disseminating information about such products and \n                services, is adequate to ensure that competitive \n                information is available in the marketplace;\n                    (C) to ensure that distributors of the products and \n                services of the airline industry have adequate relief \n                from illegal, anticompetitive practices that occur in \n                the marketplace; and\n                    (D) to foster healthy competition in the airline \n                industry and the entry of new entrants.\n    (d) Specific Matters To Be Addressed.--In carrying out the study \nauthorized under subsection (c)(1), the Commission shall specifically \naddress the following:\n            (1) Consumer access to information.--With respect to \n        consumer access to information regarding the services and \n        products offered by the airline industry:\n                    (A) The state of such access.\n                    (B) The effect in the next 5 years of the making of \n                alliances in the airline industry.\n                    (C) Whether and to what degree the trends regarding \n                such access will produce benefits to consumers.\n            (2) Means of distribution.--With respect to the means of \n        distributing the products and services of the airline industry:\n                    (A) The state of such means of distribution.\n                    (B) The roles played by travel agencies and \n                Internet-based providers of travel information and \n                services in distributing such products and services.\n                    (C) Whether the policies of the United States \n                promote the access of consumers to multiple means of \n                distribution.\n            (3) Airline reservation systems.--With respect to airline \n        reservation systems:\n                    (A) The rules, regulations, policies, and practices \n                of the industry governing such systems.\n                    (B) How trends in such systems will affect \n                consumers, including--\n                            (i) the effect on consumer access to flight \n                        reservation information;
