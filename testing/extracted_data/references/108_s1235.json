    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Winning the Peace Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) President George W. Bush has stated that the United \n        States security strategy takes into account the fact that \n        ``America is now threatened less by conquering states than we \n        are by failing ones''.\n            (2) Failed states can provide safe haven for a diverse \n        array of transnational threats, including terrorist networks, \n        militia and warlords, global organized crime, and narcotics \n        traffickers who threaten the security of the United States and \n        the allies of the United States.\n            (3) The inability of the authorities in a failed state to \n        provide basic services can create or contribute to humanitarian \n        emergencies.\n            (4) It is in the interest of the United States and the \n        international community to bring conflict and humanitarian \n        emergencies stemming from failed states to a lasting and \n        sustainable close.\n            (5) Since the end of the Cold War, United States military, \n        diplomatic, and humanitarian personnel have been engaged in \n        major post-conflict reconstruction efforts in such places as \n        Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, East Timor, and \n        Afghanistan.\n            (6) Assisting failed states in emerging from violent \n        conflict is a complex and long-term task, as demonstrated by \n        the experience that 50 percent of such states emerging from \n        conditions of violent conflict slip back into violence within 5 \n        years.\n            (7) In 2003, the bipartisan Commission on Post-Conflict \n        Reconstruction created by the Center for Strategic and \n        International Studies and the Association of the United States \n        Army, released a report explaining that ``United States \n        security and development agencies still reflect their Cold War \n        heritage. The kinds of complex crises and the challenge of \n        failed states encountered in recent years do not line up with \n        these outdated governmental mechanisms. If regional stability \n        is to be maintained, economic development advanced, lives \n        saved, and transnational threats reduced, the United States and \n        the international community must develop a strategy and enhance \n        capacity for pursuing post-conflict reconstruction.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
