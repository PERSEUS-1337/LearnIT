FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In 1903 and 1904, after presenting testimony before the \n        Dawes Commission, ancestors of the Jena Band of Choctaw were \n        identified as ``Fullblood Mississippi Choctaw Indians''.\n            (2) More than 60 percent of the membership on the Jena Band \n        of Choctaw roll dated December 1, 1984, and later submitted to \n        the Assistant Secretary, Indian Affairs, on May 2, 1985, can \n        document possessing one-half or more Choctaw Indian blood \n        quantum based on descent from individuals listed as \n        ``Mississippi Choctaw'' by the Dawes Commission or as \n        ``Choctaw'' on the Indian Schedules of the 1900 Federal \n        Population Census.\n            (3) High blood degree such as that demonstrated and \n        documented by the Jena Band of Choctaw, although not a \n        requirement for maintaining a Federal tribal relationship \n        provides exceptional evidence which supports confirmation of \n        that relationship outside the normal administrative process, \n        because a group cannot maintain a high blood degree without a \n        continuity of close and significant social relationships which \n        in themselves demonstrate distinct social community.\n            (4) The Jena Band of Choctaw has retained a distinct \n        dialect of the Choctaw language on a continuous basis since \n        historic times, thus, providing supporting evidence that the \n        Jena Band has maintained itself as a separate and distinct \n        historic band of Choctaw.\n            (5) The Jena Band's Choctaw ancestors resided in close \n        proximity in historic Catahoula Parish, the predecessor to \n        modern Catahoula and La Salle Parishes, according to the 1880, \n        1900 and 1910 Federal population censuses; Federal documents \n        place the members of the Tribe in this same area in the 1930's \n        and 1950's; 72 percent of the Tribe's current membership still \n        resides in La Salle, and neighboring Grant and Rapides \n        Parishes, thus providing supporting evidence for continuity of \n        membership and location.\n            (6) The Jena Band of Choctaw can document and identify \n        traditional leaders by name from 1850 to 1968 and elected \n        leaders from 1974 to the present, which in the historical \n        context of their community provides supporting evidence for \n        continuity of political influence.\n            (7) Confirmation of the Federal relationship with the Tribe \n        is supported by all the federally recognized tribes in \n        Louisiana and by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    For purposes of this Act:\n            (1) The term ``Tribe'' means the Jena Band of Choctaw \n        Indians of Louisiana.\n            (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n        Interior.\n            (3) The term ``Interim Council'' means the Board of \n        Directors of the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians of Louisiana.\n            (4) The term ``member'' means an individual who is enrolled \n        on the membership roll of the Tribe.\n            (5) The term ``State'' means the State of Louisiana.\n\nSEC. 4.
