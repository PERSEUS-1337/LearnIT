(a) The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the service philosophy of the Social Security \n        Administration recognizes that the effective administration of \n        programs depends upon the goodwill and acceptance of the \n        public;\n            (2) the Statement of Objectives of the Social Security \n        Administration in the year of 1958 recognized that public \n        confidence and cooperation is partially based on the locations \n        and appearances of offices;\n            (3) the mission of the Social Security Administration \n        touches the lives of virtually all United States citizens and \n        therefore offices of the Administration need to be readily \n        accessible to all citizens regardless of residence;\n            (4) many United States citizens, especially many among the \n        handicapped and the elderly, need personal attention to needs \n        and should not be unnecessarily deprived of access to agency \n        officers;\n            (5) discrepancies exist between the formal procedures for \n        closing, consolidating, and recategorizing Social Security \n        Administration offices and the practice often used;\n            (6) the procedures used for such decisions are inconsistent \n        and often too informal;\n            (7) the procedures used in many closings, moves, and \n        recategorizations have not adequately considered the interests \n        of the individuals affected by the decisions; and\n            (8) all changes in the status and location of Social \n        Security Administration offices should be considered in such a \n        way as to not undermine public confidence in the Social \n        Security program.\n    (b) The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) ensure that the public interest is considered and \n        protected in all decisions to close, consolidate, or \n        recategorize Social Security Administration offices; and\n            (2) establish a fair procedure to be followed in all such \n        decisions.\n\n   consolidation, closing, or recategorization of a social security \n                         administration office\n\n    Sec. 3. Title VII of the Social Security Act is amended by adding \nat the end thereof the following new section:\n\n   ``consolidation, closing or recategorization of a social security \n                         administration office\n\n    ``Sec. 712.
