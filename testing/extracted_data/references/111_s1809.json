EMISSION CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR AFTERMARKET CONVERSION \n              SYSTEMS.\n\n    Part A of title II of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521 et seq.) is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``SEC. 220. EMISSION CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR AFTERMARKET \n              CONVERSION SYSTEMS.\n\n    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Aftermarket conversion system.--The term `aftermarket \n        conversion system' has the meaning given the term in section \n        85.502 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect \n        on the date of enactment of this section).\n            ``(2) Aftermarket conversion test group.--The term \n        `aftermarket conversion test group' means a group of vehicles \n        or engines identified pursuant to subsection (b)(4) for the \n        purpose of testing aftermarket conversion systems.\n    ``(b) Certificates of Conformity.--\n            ``(1) In general.--In the case of an aftermarket conversion \n        system, the certificate of conformity issued by the \n        Administrator for 1 or more aftermarket conversion test \n        groups--\n                    ``(A) shall not expire; and\n                    ``(B) shall continue to apply in subsequent \n                calendar years.\n            ``(2) Subsequent recertification.--No recertification of an \n        aftermarket conversion system shall be required with respect to \n        the aftermarket conversion test group covered by the \n        certificate.\n            ``(3) Name changes.--The names of test groups covered by a \n        certificate of conformity described in paragraph (1) shall not \n        change from year to year.\n            ``(4) Identification of multiple vehicle makes, models, \n        manufacturers, and standards.--For purposes of aftermarket \n        conversion, the Administrator shall--\n                    ``(A) establish criteria for use in identifying \n                similar vehicle makes, models, original equipment \n                manufacturers, emission standards, and different model \n                years that may be used under a single aftermarket \n                conversion test group; and\n                    ``(B) accept the aftermarket conversion test group \n                established under subparagraph (A) on an aftermarket \n                conversion system manufacturer application for a \n                certificate of conformity.\n    ``(c) Carryover Certification for Additional Model Years.--At the \nrequest of an aftermarket conversion system manufacturer, the \nAdministrator shall allow the submission of previous vehicle emission \ntest data and on-board diagnostic II system test data for the \ncertification of additional model year vehicles if the aftermarket \nconversion system manufacturer is able to demonstrate that neither the \naftermarket conversion system nor the design and specifications of the \napplicable vehicle model are substantially different, from those \nidentified in the original certificate of conformity, in a way that \ncould affect the compliance of the aftermarket conversion system.\n    ``(d) Carry-Across Certification.--The Administrator shall \npromulgate regulations to allow an aftermarket conversion system \nmanufacturer to use emission test data and on-board diagnostic II \nsystem test data generated for a single certified test group to serve \nas the basis for certifying additional test groups upon a showing that \nthe additional test groups are sufficiently similar, even if produced \nby different original equipment manufacturers.\n    ``(e) Use of Assigned Deterioration Factors.--A manufacturer of \naftermarket conversion systems may use deterioration factors assigned \nby the Environmental Protection Agency without regard to any sales \nlimits imposed on small-volume manufacturers.\n    ``(f) Waiver of Certain Testing Requirements.--In certifying an \naftermarket conversion system, the Administrator shall waive any \nemission testing and nonexhaust emission testing requirements \npertaining to the fuel on which the vehicle or engine was originally \ncertified to run, if the aftermarket conversion system manufacturer is \nable to demonstrate that waiving the testing requirements is \nappropriate.\n    ``(g) On-Board Diagnostic Requirements.--The Administrator shall \npromulgate regulations applicable to on-board diagnostic systems for \naftermarket conversion systems that--\n            ``(1) ensure that aftermarket conversion systems which are \n        equipped with on-board diagnostic systems are effective at \n        monitoring critical emission components;\n            ``(2) take into account the inability of an aftermarket \n        conversion system manufacturer to access proprietary on-board \n        diagnostic technology of an original equipment manufacturer; \n        and\n            ``(3) are sufficiently flexible to encourage the increased \n        use of alternative fueled vehicles.\n    ``(h) Older Vehicles.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Conversion of a vehicle outside of the \n        useful life of the vehicle, as specified on the certificate of \n        conformity of the original equipment manufacturer, to \n        alternative fuel operation shall not--\n                    ``(A) be considered to be tampering under section \n                203, if the aftermarket conversion system manufacturer \n                or the person performing the conversion is able to \n                demonstrate that the development and engineering \n                sophistication of the conversion technology is--\n                            ``(i) matched to an appropriate vehicle or \n                        group of vehicles; and\n                            ``(ii) well-designed and installed in \n                        accordance with good engineering judgment so \n                        that the installation of the aftermarket \n                        conversion system does not degrade emission \n                        performance, as compared to the performance of \n                        the vehicle or vehicles before the conversion; \n                        or\n                    ``(B) require the issuance by the Administrator of \n                any certificate of conformity.\n            ``(2) Label.--Upon conversion of a vehicle described in \n        paragraph (1), the person performing the conversion shall affix \n        to the motor vehicle a label that includes a statement that--\n                    ``(A) the vehicle has been equipped with an \n                aftermarket conversion system; and\n                    ``(B) the installation of that system occurred \n                outside of the useful life of the vehicle.\n            ``(3) No preclusion of orders.--Nothing in this section \n        precludes the Administrator from issuing an order to prohibit \n        the manufacture, sale, distribution, or installation of an \n        aftermarket conversion system if the Administrator has evidence \n        that the installation of the aftermarket conversion system on a \n        vehicle outside of the useful life of the vehicle degrades \n        emission performance.''."
