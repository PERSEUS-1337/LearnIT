SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Uniform Hazardous \nWaste Treatment Act of 1994''.\n    (b) References to the Solid Waste Disposal Act.--Whenever in this \nAct an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or \nrepeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be \nconsidered to be made to a section or other provision of the Solid \nWaste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Cement kilns produce cement kiln dust that has caused \n        and, if not properly controlled, will continue to cause \n        contamination of air, soil, and surface and ground water, and \n        that present unacceptable hazards to human health and the \n        environment.\n            (2) Cement kiln dust and cement products produced from \n        kilns that burn hazardous waste contain concentrations of heavy \n        metals, particularly lead, at levels significantly higher than \n        that produced in cement kilns that do not burn hazardous waste.\n            (3) Widespread burning of hazardous wastes in cement kilns \n        under current regulations discourages preferable forms of \n        recycling, reclamation, and reuse.\n            (4) Existing statutes and regulations are inadequate to \n        effectively monitor and control the hazards to human health and \n        the environment posed by cement kilns.\n            (5) Current regulations permit cement kilns to burn fuel \n        comprised of hazardous waste materials with little or no fuel \n        value blended with other materials and wastes.\n            (6) The public has not had adequate notice and opportunity \n        to comment on the increasingly large quantities of hazardous \n        wastes that cement kilns are burning.\n            (7) Current regulation of cement kilns fosters continued \n        use of cement kilns that maximize environmental pollution and \n        discourages introduction of less polluting cement-making \n        technologies that are currently available.\n\nSEC. 3. SPECIFICATIONS FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE FUELS BURNED IN COMBUSTION \n              UNITS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 3004(q) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is \namended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(3)(A) Facilities that burn fuel for purposes of energy recovery \nshall not burn fuel containing any quantity of hazardous waste \nidentified or listed pursuant to section 3001, unless such fuel is \nconforming hazardous waste fuel.\n    ``(B) Within 12 months of the date of the enactment of this \nsubparagraph, the Administrator shall promulgate quantitative \nspecifications for conforming hazardous waste fuel to ensure that fuel \ncontaining hazardous waste is burned to recover useful energy, and that \nconforming hazardous waste fuel has physical, chemical, thermal and \nenergy-related properties equivalent to standard fuels such as coal and \noil. Such specifications shall include at a minimum:\n            ``(i) British thermal unit (BTU) content.\n            ``(ii) Metals content.\n            ``(iii) Chlorinated hydrocarbon content.\n            ``(iv) Sulfur content.\n            ``(v) Halogens content.\n            ``(vi) Hazardous waste content of the fuel sufficient to \n        ensure complete combustion of the hazardous waste components of \n        the fuel, to limit the ash content of the combustion residue, \n        and to minimize the amount of ash contained in cement kiln dust \n        and clinker.''.\n    (b) Definition.--Section 1004 is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new paragraph:\n    ``(42) The term `conforming hazardous waste fuel' means any fuel to \nbe burned in a facility which burns fuel for purposes of energy \nrecovery that contains any amount of hazardous waste and meets the \nspecifications established under section 3004(q)(3)(B), except that the \nfuel does not contain any hazardous waste component that does not meet \nthe specifications when that component first becomes subject to \nregulation under this subchapter.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

The Administrator's \nauthorization to modify certain subchapter C requirements pursuant to \nsubsection (x) of this section, insofar as it relates to the regulation \nof cement kiln dust, shall not extend to cement kiln dust produced in a \ncement kiln that burns conforming hazardous waste fuel.\n    ``(B) Standards applicable to the land disposal of cement kiln dust \nproduced in a cement kiln that burns conforming hazardous waste fuel \npursuant to this paragraph shall be not less stringent than the \nstandards in effect as of the date of the enactment of this \nsubparagraph for landfills, waste piles or land farms regulated under \nthis subchapter.\n    ``(C) Cement kiln dust produced in a cement kiln that burns \nconforming hazardous waste fuel is subject to any land disposal \ntreatment standards promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to \nsubsection (m) of this section applicable to the particular hazardous \nwaste contained in the conforming hazardous waste fuel.''.\n\nSEC. 5. CEMENT KILN DESIGN AND OPERATING STANDARDS.\n\n    Section 3004(q), as amended by section 4, is further amended by \nadding at the end the following new paragraph:\n    ``(5)(A) Not later than 12 months after the date of the enactment \nof this subparagraph, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations \nestablishing such standards for design and operation of cement kilns \nthat burn conforming hazardous waste fuel as may be necessary to \nprotect human health and the environment, including standards for, at a \nminimum, the following:\n            ``(i) The design and construction of a new or modified \n        cement kiln that burns conforming hazardous waste fuel.\n            ``(ii) The handling, storage and combustion of conforming \n        hazardous waste fuel pursuant to protective operating methods, \n        techniques and practices.\n            ``(iii) Contingency plans to anticipate and minimize \n        foreseeable potential hazards associated with the \n        transportation, storage and combustion of conforming hazardous \n        waste fuel, including damage from accidental spills, leaks, \n        discharges, emissions, or other releases into the environment \n        of conforming hazardous waste fuel. Each such contingency plan \n        shall take into consideration the location of the kiln, and its \n        proximity to population centers, wetlands, and waters of the \n        United States.\n    ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `modified cement \nkiln' includes the following alterations to a cement kiln that, as of \nthe date of the enactment of this subparagraph, burns conforming \nhazardous waste fuel:\n            ``(i) The addition of a kiln.\n            ``(ii) The addition of a new waste feed process.\n            ``(iii) Any other alteration of a cement kiln or cement \n        kiln facility that would require modification of a permit \n        issued pursuant to section 3005.''.\n\nSEC. 6.
