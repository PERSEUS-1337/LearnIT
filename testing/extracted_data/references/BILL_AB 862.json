The department shall create and maintain online capability for reporting.\n(g) Operators of certified farmers\u2019 markets may establish rules and procedures that are more restrictive and stringent than state laws or regulations governing or implementing this chapter, so long as the rules and procedures are not in conflict with state laws or regulations.\n(h) Except for certified farmers\u2019 markets operated by government agencies, nonprofit entities and other qualified operators of certified farmers\u2019 markets shall be considered private entities and may take actions, adopt rules, and impose requirements they deem necessary for the proper and honest operation of their market, subject to the application of any state or other laws.

The application shall include the times and location of the market, the name and contact information for the operator of the market, and the agent for service of process for the operator. Upon approval of an application, the county agricultural commissioner shall issue to the operator a certified farmers\u2019 market certificate.\n(b) A certified farmers\u2019 market certificate issued by a county agricultural commissioner shall be valid for 12 months from the date of issue, and may be renewed annually thereafter. The county agricultural commissioner shall inspect every certified farmers\u2019 market within his or her jurisdiction at least once for every six months of operation. At the time of application or renewal, the county agricultural commissioner shall provide a schedule of fees that reflects an estimate of expenses for inspections and may charge a certification and inspection fee equal to the actual expenses incurred.\n(c) (1) (A) Before selling at a certified farmers\u2019 market, a producer shall register with the department by applying for and obtaining a certificate from the county agricultural commissioner\u2019s office in the county in which the producer\u2019s land or facility is located. The application shall include a declaration by the producer that he or she is knowledgeable of and intends to produce in accordance with good agricultural practices, as outlined in the Small Farm Food Safety Guidelines published by the department. Upon approval of an application, the county agricultural commissioner shall issue to the producer a certified producer\u2019s certificate.\n(B) A declaration made pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be used to infer that the producer is not required to comply with other state or federal laws relative to food safety and good agricultural practices.\n(2) As part of obtaining or renewing a certified producer certificate, a producer farming fruit, vegetables, nuts, herbs, and similar crops shall annually submit to the county agricultural commissioner\u2019s office in the county in which the producer\u2019s land or facility is located information requested by the department about the specific crops that he or she will harvest or intends to harvest for sale directly to the public. The secretary may promulgate regulations specifying the information a producer is required to submit.\n(3) A certified producer\u2019s certificate issued by a county agricultural commissioner shall be valid for up to 12 months from the date of issue and may be renewed annually thereafter. The county agricultural commissioner in each county shall perform at least one onsite inspection for all new certified producer\u2019s certificate applicants, and may perform additional inspections as needed of the property or properties listed on the certified producer\u2019s certificate issued in his or her county as deemed appropriate by the county agricultural commissioner to verify production of the commodities being sold at a certified farmers\u2019 market or the existence in storage of the producer\u2019s actual harvested production, or both, of any product being sold at a certified farmers\u2019 market. Where practical or purposeful, verification inspections shall be made when the actual harvest or sale of the commodity in question is occurring. The county agricultural commissioner shall provide to the producer a schedule of fees that reflects an estimate of expenses for certification or inspection at the time of application or renewal or before any needed additional verification inspection, and may charge a certification and inspection fee equal to the actual expenses incurred.\n(d) Renewal of a certified farmers\u2019 market certificate or certified producer\u2019s certificate may be denied by either the department or a county agricultural commissioner if a certified farmers\u2019 market or a producer is delinquent in the payment of the required state fee or a county certification and inspection fee or administrative civil penalty authorized pursuant to this chapter. The certificate may be eligible for renewal when all outstanding balances and associated penalties or administrative fines have been paid to the department or the respective county or counties.\nSEC. 7.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution.\nHowever, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code."
