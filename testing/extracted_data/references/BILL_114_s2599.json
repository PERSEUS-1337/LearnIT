FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this \n        Act, hotel rooms are often advertised at a rate and later in \n        the buying process mandatory fees are disclosed that were not \n        included in the advertised room rate.\n            (2) The mandatory fees described in paragraph (1) are \n        sometimes called by names such as ``resort fees'' or ``facility \n        fees'' and they are all mandatory and charged by the hotel in \n        addition to advertised room rates.\n            (3) The number of hotels that charged a mandatory resort \n        fees is growing as of the day before the date of the enactment \n        of this Act.\n            (4) Advertising that does not reflect the true mandatory \n        cost of a hotel stay is deceptive.\n            (5) The Federal Trade Commission has authority under \n        section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to \n        regulate and prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in \n        or affecting commerce.\n            (6) In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission exercised its \n        authority under section 5 to issue warning letters to 22 hotel \n        operators. In that letter, the Commission cautioned hotel \n        operators that mandatory resort fees could confuse consumers in \n        violation of section 5(a)(2) of the Federal Trade Commission \n        Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(2)).\n\nSEC. 3.
