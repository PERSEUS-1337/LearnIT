    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic Wasting Disease Support for \nStates Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Chronic wasting disease.--The term ``chronic wasting \n        disease'' means the animal disease afflicting deer and elk \n        that--\n                    (A) is a transmissible disease of the nervous \n                system resulting in distinctive lesions in the brain; \n                and\n                    (B) belongs to the group of diseases known as \n                transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which group \n                includes scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and \n                Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n            (2) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n        meaning given the term in section 4 of the Indian Self-\n        Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain \n        primacy and policy-making authority with regard to wildlife \n        management, and nothing in this Act interferes with or \n        otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing \n        wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring the \n        incidence of chronic wasting disease.\n            (2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease \n        found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and \n        vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased \n        occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse \n        locations in recent months necessitates an escalation in \n        research, surveillance, monitoring, and management activities \n        focused on containing and managing this lethal disease.\n            (3) As the States move to manage existing levels of chronic \n        wasting disease and insulate noninfected wild and captive \n        cervid populations from the disease, the Federal Government \n        should endeavor to provide integrated and holistic financial \n        and technical support to these States.\n            (4) Relevant Federal agencies should provide consistent, \n        coherent, and integrated support structures and programs for \n        the benefit of State wildlife and agricultural administrators, \n        as chronic wasting disease can move freely between captive and \n        wild cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, tribal, \n        and local land management jurisdictions.\n            (5) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n        Agriculture, and other affected Federal authorities can provide \n        consistent, coherent, and integrated support systems under \n        existing legal authorities.\n\n             TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ACTIVITIES\n\nSEC. 101.
