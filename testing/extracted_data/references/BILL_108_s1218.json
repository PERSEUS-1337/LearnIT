FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The rich biodiversity of marine organisms provides \n        society with an essential biomedical resource, a promising \n        source of novel compounds with therapeutic potential, and a \n        potentially important contribution to the national economy.\n            (2) The diversity of ocean life and research on the health \n        of marine organisms, including marine mammals and other \n        sentinel species, helps scientists in their efforts to \n        investigate and understand human physiology and biochemical \n        processes, as well as providing a means for monitoring the \n        health of marine ecosystems.\n            (3) The oceans drive climate and weather factors causing \n        severe weather events and shifts in temperature and rainfall \n        patterns that affect the density and distribution of disease-\n        causing organisms and the ability of public health systems to \n        address them.\n            (4) The oceans act as a route of exposure for human disease \n        and illnesses through ingestion of contaminated seafood and \n        direct contact with seawater containing toxins and disease-\n        causing organisms.\n            (5) During the past two decades, the incidence of harmful \n        blooms of algae and hypoxia has increased in United States \n        coastal waters, including the Great Lakes, and around the \n        world, contaminating shellfish, causing widespread fish kills, \n        threatening marine environmental quality and resulting in \n        substantial economic losses to coastal communities.\n            (6) Existing Federal programs and resources support \n        research in a number of these areas, but gaps in funding, \n        coordination, and outreach have impeded national progress in \n        addressing ocean health issues.\n            (7) National investment in a coordinated program of \n        research and monitoring would improve understanding of marine \n        ecosystems, allow prediction and prevention of marine public \n        health problems and assist in realizing the potential of the \n        oceans to contribute to the development of effective new \n        treatments of human diseases and a greater understanding of \n        human biology.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide for--\n            (1) Presidential support and coordination of interagency \n        ocean science programs; and\n            (2) development and coordination of a comprehensive and \n        integrated United States ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \n        research and monitoring program that will assist this Nation \n        and the world to understand, use and respond to the role of the \n        oceans in human health.\n\nSEC. 3. INTERAGENCY OCEANS AND HUMAN HEALTH RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Coordination.--The President, through the National Science and \nTechnology Council, shall coordinate and support a national research \nprogram to improve understanding of the role of the oceans in human \nhealth.\n    (b) Implementation Plan.--Within 1 year after the date of enactment \nof this Act, the National Science and Technology Council, through the \nDirector of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall develop \nand submit to the Congress a plan for coordinated Federal activities \nunder the program. Nothing in this subsection is intended to duplicate \nor supersede the activities of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful \nAlgal Blooms and Hypoxia established under section 603 of the Harmful \nAlgal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 (16 U.S.C. \n1451 note). In developing the plan, the Committee will consult with the \nInter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia. Such plan \nwill build on and complement the ongoing activities of the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science \nFoundation, and other departments and agencies and shall--\n            (1) establish, for the 10-year period beginning in the year \n        it is submitted, the goals and priorities for Federal research \n        which most effectively advance scientific understanding of the \n        connections between the oceans and human health, provide usable \n        information for the prediction of marine-related public health \n        problems and use the biological potential of the oceans for \n        development of new treatments of human diseases and a greater \n        understanding of human biology;\n            (2) describe specific activities required to achieve such \n        goals and priorities, including the funding of competitive \n        research grants, ocean and coastal observations, training and \n        support for scientists, and participation in international \n        research efforts;\n            (3) identify and address, as appropriate, relevant programs \n        and activities of the Federal agencies and departments that \n        would contribute to the program;\n            (4) consider and use, as appropriate, reports and studies \n        conducted by Federal agencies and departments, the National \n        Research Council, the Ocean Research Advisory Panel, the \n        Commission on Ocean Policy and other expert scientific bodies;\n            (5) make recommendations for the coordination of program \n        activities with ocean and human health-related activities of \n        other national and international organizations;
