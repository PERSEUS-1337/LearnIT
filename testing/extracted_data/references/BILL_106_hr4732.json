FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n        (OPEC), in its capacity as an oil cartel, has been a critical \n        factor in withholding production from the market and driving up \n        oil prices approximately 300 percent from January 1999 to June \n        2000.\n            (2) Nationwide, gasoline prices have increased \n        approximately 60 cents a gallon since the beginning of 1999 \n        with crude oil prices increasing 48 cents over this same time \n        period.\n            (3) The Department of Energy's weekly survey showed the \n        average cost of gasoline in the United States increased 5 cents \n        a gallon to $1.68 from the second to the third week of June \n        2000, a record high for a fourth week in a row.\n            (4) Price declines in the cost of oil in April 2000, \n        following the March 2000 OPEC meetings, have been reversed \n        because OPEC output did not meet global demand and supply \n        conditions. When OPEC members met in March 2000, quotas were \n        not set high enough for refiners around the world to rebuild \n        crude stocks depleted by winter heating demand.\n            (5) Crude oil stocks in the United States are only \n        31,000,000 barrels above the lowest operational inventories \n        ever observed in recent times (the equivalent of 2 days of \n        refinery operations) and 20,000,000 barrels under the normal \n        range for the month of June.\n            (6) The United States needs to make a systematic review of \n        its bilateral and multilateral policies and those of all \n        international organizations and international financial \n        institutions to ensure that these policies are not directly or \n        indirectly supporting the oil price fixing activities, \n        policies, and programs of OPEC.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) Policy With Respect to International Organizations.--It shall \nbe the policy of the United States that the extent to which each \ninternational organization supports, or otherwise recognizes, OPEC will \nbe an important determinant in the relationship between the United \nStates and this organization.\n    (b) Policy With Respect to International Financial Institutions.--\nIt shall be the policy of the United States that the extent to which \neach international financial institution supports or otherwise \nrecognizes OPEC, will be an important determinant in the relationship \nbetween the United States and the institution.\n    (c) Policy With Respect to the Energy and Development Activities.--\nThe United States should carefully review all the energy development \nprojects and programs administered by the United States Agency for \nInternational Development in developing countries to ensure that these \nprojects and programs do not indirectly or inadvertently support the \nactivities of OPEC.\n\nSEC. 4. POLICY TOWARD THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.\n\n    (a) Report to the Congress on Activities of the International \nFinancial Institutions.--No later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the Congress a \nreport that contains the following:\n            (1) A description of any loan, guarantee, or technical \n        assistance provided or to be provided by any international \n        financial institution that does or would directly or indirectly \n        support any activity or program of OPEC or any other cartel, or \n        any member of OPEC or any other cartel, engaging in production \n        cutbacks or other market-distorting practices.\n            (2) A description of the energy sector loans of, technical \n        assistance provided by, and policies of each international \n        financial institution, and an analysis of the extent to which \nthe loans, assistance, or policies promote the complete dismantlement \nof international oil price fixing arrangements and the development of a \nmarket-based system for the exploration, production, and marketing of \npetroleum resources.\n    (b) United States Position in International Financial \nInstitutions.--The United States Executive Directors at each \ninternational financial institution shall use the voice, vote, and \ninfluence of the United States to oppose the provision of any loan, \nguarantee, or technical assistance by the institution that would \ndirectly or indirectly support the activities and programs of OPEC or \nany other cartel, or any member of OPEC or any other cartel, engaging \nin production cutbacks or other market-distorting practices.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORT RELATING TO THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION \n              AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD).\n\n    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nthe President shall prepare and transmit to Congress a report that--\n            (1) describes the efforts of the Organization for Economic \n        Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review the market-\n        distorting practices of international cartels, including OPEC, \n        and recommends specific actions that the member countries of \n        the OECD can undertake to combat such practices; and\n            (2) describes actions to be taken by the United States to \n        ensure that the OECD expands upon its activities and programs \n        regarding the operation of international cartels.\n\nSEC. 6.
