    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nSection 261 of the Penal Code is amended to read:\n261.\n(a) Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator, under any of the following circumstances:\n(1) Where a person is incapable, because of a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability, of giving legal consent, and this is known or reasonably should be known to the person committing the act. Notwithstanding the existence of a conservatorship pursuant to the provisions of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Part 1 (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code), the prosecuting attorney shall prove, as an element of the crime, that a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability rendered the alleged victim incapable of giving consent.\n(2) Where it is accomplished against a person\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\n(3) Where a person is\nprevented from resisting\nincapable of giving consent\nby any intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the accused.\n(4) Where a person is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act, and this is known to the accused. As used in this paragraph, \u201cunconscious of the nature of the act\u201d means incapable of\nresisting\ngiving consent\nbecause the victim meets any one of the following conditions:\n(A) Was unconscious or asleep.\n(B) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant that the act occurred.\n(C) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant of the essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator\u2019s fraud in fact.\n(D) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant of the essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator\u2019s fraudulent representation that the sexual penetration served a professional purpose when it served no professional purpose.\n(5) Where a person submits under the belief that the person committing the act is someone known to the victim other than the accused, and this belief is induced by any artifice, pretense, or concealment practiced by the accused, with intent to induce the belief.\n(6) Where the act is accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other person, and there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetrator will execute the threat. As used in this paragraph, \u201cthreatening to retaliate\u201d means a threat to kidnap or falsely imprison, or to inflict extreme pain, serious bodily injury, or death.\n(7) Where the act is accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate, arrest, or deport the victim or another, and the victim has a reasonable belief that the perpetrator is a public official. As used in this paragraph, \u201cpublic official\u201d means a person employed by a governmental agency who has the authority, as part of that position, to incarcerate, arrest, or deport another. The perpetrator does not actually have to be a public official.\n(b) As used in this section, \u201cduress\u201d means a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed, or acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted. The total circumstances, including the age of the victim, and his or her relationship to the defendant, are factors to consider in appraising the existence of duress.\n(c) As used in this section, \u201cmenace\u201d means any threat, declaration, or act which shows an intention to inflict an injury upon another.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 262 of the Penal Code is amended to read:\n262.\n(a) Rape of a person who is the spouse of the perpetrator is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished under any of the following circumstances:\n(1) Where it is accomplished against a person\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\n(2) Where a person is\nprevented from resisting\nincapable of giving consent\nby any intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this condition was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the accused.\n(3) Where a person is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act, and this is known to the accused. As used in this paragraph, \u201cunconscious of the nature of the act\u201d means incapable of\nresisting\ngiving consent\nbecause the victim meets one of the following conditions:\n(A) Was unconscious or asleep.\n(B) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant that the act occurred.\n(C) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant of the essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator\u2019s fraud in fact.\n(4) Where the act is accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other person, and there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetrator will execute the threat. As used in this paragraph, \u201cthreatening to retaliate\u201d means a threat to kidnap or falsely imprison, or to inflict extreme pain, serious bodily injury, or death.\n(5) Where the act is accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate, arrest, or deport the victim or another, and the victim has a reasonable belief that the perpetrator is a public official. As used in this paragraph, \u201cpublic official\u201d means a person employed by a governmental agency who has the authority, as part of that position, to incarcerate, arrest, or deport another. The perpetrator does not actually have to be a public official.\n(b) As used in this section, \u201cduress\u201d means a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed, or acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted. The total circumstances, including the age of the victim, and his or her relationship to the defendant, are factors to consider in apprising the existence of duress.\n(c) As used in this section, \u201cmenace\u201d means any threat, declaration, or act that shows an intention to inflict an injury upon another.\n(d) If probation is granted upon conviction of a violation of this section, the conditions of probation may include, in lieu of a fine, one or both of the following requirements:\n(1) That the defendant make payments to a battered women\u2019s shelter, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n(2) That the defendant reimburse the victim for reasonable costs of counseling and other reasonable expenses that the court finds are the direct result of the defendant\u2019s offense.\nFor any order to pay a fine, make payments to a battered women\u2019s shelter, or pay restitution as a condition of probation under this subdivision, the court shall make a determination of the defendant\u2019s ability to pay. In no event shall any order to make payments to a battered women\u2019s shelter be made if it would impair the ability of the defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim or court-ordered child support. Where the injury to a married person is caused in whole or in part by the criminal acts of his or her spouse in violation of this section, the community property may not be used to discharge the liability of the offending spouse for restitution to the injured spouse, required by Section 1203.04, as operative on or before August 2, 1995, or Section 1202.4, or to a shelter for costs with regard to the injured spouse and dependents, required by this section, until all separate property of the offending spouse is exhausted.\nSEC. 3.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution."
