    "title": "An act to amend Sections 5080.05 and 5080.18 of, and to add Section 5080.22 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to state parks.",
    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThis act shall be known, and may be cited, as the California Heritage Protection Act.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) National, state, and regional parks serve the public interest, benefit California, and very often reflect historic significance that earlier generations of Californians have attached to these sites.\n(b) Yosemite National Park, located in California, is one of the most important and majestic parks in the United States and is filled with historic landmarks built several decades ago. The historic nature of these landmarks as California heirloom destinations is demonstrated by topographic maps of the Yosemite Valley, dating back to the 1950s, which include these venues.\n(c) The Ahwahnee Hotel was built in the 1920s with a backdrop of Half Dome. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.\n(d) Curry Village, in the Yosemite Valley, is named after a San Francisco Bay area couple who established a summer camp there in 1899. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n(e) The Wawona Hotel is a complex of seven buildings in the southwest corner of Yosemite National Park. The first building, then named \u201cLong White,\u201d was originally constructed in 1876. The main hotel building originally opened in 1879. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n(f) California state park venues are held in public trust for the people of California. A legal claim by an individual to have a trademark right to a name or names associated with a venue within a state park derogates the interests of California and the shared history of Californians, and it is indicative of a lack of the individual\u2019s fitness to serve as a steward of the state\u2019s cherished cultural heritage and places.\n(g) An agreement entered into by any California state agency that compromises the interests of Californians is \u201cultra vires\u201d and therefore beyond that agency\u2019s legal authority to enter.\n(h) It is important that the Legislature clarify that an awarded concession contract within California\u2019s state parks does not give the concessionaire a trademark right to the name or names associated with a state park venue or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources. Furthermore, a concessionaire who makes a legal claim to have that trademark right should be disqualified from further consideration as a bidder.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 5080.05 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n5080.05.\n(a) Except as provided in Section 5080.16, all contracts authorizing occupancy of any portion of the state park system for a period of more than two years shall be awarded to the best responsible bidder.\n(b) \u201cBest responsible bidder\u201d means the bidder, as determined by specific standards established by the department, that, as determined by the department, will operate the concession (1) consistent with the contract, (2) in a manner fully compatible with, and complementary to, the characteristics, features, and theme of the unit in which the concession will be operated, (3) in the best interests of the state and public, and (4) in a manner that protects the state\u2019s trademark and service mark rights in the names associated with a state park venue and its historical, cultural, and recreational resources. For purposes of this section, a bidder who would be subject to subdivision (b) of Section 5080.22 is not a best responsible bidder.\nSEC. 4.\nSection 5080.18 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n5080.18.\nA concession contract entered into pursuant to this article shall contain, but is not limited to, all of the following provisions:\n(a) (1) The maximum term shall be 10 years, except that a term of more than 10 years may be provided if the director determines that the longer term is necessary to allow the concessionaire to amortize improvements made by the concessionaire, to facilitate the full utilization of a structure that is scheduled by the department for replacement or redevelopment, or to serve the best interests of the state. The term shall not exceed 20 years without specific authorization by statute. Except as provided in Section 5080.16, all renewals of concession contracts pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to competitive bidding requirements.\n(2) The maximum term shall be 50 years if the concession contract is for the construction, development, and operation of multiple-unit lodging facilities equipped with full amenities, including plumbing and electrical, that is anticipated to exceed an initial cost of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) in capital improvements in order to begin operation. The term for a concession contract described in this paragraph shall not exceed 50 years without specific authorization by statute. Except as provided in Section 5080.16, all renewals of concession contracts pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to competitive bidding requirements.\n(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a concession agreement at Will Rogers State Beach executed prior to December 31, 1997, including, but not limited to, an agreement signed pursuant to Section 25907 of the Government Code, may be extended to exceed 20 years in total length without specific authorization by statute, upon approval by the director and pursuant to a determination by the director that the longer term is necessary to allow the concessionaire to amortize improvements made by the concessionaire that are anticipated to exceed one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) in capital improvements. Any extensions granted pursuant to this paragraph shall not be for more than 15 years.\n(b) Every concessionaire shall submit to the department all sales and use tax returns and, at the request of the department, provide an annual financial statement prepared or audited by a certified public accountant.\n(c) Every concession shall be subject to audit by the department.\n(d) A performance bond shall be obtained and maintained by the concessionaire. In lieu of a bond, the concessionaire may substitute a deposit of funds acceptable to the department. Interest on the deposit shall accrue to the concessionaire.\n(e) The concessionaire shall obtain and maintain in force at all times a policy of liability insurance in an amount adequate for the nature and extent of public usage of the concession and naming the state as an additional insured.\n(f) Any discrimination by the concessionaire or his or her agents or employees against any person because of the marital status or ancestry of that person or any characteristic listed or defined in Section 11135 of the Government Code is prohibited.\n(g) To be effective, any modification of the concession contract shall be evidenced in writing.\n(h) Whenever a concession contract is terminated for substantial breach, there shall be no obligation on the part of the state to purchase any improvements made by the concessionaire.\n(i) If a concessionaire makes a legal claim or assertion to have a trademark or service mark interest in violation of subdivision (a) of Section 5080.22, the concessionaire shall forfeit the right to bid on future state park concession contracts to the extent authorized by federal law.\n(j) If a current or former concessionaire in bad faith files a federal or state trademark or service mark application for a trademark or service mark that incorporates or implies an association with a state park venue, or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources, and the state files a successful opposition or cancellation with respect to that trademark or service mark application, the concessionaire shall be responsible for the state\u2019s attorney fees, costs, and expenses associated with that opposition or cancellation.\nSEC. 4.5.\nSection 5080.18 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n5080.18.\nA concession contract entered into pursuant to this article shall contain, but is not limited to, all of the following provisions:\n(a) (1) The maximum term shall be 10 years, except that a term of more than 10 years may be provided if the director determines that the longer term is necessary to allow the concessionaire to amortize improvements made by the concessionaire, to facilitate the full utilization of a structure that is scheduled by the department for replacement or redevelopment, or to serve the best interests of the state.
