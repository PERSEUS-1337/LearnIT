FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds:\n            (1) Article I, section 8, of the Constitution of the United \n        States gives no authority to Congress to require a waiting \n        period or a background check before the sale of a firearm.\n            (2) The United States Supreme Court, in United States v. \n        Lopez, struck down gun control legislation for lack of \n        constitutional authority.\n            (3) A number of Federal district courts have ruled that the \n        Federal mandate imposed on the States by Public Law 103-159 \n        violates the tenth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n        States.\n            (4) Public Law 103-159 violates the second amendment to the \n        Constitution of the United States because it impermissibly \n        infringes on the right of the people to secure a firearm when \n        necessary for the protection of person and property and for the \n        pursuit of other constitutionally protected activities.\n            (5) Waiting periods and background checks have produced \n        devastating effects for law-abiding citizens trying to acquire \n        firearms for self-defense. During the 1992 riots in Los \n        Angeles, residents were forced to wait fifteen days before they \n        could legally buy firearms for protection, in spite of the fact \n        that police admitted they could not protect citizens.\n            (6) In addition to the problem of delays and erroneous \n        denials for law-abiding citizens who need to protect \n        themselves, background checks can also lend themselves to \n        official abuse:\n                    (A) In 1991, the office of Technology Assessment \n                commented on the possibility of gun owner registration \n                under Virginia's instant check system. It stated, \n                ``[T]he potential [for registration] exists regardless \n                of legal prohibitions.''\n                    (B) A Justice Department Task Force stated in 1989 \n                that ``[a]ny system that requires a criminal record \n                check prior to purchase of a firearm creates the \n                potential for the automated tracking of individuals who \n                seek to purchase firearms.''\n\nSEC. 3. SECOND AMENDMENT RESTORATION.\n\n    (a) Public Law 103-159 is hereby repealed, and any provisions of \nlaw amended or repealed by such Act are restored or revived as if such \nAct had not been enacted.\n    (b) The Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990 \n(D.C.
