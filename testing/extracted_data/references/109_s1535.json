FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program, authorized \n        by section 9 of the Act of December 22, 1944 (commonly known as \n        the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'') (58 Stat. 891), was intended \n        to promote the general economic development of the United \n        States;\n            (2) the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project--\n                    (A) is a major component of the Pick-Sloan Missouri \n                River Basin program; and\n                    (B) contributes to the national economy;\n            (3) the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project flooded the fertile \n        bottom land of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, which \n        greatly damaged the economy and cultural resources of the \n        Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and caused the loss of many homes \n        and communities of members of the Tribe;\n            (4) Congress has provided compensation to several Indian \n        tribes, including the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, that border \n        the Missouri River and suffered injury as a result of 1 or more \n        of the Pick-Sloan projects;\n            (5) on determining that the compensation paid to the \n        Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe was inadequate, Congress enacted the \n        Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act (Public \n        Law 106-511; 114 Stat. 2365), which created the Cheyenne River \n        Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund; and\n            (6) that Act did not provide for additional compensation to \n        members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe that lost land as a \n        result of the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal \n        Recovery Trust Fund may be used to provide compensation to \n        members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe that lost land as a \n        result of the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project; and\n            (2) to provide for the capitalization of the Cheyenne River \n        Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund.\n\nSEC. 3.

of the Tribe and \n                member landowners; and\n                    ``(B) the Tribe and member landowners should be \n                adequately compensated for that land;''; and\n

Compensation Act (Public Law 106-511; 114 Stat. 2365) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraph (1) as paragraph (3) and \n        moving the paragraph so as to appear after paragraph
