FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) increased demands on firefighting personnel have made \n        it difficult for local governments to adequately fund necessary \n        fire safety precautions;\n            (2) the Federal Government has an obligation to protect the \n        health and safety of the firefighting personnel of the United \n        States and to help ensure that the personnel have the financial \n        resources to protect the public;\n            (3) the United States has serious fire losses, including a \n        fire death rate that is one of the highest per capita in the \n        industrialized world;\n            (4) in the United States, fire kills more than 4,000 people \n        and injures more than 25,000 people each year;\n            (5) in any single day in the United States, on the \n        average--\n                    (A) 11 people will die because of fire;\n                    (B) 2 of those people are likely to be children \n                under the age of 5;\n                    (C) 68 people will be injured because of fire; and\n                    (D) over $9,000,000,000 in property losses will \n                occur from fire; and\n            (6) those statistics demonstrate a critical need for \n        Federal investment in support of firefighting personnel.\n\nSEC. 3. REDESIGNATION OF FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Federal Emergency Management Agency is \nredesignated as the ``Federal Fire and Emergency Management Agency''.\n    (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, \npaper, or other record of the United States to the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency shall be deemed to be a reference to the Federal Fire \nand Emergency Management Agency.\n    (c) Conforming Amendments to Federal Fire Prevention and Control \nAct of 1974.--Sections 4(4), 17, and 31(a)(5)(B) of the Federal Fire \nPrevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2203(4), 2216, and \n2227(a)(5)(B)) are amended by striking ``Federal Emergency Management \nAgency'' each place it appears and inserting ``Federal Fire and \nEmergency Management Agency''.\n\nSEC. 4.
