FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Between 20,000 and 30,000 Americans are diagnosed each \n        year with myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, \n        paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and other acquired bone \n        marrow failure diseases.\n            (2) Acquired bone marrow failure diseases have a \n        debilitating and often fatal impact on those diagnosed with \n        these disease.\n            (3) While some treatments for acquired bone marrow failure \n        diseases can prolong and improve the quality of patients' \n        lives, there is no single cure for these diseases.\n            (4) The prevalence of acquired bone marrow failure diseases \n        in the United States will continue to grow as the general \n        public ages.\n            (5) Evidence exists suggesting that acquired bone marrow \n        failure diseases occur more often in minority populations, \n        particularly in Asian American and Hispanic/Latino populations.\n            (6) The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the \n        National Cancer Institute have conducted important research \n        into the causes of and treatments for acquired bone marrow \n        failure diseases.\n            (7) The National Marrow Donor Program Registry has made \n        significant contributions to the fight against bone marrow \n        failure diseases by connecting millions of potential marrow \n        donors with individuals and families suffering from these \n        conditions.\n            (8) Despite these advances, a more comprehensive Federal \n        strategic effort among numerous Federal agencies is needed to \n        discover a cure for acquired bone marrow failure disorders.\n            (9) Greater Federal surveillance of acquired bone marrow \n        failure diseases is needed to gain a better understanding of \n        the causes of acquired bone marrow failure diseases.\n            (10) The Federal Government should increase its research \n        support for and engage with public and private organizations in \n        developing a comprehensive approach to combat and cure acquired \n        bone marrow failure diseases.\n\nSEC. 3.
