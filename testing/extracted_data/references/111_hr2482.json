FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress supports the following elements outlined in \n        the President's White Paper of the Interagency Policy Group's \n        Report on United States Policy Toward Afghanistan and Pakistan:\n                    (A) The United States has a vital national security \n                interest in addressing the current and potential \n                security threats posed by extremists in Afghanistan and \n                Pakistan.\n                    (B) The United States homeland, Pakistan, \n                Afghanistan, India, Europe, Australia, and United \n                States allies in the Middle East remain targets of al \n                Qaeda and other extremist groups.\n                    (C) At the same time, the Taliban and related \n                organizations seek to reestablish their old sanctuaries \n                in Afghanistan.\n            (2) Afghanistan is a central front in the global struggle \n        against al Qaeda and other affiliated networks. A stable \n        Afghanistan that is free from al Qaeda, the Taliban, and \n        extremist influence and ideology will require a patient, long-\n        term, integrated political, military, and economic strategy \n        that is adequately resourced to accomplish its objectives.\n            (3) Allowing Afghanistan to revert to its pre-September 11, \n        2001, status of control by al Qaeda and the Taliban is not an \n        option for United States policy.\n            (4) Security and stability in Afghanistan is further \n        complicated given the prevalence of ungoverned space between \n        Afghanistan and Pakistan in which state control has not been \n        fully exercised given ethnic and tribal affiliations.\n            (5) The United States will continue to demonstrate its \n        long-term commitment to the people of Afghanistan by--\n                    (A) sustained civilian assistance and providing \n                United States commanders with the troops and resources \n                needed to conduct counterinsurgency operations with the \n                support of the Government and people of Afghanistan; \n                and\n                    (B) continuing to engage the Afghan people in ways \n                that demonstrate United States commitment to promoting \n                a legitimate and capable Afghan government.\n            (6) The objectives of United States policy toward \n        Afghanistan are to empower and enable Afghanistan to--\n                    (A) develop into secure and stable state with a \n                government that exercises full control and authority \n                over all the country; and\n                    (B) develop increasingly reliable and capable \n                Afghan security forces that can actively confront, and \n                deny safe haven to, al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other \n                extremists and eventually lead the counterinsurgency \n                and counterterrorism fight with reduced United States \n                assistance.\n\nSEC. 3.
