FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The National Health Service Corps is a vital resource \n        for underserved communities experiencing shortages of health \n        professionals.\n            (2) For over 35 years, National Health Service Corps \n        clinicians have expanded access to primary and preventive \n        health care, dental care, mental health, and behavioral health \n        services in underserved areas of the United States and have \n        improved health outcomes among underserved populations.\n            (3) The National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program \n        provides a predictable supply of clinicians who will pursue \n        employment in primary care for underserved communities. Upon \n        completion of their training, National Health Service Corps \n        scholars become salaried employees of organized systems of care \n        in such underserved communities.\n            (4) The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment \n        Program helps communities meet their immediate needs for health \n        professionals by offering to pay off qualifying educational \n        loans in exchange for 2 years of service in an underserved \n        community.\n            (5) A recent report in the Journal of the American Medical \n        Association found that community health centers are facing 13 \n        percent vacancies for family physician positions and 20.8 \n        percent vacancies for OB-GYN positions. The study cited heavy \n        reliance on the National Health Service Corps and recommended \n        expanding the program in order to address those needs.\n            (6) Critical to the growth of new and existing health \n        centers is having a sufficient supply of primary care health \n        professionals to staff them. Currently, health centers rely on \n        the National Health Service Corps for over 20 percent of their \n        physician workforce. Yet, just over half of all Corps \n        placements are made to health centers, even though they are one \n        of the strongest cords in the health care safety net.\n            (7) Health facilities in rural areas, including community \n        health centers and rural health clinics, face primary care \n        vacancy rates higher than the national average, and are more \n        heavily reliant on the National Health Service Corps to address \n        those needs.\n            (8) The number of new medical residents choosing a primary \n        care discipline as a medical specialty is declining, and the \n        National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program and the \n        National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program provide an \n        important incentive for students to choose to pursue a career \n        in primary care.\n\nSEC. 3.
