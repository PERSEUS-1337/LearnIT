    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Bridges of Hope for Transitional \nHealth Insurance Act of 2006''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The national policy of advancing global free trade \n        through treaties such as NAFTA, CAFTA and supporting the \n        accession of certain countries to the World Trade Organization \n        have opened the markets of the United States to a range of \n        products that have facilitated the export of American jobs and \n        resulted in the enormous loss of employment in the United \n        States for our citizens.\n            (2) This transformation has not been accompanied by a \n        Federal commitment to reorient, retrain, relocate, or re-employ \n        individuals in selective State economies dependent upon a \n        previously robust industrial employment opportunity to minimal \n        immediate new economic opportunities through well-funded \n        temporary assistance and economic support program capable of \n        breaching the loss of jobs and economic opportunities thereby \n        leaving individuals in the depressed States without the \n        opportunity to maintain a decent quality of life and health \n        security by threatening the loss of health insurance coverage.\n            (3) The responsibility for the transformation of State \n        economies where economic dislocation occurs is the primary \n        responsibility of the governmental unit whose policies caused \n        such a change in the underlying economic base and have such \n        profound impacts that the State alone cannot be reasonably \n        expected to mobilize financial resources to bring about \n        prosperity when the State's own tax resources are declining.\n            (4) The impact has been to so erode the underlying \n        structural base of a State that results in a decline in funding \n        for existing health safety and welfare programs that may be \n        supported by the State government. Acting alone the State \n        government cannot remedy the devastating impact on individuals \n        who must alter the quality of their lifestyle so radically that \n        health choices become beyond the reach of average families who \n        have no where else to go.\n            (5) In the State of Michigan alone the average unemployment \n        rate has been 2.5 times the national average for over 56 months \n        and the State is projected to lose more than 63,000 more \n        factory jobs by 2007 with no hope for rapid implementation to \n        re-employ such individuals whose only real wealth is their \n        homestead that cannot be relocated and whose skill levels. But \n        these individuals cannot find employment to replace the wages \n        they lost and they are risking foregoing payment of health \n        insurance in order to preserve their homestead.\n            (6) The distress suffered by these State industrial \n        economies cannot be rectified by State Governments alone and it \n        requires the intervention of the Federal Government to provide \n        a bridge fund of transitional financial assistance to \n        individuals to maintain their health insurance premium \n        payments.\n            (7) The Federal Government has the responsibility to \n        establish a health insurance premium enhancement program to \n        provide individuals a continuity of care and continuum of \n        lifestyles in a circumstance where the balance of cost-of-\n        living expenses and mortgage payments force them to abandon \n        health care coverage and may subject them and their families to \n        irreparable harm thereby endangering the health safety and \n        welfare of everyone in their communities.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a Bridges of \nHope for Transitional Health Insurance Program to provide premium \nrelief for individual workers through a local public health authorities \nacting as a fiduciary on their behalf.\n\nSEC. 3.
