FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) There is currently no comprehensive system for \n        acquiring accurate data on the incidence of sports- and \n        recreation-related concussions across all youth age groups and \n        sports.\n            (2) Overall, according to a report entitled ``Sports-\n        Related Concussions in Youth: Improving the Science, Changing \n        the Culture'', issued by the National Academies in 2013, each \n        year in the United States, there are approximately 1.6 to 3.8 \n        million sports- and recreation-related traumatic brain \n        injuries, including concussions and other head injuries. These \n        figures are based on conservative estimates.\n            (3) A review of National Collegiate Athletic Association \n        data for 15 sports showed that the overall reported concussion \n        rate doubled from 1.7 to 3.4 concussions per 1,000 athletic \n        exposures over the past 15 years, covering the 1988-1989 and \n        2003-2004 academic years.\n            (4) Between 2001 and 2009, the reported number of our youth \n        ages 19 and under treated for concussion and other nonfatal, \n        sports- and recreation-related traumatic brain injuries \n        increased from 150,000 to 250,000.\n            (5) Over the same time period between 2001 and 2009, the \n        rate of emergency room visits for concussive injuries increased \n        by 57 percent.\n            (6) Yet, according to the National Academies there \n        currently is--\n                    (A) a lack of data to accurately estimate the \n                incidence of sports-related concussions across a \n                variety of sports and for youth across the pediatric \n                age spectrum; and\n                    (B) no comprehensive system for acquiring accurate \n                data on the incidence of sports- and recreation-related \n                concussions across all youth age groups and sports.\n            (7) Currently, there are significant information gaps in \n        the proper protocol for diagnosis and treatment of sports-\n        related concussions and more research desperately is needed.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to increase awareness and knowledge about concussions \n        through development of, implementation of, and evaluation of \n        the effectiveness of, large-scale collaborative efforts and \n        research by entities including, but not limited to, national \n        sports associations, State high school associations, trainers' \n        associations, appropriate Federal entities, and other \n        stakeholders such as parents, coaches, and students; and\n            (2) to change the culture (including social norms, \n        attitudes, and behaviors) surrounding concussions among \n        elementary school through college-aged youth and their parents, \n        coaches, sports officials, educators, trainers, and health care \n        professionals, taking into account demographic variations \n        across population groups, where appropriate.\n\nSEC. 4. SURVEILLANCE OF SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSIONS.\n\n    Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting \nafter section 317T of such Act (42 U.S.C. 247b-22) the following:\n\n``SEC. 317U.
