SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Military Pain Care \nAct of 2008''.\n    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as \nfollows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title and table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings.\nSec. 3. Pain care initiative in military health care facilities.\nSec. 4. Pain care standards in TRICARE plans.\nSec. 5. Report of Comptroller General.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Acute and chronic pain are prevalent conditions among \n        active duty and retired military personnel.\n            (2) Characteristics of modern warfare, including the use of \n        improvised explosive devices, produce substantial numbers of \n        battlefield casualties with significant damage to both the \n        central and peripheral nervous systems.\n            (3) The successes of military health care both on and off \n        the battlefield result in high survival rates of severely \n        injured military personnel who will be afflicted with \n        significant pain disorders on either an acute or chronic basis.\n            (4) Failure to treat acute pain promptly and appropriately \n        at the time of injury, during initial medical and surgical \n        care, and at the time of transition to community-based care, \n        contributes to the development of long-term chronic pain \n        syndromes, in some cases accompanied by long-term mental health \n        and substance abuse disorders.\n            (5) Pain is a leading cause of short- and long-term \n        disability among military personnel.\n            (6) The military health care systems have implemented \n        important pain care programs at some facilities and in some \n        areas, but comprehensive pain care is not consistently provided \n        on a uniform basis throughout the systems to all patients in \n        need of such care.\n            (7) Inconsistent and ineffective pain care leads to pain-\n        related impairments, occupational disability, and medical and \n        mental complications with long-term costs for the military \n        health and disability systems, and for society at large.\n            (8) Research, diagnosis, treatment, and management of acute \n        and chronic pain in the active duty and retired military \n        populations constitute health care priorities of the United \n        States.\n\nSEC. 3.
