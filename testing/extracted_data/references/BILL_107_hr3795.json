FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The failure of accounting firms to provide accurate \n        audits of its clients is not a new or isolated problem.\n            (2) Accounting firms have been implicated in failed audits \n        that have cost investors billions of dollars when earnings \n        restatements sent stock prices tumbling.\n            (3) Auditors have an inherent conflict of interest. They \n        are hired, and fired, by their audit clients.\n            (4) This conflict of interest pressures auditors to sign \n        off on substandard financial statements rather than risk losing \n        a large client.\n            (5) Auditing a public company for the benefit of small as \n        well as large investors requires independence.\n            (6) Therefore the only truly independent audit is one by a \n        governmental agency.\n            (7) The Federal Bureau of Audits, closely regulated by the \n        Commission, will provide honest audits of all publicly traded \n        companies.\n\nSEC. 3.
