REPORT ON LONG-TERM COSTS OF OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND \n              OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has been engaged in military \n        operations in Afghanistan since October 2001 as Operation \n        Enduring Freedom and in military operations in Iraq since March \n        2003 as Operation Iraqi Freedom and its successor contingency \n        operation, Operation New Dawn.\n            (2) According to the Congressional Research Service, \n        through fiscal year 2010, Congress has appropriated \n        $1,087,000,000,000 for the Department of Defense, for the State \n        Department, and for medical costs paid by the Department of \n        Veterans Affairs. This amount includes $751,000,000,000 related \n        to operations in Iraq and $336,000,000,000 related to \n        operations in Afghanistan.\n            (3) Over 90 percent of the funds appropriated for the \n        Department of Defense for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \n        have been provided as supplemental or additional appropriations \n        and designated as an emergency funding requirement.\n            (4) The Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional \n        Research Service have stated that future costs for operations \n        in Iraq and Afghanistan are difficult to estimate because the \n        Department of Defense provides little information on costs \n        incurred to date and does not report outlays or actual \n        expenditure for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (because war \n        and baseline funds are mixed in the same accounts) and because \n        of a lack of information from the Department of Defense on many \n        of the key factors that determine costs, including personnel \n        levels and the pace of operations.\n            (5) Over 2,000,000 members of the United States Armed \n        Forces have served in Afghanistan and Iraq since the beginning \n        of the conflicts.\n            (6) Over 4,400 members of the Armed Forces and Department \n        of Defense civilian personnel have been killed in Operation \n        Iraqi Freedom, and over 1,400 members of the Armed Forces and \n        Department of Defense civilian personnel have been killed in \n        Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n            (7) Over 1,620 members of the Armed Forces have suffered \n        amputations as a result of wounds or other injuries incurred in \n        Afghanistan or Iraq.\n            (8) More than 243,685 veterans of military service in Iraq \n        and Afghanistan have been treated for mental health conditions, \n        more than 66,900 of these veterans have been diagnosed with \n        post-traumatic stress disorder, and approximately 178,876 of \n        these veterans have a confirmed traumatic brain injury \n        diagnosis.\n            (9) Approximately 46 percent of veterans of military \n        service in Iraq and Afghanistan have sought treatment at a \n        Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or medical clinic.\n            (10) The Independent Review Group on Rehabilitative Care \n        and Administrative Processes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center \n        and National Naval Medical Center identified traumatic brain \n        injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, increased survival of \n        severe burns, and traumatic amputations as the four signature \n        wounds of the current conflicts, and the Independent Review \n        Group report states that the recovery process ``can take months \n        or years and must accommodate recurring or delayed \n        manifestations of symptoms, extended rehabilitation and all the \n        life complications that emerge over time from such trauma''.\n    (b) Report Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \nthe enactment of this Act, the President, with contributions from the \nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, shall submit to Congress a report containing an \nestimate of the long-term costs of Operation New Dawn (the successor \ncontingency operation to Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Operation \nEnduring Freedom for each the following scenarios:\n            (1) The scenario in which the number of members of the \n        Armed Forces deployed in support of Operation New Dawn and \n        Operation Enduring Freedom is reduced from roughly 190,000 in \n        2011 to 150,000 in 2012, 65,000 in 2013, and 30,000 by the \n        beginning of 2014, and remains at 30,000 through 2020.\n            (2) The scenario in which the number of members of the \n        Armed Forces deployed in support of Operation New Dawn and \n        Operation Enduring Freedom rises to approximately 235,000 in \n        2011, is reduced to 230,000 in 2012, 195,000 in 2013, 135,000 \n        in 2014, 80,000 in 2015, 60,000 in 2016, and remains at 60,000 \n        through 2020.\n            (3) An alternative scenario, determined by the President \n        and based on current contingency operation and withdrawal \n        plans, which takes into account expected force levels and the \n        expected length of time that members of the Armed Forces will \n        be deployed in support of Operation New Dawn and Operation \n        Enduring Freedom.\n    (c) Estimates To Be Used in Preparation of Report.--In preparing \nthe report required by subsection (b), the President shall make \nestimates and projections through at least fiscal year 2020, adjust any \ndollar amounts appropriately for inflation, and take into account and \nspecify each of the following:\n            (1) The total number of members of the Armed Forces \n        expected to be deployed in support of Operation New Dawn and \n        Operation
