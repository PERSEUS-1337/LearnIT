UNITED STATES PENSION PLANS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The United States and the international community face \n        no greater threat to their security than the prospect of rogue \n        regimes who support international terrorism obtaining weapons \n        of mass destruction, and particularly nuclear weapons.\n            (2) Iran is the leading state sponsor of international \n        terrorism and is close to achieving nuclear weapons capability \n        but has paid no price for nearly twenty years of deception over \n        its nuclear program. Foreign entities that have invested in \n        Iran's energy sector, despite Iran's support of international \n        terrorism and its nuclear program, have afforded Iran a free \n        pass while many United States entities have unknowingly \n        invested in those same foreign entities.\n            (3) United States investors have a great deal at stake in \n        preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n            (4) United States investors can have considerable influence \n        over the commercial decisions of the foreign entities in which \n        they have invested.\n    (b) Publication in Federal Register.--Not later than six months \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act and every six months \nthereafter, the President shall ensure publication in the Federal \nRegister of a list of all United States and foreign entities that have \ninvested more than $20,000,000 in Iran's energy sector between August \n5, 1996, and the date of such publication. Such list shall include an \nitemization of individual investments of each such entity, including \nthe dollar value, intended purpose, and current status of each such \ninvestment.\n    (c) Sense of Congress Relating to Divestiture From Iran.--It is the \nsense of Congress that, upon publication of a list in the relevant \nFederal Register under subsection (b), managers of United States \nGovernment pension plans or thrift savings plans, managers of pension \nplans maintained in the private sector by plan sponsors in the United \nStates, and managers of mutual funds sold or distributed in the United \nStates should immediately initiate efforts to divest all investments of \nsuch plans or funds in any entity included on the list.\n    (d) Sense of Congress Relating to Prohibition on Future \nInvestment.--It is the sense of Congress that, upon publication of a \nlist in the relevant Federal Register under subsection (b), there \nshould be no future investment in any entity included on the list by \nmanagers of United States Government pension plans or thrift savings \nplans, managers of pension plans maintained in the private sector by \nplan sponsors in the United States, and managers of mutual funds sold \nor distributed in the United States.\n    (e) Disclosure to Investors.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n        publication of a list in the relevant Federal Register under \n        subsection (b), managers of United States Government pension \n        plans or thrift savings plans, managers of pension plans \n        maintained in the private sector by plan sponsors in the United \n        States, and managers of mutual funds sold or distributed in the \n        United States shall notify investors that the funds of such \n        investors are invested in an entity included on the list.
