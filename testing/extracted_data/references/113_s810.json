PILOT PROGRAM ON ONLINE COMPUTERIZED ASSESSMENT TO ENHANCE \n              DETECTION OF BEHAVIORS INDICATING A RISK OF SUICIDE AND \n              OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n              FORCES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 30,137 \n        members of the Armed Forces and veterans have committed suicide \n        since the Department of Defense began closely tracking these \n        incidents in 2009.\n            (2) In 2012 alone, approximately 349 members of the Armed \n        Forces, including the National Guard and Reserve, committed \n        suicide, which is more than the total number of members who \n        died in combat operations in 2012. This number does not include \n        the more than 6,000 veterans who committed suicide in 2012.\n            (3) During a March 21, 2013, hearing of the Committee on \n        Armed Services of the House of Representatives, Jacqueline \n        Garrick, acting director of the Defense Suicide Prevention \n        Office of the Department of Defense (DPSO), stated that \n        ``[l]ess than half [of the suicide victims] had deployed, and \n        few were involved in combat''. This statement is consistent \n        with current research, which has shown other risk factors, such \n        as relationships, legal or financial issues and alcohol or drug \n        usage play a larger role than a member's deployment history. \n        Garrick also told the Committee that many of these suicidal \n        victims did not communicate their intent, nor did they have \n        known behavioral health histories.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, as the \nUnited States draws down combat operations in Afghanistan, the \nDepartment of Defense should continue to seek to identify tools to \nassist in the identification of behavior indicating a risk suicide in \nmembers of the Armed Forces.\n    (c) Pilot Program Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall carry \nout a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of using \nan online computerized assessment to assist the Department of Defense \nin detecting behaviors in members of the Armed Force that indicate a \nrisk of suicide or other mental health conditions.\n    (d) Participating Members.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot \nprogram using the following, as selected by the Secretary at random for \npurposes of the pilot program:\n            (1) 1,000 members of the regular component of the Army.\n            (2) 1,000 members of the regular component of the Navy.\n            (3) 1,000 members of the regular component of the Air \n        Force.\n            (4) 1,000 members of the regular component of the Marine \n        Corps.\n            (5) 500 members of the Army Reserve.\n            (6) 500 members of the Army National Guard of the United \n        States.\n            (7) 500 members of the Navy Reserve.\n            (8) 500 members of the Air Force Reserve.\n            (9) 500 members of the Air National Guard of the United \n        States.\n            (10) 500 members of Marine Corps Reserve.\n    (e) Online Computerized Assessments.--\n            (1) In general.--In carrying out the pilot program, the \n        Secretary shall require each member of the Armed Forces \n        selected to participate in the pilot program to undertake two \n        online computerized assessments.\n            (2) Elements.--The assessments under this subsection shall \n        be designed to obtain such information on behaviors that \n        indicate a risk of suicide or other mental health conditions as \n        the Secretary shall include in the assessments for purposes of \n        the pilot program, including, but not limited to, work \n        performance, use and abuse of alcohol and other substances, \n        financial matters, and relationship and social matters.\n            (3) Timing.--The assessments under this subsection shall be \n        undertaken by a member at the same time the member undertakes \n        each of the first two annual periodic health assessments (PHAs) \n        in connection with service in the Armed Forces that are \n        required of the member by the Department after the selection of \n        the member for participation in the pilot program.\n    (f) Command Questionnaires.--\n            (1) In general.--At the same time a member of the Armed \n        Forces undertakes an online computerized assessment under \n        subsection (e), the member of the Armed Forces first superior \n        to such member in the chain of command shall undertake a \n        questionnaire on the behavior of such member, including, but \n        not limited to, behavior that indicates a risk of suicide or \n        other mental health conditions.\n            (2) Elements.--The questionnaires under this subsection \n        shall be designed to obtain information on the members covered \n        by the questionnaires so as to verify the accuracy of the \n        information provided by such members in undertaking assessments \n        under subsection (e).\n    (g) Referral.--As part of pilot program, the Secretary shall ensure \nthat any member of the Armed Forces determined to have behavior \nindicating a risk of suicide or another mental health condition is \nreferred to an appropriate mental health care provider for further \nassessment, care, and services in accordance with applicable \nprocedures.\n    (h) Control Groups.--In carrying out the pilot program, the \nSecretary shall establish one or more control groups whose behavior and \nexperiences during the course of the pilot program permit comparison \nwith the behavior and experiences of members participating in the pilot \nprogram. Each control group shall consist of such members of the Armed \nForces as the Secretary shall identify for purposes of the pilot \nprogram.\n    (i) Privacy Matters.--\n            (1) In general.--The privacy of any medical or other \n        information obtained on members of the Armed Forces under this \n        section shall be protected in accordance with the laws on \n        privacy applicable to such information.\n            (2) Prohibition on certain uses.--No information obtained \n        on a member under this section may be used in determining the \n        promotion or advancement of the member or any other benefit for \n        which the member may be eligible.\n            (3) Exclusion of personally identifiable information from \n        reports.--No personally identifiable information on members may \n        be included in any report under subsection (j).\n    (j) Report.--\n            (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n        date on which all the members of the Armed Forces participating \n        in the pilot program have completed both of the online \n        computerized assessments required by subsection (e) for \n        purposes of the pilot program, the Secretary shall submit to \n        the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the pilot \n        program.\n            (2) Elements.--The report under paragraph (1) shall include \n        the following:\n                    (A) A description of the pilot program, including a \n                detailed description of the assessments used for \n                purposes of subsection (e) and the questionnaires used \n                for purposes of subsection (f).\n                    (B) A summary of the various behaviors detected \n                through the assessments and questionnaires.\n                    (C) A description of the number of members \n                identified as being at risk of suicide or other mental \n                health conditions, and an assessment of the correlation \n                between the risks identified and the various behaviors \n                detected.\n                    (D) If care and services were provided to members \n                pursuant to subsection (g), a description of such care \n                and services and an assessment of the effectiveness of \n                such care and services.\n                    (E) A description of the number of members \n                participating in the pilot program who committed \n                suicide.\n                    (F) A description of the control groups established \n                pursuant to subsection (h), and a comparative analysis \n                of the behavior and experiences of members of such \n                control groups during the pilot program with the \n                behavior and experiences of members participating in \n                the pilot program, including on matters relating to \n                suicidal ideations, suicides attempted, and suicides \n                committed.\n                    (G) A comparative analysis of the rate of suicide \n                among members participating in the pilot program, \n                members of the control groups established pursuant to \n                subsection (h), and the general population of each of \n                the Armed Forces.\n                    (H) Such recommendations for extension or expansion \n                of the pilot program as the Secretary considers \n                appropriate in light of the pilot program, including \n                recommendations on the feasibility and advisability of \n                incorporating the online computerized assessments under \n                the pilot program in the online questionnaire of the \n                annual periodic health assessments (PHA) in connection \n                with service in the Armed Forces that are required by \n                the Department.\n    (k) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this section, \nthe term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--\n            (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n        Veterans' Affairs of the Senate; and\n            (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n        Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives."
