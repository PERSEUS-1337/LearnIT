FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Medicare fee-for-service program covers infusion \n        therapy in the hospital, skilled nursing facility, physician \n        office, and hospital outpatient department, but does not cover \n        the full range of services for the provision of infusion \n        therapies in a patient's home.\n            (2) The Medicare program is presently the only major health \n        care payer in the United States that does not provide \n        comprehensive coverage of home infusion therapy.\n            (3) As a result of the Medicare program not providing for \n        comprehensive coverage of home infusion therapy, many Medicare \n        beneficiaries are unable to obtain infusion therapy in the most \n        cost-effective and convenient setting of their home, and \n        physicians are deprived of the ability to select the best site \n        of care for their patients.\n            (4) The Medicare program is paying for institutional care \n        for the provision of infusion therapy in many instances when \n        such institutional care could be avoided if the Medicare \n        program provided coverage for home infusion therapy.\n            (5) The Government Accountability Office found in a 2010 \n        report that home infusion therapy is utilized widely by private \n        payers providing health insurance coverage for individuals \n        enrolled under such coverage and that such private payers \n        generally are satisfied with the quality of care and the \n        savings they achieve through avoided institutionalizations.\n            (6) A recent study has reported a potential savings for \n        Medicare if infusion therapies were covered in the home site of \n        care.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE COVERAGE OF HOME INFUSION THERAPY.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1861 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n1395x) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (s)(2)--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph \n                (EE);\n                    (B) by inserting ``and'' at the end of subparagraph \n                (FF); and\n                    (C) by inserting at the end the following new \n                subparagraph:\n            ``(GG) home infusion therapy (as defined in subsection \n        (iii)(1));''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n\n                        ``Home Infusion Therapy\n\n    ``(iii)(1) The term `home infusion therapy' means the items and \nservices described in paragraph (2) furnished to an individual, who is \nunder the care of a physician, which are provided by a qualified home \ninfusion therapy supplier under a plan (for furnishing such items and \nservices to such individual) established and periodically reviewed by a \nphysician, which items and services are provided in an integrated \nmanner in the individual's home in conformance with uniform standards \nof care established by the Secretary and in coordination with the \nprovision of covered infusion drugs under part D.
