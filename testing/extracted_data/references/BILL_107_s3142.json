FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) More than 70,000,000 Americans, including more than \n        18,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries, are uninsured or \n        underinsured for prescription drug coverage.\n            (2) High prescription drug prices are denying uninsured and \n        underinsured Americans access to medically necessary care, \n        thereby threatening their health and safety. Many of these \n        Americans require repeated doctor or medical clinic \n        appointments, becoming sicker because they cannot afford to \n        take the drugs prescribed for them. Many are admitted to or \n        treated at hospitals because they cannot afford the drugs \n        prescribed for them that could have prevented the need for \n        hospitalization. Many enter expensive institutional care \n        settings because they cannot afford the prescription drugs that \n        could have supported them outside of an institution. In each of \n        these circumstances, uninsured and underinsured residents too \n        often become medicaid recipients because of their inability to \n        afford prescription drugs.\n            (3) Pursuant to the Social Security Act, State medicaid \n        programs receive discounts in the form of rebates for \n        outpatient prescription drugs. On average, these rebates \n        provide discounts of more than 40 percent off retail prices.\n            (4) In 49 States, individual Americans do not have access \n        to medicaid rebates. But in 1 State, since June 1, 2001, over \n        100,000 Americans have received discounts from those rebates \n        through the ``Healthy Maine'' program. This program, \n        established as a demonstration project pursuant to a waiver \n        from the Secretary of Health and Human Services has proven to \n        work. Americans need that program replicated in every State, \n        immediately.\n            (5) The Federal and State governments are the only agents \n        that, as a practical matter, can play an effective role as a \n        market participant on behalf of Americans who are uninsured or \n        underinsured.\n\nSEC. 3.
