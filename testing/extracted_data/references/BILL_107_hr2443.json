FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) humans have long had a yearning to travel in space and \n        experience conditions beyond Earth's atmosphere;\n            (2) forty years of human space flight experience have \n        demonstrated the feasibility of safe travel to and from space \n        as well as the ability of humans to live and work in space;\n            (3) the Nation's human space flight program has developed \n        technologies and operational procedures that the private sector \n        could make use of to enable American citizens to experience \n        space travel;\n            (4) space tourism has the potential to become a significant \n        industry and a powerful stimulus for advances in space \n        transportation;\n            (5) the Federal Government could play an important role in \n        stimulating the development of space tourism by means of \n        guaranteed loans, tax credits, expeditious establishment of a \n        straightforward and predictable regulatory structure, and \n        research and development in technologies that may enable the \n        private sector to develop operational passenger-carrying space \n        transportation systems and on-orbit habitations;\n            (6) as the agency of the Federal Government primarily \n        responsible for the development of America's commercial sector, \n        the Department of Commerce, and in particular its Office of \n        Space Commercialization, should have the lead role in \n        encouraging the growth of space tourism;\n            (7) as the agency of the Federal Government currently \n        responsible for regulating America's commercial space \n        transportation industry, the Federal Aviation Administration, \n        and in particular its Office of Commercial Space \n        Transportation, should have the lead role in establishing the \n        regulatory structure necessary to ensure the safety of United \n        States space tourism;\n            (8) as the agency of the Federal Government responsible for \n        carrying out the major share of the Nation's civil space \n        activities, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n        should continue its traditional role of conducting research and \n        development related to new space technologies and systems and \n        facilitating their transfer to the private sector;\n            (9) it is an appropriate role for the Federal Government to \n        undertake measures to encourage the development of space \n        tourism in the United States; and\n            (10) at the same time, it is an inappropriate role and a \n        misallocation of taxpayer-provided resources for the Federal \n        Government to compete with the private sector in the provision \n        of transportation vehicles or facilities for space tourism.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) terms that are defined in the Federal Credit Reform Act \n        of 1990 have the meaning given those terms in that Act; and\n            (2) the term ``space tourism'' means travel to, from, or \n        within outer space, or to the surface of a body in space other \n        than Earth, or habitation in outer space, for the purpose of \n        recreation.\n\nSEC. 4.
