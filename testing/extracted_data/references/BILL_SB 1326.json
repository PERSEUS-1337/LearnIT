    "content": "The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n\nSECTION 1.\nThis act shall be known, and may be cited, as the 2015 Realignment Legislation addressing justice reinvestment.\nSEC. 2.\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(a) The Legislature is committed to reducing recidivism among criminal offenders, ensuring that local governments have adequate funding to achieve this goal, and facilitating the responsible implementation of the criminal justice policies contained in the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.\n(b) California must continue to reinvest its criminal justice resources to support community-based corrections programs, evidence-based practices, and local correctional facilities in order to achieve improved public safety returns on this state\u2019s substantial investment in its criminal justice system.\n(c) Realigning low-level felony offenders who do not have prior convictions for serious, violent, or sex offenses to locally run community-based corrections programs, which are strengthened through community-based punishment, evidence-based practices, improved supervision strategies, and enhanced secured capacity, has the potential to improve public safety outcomes for adult felons and facilitate their reintegration back into society. However, local governments have indicated that current resources provided by the state to achieve these goals are inadequate. This lack of resources has resulted in deficiencies in bed space, evidence-based programs, and treatment options. Community-based corrections programs require additional funding to meet the level of need and provide an appropriate level of service for offender populations shifted as a result of the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.\n(d) By enacting the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, the Legislature affirmed its commitment to justice reinvestment and stated that the purpose of justice reinvestment is to manage and allocate criminal justice populations more cost effectively, generating savings that can be reinvested in evidence-based strategies that increase public safety while holding offenders accountable.\n(e) In order to properly implement the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, it is the intent of the Legislature to fully commit to justice reinvestment by using identified state savings generated by the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety and any other necessary funds to provide local governments with maximum flexibility and adequate funding to manage these new offenders in the manner that is in the best interest of public safety, most appropriate to each county, and consistent with principles of justice reinvestment.\n(f) The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a document in April 2012 entitled \u201cThe Future of California Corrections,\u201d sometimes referred to as the \u201cCorrections Blueprint\u201d or the \u201cBlueprint,\u201d detailing the department\u2019s plan to implement the 2011 Realignment Legislation, address public safety, and save billions of dollars. The Department of Finance and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a report in January 2016 entitled \u201cAn Update to the Future of California Corrections,\u201d which indicated that, after making certain specified adjustments, the Governor\u2019s proposed budget for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for the 2016\u201317 fiscal year is one billion three hundred million dollars ($1,300,000,000) less than the pre-Realignment, pre-Blueprint multiyear forecast for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for the same fiscal year. Some or all of these savings, and any future savings, should be allocated to counties to mitigate the effects of the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.\nSEC. 3.\nChapter 6.4 (commencing with Section 30030) is added to Division 3 of Title 3 of the Government Code, to read:\nCHAPTER  6.4. Realignment Reinvestment Fund\n30030.\nFor purposes of this chapter, \u201crealigned offenders\u201d means offenders sentenced to a county jail or to mandatory supervision, or to both county jail and mandatory supervision, pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code, offenders subject to postrelease community supervision pursuant to Title 2.05 (commencing with Section 3450) of Part 3 of the Penal Code, and any other offenders under county supervision whose supervision would have been the responsibility of the state if the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety had not been enacted.\n30031.\n(a) (1) The Realignment Reinvestment Fund is hereby established in the State Treasury. Moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated and shall be used exclusively for the purposes of this chapter.\n(2) (A) Beginning in 2017, on or after July 1, and no later than August 31 of each year, the Director of Finance shall calculate both of the following:\n(i) The actual net savings to the state for the immediately preceding fiscal year resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.\n(ii) An estimate of the net savings to the state for the current fiscal year resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.\n(B) For the calculation pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A), the Director of Finance shall, to the extent possible, use the same methodology used to determine that the proposed 2016\u201317 budget for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is one billion three hundred million dollars ($1,300,000,000) less than the adjusted multiyear forecast for 2016\u201317, as reflected on page 30 of the report published by the Department of Finance and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in January 2016, entitled \u201cAn Update to the Future of California Corrections.\u201d The Director of Finance shall use the same adjustments used in the report when making savings calculations, including adjustments for employee compensation, retirement contributions, Proposition 98 funding, and the activation of the California Health Care facility.\n(3) For the 2016\u201317 fiscal year, the Controller shall transfer one billion three hundred million dollars ($1,300,000,000) from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for allocation pursuant to paragraph (5).\n(4) Beginning with the 2017\u201318 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Controller shall transfer an amount equal to the difference between the amount identified in subparagraph (A) and the amount identified in subparagraph (B) from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for allocation pursuant to paragraph (5).\n(A) The estimate of net savings for the current fiscal year calculated pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2).\n(B) An adjustment for the immediately preceding fiscal year that is the result of subtracting the amount calculated pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) for that fiscal year from the amount estimated pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) for that fiscal year.\n(5) The Controller shall annually allocate moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund, no later than September 1 of each year, to each county and city and county for deposit in the county\u2019s or city and county\u2019s Realignment Reinvestment Services Account proportionally based on the average daily population of realigned offenders under each county\u2019s supervision for the immediately preceding fiscal year. The Controller shall consult with the Board of State and Community Corrections to determine the average daily population for each county.\n(b) There shall be established in each county or city and county treasury a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to receive all amounts allocated to a county or city and county for purposes of implementing this chapter.\n(c) (1) Each county local Community Corrections Partnership established pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1230 of the Penal Code shall recommend a comprehensive, locally run supplemental community-based corrections plan to the county board of supervisors.
