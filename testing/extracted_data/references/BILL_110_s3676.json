FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services \n        personnel are a vital component of the first responders across \n        the United States.\n            (2) The 800,000 volunteer firefighters and emergency \n        medical service personnel in the United States save lives and \n        property everyday.\n            (3) The national financial savings resulting from volunteer \n        firefighting and emergency medical services has been calculated \n        at more than $37,000,000,000 each year.\n            (4) Many volunteer fire stations and emergency medical \n        services organizations in the United States face growing \n        challenges as volunteers contend with increased competition for \n        their time from their jobs, families, and other \n        responsibilities.\n            (5) Some State and local governments provide financial \n        incentives to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical \n        services personnel, such as retirement benefits and tuition \n        assistance. Unfortunately, many communities that rely on \n        volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services \n        personnel, especially rural and low-income communities, do not \n        have the resources to provide such incentives.\n            (6) There is an important role for the Federal Government \n        and the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration \n        in supporting volunteer firefighters and emergency medical \n        services personnel, including providing funds to contribute to \n        incentives for the recruitment and retention of volunteers.\n\nSEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL \n              SERVICES PERSONNEL.\n\n    The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2201 \net seq.) is amended by inserting after section 33 the following new \nsection:\n\n``SEC. 33A.
