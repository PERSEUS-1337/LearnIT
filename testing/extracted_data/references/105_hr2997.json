    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness in the Workplace Commission \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Workers are not achieving wage and benefit increases \n        commensurate with corporate profits and sustained economic \n        expansion. While the median wage for workers fell 8 percent in \n        real terms during the business cycle peaks from 1979 through \n        1996, after-tax corporate profit rates grew 66 percent.\n            (2) The wage gap between men and women has increased in the \n        last 4 years, reversing a 20 year trend in which that gap had \n        narrowed.\n            (3) Despite a significant degree of closing the education \n        gap between minority and white Americans, wage gaps between \n        these groups persist and for some minority groups have been \n        expanded.\n            (4) Over the period of 1979 through 1996, workers have \n        experienced a heightened sense of job insecurity due to \n        corporate downsizing, deregulation of key industries, new \n        technology, and foreign competition.\n            (5) The last decade has seen a growth in the use of part-\n        time and temporary workers.\n            (6) Insufficient research has been done to determine the \n        extent and the impact of the use of part-time workers and the \n        failure of wages, especially for female workers, to keep pace \n        with economic growth and corporate profits.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--There is established the National Commission on \nFairness in the Workplace (hereafter in this Act referred to as the \n``Commission'').\n    (b) Member Authority.--Any member or agent of the Commission may, \nif authorized by the Commission, take any action which the Commission \nis authorized to take by this Act.\n    (c) Chairperson, Vice Chairperson.--The Chairperson of the \nCommission shall be designated by the President at the time of \nappointment.

COMMISSION DUTY.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Commission shall examine--\n            (1) the growing corporate practice of providing wages and \n        benefit levels for part-time and temporary employees which are \n        lower than the wage and benefit levels provided to full-time \n        employees who perform essentially identical work;\n            (2) how the use of part-time and temporary employees has \n        affected wage and benefit levels, employee job insecurity, and \n        employee productivity;\n            (3) the reasons that workers' wages have not kept pace with \n        corporate profits and economic growth;\n            (4) the reasons for the widening median wage gap between \n        working men and working women; and\n            (5) the reasons for the consistent discrepancy in the \n        average wage of minority populations in comparison to the \n        average wage of white Americans.\nAt the conclusion of the examination, the Commission shall develop \npolicy options for the Congress to address the problems identified in \nthe examination.\n    (b) Scope.--The Commission shall conduct its examination with \nrespect to the States and Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the \nVirgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMarianas Islands.\n    (c) Definition.--As used in section 2 and this section, the term \n``minority populations'' means Blacks (not of Hispanic origin), \nHispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Alaskan \nnatives.\n\nSEC. 5.
