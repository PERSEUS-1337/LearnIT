FINDINGS, PURPOSES AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) fusion energy has the potential to be a safe, \n        environmentally attractive, secure and economically affordable \n        source of energy;\n            (2) the United States Department of Energy's magnetic \n        fusion energy program has made significant progress toward \n        realizing fusion as a viable source of energy;\n            (3) other industrial nations have also invested in \n        significant magnetic fusion energy programs;\n            (4) an integrated program of international collaboration \n        will be necessary for continued progress to demonstrate the \n        scientific and technological feasibility of magnetic fusion \n        energy;\n            (5) there is international agreement to proceed with the \n        engineering and design of the International Thermonuclear \n        Experimental Reactor to prove the scientific and technical \n        feasibility of fusion energy and to lead to a demonstration \n        reactor;\n            (6) the United States should focus the Department of \n        Energy's magnetic fusion energy program on elements furthering \n        the design, construction and operation of the International \n        Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor and a fusion demonstration \n        reactor, including the operation of the Tokamak Physics \n        Experiment;\n            (7) the continuation of an aggressive fusion energy program \n        requires the Department of Energy, industry, utilities, and the \n        international fusion community to commit to the International \n        Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor as soon as practicable; and\n            (8) an effective United States fusion energy program \n        requires substantial involvement by industry and utilities in \n        the design, construction, and operation of fusion facilities.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) redirect and refocus the Department's magnetic fusion \n        energy program in a way that will lead to the design, \n        construction and operation of the International Thermonuclear \n        Experimental Reactor by 2005, in cooperation with other \n        countries, and operation of a fusion demonstration reactor by \n        2025;\n            (2) develop a plan identifying the budget, critical path, \n        milestones and schedules for the International Thermonuclear \n        Experimental Reactor;\n            (3) limit the Department of Energy's magnetic fusion energy \n        program to elements that support the development of the \n        International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor or a fusion \n        demonstration reactor, including the Tokamak Physics Experiment \n        to be built at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory; and\n            (4) select a candidate host site within the United States \n        for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor and to \n        identify the steps necessary to lead to the selection of the \n        final host site by the international community.\n    (c) Definitions.--\n            (1) ``Department'' means the United States Department of \n        Energy;\n            (2) ``ITER'' means the International Thermonuclear \n        Experimental Reactor; and\n            (3) ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the United States \n        Department of Energy.\n\nSEC. 3.
