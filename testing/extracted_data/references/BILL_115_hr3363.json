If the National Association of Registered Agents and \n        Brokers determines at any time that a State no longer is in \n        compliance with the requirements of subsection (a), section 4 \n        shall apply with respect to such State.\n            (3) Judicial review.--The appropriate United States \n        District Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any \n        challenge arising under this section. The court shall apply the \n        standards set forth in section 706 of title 5, United States \n        Code, in reviewing any such challenge.\n\nSEC. 3. STATE AUTHORITIES.\n\n    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to--\n            (1) require a State that does not have licensing \n        requirements for independent claims adjusters to adopt any such \n        requirements;\n            (2) subject to section 2, limit the right of a State to \n        establish licensing fees or enforce its laws regarding the \n        adjusting of insurance claims, provided that such State fee is \n        uniform regardless of the State of residence of the licensee in \n        that State; or\n            (3) affect the jurisdiction and authority of a State \n        insurance regulator to prescribe and enforce its insurance \n        laws, rules, and regulations regulating independent claims \n        adjuster activity in its jurisdiction.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORITY FOR INTERSTATE CLAIMS ADJUSTING.\n\n    In the case of any State that requires and issues licenses for \nindependent claims adjusters but is not in compliance with section 2, \nafter the expiration of the 4-year period beginning on the date of the \nenactment of this Act, an independent claims adjuster may apply to the \nNational Association of Registered Agents and Brokers for Membership \nfor the purpose of licensure in each such State not in compliance with \nsection 2, provided that such independent claims adjuster pays the \nrequisite fees, including licensing fees. For purposes of this \nprovision, upon such date an independent claims adjuster shall be \ndetermined to be a person that negotiates policies of insurance and \noffers advice, counsel, opinions or services related to insurance, as \nsuch terms are used in section 334(5) of Public Law 106-102, as amended \nby section 202(a) of Public Law 114-1 (15 U.S.C. 6764(5); 129 Stat. \n27).\n\nSEC. 5.
