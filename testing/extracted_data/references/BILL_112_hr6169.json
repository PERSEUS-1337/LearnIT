FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the following problems exist \nwith the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (in this section referred to as \nthe ``tax code''):\n            (1) The tax code is unfair, containing hundreds of \n        provisions that only benefit certain special interests, \n        resulting in a system of winners and losers.\n            (2) The tax code violates the fundamental principle of \n        equal justice by subjecting families in similar circumstances \n        to significantly different tax bills.\n            (3)(A) Many tax preferences, sometimes referred to as ``tax \n        expenditures,'' are similar to government spending--instead of \n        markets directing economic resources to their most efficient \n        uses, the Government directs resources to other uses, creating \n        a drag on economic growth and job creation.\n            (B) The exclusions, deductions, credits, and special rules \n        that make up such tax expenditures amount to over $1 trillion \n        per year, nearly matching the total amount of annual revenue \n        that is generated from the income tax itself.\n            (C) In some cases, tax subsidies can literally take the \n        form of spending through the tax code, redistributing taxes \n        paid by some Americans to individuals and businesses who do not \n        pay any income taxes at all.\n            (4) The failure to adopt a permanent tax code with stable \n        statutory tax policy has created greater economic uncertainty. \n        Tax rates have been scheduled to increase sharply in 3 of the \n        last 5 years, requiring the enactment of repeated temporary \n        extensions. Additionally, approximately 70 other, more targeted \n        tax provisions expired in 2011 or are currently scheduled to \n        expire by the end of 2012.\n            (5) Since 2001, there have been nearly 4,500 changes made \n        to the tax code, averaging more than one each day over the past \n        decade.\n            (6) The tax code's complexity leads nearly nine out of ten \n        families either to hire tax preparers (60 percent) or purchase \n        software (29 percent) to file their taxes, while 71 percent of \n        unincorporated businesses are forced to pay someone else to \n        prepare their taxes.\n            (7) The cost of complying with the tax code is too \n        burdensome, forcing individuals, families, and employers to \n        spend over six billion hours and over $160 billion per year \n        trying to comply with the law and pay the actual tax owed.\n            (8) Compliance with the current tax code is a financial \n        hardship for employers that falls disproportionately on small \n        businesses, which spend an average of $74 per hour on tax-\n        related compliance, making it the most expensive paperwork \n        burden they encounter.\n            (9) Small businesses have been responsible for two-thirds \n        of the jobs created in the United States over the past 15 \n        years, and approximately half of small-business profits are \n        taxed at the current top 2 individual rates.\n            (10) The historic range for tax revenues collected by the \n        Federal government has averaged 18 to 19 percent of Gross \n        Domestic Product (GDP), but will rise to 21.2 percent of GDP \n        under current law--a level never reached, let alone sustained, \n        in the Nation's history.\n            (11) The current tax code is highly punitive, with a top \n        Federal individual income tax rate of 35 percent (which is set \n        to climb to over 40 percent in 2013 when taking into account \n        certain hidden rates), meaning some Americans could face a \n        combined local, State and Federal tax rate of 50 percent.\n            (12) The tax code contains harmful provisions, such as the \n        Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which was initially designed to \n        affect only the very highest-income taxpayers but now threatens \n        more than 30 million middle-class households because of a \n        flawed design.\n            (13) As of April 1, 2012, the United States achieved the \n        dubious distinction of having the highest corporate tax rate \n        (39.2 percent for Federal and State combined) in the developed \n        world.\n            (14) The United States corporate tax rate is more than 50 \n        percent higher than the average rate of member states of the \n        Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)--a \n        factor that discourages employers and investors from locating \n        jobs and investments in the United States.\n            (15) The United States has become an outlier in that it \n        still uses a ``worldwide'' system of taxation--one that has not \n        been substantially reformed in 50 years, when the United States \n        accounted for nearly half of global economic output and had no \n        serious competitors around the world.\n            (16) The combination of the highest corporate tax rate with \n        an antiquated ``worldwide'' system subjects American companies \n        to double taxation when they attempt to compete with foreign \n        companies in overseas markets and then reinvest their earnings \n        in the United States.\n            (17) The Nation's outdated tax code has contributed to the \n        fact that the world's largest companies are more likely to be \n        headquartered overseas today than at any point in the last 50 \n        years: In 1960, 17 of the world's 20 largest companies were \n        based in the United States; by 2010, that number sank to a mere \n        six out of 20.\n            (18) The United States has one of the highest levels of \n        taxation on capital--taxing it once at the corporate level and \n        then again at the individual level--with integrated tax rates \n        on certain investment income already reaching roughly 50 \n        percent (and scheduled to reach nearly 70 percent in 2013).\n            (19) The United States' overall taxation of capital is \n        higher than all but four of the 38 countries that make up the \n        OECD and the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China).\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide for \nenactment of comprehensive tax reform in 2013 that--\n            (1) protects taxpayers by creating a fairer, simpler, \n        flatter tax code for individuals and families by--\n                    (A) lowering marginal tax rates and broadening the \n                tax base;\n                    (B) eliminating special interest loopholes;\n                    (C) reducing complexity in the tax code, making tax \n                compliance easier and less costly;\n                    (D) repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax;\n                    (E) maintaining modern levels of progressivity so \n                as to not overburden any one group or further erode the \n                tax base;\n                    (F) making it easier for Americans to save; and\n                    (G) reducing the tax burdens imposed on married \n                couples and families;\n            (2) is comprehensive (addressing both individual and \n        corporate rates), so as to have the maximum economic impact by \n        benefitting employers and their employees regardless of how a \n        business is structured;\n            (3) results in tax revenue consistent with historical \n        norms;\n            (4) spurs greater investment, innovation and job creation, \n        and therefore increases economic activity and the size of the \n        economy on a dynamic basis as compared to the current tax code; \n        and\n            (5) makes American workers and businesses more competitive \n        by--\n                    (A) creating a stable, predictable tax code under \n                which families and employers are best able to plan for \n                the future;\n                    (B) keeping taxes on small businesses low;\n                    (C) reducing America's corporate tax rate, which is \n                currently the highest in the industrialized world;\n                    (D) maintaining a level of parity between \n                individual and corporate rates to reduce economic \n                distortions;\n                    (E) promoting innovation in the United States;\n                    (F) transitioning to a globally competitive \n                territorial tax system;\n                    (G) minimizing the double taxation of investment \n                and capital; and\n                    (H) reducing the impact of taxes on business \n                decision-making to allow such decisions to be driven by \n                their economic potential.\n\nSEC. 3.

If a committee fails to report the tax reform \n        bill within that period, such committee shall be automatically \n        discharged from further consideration of the bill.\n            (2) If the House has not otherwise proceeded to the \n        consideration of the tax reform bill upon the expiration of 15 \n        legislative days after the bill has been placed on the Union \n        Calendar, it shall be in order for the Majority Leader or a \n        designee (or, after the expiration of an additional 2 \n        legislative days, any Member), to offer one motion that the \n        House resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on the \n        state of the Union for the consideration of the tax reform \n        bill. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on \n        the motion to its adoption without intervening motion except 20 \n        minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the \n        proponent and an opponent. If such a motion is adopted, \n        consideration shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (3).

A motion to proceed \n        is in order even though a previous motion to the same effect \n        has been disagreed to. All points of order against the motion \n        to proceed to the tax reform bill are waived. The motion to \n        proceed is not debatable.
