FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Annually at least 1 billion people worldwide contracted \n        one of eight sexually transmitted diseases (``STDs'')--\n        chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, hepatitis B, \n        herpes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and human papilloma \n        virus. Of these, hepatitis B, herpes, HIV, and human papilloma \n        virus are incurable and represented two-thirds of the new \n        infections.\n            (2) In 1999, 15.4 million people in the United States \n        acquired at least one of these eight diseases, the highest rate \n        in the industrialized world. Five of the top 10 most frequently \n        reported infectious diseases (87 percent of all cases) are \n        sexually transmitted. At least 66 million Americans, over 1 in \n        3 adults aged 15-65, are now living with an incurable viral \n        STD.\n            (3) The total costs to the U.S. economy of STDs, excluding \n        HIV infection, were approximately $16 billion. When the costs \n        of sexually-transmitted HIV infection are included, that total \n        rises to $23 billion.\n            (4) STDs impose high human costs in pain, diminished \n        quality of life, disability, and mortality. In women, STDs \n        other than HIV can produce infertility, cancers, and numerous \n        pregnancy-related complications, including ectopic pregnancy, \n        spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth. Passed to a fetus or \n        infant, these infections can cause low birthweight, pneumonia, \n        neurologic damage, and congenital abnormalities. These \n        infections also substantially enhance susceptibility to HIV \n        infection.\n            (5) Individuals of every age and every geographic, racial, \n        cultural, socioeconomic, and religious background are affected \n        by STDs. Some infections are so prevalent that almost everyone \n        is at risk, with many perhaps unaware of their infected status.\n            (6) Biologically and socially, women are more vulnerable to \n        STDs than men. Many STDs are transmitted more easily from a man \n        to a woman and are more likely to remain undetected in women, \n        resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment, and more severe \n        complications.\n            (7) In the United States, HIV morbidity and mortality \n        remain highest among African Americans, who make up 13% of the \n        U.S. population but accounted for almost half of AIDS deaths \n        and new AIDS cases in 1998. For African American women between \n        the ages 25 and 44 in the United States, AIDS now occupies \n        second place as the cause of death.\n            (8) In the United States as well as globally, adolescents \n        and young adults are at highest risk of acquiring a sexually-\n        transmitted infection. At least a quarter of all new cases of \n        STDs occur in teens, two-thirds in people ages 15-24, so that \n        by age 24, at least 1 in 3 sexually-active Americans will have \n        contracted an STD. Teenage girls are at particular risk, \n        behaviorally and physiologically.\n            (9) The social, health, and economic burdens of STDs are \n        especially severe for developing countries. Among women ages \n        15-49 in developing countries, STDs represent the second \n        largest burdens of mortality and disability. Only ``maternal \n        causes,'' that is, immediate complications of pregnancy and \n        childbirth, rank higher.\n            (10) AIDS is rapidly becoming a ``women's epidemic.'' In \n        the United States, women now constitute the fastest growing \n        group of those newly infected with HIV and in Africa, more \n        women are becoming infected with HIV than are men. Worldwide, \n        almost half of the approximately 14,000 adults infected daily \n        with HIV in 1998 were women, of whom 9 out of 10 live in \n        developing countries.\n    (b) Microbicides.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Since the early 1990s, ``topical microbicides'' have \n        attracted scientific attention as a possible new technology for \n        preventing STDs, including HIV. Like today's spermicides, \n        microbicides would be used vaginally by women to help protect \n        themselves, their partners, and their infants from the sexual \n        transmission of HIV and other STD pathogens. These compounds \n        could be formulated in a number of ways--as a gel, film, sponge \n        or time released-capsule--and could be used in addition to \n        condoms or as an alternative when condom use is not possible.\n            (2) For individuals needing to use them without partner \n        knowledge or consent, safe, effective, acceptable, and \n        affordable topical microbicides could be formulated to be \n        undetectable.\n\n   TITLE I--MICROBICIDE RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n SEC. 101.
