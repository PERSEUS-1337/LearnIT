FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The moratorium of the Internet Tax Freedom Act on new \n        taxes on Internet access and on multiple and discriminatory \n        taxes on electronic commerce should be extended.\n            (2) States should be encouraged to simplify their sales and \n        use tax systems.\n            (3) As a matter of economic policy and basic fairness, \n        similar sales transactions should be treated equally, without \n        regard to the manner in which sales are transacted, whether in \n        person, through the mails, over the telephone, on the Internet, \n        or by other means.\n            (4) Congress may facilitate such equal taxation consistent \n        with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Quill Corp. \n        v. North Dakota.\n            (5) States that adequately simplify their tax systems \n        should be authorized to correct the present inequities in \n        taxation through requiring sellers to collect taxes on sales of \n        goods or services delivered in-state, without regard to the \n        location of the seller.\n            (6) The States have experience, expertise, and a vital \n        interest in the collection of sales and use taxes, and thus \n        should take the lead in developing and implementing sales and \n        use tax collection systems that are fair, efficient, and non-\n        discriminatory in their application and that will simplify the \n        process for both sellers and buyers.\n            (7) Online consumer privacy is of paramount importance to \n        the growth of electronic commerce and must be protected.\n\nSEC. 3. EXTENSION OF INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT MORATORIUM.\n\n    Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 \nnote) is amended to read as follows:\n    ``(a) Moratorium.--No State or political subdivision thereof shall \nimpose--\n            ``(1) any taxes on Internet access during the period \n        beginning after September 30, 1998, unless such a tax was \n        generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, \n        1998; and\n            ``(2) multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic \n        commerce during the period beginning on October 1, 1998, and \n        ending on December 31, 2005.''.\n\nSEC. 4. INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Internet Access Services.--Section 1104 of the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 note) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new paragraph:\n            ``(11) Internet access services.--The term `Internet access \n        services' means services that combine computer processing, \n        information storage, protocol conversion, and routing with \n        transmission to enable users to access Internet content and \n        services. Such term does not include receipt of such content or \n        services.''.\n    (b) Internet Access.--Section 1104(5) of the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct (47 U.S.C. 151 note) is amended by striking ``telecommunications \nservices.' and inserting ``telecommunications services generally, but \ndoes include wireless web access services used to enable users to \naccess content, information, electronic mail, or other services offered \nover the Internet, including any comparable package of services offered \nto users.''.\n    (c) Telecommunications Services.--Section 1104(9) of the Internet \nTax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 note) is amended by striking ``and \nincludes communications services (as defined in section 4251 of the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986)''.\n    (d) Wireless Web Access Services.--Section 1104 of the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 note), as amended by subsection (a), is \namended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n            ``(12) Wireless web access services.--The term `wireless \n        web access services' means commercial mobile services (as \n        defined in section 332(d)(1) of Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n        U.S.C. 332(d)(1)), multi-channel, multi-point distribution \n        services, or any wireless telecommunications services used to \n        access the Internet.''.\n\nSEC. 5. STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX SYSTEM.\n\n    (a) Development of Streamlined System.--It is the sense of Congress \nthat States and localities should work together to develop a \nstreamlined sales and use tax system that addresses the following in \nthe context of remote sales:\n            (1) A centralized, one-stop, multi-state reporting, \n        submission, and payment system for sellers.\n            (2) Uniform definitions for goods or services, the sale of \n        which may, by State action, be included in the tax base.\n            (3) Uniform rules for attributing transactions to \n        particular taxing jurisdictions.\n            (4) Uniform procedures for--\n                    (A) the treatment of purchasers exempt from sales \n                and use taxes; and\n                    (B) relief from liability for sellers that rely on \n                such State procedures.\n            (5) Uniform procedures for the certification of software \n        that sellers rely on to determine sales and use tax rates and \n        taxability.\n            (6) A uniform format for tax returns and remittance forms.\n            (7) Consistent electronic filing and remittance methods.\n            (8) State administration of all State and local sales and \n        use taxes.\n            (9) Uniform audit procedures, including a provision giving \n        a seller the option to be subject to no more than a single \n        audit per year using those procedures; except that if the \n        seller does not comply with the procedures to elect a single \n        audit, any State can conduct an audit using those procedures.\n            (10) Reasonable compensation for tax collection by sellers.\n            (11) Exemption from use tax collection requirements for \n        remote sellers falling below a de minimis threshold of \n        $5,000,000 in gross annual sales.\n            (12) Appropriate protections for consumer privacy.\n            (13) Such other features that the States deem warranted to \n        promote simplicity, uniformity, neutrality, efficiency, and \n        fairness.\n    (b) No Undue Burden.--Congress finds that, if adopted, the system \ndescribed in subsection (a) will not place an undue burden on \ninterstate commerce or burden the growth of electronic commerce and \nrelated technologies in any material way.\n    (c) Study.--It is the sense of Congress that a joint, comprehensive \nstudy should be commissioned by State and local governments and the \nbusiness community to determine the cost to all sellers of collecting \nand remitting State and local sales and use taxes on sales made by \nsellers under the law as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act \nand under the system described in subsection (a) to assist in \ndetermining what constitutes reasonable compensation.\n\nSEC. 6. INTERSTATE SALES AND USE TAX COMPACT.\n\n    (a) Authorization and Consent.--In general, the States are \nauthorized to enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact. \nSubject to subsection (c), Congress consents to their entry into that \nCompact. The Compact shall describe a uniform, streamlined sales and \nuse tax system consistent with section 5(a), and shall provide that \nStates joining the Compact must adopt that system.\n    (b) Expiration.--The authorization and consent in subsection (a) \nshall expire if the Compact has not been formed before January 1, 2006.\n    (c) Congressional Consent Withdrawn if Compact Disapproved.--\n            (1) Adopting states to transmit.--Upon the 20th State \n        becoming a signatory to the Compact, the adopting States shall \n        transmit a copy of the Compact to Congress.\n            (2) Congressional action.--The consent of Congress to the \n        Compact is withdrawn if Congress, by law, disapproves the \n        Compact within 120 days (computed in accordance with section \n        154 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2194)) after the \n        adopting States transmit the Compact to Congress.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION TO SIMPLIFY STATE USE-TAX RATES THROUGH \n              AVERAGING.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subject to the exception in subsection (c), a \nState that adopts the Compact authorized under section 6 and that \nlevies a use tax shall impose a single, uniform State-wide use-tax rate \non all remote sales on which it assesses a use tax for any calendar \nyear for which the State meets the requirements of subsection (b).\n    (b) Averaging Requirement.--A State meets the requirements of this \nsubsection for any calendar year in which the single, uniform State-\nwide use-tax rate is in effect if such rate is no greater than the \nweighted average of the sales tax rates actually imposed by the State \nand its local jurisdictions during the 12-month period ending on June \n30 prior to such calendar year.\n    (c) Annual Option To Collect Actual Tax.--Notwithstanding \nsubsection (a), a remote seller may elect annually to collect the \nactual applicable State and local use taxes on each sale made in the \nState.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION TO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF USE TAXES.\n\n    (a) Grant of Authority.--\n            (1) States that adopt the system may require collection.--\n        Any State that has adopted the system described in the Compact \n        is authorized, notwithstanding any other provision of law, to \n        require all sellers not qualifying for the de minimis exception \n        to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote sales to \n        purchasers located in such State after the expiration of the \n        120 day period described by section 6(c)(2) unless the Compact \n        is disapproved under section 6(c).\n            (2) States that do not adopt the system may not require \n        collection.--Paragraph (1) does not extend to any State that \n        does not adopt the system described in the Compact.\n    (b) No Effect on Nexus, Etc.--No obligation imposed by virtue of \nauthority granted by subsection (a)(1) or denied by subsection (a)(2) \nshall be considered in determining whether a seller has a nexus with \nany State for any other tax purpose. Except as provided in subsection \n(a), nothing in this Act permits or prohibits a State--\n            (1) to license or regulate any person;\n            (2) to require any person to qualify to transact intrastate \n        business; or\n            (3) to subject any person to State taxes not related to the \n        sale of goods or services.\n\nSEC. 9. NEXUS FOR STATE BUSINESS ACTIVITY TAXES.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that before the conclusion of the 107th \nCongress, legislation should be enacted to determine the appropriate \nfactors to be considered in establishing whether nexus exists for State \nbusiness activity tax purposes.\n\nSEC. 10. LIMITATION.\n\n    In general, nothing in this Act shall be construed as subjecting \nsellers to franchise taxes, income taxes, or licensing requirements of \na State or political subdivision thereof, nor shall anything in this \nAct be construed as affecting the application of such taxes or \nrequirements or enlarging or reducing the authority of any State or \npolitical subdivision to impose such taxes or requirements.\n\nSEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) State.--The term ``State'' means any State of the \n        United States of America and includes the District of Columbia.\n            (2) Goods or services.--The term ``goods or services'' \n        includes tangible and intangible personal property and \n        services.\n            (3) Remote sale.--The term ``remote sale'' means a sale in \n        interstate commerce of goods or services attributed, under the \n        rules established pursuant to section 5(a)(3), to a particular \n        taxing jurisdiction that could not, except for the authority \n        granted by this Act, require that the seller of such goods or \n        services collect and remit sales or use taxes on such sale.\n            (4) Locus of remote sale.--The term ``particular taxing \n        jurisdiction'', when used with respect to the location of a \n        remote sale, means a remote sale of goods or services \n        attributed, under the rules established pursuant to section \n        5(a)(3), to a particular taxing jurisdiction."
