FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Military operations in Afghanistan have cost American \n        taxpayers more than $200,000,000,000 in deficit spending since \n        2001.\n            (2) Particularly given current record deficits, high \n        unemployment, and proposed reductions in domestic spending, the \n        United States should ensure future war expenditures in \n        Afghanistan do not add to the deficit and ensure that resources \n        are not squandered on waste, fraud, abuse, or corruption in \n        Afghanistan.\n            (3) United States military and nonmilitary operations in \n        Afghanistan, including those conducted by contractors, must be \n        subject to the highest standards of transparency and \n        accountability, and subject to the review of appropriate \n        inspectors general.\n            (4) According to the most recent Army Mental Health \n        Advisory Team Assessment, one in five soldiers surveyed in \n        Afghanistan reports having psychological problems.\n            (5) The United States needs a comprehensive strategy to \n        counter the global threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates \n        in Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, North Africa, and elsewhere around \n        the world.\n            (6) A massive, open-ended United States military presence \n        in Afghanistan is unlikely to advance, and may undermine, \n        United States efforts to eliminate the safe haven for al Qaeda \n        in Pakistan and combat al Qaeda globally.\n            (7) Rather than engaging in a nation-building effort in \n        Afghanistan, the United States should begin reducing troop \n        levels in Afghanistan and transition to a sustainable \n        counterterrorism policy.\n            (8) President Obama announced on December 1, 2009, that \n        United States troops would begin to be withdrawn from \n        Afghanistan in July 2011.\n            (9) The United States remains committed to providing long-\n        term economic, diplomatic, and political support to the people \n        of Afghanistan, and to supporting the emergence of a \n        legitimate, effective government in Afghanistan.\n            (10) The United States will continue to provide economic, \n        development, and political support for women's rights, \n        education, and leadership in Afghanistan.\n            (11) The August 20, 2009, presidential election in \n        Afghanistan was characterized by widespread fraud, and there \n        are credible reports of widespread corruption.\n            (12) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral \n        Michael Mullen, has acknowledged that the greatest threat in \n        Afghanistan today is the ``lack of legitimacy in the \n        government--at all levels'' and that the United States Armed \n        Forces cannot solve the legitimacy problem.\n            (13) General McChrystal has acknowledged that United States \n        partnerships with ``polarizing and predatory'' powerbrokers, \n        including in the Afghan National Security Forces, compromise \n        the ability of the United States to address the lack of \n        legitimacy in the Afghanistan Government.\n\nSEC. 2. PLAN FOR THE SAFE, ORDERLY, AND EXPEDITIOUS REDEPLOYMENT OF \n              UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM AFGHANISTAN.\n\n    (a) Plan With Timetable Required.--Not later than January 1, 2011, \nor 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, whichever is \nearlier, the President shall submit to Congress a plan for the safe, \norderly, and expeditious redeployment of United States Armed Forces \nfrom Afghanistan, including military and security-related contractors, \ntogether with a timetable for the completion of that redeployment and \ninformation regarding variables that could alter that timetable.\n    (b) Status Updates.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nsubmittal of the plan required by subsection (a), and every 90 days \nthereafter, the President shall submit to the Congress a report setting \nforth the current status of the plan for redeploying United States \nArmed Forces from Afghanistan.\n    (c) Recommendations on Contractor Oversight.--\n            (1) Recommendations required.--Not later than 90 days after \n        the date of the enactment of this Act, the Special Inspector \n        General for Afghanistan Reconstruction shall, in consultation \n        with the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and the \n        Inspector General of the Department of State--\n                    (A) issue recommendations on measures to increase \n                oversight of contractors engaged in activities relating \n                to Afghanistan that have a record of engaging in waste, \n                fraud, or abuse; and\n                    (B) report on the status of efforts of the \n                Department of Defense and the Department of State to \n                implement existing recommendations regarding oversight \n                of such contractors.\n            (2) Elements of recommendations.--The recommendations \n        issued under paragraph (1)(A) shall include recommendations for \n        reducing the reliance of the United States on security \n        contractors or subcontractors responsible for the deaths of \n        Afghan civilians and on Afghan militias, contractors, \n        subcontractors, or other armed groups that are not part of the \n        Afghan National Security Forces."
