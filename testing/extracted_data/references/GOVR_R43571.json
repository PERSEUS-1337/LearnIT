    "content": "Federal student loan programs that make available loan forgiveness or repayment in return for service in certain professions or occupations have existed since the enactment of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (NDEA; P.L. 85-864), which authorized the National Defense Student Loan (NDSL) program. In recognition of the high costs to individuals of borrowing to finance postsecondary education expenses and to address identified needs for individuals to perform certain types of service or work in certain occupations, an array of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been enacted. These programs offer borrowers a means to have all or part of their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in return for work or service in specific fields or professions or for satisfying certain conditions relating to borrower debt and income. Throughout the years, various federal loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs have been created, and presently, over 50 such programs are authorized, approximately 30 of which were operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness (sometimes also referred to as cancellation or discharge) programs and loan repayment programs are characterized by the federal government's forgiving, canceling, or discharging all or a portion of an individual's total student loan indebtedness or making loan payments on a borrower's behalf, upon the individual satisfying certain requirements. Loan forgiveness and loan repayment benefits are often contingent upon a borrower completing a period of employment in public service or in certain other occupations. Increasingly, however, loan forgiveness benefits have begun to be offered as a component of certain income-driven student loan repayment plans. While the various programs operate somewhat differently, they are generally intended to support at least one of the following goals: Provide a financial incentive to encourage individuals to enter public service or a particular profession, occupation, or occupational specialty. Provide a financial incentive to encourage individuals to remain employed in a high-need profession or occupation\u2014often in certain locations. Provide debt relief to borrowers who, after repaying their student loans as a proportion of their income for an extended period of time, have not completely repaid their entire student loan debt.  These types of loan forgiveness and loan repayment benefits provide debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who make an active choice to enter public service or obtain employment in particular professions, occupations, or specialties, or to repay their loans according to an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. Other forms of debt relief also may be available to borrowers who experience certain unfortunate circumstances. These forms of debt relief\u2014which are beyond the scope of this report\u2014include loan discharge for borrowers who become totally and permanently disabled, loan discharge upon death of the individual on whose behalf a loan was made, discharge for closure of the borrower's school, discharge for false certification of student eligibility, discharge for loans made without the borrower's authorization, discharge for unpaid refunds by a school following the borrower's withdrawal from school, discharge upon the successful assertion of a defense to repayment, and discharge in bankruptcy.  One of the earliest federal student loan programs that made loan forgiveness available to borrowers was the NDSL program, authorized under the NDEA in 1958. The NDSL program was established, in part, as a response to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' 1957 launch of the Sputnik satellite. Many Members of Congress viewed this as an issue of national security, as they believed this event illustrated that the United States was falling behind in technological developments. To address this perceived national security issue, Congress decided to target and fund improvements in education programs because national security required \"the fullest development of mental resources and technical skills of its young men and women.\" The establishment of the NDSL program made low-interest loans available to college students to help them pursue their studies. Also as part of the NDSL program, Congress authorized a student loan forgiveness component, which was intended to increase the number and quality of teachers in U.S. schools. Specifically, students who taught full-time in a public elementary or secondary school were eligible to have up to half of their student loans cancelled. Over the years, the NDSL loan forgiveness provisions were amended, with the teacher loan forgiveness benefits targeted at individuals who were either teaching in elementary or secondary schools at which low-income students made up more than 30% of the enrollment or were teaching students with disabilities full-time. Loan forgiveness benefits were also expanded to be available to individuals serving in a Head Start program and those serving in an area of hostility while in the Armed Forces. Through these provisions, qualified borrowers became eligible to have a portion of their loans canceled based on the number of years of public service completed. The NDSL program was incorporated into the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA; P.L. 89-329) through the Education Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-318) and was later renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program by amendments made through the Higher Education Amendments of 1986 ( P.L. 99-498 ). Subsequent to the enactment of the NDEA, other federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs were established to target borrowers who entered other professions and worked in high-need areas. For instance, in 1965, a loan forgiveness component modeled after the NDSL was incorporated into the Health Professions Student Loan Program (HPSLP), authorized under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA; P.L. 89-290). Under this program, borrowers who practiced medicine in locations with a health manpower shortage (as defined) could have up to 50% of their loans forgiven. Following these early student loan repayment and forgiveness programs, many additional programs were enacted and currently over 50 such programs exist.  This report identifies and describes federal student loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs that are currently authorized by federal law. It provides brief, summary descriptions of identified programs. These program descriptions are intended to provide policymakers with general information about the purpose of existing programs and how they are designed to operate. The program descriptions are not intended to be comprehensive in nature. Readers interested in comprehensive details about a particular program are encouraged to refer to additional resources, including federal statutes, regulations, and agency guidance. Citations are provided for the various programs identified in this report.  Over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs are currently authorized under federal law. Although each program is designed to operate somewhat differently, they are all intended to provide student loan debt relief to borrowers who perform specified types of service, enter into and remain employed in certain professions, serve in certain locations, or repay their loans according to an income-driven repayment plan for an extended period of time. Each of the various programs has unique characteristics and may be distinguished by features such as differing borrower eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, the means through which benefits are provided, or how the program is funded. In this overview, several parameters are identified and used to broadly characterize various aspects of the currently authorized programs. As some of the terms commonly used to identify the benefits offered through these programs (e.g., loan forgiveness, cancellation, or repayment) are often used inconsistently from program to program, this report's use of a consistent set of parameters to characterize various aspects of the programs facilitates the description and examination of some of the similarities and differences between the various programs. In employment-focused loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs, a borrower typically must work or serve in a certain function, profession, or geographic location for a specified period of time to qualify for benefits. Under repayment plan-based loan forgiveness, a borrower typically must repay according to an income-driven repayment plan for a specified period of time to qualify for benefits. At the end of the specified term, some or all of the individual's qualifying student loan debt is forgiven or repaid on his or her behalf. The individual is thus relieved of responsibility for repaying that portion of his or her student loan debt. One of the most important distinctions among these types of programs is whether the availability of benefits is incorporated into the loan terms and conditions and is thus considered an entitlement to qualified borrowers or whether benefits are made available to qualified borrowers at the discretion of the entity administering the program and whether the benefits are subject to the availability of funds. For the purposes of this report, the former types of programs are referred to as loan forgiveness while the latter are referred to as loan repayment . In general, loan forgiveness benefits are broadly available to borrowers of qualified loans. The availability of these benefits is expressed to borrowers in their loan documents, such as the master promissory note and the borrower's rights and responsibilities statement. A borrower who satisfies the loan forgiveness program's eligibility criteria, as set forth in the loan terms and conditions, is entitled to the loan forgiveness benefits. Benefits that are entitlements to qualified borrowers are generally funded through mandatory appropriations and accounted for as part of federal student loan subsidy costs, which are discussed in detail later in the section titled \" Cost of Loan Forgiveness and Loan Repayment Programs .\" There are two broad categories of loan forgiveness benefits: loan forgiveness for public service employment and loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs also provide debt relief to borrowers for service in a specific function, profession, or location. However, in contrast to employment-focused loan forgiveness programs, the entity that administers a loan repayment program typically either directly repays some or all of the qualified borrower's student loan debt on his or her behalf or provides funding to a separate entity for purposes of implementing a loan repayment program and making such payments. Loan repayment benefits are generally offered through programs that are separate or distinct from the program through which a federal student loan is made. In many instances, these programs are designed to address broad employment needs or shortages (e.g., within a specific occupation or geographic location), while other such programs are intended to help individual federal agencies recruit and retain qualified employees, often serving as an additional form of compensation to targeted employees, who may be harder to recruit or retain. Both types of loan repayment benefits are generally available to a limited number of qualified borrowers. Typically, loan repayment benefits are discretionary and their availability is subject to the appropriation of funds.  A related distinguishing characteristic of the types of debt relief programs examined in this report is the extent to which an individual may incur a federal income tax liability based on receipt of the program's benefit. In general, debt forgiven under an employment-focused loan forgiveness program is excluded from a borrower's gross income for federal income tax purposes, and therefore, the borrower would not be responsible for paying the federal income tax liability associated with the forgiveness benefit received. On the other hand, debt forgiven following income-driven repayment or repaid for public service employment is often included in a borrower's gross income for federal income tax purposes, and therefore, the borrower would be responsible for paying the income tax liability associated with the forgiveness or repayment benefit received. The text box below provides a summary of some of the distinguishing features of the three categories of debt relief programs examined in this report: programs that provide loan forgiveness for public service employment, programs that provide loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment, and programs that provide loan repayment for public service employment. There are three broad categories of loans that may be eligible for inclusion in federal loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs:  1. Federal student loans made through programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) and administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA). 2. Student loans made through programs authorized by Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). 3. Private (nonfederal) education loans.  For most federal loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs, eligible loans include only federal student loans made through HEA or PHSA programs; however, for a small number of programs, eligible loans also include private education loans. Brief summaries of student loan types that may be eligible for loan forgiveness or loan repayment are provided below. At present, federal student loans are being made only through one HEA, Title IV federal student aid program\u2014the Direct Loan program authorized under Part D of Title IV. However, federal student loans were previously also made through two other HEA programs. Until June 30, 2010, federal student loans were also made through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, a guaranteed loan program, authorized under Part B of Title IV. FFEL program loans were made with terms and conditions that were substantially similar to those of loans offered through the Direct Loan program. Until September 30, 2017, federal student loans had been made through the Federal Perkins Loan program, which was authorized under Part E of Title IV. In the Direct Loan program, loans are made by the government with federal capital. ED administers the program, and activities such as loan origination, servicing, and collection are performed by federal contractors. In the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders with nonfederal capital. These entities were responsible for originating, holding, and servicing these loans. Nonprofit guaranty agencies administer federal loan insurance and process loan forgiveness benefits. During the period when the FFEL and Direct Loan programs both operated, one set of loan types was made through the FFEL program and another similar set of loan types was made through the Direct Loan program. While these two sets of loan types had borrower terms and conditions that were quite similar, some of the ways in which they differed pertained to availability of loan forgiveness benefits. Where applicable, differences in the availability of loan forgiveness benefits are noted in the discussion that follows. In the Perkins Loan program, loans were made by institutions of higher education (IHEs) with a combination of capital provided by the federal government and capital provided by the institution. In the Perkins Loan program, the institution served as the lender and remain responsible for originating and servicing Perkins Loans and for processing loan cancelation benefits. The following loan types comprise the primary types of loans that are currently being made\u2014or were made in recent years\u2014through HEA, Title IV federal student loan programs.  In the Direct Loan program, Direct Subsidized Loans are available only to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The federal government \"subsidizes\" these loans by not assessing interest charges while the borrower is enrolled in an eligible academic program on at least a half-time basis, during a six-month grace period prior the loan entering repayment status, and during periods of authorized deferment. Prior to July 1, 2012, Direct Subsidized Loans were also available to graduate and professional students. Borrowing limits restrict the amounts that students may borrow during a given academic year and in the aggregate over multiple years. In FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans, totaling $21.5 billion, were made. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Students are not required to demonstrate financial need to be eligible to borrow these loans. As a non-need-based loan, loan proceeds may be used to finance portions of a student's cost of attendance (COA) that would otherwise be expected to be met by the student's expected family contribution (EFC) toward postsecondary education expenses. For these loans, the borrower is responsible for paying all the interest that accrues on the loan from the time it is disbursed, although interest payments may be deferred until the loan enters repayment status. Unsubsidized Loan borrowing is also limited by annual and aggregate borrowing limits. In FY2017, 8.1 million Direct Unsubsidized Loans, totaling $49.8 billion, were made. Direct PLUS Loans are available to the parents of undergraduate students who are dependent on them for financial support, as well as to graduate and professional students. Like Unsubsidized Loans, these are non-need-based loans and may be used to finance postsecondary education expenses that would otherwise be expected to be met by a student's EFC. There are no explicit limits to the amount an individual may borrow in PLUS Loans. Rather, each year, an individual may borrow up to the amount that the COA of the student on whose behalf the loan is made is greater than his or her estimated financial assistance (EFA) from other sources (e.g., Pell Grants, Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, private scholarships, etc.). In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct PLUS Loans, totaling $12.5 billion, were made to parents of undergraduate students and 0.6 million Direct PLUS Loans, totaling $9.9 billion, were made to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers with existing federal student loans to combine their loan obligations into a single loan and to extend their repayment period.  Consolidation Loans must include at least one loan made through either the Direct Loan or the FFEL program. In addition, Consolidation Loans may include loans made through the federal student loan programs authorized or previously authorized under Title IV of the HEA and loans made through the following programs authorized under Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA (described below):  Health Professions Student Loans (HPSL) Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS) Nursing Student Loans (NSL) Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) That borrowers may incorporate different loan types into a Consolidation Loan is particularly relevant in the examination of loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs. This characteristic of Consolidation Loans facilitates the extension of certain loan forgiveness and loan repayment benefits to borrowers of loans originally made without those benefits upon such loans being incorporated into a Consolidation Loan.  The Direct Consolidation Loans currently being made are fixed rate loans for which the interest rate is based on the weighted average interest rate of the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest higher one-eighth of 1%. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans, totaling $48.8 billion, were made. Perkins Loans were available to undergraduate and graduate and professional students. IHEs were required to make Perkins Loans reasonably available to all eligible students, with priority given to students with exceptional financial need. Interest on Perkins Loans is fixed at 5% per year, and interest does not accrue prior to a borrower's beginning repayment or during periods of authorized deferment. Borrowers who are engaged in certain types of public service may have a portion of their Perkins Loans cancelled for each complete year of service. In FY2017, approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans, totaling $782,230 million, were made. HRSA, within HHS, makes student loans to specific health professions students through five loan programs authorized under Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA. Collectively these programs made 20,849 loans in academic year 2016-2017 for a total of approximately $162.8 million. The five programs are described below.  This program provides low interest rate loans to full-time students who are pursuing degrees in dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, or veterinary medicine. The program is administered by schools that select participants who are citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States and financially needy. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated that it made 6,842 loans, totaling $64.2 million.  This program provides 5% fixed interest rate loans to full-time students who are pursuing degrees in allopathic or osteopathic medicine. The program is administered by individual medical schools that select participants who are citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States and financially needy. In exchange for receiving a primary care loan, students must complete a residency in a primary care field (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, preventive medicine, osteopathic general practice or combined programs in internal medicine and pediatrics) and practice in a primary care field for 10 years. Loan recipients who fail to meet the service requirements must repay their primary care loans at a higher interest rate of 7%. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated that it made 252 loans, totaling $17.8 million.  This program provides need-based, low interest rate loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds\u2014defined as coming from a background that has inhibited the individual from pursuing a health professional degree or coming from a low-income background based on the family's income\u2014who are pursuing degrees in allopathic or osteopathic medicine, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine. The program is administered by individual schools that select students who are citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated that it made 1,619 loans, totaling $21.7 million.  This program provides low interest rate loans to students who are pursuing studies that lead to a diploma, associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree in nursing. The program is administered by nursing schools that select participants who are citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States and financially needy. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated that it made 10,138 loans, totaling $31.8 million.  This program provides loans to registered nurses who are completing their graduate studies necessary to become qualified nursing school faculty. The program is administered by individual nursing schools that offer eligible advanced masters or doctoral degree nursing programs. Nursing schools select participants for loans and may also offer loan forgiveness (see \"Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program\" in Appendix A ). For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated that it made 1,998 loans, totaling $27.3million.  A sixth program, the Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, authorized in Title VII, Part A-I of the PHSA, no longer makes new loans, but the program continues to receive an appropriation to administer outstanding loans. HEAL program loans were gradually phased out between 1995 and 1999 but were available to students to support their pursuit of degrees in allopathic and osteopathic medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry, public health, pharmacy, chiropractic, and graduate programs in health administration, clinical psychology, and allied health professions. Although the authority to make new HEAL program loans has been terminated, borrowers of these loans remain responsible for making payments on their loans. In addition to the student loans made through the federal student loan programs identified above, student loans are also made by a variety of nonfederal entities. The most common of these are student loans made by private financial institutions (e.g., banks, credit unions), student loans made through state-supported loan programs, and loans made by IHEs. These types of loans are sometimes referred to as private student loans or alternative loans. The terms and conditions of private education loans are specified by the entity responsible for making these loans. While private education loans are not made through federal loan programs, a small number of federal loan repayment programs make benefits available to borrowers of some types of these loans. All student loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs provide some form of debt relief to borrowers who satisfy certain eligibility criteria. While these programs all support the broad common purpose of providing borrowers with debt relief, they are distinguished by unique program characteristics and features. This section of the report first outlines the three categories of debt relief programs discussed above (see \" Distinction among Loan Forgiveness and Loan\u00a0Repayment\u00a0Programs \") and the qualifying criteria for borrowers associated with these three broad categories. It then identifies a number of program components or parameters that are used to characterize or classify the various programs and to facilitate the examination of and comparison between the various programs using a common terminology. Major program components examined include types of qualifying service, the consideration of borrower economic circumstances, amounts and timing of debt relief, and exclusions or limitations on benefits. For program-specific details on the programs discussed in this section, see Appendix A . This section presents the primary categories of debt relief programs largely in order of their potential scope of availability to borrowers. First, the loan forgiveness entitlement programs are presented, as they are potentially the largest in scale, with programs providing loan forgiveness for public service presented first and then programs providing loan forgiveness as a component of income-driven repayment plans. Programs providing loan repayment for broad public service or employment needs are then presented, because their availability to borrowers is generally limited to a discrete number of individuals and they are smaller in scale than programs providing loan forgiveness. Finally, programs providing loan repayment for public service in government employment are presented, as they are generally more narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs and are likely the smallest in scale of the loan repayment and forgiveness programs.  As described above, loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers employed in certain occupations, for specific employers, or in public service. These benefits are considered entitlements and are written into the terms and conditions of widely available federal student loans (e.g., Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Perkins Loans). They are potentially available to an open-ended number of qualified borrowers.  Table 1 provides a summary of the various loan forgiveness for public service employment programs offered. It highlights whether forgiveness benefits are available to borrowers who are employed with a single specified employer, one of multiple eligible employers, or if there is no specific employer requirement. It also highlights whether benefits are available to borrowers who are employed in a single specified occupation, one of multiple eligible occupations; or if there is no specific occupation requirement. Finally, it highlights whether a borrower must qualify based, in part, on their economic circumstances during repayment (i.e., whether the program has an eligibility component that assesses the borrower's income). The table also provides details on the operational status of the program. Programs are listed in descending order of their size to reflect the scale of benefits that have been or are estimated to be made available to borrowers.  Table 1 illustrates that although loan forgiveness benefits are entitlements that are potentially available to a wide array of borrowers, to qualify for benefits borrowers must still meet specific eligibility criteria, including completing a specific type of service or entering into a particular occupation or profession.  All three programs are widely available to individuals serving as teachers, while Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation is available to individuals who also serve in other specific public service occupations, such as law enforcement personnel and public defenders, and Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness is available to an even broader array of individuals who are employed full-time in public service, which includes employment in federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies, and certain nonprofit organizations. Additionally, borrowers of loans made under these programs must serve for a minimum period of time. For these loan forgiveness programs, service commitments generally last between 1 year (for partial benefits) and 10 years. Loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment provides debt relief to borrowers who repay their federal student loans as a proportion of their income for an extended period of time but who have not repaid their entire student loan debt. These benefits are considered entitlements and are written into the terms and conditions of widely available federal student loans (e.g., Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans). These repayment plans are potentially available to an open-ended number of qualified borrowers; however, they are distinct from those programs that target public service employment.   Table 2 provides a summary of the various loan forgiveness programs that provide debt relief to individuals following income-driven repayment and provides details on the operational status of each program. The table is organized according to the date on which borrowers first became eligible to repay under each plan. Unlike the loan forgiveness programs presented in Table 1 , these programs are not grouped by the potential scope of availability to borrowers and financial resources used to provide benefits, because numerous factors and borrower characteristics may affect program participation, which makes it difficult to estimate the potential scope of each program.   Table 2 illustrates that the various programs that provide loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment are widely available to a potentially open-ended number of borrowers who meet income-driven qualifications. Unlike loan forgiveness or repayment programs that seek to encourage borrowers to enter into certain service or occupational commitments, no such employer-specific or occupational or service requirements exist for these programs. Rather, under each of the above programs, borrowers generally must make monthly payments towards their qualifying federal student loans for a specified period of time (between 20 and 25 years). The amount of monthly payments is determined based on factors including the amount of the student loan debt, family size, and adjusted gross income; monthly payments are capped at a percentage of a borrower's discretionary income (between 10% and 20%) or other income-driven criteria. At the end of each program's repayment period, the outstanding balance of a borrower's loans is then forgiven and they are no longer responsible for payments on their loans. Loan repayment for public service employment provides debt relief benefits to borrowers employed in specific occupations, for specific employers, or in public service. Some of these program benefits are often used to meet broad employment needs or shortages (e.g., within specific occupations or geographic locations), while others are intended to help individual government agencies recruit and retain qualified employees and often serve as additional compensation, similar to benefits offered by private employers. Both types of loan repayment for public service employment are generally available to a limited number of qualified borrowers, subject to the appropriation of program funds; they are not considered entitlements to qualified borrowers.  Loan repayment programs addressing broad employment needs or shortages are generally available to a limited number of qualified borrowers and subject to the appropriation of program funds. These programs are smaller in scale, when considering their availability to borrowers, than are the previously discussed loan forgiveness programs.  Table 3 provides a summary of the various loan repayment programs offered for the purposes of meeting broad employment needs or shortages. It highlights whether repayment benefits are available to borrowers who are employed with a single specified employer, one of multiple eligible employers, or if no particular employer is specified. It also highlights whether benefits are available to borrowers who are employed in a single specified occupation, one of multiple eligible occupations; or if there is no specific occupational requirement. Finally, it highlights whether borrowers must qualify based, in part, on their economic circumstances (i.e., whether the program has an eligibility component that assesses the borrower's income).  The table is organized by operational status of each program, and within each operational subheading, programs are grouped by administering department or agency. Unlike the loan forgiveness programs presented in Table 1 , these programs are not grouped by the potential scope of availability to borrowers and financial resources used to provide benefits, because such data are inconsistently available across programs.  Table 3 illustrates the variety of employment needs these broad-based loan repayment programs are currently intended to meet. In total, there are 19 such programs, and 15 of these programs are targeted, at least in part, to health-related occupations. Of these health-related occupations programs, eight are intended to specifically address health care provider shortages and four are intended to meet health care faculty needs. Other occupations specifically targeted by loan repayment programs to meet broad employment needs include legal occupations and large animal veterinarians who provide emergency services.  In most of the programs detailed in Table 3 , borrowers need not fulfill their service obligations with a single individual employer. Rather, they may fulfill their service by working for multiple employers within the broader class of employers. Some of these programs, however, require borrowers to serve in specific geographic locations, typically underserved rural or disadvantaged areas. Finally, like the loan forgiveness programs, borrowers participating in loan repayment programs must serve for a minimum period of time. For such programs, service commitments generally last between one and five years.  Loan repayment programs to recruit and retain federal government employees are generally narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs and are potentially the smallest in scale of the loan repayment and forgiveness programs. Although, for many of these programs, information on the programs' scale (e.g., number of benefit recipients and amount of benefits received) is not readily available, the Office of Personnel Management annually reports on the number of agencies participating in, the number of beneficiaries from, and the amount of benefits received from the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program.  Table 4 provides a summary of the various loan repayment programs offered for the purposes of individual federal agencies' recruiting and retaining qualified employees. It highlights whether repayment benefits are available only to borrowers who are employed by a single government agency or if benefits may be offered by federal government employers. It also highlights whether benefits are available only to borrowers who are employed in a single specified occupation, one of multiple eligible occupations; or if no occupational requirement is specified. In addition, it highlights whether borrowers must qualify based, in part, on their economic circumstances (i.e., whether the program has an eligibility component that assesses the borrower's income).  The table is organized by operational status of each program, and within each operational subheading, programs are grouped by administering department or agency. Unlike the loan forgiveness programs presented in Table 1 , these programs are not grouped by the potential scope of availability to borrowers and financial resources used to provide benefits, because such data are inconsistently available across programs.  Table 4 shows the array of loan repayment programs operated by federal agencies as a means of recruiting and retaining qualified employees. There are 25 such programs, and of these programs, 8 are designed specifically to recruit and retain members of the Armed Forces, with many of the other programs available at federal agencies to varying degrees.  The programs detailed in Table 4 vary as to whether benefits are available to any employee within an agency or only to employees in specific occupations at the agency. Several programs are generally open to any agency employee, while others are available to employees employed in fields or occupations designated by the administering agency as hard-to-fill or in-need, and yet others are available to agency employees who are employed in certain fields or occupations. Finally, like the loan repayment programs designed to meet broad employment needs or shortages, borrowers participating in loan repayment programs must serve for a minimum period of time. For such programs, service commitments generally are between one and five years. Individuals' economic circumstances may affect eligibility, with several loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs using a borrower's economic circumstances as a criterion to qualify for benefits. There are two primary ways that individuals may qualify for benefits based on their economic circumstances. Some programs allow individuals to qualify for benefits based on their economic circumstances at the time they borrow, while other programs allow individuals to qualify for benefits based on their economic circumstances during the repayment period. In some programs, the borrower's economic circumstance is one factor that is considered alongside others, such as qualifying types of service. Typically, for programs that extend debt relief to borrowers based on their economic circumstances, individuals may be eligible to receive program benefits if they are from a disadvantaged background (based on family economic circumstances) or if their expected monthly loan payment exceeds a certain percentage of their income.  Programs can also be categorized by the amount of loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits provided and the schedule for providing those benefits to qualified borrowers. There are three primary methods used to determine the amount of benefits an individual is eligible to receive and when those benefits are realized. Generally, programs forgive the entire outstanding balance of a borrower's loans or repay either a flat dollar amount specified in the authorizing statute or a percentage of the outstanding loan. Several programs offer to forgive the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans. Typically, in these programs, a borrower is required to make a certain number of payments towards the balance of their student loans, and at the end of a specified period of time, the remaining balance of their outstanding loans is forgiven.  A second way in which benefits may be awarded is by an employer paying repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount, usually either paid as a lump sum or in a series of regular payments (e.g., monthly, yearly). Alternatively, some programs may offer varying flat rates that are available to individuals depending on the specific type of service performed. Finally, some programs pay a percentage of an individual's outstanding loans, with a handful offering borrowers the greater of a certain percentage of a borrower's outstanding loans or a flat dollar amount or an amount equal to a percentage of their outstanding loans.  Many loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs contain provisions that may restrict or limit the availability of benefits in certain circumstances. In general, borrowers who have defaulted on their loans are ineligible for loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits. Certain programs contain restrictions that prohibit borrowers from also receiving benefits under certain other federal student loan forgiveness or loan repayment programs for the same qualifying service. In some programs, borrowers must be U.S. citizens or nationals to be eligible for benefits. In programs that provide loan repayment benefits concurrent with or prior to the completion of the qualifying service, borrowers may be financially penalized if they do not complete their term of service.  Many federal loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs prohibit individuals from benefitting from multiple programs for completion of the same service. For instance, the Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program will not make benefits available to individuals for the same service used to qualify for benefits under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, the Loan Forgiveness for Service in Areas of National Need program, or for AmeriCorps Education Awards. Alternatively, in some programs, individuals are ineligible for benefits if they are already receiving benefits under another program, but they may become eligible for program benefits once their obligation under the first program is completed. Some programs specifically require that participants be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. Many programs, on the other hand, do not expressly state such a requirement, but these programs may nonetheless only be available to these groups of individuals based on the type of loan eligible for forgiveness or repayment. For example, federal student loans made under the Higher Education Act (HEA), Title IV programs (e.g., FFEL program loans, Direct Loan program loans, and Perkins Loans) are only available to U.S. citizens, nationals, legal permanent residents, and other specified \"eligible noncitizens.\" Thus, the availability of programs that provide loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits only for these types of loans (e.g., the PSLF program, which is only available for Direct Loan program loans) is restricted based on a borrower's citizenship and immigration status at the time the loans were obtained.  Depending on the program, the availability of loan forgiveness and loan repayment benefits may be restricted for borrowers who have defaulted on their loans. In some programs, the availability of benefits for borrowers whose loans are in default status depends on certain characteristics of the defaulted loans. For instance, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers are generally ineligible for teacher loan forgiveness on defaulted loans, however, loan forgiveness may be granted to borrowers who have made satisfactory repayment arrangements for their loans. While in the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, borrowers of defaulted loans whose loans have not been accelerated may qualify for loan forgiveness on the same terms as borrowers who have not defaulted, and borrowers of defaulted loans whose loans have been accelerated may qualify for loan forgiveness based on service performed prior to, but not after, the date of acceleration.  Provisions that require recipients of loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits to pay back the amount of the benefits they received if they fail to complete their service obligations may be referred to as clawback provisions. Such provisions are common in federal loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs. Some clawback provisions only require participants to repay an amount equal to the unearned or disallowed portion of their benefits, while others may require participants to repay an amount equal to the benefit received, plus interest. Moreover, in some programs, clawback provisions may also require beneficiaries to pay punitive fees, in addition to amounts equal to the unearned portion of their benefits. Finally, many programs exempt borrowers from liability for unearned benefits if they become disabled, or upon death.  In general, student loan debt (and other types of debt) that is forgiven or repaid on a borrower's behalf is included as part of the individual's gross income for the purposes of federal income taxation under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). However, in certain instances, student loan forgiveness and loan repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income and, therefore, exempt from income tax liability. Some programs' authorizing statutes specifically state that loan forgiveness or loan repayment under those programs will be excluded from an individual's gross income for purposes of taxation. For instance, the HEA specifies that any part of a Federal Perkins Loan that is forgiven is excluded from gross income. For programs without authorizing statutes that specifically exclude loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits from gross income, benefits may still be excluded if certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f) are met. The loans that are repaid or forgiven must have been borrowed to assist an individual in attending a qualified educational institution and must contain terms providing that some or all of the loan balance will be cancelled for work for a specified amount of time in certain professions or occupations and for any broad class of employers. The loan must also have been made by specified types of lenders, including the federal and state governments. Additionally, IRC Section 108(f)(4) provides exclusions for the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program (NHSCLRP) and state programs eligible to receive funds under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). In general, if loan forgiveness or repayment benefits are not specifically excluded from income by statute or if the requirements of IRC Section 108(f)(4) are not met, individuals are responsible for paying any income tax liability associated with the loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits received. However, at least eight loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs provide supplemental funds to borrowers to offset any tax liability incurred as a result of the discharge of their loans. Many recipients of loan forgiveness and loan repayment benefits can avoid being subject to thousands of dollars in taxation if their benefits are excluded from gross income. At the same time, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that approximately $200 million of revenue was lost in FY2017 due to the exclusion from taxation of income attributable to the forgiveness and repayment of student loan debt. Researchers debate whether providing loan repayment or forgiveness benefits is an effective way to encourage borrowers to enter specific professional or occupational fields, serve in specific geographic areas, or enter into government service. In general, three main issues are explored when determining the effect of these programs: 1. Whether individuals would enter into and/or remain in these fields or positions without the prospect of loan forgiveness or loan repayment. 2. Whether student loan debt is the only or the most substantial impediment to entering into and/or remaining in these fields or positions. 3. Whether the prospect of debt relief through loan repayment or loan forgiveness programs encourages students to finance a larger portion of their postsecondary education expenses with student loans than they otherwise would have without such prospects. These issues largely focus on the individuals who receive loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits, but another aspect of effectiveness to consider is the cost of these programs to the federal government relative to the benefits received. The analysis below first discusses program effectiveness as it relates to individuals and is then followed by a discussion of the costs that the federal government incurs when operating loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs. In assessing the influence of a loan forgiveness or loan repayment program on an individual's employment choice, one issue to consider is whether, in the absence of such a program, the recipient would have engaged in the qualifying service. Information on the influence of such programs might be gleaned from an examination that compares the career paths of individuals who have access to loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits with the career paths of otherwise similarly situated individuals without such access. These types of evaluations generally have not been conducted for federal loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs. However, some data from one federal program may be instructive. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) examined the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and compared them with similar individuals who did not receive loan repayment under the IRP. The purposes of the IRP's loan repayment component is to encourage individuals to complete medical research at the NIH and to encourage qualified health professionals to continue careers in medical research in general (e.g., at a university). The NIH found that individuals receiving loan repayment benefits were more likely to continue conducting medical research at the NIH than those who did not. Likewise, individuals who received loan repayment benefits but then left the NIH were more likely to continue a career as a medical researcher than those who did not. This study suggests that the program may be meeting its stated goals. While the NIH study indicates that its loan repayment program may be meeting its stated goals, the loan repayment program is unlikely the sole reason for at least some of the individuals to remain in the NIH's targeted positions. Other research has found that some individuals would have entered certain fields or taken certain positions in the absence of loan repayments for a variety of other reasons. If this were true, then the program would not have been necessary and, therefore, might be considered ineffective. For example, a loan repayment program may be an effective incentive when jobs are plentiful for recent graduates who are weighing multiple employment opportunities but may be unnecessary when there are fewer employment opportunities. In relatively recent years, for instance, law school graduates have had fewer employment opportunities and may take a public interest or government job because of more limited private sector opportunities. Finally, individuals who accept loan repayment for a specific job might have taken the same job without loan repayment benefits. For example, one study found that healthcare providers who practice in rural areas would have done so without receiving a loan repayment award. Although in some cases loan forgiveness or loan repayment programs may appear to be unnecessary, in some instances there is evidence showing that participants would likely not have taken a particular position but for loan repayment. For example, the NIH examined its IRP loan repayment program and found that most loan repayment award recipients had competing job offers and stated that the potential for loan repayment was an attractive benefit that was unique to the NIH employment. This was particularly true for physicians who often had competing job offers at higher salaries. Physicians who received loan repayment benefits were also more likely to remain in research at the NIH, which demonstrates that loan repayment may be an important recruitment and retention tool. Other federal agencies have found that loan repayment programs are effective at recruiting and maintaining staff, but there are indications that some aspects of a program's design may undermine its effectiveness. For example, discretionary programs may have their funding reduced or cut altogether, thus making the availability of loan repayment benefits to individuals uncertain. The effectiveness of these programs as a recruitment incentive may be hard to determine because job applicants do not know whether they will receive a loan repayment award until after having accepted a job.  Additionally, loan repayment award amounts may not be a sufficient incentive for individuals to enter into and remain in certain professions. Some researchers have theorized that loan repayment programs may be more likely to be successful in meeting recruitment and retention needs if the financial benefits are sufficiently meaningful to offset a reasonable share of the costs associated with borrowing to pursue a postsecondary education.  Similarly, in some circumstances, while the dollar amount of loan repayment benefits may be perceived as sufficient, additional program design elements such as an individual's responsibility to pay federal income taxes associated with receiving a loan payment may make the benefit less attractive for an individual. Specifically, under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program (GESLRP), participants are responsible for the tax liability, which some agencies estimate can account for 39% of the loan repayment amount. Some agencies suggest that this makes the program less attractive to participants than it would be if benefits were excluded from taxation.  Another consideration is the short-term nature of many of these programs (e.g., providing loan repayment benefits in exchange for a two-year employment commitment), which may contribute to turnover, as individuals may decide to change jobs once they have realized the full benefit of a program. This could possibly lead to a less stable workforce for employers. For example, some researchers have found that individuals who have a service obligation have shorter tenures in a particular position than do individuals who do not have service obligations. A second issue regarding the assessment of loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs is whether individuals would otherwise enter a certain field or take a specific job but for their student loan debt. Loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs are predicated on the assumption that student loan debt is a large factor in making employment decisions. However, researchers have found that career choices are more complex; that debt, in some instances, may have little or no effect on career or job choices; and that a number of other deterrents may reduce student interest in a specific field or may make students less likely to seek employment in certain geographic areas. For example, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP) provides loan repayment benefits to physicians (among other health professionals) who enter primary care and practice in specific geographic areas. Although lower levels of compensation are one deterrent that keep physicians from entering primary care medicine, physicians might not enter these fields for other reasons as well. For instance, a physician may prefer to focus in a specialty or may not want to assume the increased administrative duties that primary care physicians incur. Moreover, others have found that debt levels may play a greater role in career decisions for certain racial and ethnic groups. Because it may be difficult or undesirable to target programs by racial and ethnic group, loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs may be available to individuals for whom debt is not a factor in career choice. A related critique of loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs is that despite these programs' providing a financial inducement for individuals to enter a specific field that is relatively lower paying (e.g., primary care medicine versus a specialty field), the amount received is generally far less than the overall lifetime earnings gap. One study estimated that over a lifetime, the average primary care physician earns $3.5 million less than a specialty physician. Given that borrowers are unlikely to have $3.5 million in student loan debt, loan repayments cannot fully make up for the lower lifetime earnings from entering primary care. Other research has found that high levels of debt do influence job choice. For example, in a literature review of the influence of law school debt on legal practice, the author found that high levels of law school debt often make it more likely for recent graduates to work at large law firms, where they are likely to earn more. Similarly, when examining the career trajectories of undergraduates, researchers have found that undergraduate students with higher debt levels are more likely to choose higher salary jobs and less likely to enter education-related fields, work for a government agency, or work at a nonprofit organization\u2014all job choices that traditionally are associated with a lower income than their private sector counterparts. Some studies, however, have found that law school debt levels may play a secondary role in an individual's determination of which occupations to enter after graduation, while demographic characteristics may be a more dominant factor in the decision-making process (similar to the finding noted above that there is racial and ethnic variation in the importance of debt on career trajectories). This may indicate that loan repayment programs have little or no effect on the career choice of law school graduates. A third issue regarding the effects of student loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs is whether the prospect of debt relief through loan repayment or loan forgiveness programs encourages students to finance a larger portion of their postsecondary education expenses with student loans than they otherwise would have without such prospects. This issue has been specifically raised with regard to those programs\u2014the various income-driven repayment (IDR) plans and PSLF\u2014that provide an open-ended amount of student loan debt relief after borrowers make student loan payments that are capped at a smaller portion of their discretionary income for a limited duration (e.g., 20 years).  Under the IDR plans, monthly payments are tied to income, not amount owed, and individuals may receive forgiveness of their entire outstanding balance of loan principal and interest after certain conditions are met. Monthly payments are limited to a portion (e.g., 10%, 15%) of discretionary income and maximum repayment periods are shorter than may otherwise be necessary to repay the entirety of the debt. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt in this way may \"render the size of the debt irrelevant\" to a borrower and may encourage student over-borrowing. In addition, some hypothesize that the lack of student incentive to limit borrowing also may make some students less sensitive to the price of education. Similar arguments have been made about the PSLF program, under which individuals may gain the largest amount of forgiveness benefit by repaying their loans under an IDR plan for 10 years while working in public service.  The granting of loan forgiveness and loan repayment benefits to borrowers results in costs to the federal government. The nature of the costs that are incurred by the government depends on the structure of the applicable program through which these benefits are made available. There are three categories of costs that typically may be associated with loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs: loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs.  Loan forgiveness programs typically make available benefits that are incorporated into the terms and conditions of loans that are made through the federal student loan programs, most of which are classified as federal credit programs for federal budgeting purposes. Federal credit consists of federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is a direct loan program, and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program is a guaranteed loan program. Loan subsidy costs for these programs are funded through mandatory indefinite appropriations. According to requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA), the budgetary costs of direct loans and loan guarantees are measured on the basis of their estimated long-term costs to the government on a net present value basis, and these costs are attributable to the fiscal year during which a direct loan obligation or guaranteed loan commitment is made (as opposed to the year during which the cash flows associated with these benefits occur). The federal budget reflects the unreimbursed costs of making or guaranteeing loans\u2014the subsidy cost of loans (discussed below) and administrative costs (which are expressed separately on a cash basis, and discussed in a following section). The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of the cash flows from the government (excluding administrative expenses), less the estimated present value of the cash flows to the government, resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee, and discounted to the time when the loan is disbursed. A positive loan subsidy cost means that there is a cost to the government of providing the loan subsidy to borrowers. A negative loan subsidy cost means that the government earns a positive return from the extension of credit to borrowers. With regard to loan forgiveness benefits that are incorporated into the terms and conditions of direct loan or guaranteed loan programs, the availability (and eventual granting) of these benefits alters the expected cash flows of the program and results in an increase in loan subsidy costs. For example, in the Direct Loan program, Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers is a benefit that is made available to qualified borrowers. When borrowers qualify for loan forgiveness under the program, a portion of each borrower's loan balance (e.g., $5,000, $17,500) is discharged by the government. As a consequence, these borrowers are relieved of responsibility for repaying some portion of their loans and the cash flows to the government associated with these loans are reduced. This results in an increase in loan subsidy costs for the program. While these loan forgiveness benefits may not be provided until many years after a loan is made, the estimated cost of providing these loan forgiveness benefits is accounted for in the loan subsidy costs for the fiscal year during which the loan was originally made. Other examples of this type of program include the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and loan forgiveness following completion of the maximum repayment period (e.g., 20 years, 25 years) in the income-based repayment (IBR) plan and the income-contingent repayment (ICR) plan. In loan repayment programs, the direct costs of borrower benefits are not incorporated into the subsidy rates of the federal credit programs through which the federal student loans were made, but rather are funded through the appropriation of funds for the fiscal year during which the loan repayment benefits are made available. (However, the early repayment of a loan may also have an effect on loan subsidy costs.) Funding may be provided through either discretionary or mandatory appropriations. For these types of programs, benefits are available to borrowers only in years for which appropriations have been made and only to the extent that the availability of funds allows. Thus, for these types of programs, sufficient funding might not be available to extend benefits to all borrowers who satisfy the eligibility criteria for loan repayment benefits. Examples of programs funded through discretionary appropriations include the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment (GESLR) program and the John R. Justice (JRJ) Loan Repayment for Prosecutors and Public Defenders Program. An example of a program funded through mandatory appropriations is the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program (NHSCLRP). The manner of providing funding for Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits is unique. The availability of Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits is specified in the terms and conditions of Perkins Loans and all borrowers who satisfy program eligibility criteria must be granted loan forgiveness by the institution that made the Perkins Loan. However, whereas most loan forgiveness program benefits are components of federal credit programs, the Perkins Loan program is not a federal credit program. Funding for reimbursement from the federal government to institutions for Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits is authorized to be made available through discretionary appropriations. While funding was last appropriated for Perkins Loan Cancellation reimbursements in FY2009, qualified borrowers have continued to have their loans canceled despite no funding being appropriated. Since the Perkins Loan program is a revolving loan fund program, institutions that have canceled Perkins Loans for eligible borrowers have absorbed the costs of loan cancellation without having these costs reimbursed by the federal government. ED currently maintains a record of reimbursement amounts institutions would be eligible to receive should funding be appropriated. Whereas most of the costs associated with loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs may be considered programmatic costs and are either incorporated into loan subsidy rates or are funded on a fiscal year basis through discretionary or mandatory appropriations for the applicable program, the costs of administering these programs are generally accounted for and funded separately. For loan forgiveness benefits that are offered through federal credit programs, in accordance with requirements of the FCRA, administrative costs are accounted for separately on a cash basis and are funded through annual appropriations. Loan repayment programs are administered by numerous agencies and there is variation across programs in how administrative costs are funded. For ED programs administered by Federal Student Aid, discretionary appropriations are provided for federal student aid administration.  Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government of loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs. For some programs\u2014particularly many loan forgiveness programs\u2014the only information available on program costs are estimates of the dollar amount or number of loans projected to be forgiven in future years, because borrowers have not yet become eligible to realize these benefits. For other programs\u2014primarily loan repayment programs\u2014information is often available on items such as the total amount of benefits provided or the number of borrowers who received benefits in a given fiscal year. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs in which benefits have not yet been realized are discussed below. For a limited set of programs in which benefits have been awarded to borrowers, and where relevant data are available, data on the amount of debt relief provided and the number of recipients is presented in Appendix A on a program-by-program basis.  For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, in a 2008 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to implement changes made by the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-84 ), ED estimated a cost to the government of $1.5 billion over the five-year period of FY2008-FY2012, with $1.2 billion of that amount being associated with loans made prior to FY2008. (For federal credit programs, costs are associated with the cohort year in which a loan is made, as opposed to the year in which benefits are realized.) ED did not provide estimates of the number of borrowers expected to receive loan forgiveness benefits.  For the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan, in the 2015 Final Regulation, ED estimated that for the cohorts of borrowers from 1994 to 2025, a total of approximately 6 million borrowers will be eligible for REPAYE, and of those, approximately 2 million borrowers would choose to enroll in the plan. It also estimated that the availability of the REPAYE plan would cost approximately $15.4 billion.  For the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) repayment plan, in a 2012 NPRM, ED estimated a cost to the government of $2.1 billion over the 10-year period of FY2012-FY2021. In arriving at this figure, ED estimated that approximately 1.67 million borrowers would elect to repay their loans according to the PAYE plan. Of these borrowers, ED estimated that approximately 400,000 would receive loan forgiveness through either public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment according to the PAYE plan. On a per-borrower basis, ED estimated that the average original loan balance of borrowers receiving loan forgiveness would be $39,500 and that, because many borrowers would pay only interest and no principal on their loans under the PAYE plan, these borrowers would have an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven. In the same 2012 NPRM, ED estimated that approximately 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts would elect to repay their loans according to the IBR plan for post-July 1, 2014 borrowers, but it did not provide estimations on how many individuals might realize forgiveness benefits under the plan. Finally, for the IBR plan for pre-July 1, 2014, borrowers, ED estimated in its 2008 NPRM that 126,000 borrowers from the FY2009 loan cohort would repay their loans according to IBR, and that 44,000 of such borrowers would have at least some portion of their student loan debt forgiven after 25 years. For the FY2012 cohort, ED estimated that 146,000 borrowers would repay according to the IBR plan, and that 52,000 of these borrowers would have some portion of their debt forgiven after 25 years. Given that many of these loan forgiveness benefits are relatively new, and that both loan forgiveness receipt and benefit amounts are contingent upon borrower repayment behavior and/or labor market experiences over a sustained period of time, it is likely difficult to precisely estimate loan forgiveness benefits in the aggregate. Congress may explore whether existing policy on the availability of federal student loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs is optimal or whether changes should be made. Several issues related to loan forgiveness and loan repayment policy might be examined. For instance, should multiple programs make available loan forgiveness or loan repayment benefits for borrowers who engage in similar types of activities? Does the structure of some loan forgiveness or loan repayment programs lead to a financial windfall for borrowers who engage in the same type of activity they otherwise would have even if debt relief were not available? Is sufficient information available to assess whether existing programs are effectively achieving their intended purposes?  Programs may be considered to overlap if multiple programs have the same or substantially similar goals and activities. There are two primary ways that student loan forgiveness and repayment programs can be considered overlapping. First, the same borrower could receive benefits from two different programs for the same service performed. Second, multiple programs may be available to the same group of individuals and may serve the same purpose, such that the federal government could be spending money on administrative costs for both programs when only one may be sufficient. Individuals potentially may be able to qualify for benefits under multiple programs. Although some programs (e.g., Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers) specifically state that recipients are not allowed to receive benefits under that and certain other programs for the same qualifying service, other programs do not contain such restrictions. Without such limitations, recipients may be able to receive benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed. For instance, an individual working in a federal agency may be eligible to receive up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits (and up to $60,000 in total) under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program (GESLRP), while concurrently qualifying for forgiveness of the remainder of their student loan debt after 10 years of service with a federal agency and 120 concurrent monthly loan payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF). If the individual applied the benefits received under the GESLRP towards the 120 monthly payments necessary to qualify for loan forgiveness under the PSLF, he or she potentially would be receiving benefits under two programs for the same federal government service. Another way in which programs can overlap is that multiple programs may be available to the same groups of individuals. Here, the federal government may be funding administrative costs for two separate programs that are serving the same purpose or same group of people. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP), for instance, provides repayment benefits to, among others, individuals who serve as nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) is available to individuals who serve as nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. Both programs are intended to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty, and both programs are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). However, under the NFLRP, the HRSA grants money to nursing schools that establish their own loan repayment programs and then choose which individuals may receive benefits. These programs may be creating an administrative burden on the HRSA if it is responsible for administering both the NELRP and also granting money to the NFLRP when both programs are available to the same group of individuals and are intended to serve the same purpose. Congress may consider combining, altering, or abolishing programs that either make available double benefits to individuals for the same service or that are available to the same group of individuals and intended to serve the same purpose. Many loan forgiveness and repayment programs are intended to encourage individuals to enter into specified jobs, careers, or public service that may otherwise be undesirable or hard-to-fill. While this may be an effective way of recruiting and retaining some individuals who might not have otherwise considered entering such fields, these programs could be providing windfalls for other individuals who would have entered the field regardless of benefit availability.  For instance, there are no limits on the amounts that may be forgiven under certain loan forgiveness plans (e.g., the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment). Notably, the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program operates in conjunction with the income-driven repayment plans. Some concerns have been raised that certain characteristics of these programs, combined with the large amounts that individuals may borrow\u2014particularly amounts borrowed under non-need-based PLUS Loans made to graduate and professional students\u2014may create situations in which individuals may borrow larger amounts than they otherwise would, knowing that the possibility exists for loan forgiveness. Congress may consider whether limits should be established on amounts that may be forgiven under certain loan forgiveness programs. Some research indicates that some individuals may take certain positions or enter into certain fields in the absence of loan forgiveness for a variety of other reasons. If the goal of loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs is to immediately place individuals in or attract highly skilled employees to specified occupations or service and they are already seeking employment within such fields, then the programs may be considered ineffective, as they may not have played a role in individual employment decisions. However, if the goal of these programs is to create pipelines for future careers or retain highly skilled employees, then the programs may be somewhat effective, as some reports indicate that loan repayment programs do play at least some role in an individual's choice in staying in a specific job or career. To tailor loan repayment programs to more specific needs, Congress may consider implementing more sensitive funding controls, such as more narrowly defining the circumstances in which individuals could become eligible for repayment benefits, rather than giving administering agencies broad discretion in implementation. Alternatively, since many programs are funded through discretionary appropriations, Congress could also direct the use of funds through language included in appropriations measures. In general, insufficient data are available on federal loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs to assess their effectiveness in achieving program objectives. For many programs, only a limited amount of programmatic data is available. For others, data will only become available once borrowers apply for and receive benefits. Since, for some programs, the period to qualify for benefits spans many years and no benefits have yet been awarded, limited or no programmatic data are available. For example, in the PSLF program, borrowers must remain employed in a public service job for 10 years while making 120 monthly payments on their loans. Borrowers first became eligible to apply for forgiveness benefits under this program on October 1, 2017; therefore, little is known about the forgiveness benefits received under the program based on the experience of actual cohorts of borrowers. In addition, projecting future participation is difficult because borrowers may, but are not required to, document their employment in public service jobs on PSLF Employment Certification Forms filed with the Department of Education (ED). Thus, information available for this program may provide a snapshot of interest in PSLF, but little more. Loan forgiveness is also available for borrowers who repay according to the income-driven repayment plans (e.g., income-based repayment (ICR) plan and income-based repayment (IBR) plan) for extended periods (e.g., 25 or 20 years). However, these programs also have not been in existence long enough for borrowers to qualify for forgiveness benefits. For many programs, longitudinal data are not collected on participants beyond what is necessary for program administration. Thus, while data may be available to verify that a borrower remained employed in a targeted position long enough to qualify for benefits, it may be difficult to determine whether a beneficiary remained in his or her position after the qualifying period of employment ended. Where data are collected and available, the data may provide information on program outcomes, but may be of limited use in assessing program effects. While improved data collection and reporting may be resource intensive, the improved availability of information may be necessary for determining program effects and whether program design changes could improve effectiveness.  There is variation from program to program in the types and amounts of student loan debt that may qualify for debt relief. For some programs, debt relief is limited to specific loan types (e.g., Perkins Loan cancellation), or to specific amounts (e.g., $5,000 or $17,500 for Stafford Teacher Loan Forgiveness). While for other programs, debt relief is available for multiple loan types (e.g., John R. Justice (JRJ) Loan Repayment), or with few limitations on maximum amounts (e.g., PSLF and loan forgiveness following IBR).  Consideration might be given to whether additional limitations should be imposed on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualifies under loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs. For instance, in recent years, amounts that students may borrow in non-need-based loan aid have increased substantially\u2014particularly due to PLUS Loans being made available to graduate and professional student borrowers. In addition, concerns have been raised that the availability of some student loan repayment or forgiveness programs may provide incentives to students to over-borrow more than they would have in the absence of such programs. Should individuals continue to be permitted to borrow non-need-based federal student loans to finance expenses that, according to federal need analysis rules, would otherwise be met by their expected family contribution (EFC), and then have a substantial portion of that amount discharged through federal student loan forgiveness or loan repayment programs? Should limits be established on the amount or type of student loan debt that may qualify for debt relief?  Selection criteria among agencies administering student loan repayment programs can vary greatly. For example, the GESLRP permits federal agencies to administer their own student loan repayment programs so long as they meet basic statutory requirements. Because of this, selection criteria may be unpredictable throughout the federal government, and in some cases, agencies may not administer a repayment program at all. In calendar year (CY) 2016, of the many federal agencies, 34 agencies provided employees with loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP. Under the GESLRP, all participants must sign a service agreement to serve in the paying agency for at least three years and they must reimburse a paying agency for any benefits received if they do not complete their service. Also, participants cannot be employees in the excepted service due to their position being confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating in nature. Beyond these limitations, however, agencies can otherwise determine to whom benefits are given. The Department of Defense, for example, uses its program extensively to recruit employees in nursing, engineering, and contracting positions. The U.S. Department of State, on the other hand, provides benefits only to individuals who have a loan balance of at least $5,000. Although individual agencies can tailor their specific loan repayment program to meet their unique needs, these variations throughout a single government-wide program can make eligibility requirements difficult for participants to discern. If the goal of the program is to attract qualified individuals to work in the federal government, the GESLRP may only attract individuals to work in a limited number of agencies that administer the program. Appendix A. Program-Specific Details The following appendix provides program-specific details about each program included in this report's analysis. Efforts were made to present the information in a relatively consistent manner; however, the programs are sufficiently different that information varies in scope and level of\u00a0detail. For each program, the following information, where available, is provided:  statutory and regulatory citations, the federal administering agency and (where appropriate) the specific office within that agency, the program's purpose, types of loans eligible for forgiveness or repayment, qualifying service required of program participants, maximum amount of benefits program participants can receive, restrictions on eligibility for program benefits, requirements for program participants after receipt of all or part of a program's benefits, federal income tax treatment of benefits, budgetary classification of the program's spending, annual amounts appropriated in FY2013-FY2017, annual amount of loans discharged or repaid in FY2013-FY2017, annual number of program beneficiaries in FY2013-FY2017, and citations to relevant CRS reports and additional resources.  Information was derived from statutes, regulations, agency websites, or other authoritative sources. Only selected information that is relevant to the overall analysis of this report is included in these program descriptions. Programs are described as they exist as of the date of this report. For complete information about a particular program of interest, readers are referred to the legal citations provided, the federal administering agency, or the identified CRS report. A notation of \"N/A\" indicates that criteria are not applicable to a specific program. Abbreviations used throughout this appendix include Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The various programs are presented in the same order as discussed earlier in this report. Loan forgiveness programs for public service are presented first. These are followed by programs that offer forgiveness following income-driven repayment. Next, loan repayment programs for public service addressing broad employment needs or shortages are presented. Loan repayment programs for public service employment in the federal government are presented last.

These benefits are considered entitlements and are written into the terms and conditions of widely available federal student loans. They are potentially available to an open-ended number of qualified borrowers and are presented first in this appendix, as they have a potentially large scope of availability to borrowers.

Purpose of program: To encourage citizens to participate in national service programs intended to meet unmet human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs. Eligible loan type: FFEL and Direct Loan Subsidized Loans Unsubsidized Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans; Perkins loans; loans made available under PHSA Title VII-A and Title VIII-E; and any other loan determined by an institution of higher education to be necessary to cover a student's educational expenses and made, insured, guaranteed by an eligible lender. Qualifying service or other activity: To qualify for award benefits, borrowers must successfully complete service in either the AmeriCorps State or National, the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), or Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) programs and be eligible to receive a national service educational award, summer of service educational award, or silver scholar educational award from the National Service Trust. Additionally, within the NCCC, participants may serve in FEMA Corps, which is a partnership between FEMA and the Corporation under which participants serve solely devoted to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.  Maximum benefit allowed: An amount equal to the maximum Pell Grant award in effect at the beginning of the fiscal year in which the Corporation approves an individual's service position (in either AmeriCorps, NCCC, VISTA, or FEMA Corps). For national service and silver scholar educational awards, borrowers cannot receive an amount greater than two full-time education awards. Prorated awards are also available based on term of service. For instance, in FY2017 the award amounts for term of service were the following: Full-time service (at least 1,700 hours of service): $5,592 Reduced full-time service (at least 1,200 hours of service): $4,144 One-year half time service (at least 900 hours of service): $2,960 Reduced half time (at least 675 hours of service): $2,255.24 Quarter time (at least 450 hours of service): $1,566.14 Minimum time (at least 300 hours of service): $1,252.91 Restrictions on eligibility: In general, award recipients must use awards within seven years of the date the term of service was completed. Summer of service participants must use awards within 10 years of the date the term was completed. Post-award conditions: N/A Federal tax treatment: The amount of education awards received is included in gross income. Budgetary classification and funding: Discretionary. Authorization of appropriations provided for FY2010 through FY2014. Previous amounts appropriated, FY2013: $200.7 million; FY2014: $207.4 million; FY2015: $209.6 million; FY2016: $220.0 million; FY2017: $206.8 million. In addition to the Corporation's annual appropriations, CNCS is authorized to transfer additional amounts from AmeriCorps State and National Grants programs funds to support the activities of national service participants, including educational awards. Also, as part of the FEMA Corps partnership, FEMA makes a contribution to the Trust towards participants' education awards (National Service Cost Share; NSCS). Annual amount discharged or repaid: Beneficiaries of the program can use their awards up to seven years after they are awarded, therefore, the dollar amount reported reflects the cumulative amount of money used by beneficiaries in a particular program year (PY). It is expected that amounts for each program year used will increase as more students use their award for tuition or loan repayment. A program year refers to service positions awarded to participants with a particular fiscal year's funds. Positions are often filled in time periods after the year in which they are awarded (e.g., money is granted to an AmeriCorps State program in FY2016, but not all positions available in the program are filled until FY2017).  Education awards can be used to pay current tuition expenses and to repay student loans, therefore, the numbers reported include money expended to both pay current tuition expenses and to repay student loans.  PY2013: $155.2 million; PY2014: $142.9 million; PY2015: $117.9 million; PY2016: $77.5 million; PY2017: $3.7 million. Annual number of beneficiaries: Because program beneficiaries have up to seven years to use an education award after it is made, the annual beneficiaries presented here reflect cumulative the number of AmeriCorps State and National, NCCC, VISTA, and FEMA Corps participants who earned education awards. The number of individuals who have earned awards is expected to increase for each program year as more individuals complete their service.
