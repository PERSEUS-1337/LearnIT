    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act \nof 1995''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) approximately \\1/2\\ of all individuals in the United \n        States who suffer from blood-clotting disorders, such as \n        hemophilia, were exposed, through the use of blood-clotting \n        agents, to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes the \n        fatal illness known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome \n        (AIDS);\n            (2) the Federal Government has a shared responsibility with \n        the blood-products industry for protecting the safety of the \n        blood supply of the Nation and for regulating the safety of \n        blood-clotting agents;\n            (3) blood and blood derivatives (including blood-clotting \n        agents) are subject to more stringent regulation by the Federal \n        Government than are most products regulated under the Federal \n        Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), because \n        blood and blood derivatives are subject to regulation under the \n        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) as well as \n        the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et \n        seq.);\n            (4) individuals with blood-clotting disorders, such as \n        hemophilia, were at an unusually high and largely preventable \n        risk of contracting HIV during the period beginning in 1980 \n        (when technology became available to pasteurize blood-clotting \n        agents) and ending in 1987 (when the last mass recall of \n        contaminated anti-hemophilic factor (AHF) occurred);\n            (5) during the period beginning in 1980 and ending in 1987, \n        despite growing concerns about blood-borne viruses such as \n        hepatitis and HIV, the Federal Government did not require the \n        blood-products industry to use available technology to ensure \n        the safety of blood products that were allowed on the market \n        for sale to individuals with blood-clotting disorders, such as \n        hemophilia;\n            (6) the Federal Government did not require that, to allow \n        for fully informed decisionmaking regarding treatment options, \n        the blood-products industry provide directly to individuals \n        with blood-clotting disorders, such as hemophilia, all \n        available information about the risks of contaminated blood \n        products;\n            (7) the Federal Government failed to fulfill its \n        responsibility to properly regulate the blood-products \n        industry, and thus exposed individuals with blood-clotting \n        disorders, such as hemophilia, and their families to potential \n        infection with a fatal disease;\n            (8) 17 other developed countries have established \n        government compensation programs to assist individuals with \n        blood-clotting disorders, such as hemophilia, who were infected \n        with HIV;\n            (9) individuals with blood-clotting disorders, such as \n        hemophilia, who have HIV infections incur annual medical costs \n        that often exceed $150,000, due to the expense of the necessary \n        medications and the complications caused by the combination of \n        the 2 illnesses;\n            (10) Ricky Ray was born with hemophilia and, like his 2 \n        younger brothers and thousands of others, became infected with \n        the deadly HIV through use of contaminated blood-clotting \n        products;\n            (11) Ricky Ray and his family have brought national \n        attention to the suffering of individuals with blood-clotting \n        disorders, such as hemophilia, and their families, who have \n        been devastated by HIV; and\n            (12) Ricky Ray died at the age of 15 on December 13, 1992, \n        of hemophilia-associated AIDS, and this Act should bear his \n        name.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \nprocedure to make partial restitution to individuals who were infected \nwith HIV after treatment, during the period beginning in 1980 and \nending in 1987, with contaminated blood products.\n\nSEC. 3. TRUST FUND.\n\n    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of the \nUnited States a trust fund to be known as the ``Ricky Ray Hemophilia \nRelief Fund'', which shall be administered by the Secretary of the \nTreasury.\n    (b) Investment of Amounts in Fund.--Amounts in the Fund shall be \ninvested in accordance with section 9702 of title 31, United States \nCode, and any interest on and proceeds from any such investment shall \nbe credited to and become part of the Fund.\n    (c) Availability of Fund.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available \nonly for disbursement by the Attorney General under section 5.\n    (d) Termination.--The Fund shall terminate upon the expiration of \nthe 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act. \nIf all of the amounts in the Fund have not been expended by the end of \nthe 5-year period, investments of amounts in the Fund shall be \nliquidated, the receipts of such liquidation shall be deposited in the \nFund, and all funds remaining in the Fund shall be deposited in the \nmiscellaneous receipts account in the Treasury of the United States.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated to the Fund to carry out this Act $1,000,000,000.\n\nSEC. 4.
