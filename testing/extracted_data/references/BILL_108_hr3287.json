FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n        (1) The Reverend Joseph Armstrong DeLaine, one of the true \n    heroes of the civil rights struggle, led a crusade to break down \n    barriers in education in South Carolina.\n        (2) The efforts of Reverend DeLaine led to the desegregation of \n    public schools in the United States, but forever scarred his own \n    life.\n        (3) In 1949, Joseph DeLaine, a minister and school principal, \n    organized African-American parents in Summerton, South Carolina, to \n    petition the school board for a bus for black students, who had to \n    walk up to 10 miles through corn and cotton fields to attend a \n    segregated school, while the white children in the school district \n    rode to and from school in nice clean buses.\n        (4) In 1950, these same parents, including Harry and Eliza \n    Briggs, sued to end public school segregation in Briggs et al. v. \n    Elliott et al., one of 5 cases that collectively led to the \n    landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision of Brown et al. v. Board of \n    Education of Topeka et al.\n        (5) Because of his participation in the desegregation movement, \n    Reverend DeLaine was subjected to repeated acts of domestic terror \n    in which--\n            (A) he, along with 2 sisters and a niece, lost their jobs;\n            (B) he fought off an angry mob;\n            (C) he received frequent death threats; and\n            (D) his church and his home were burned to the ground.\n        (6) In October 1955, after Reverend DeLaine relocated to \n    Florence County in South Carolina, shots were fired at the DeLaine \n    home, and because Reverend DeLaine fired back to mark the car, he \n    was charged with assault and battery with intent to kill.\n        (7) The shooting incident drove him from South Carolina to \n    Buffalo, New York, where he organized an African Methodist \n    Episcopal Church.\n        (8) Believing that he would not be treated fairly by the South \n    Carolina judicial system if he returned to South Carolina, Reverend \n    DeLaine told the Federal Bureau of Investigation, ``I am not \n    running from justice but injustice'', and it was not until 2000 (26 \n    years after his death and 45 years after the incident) that \n    Reverend DeLaine was cleared of all charges relating to the October \n    1955 incident.\n        (9) Reverend DeLaine was a humble and fearless man who showed \n    the Nation that all people, regardless of the color of their skin, \n    deserve a first-rate education, a lesson from which the Nation has \n    benefited immeasurably.\n        (10) Reverend DeLaine deserves rightful recognition for the \n    suffering that he and his family endured to teach the Nation one of \n    the great civil rights lessons of the last century.\n        (11) Like the Reverend DeLaine and Harry and Eliza Briggs, Levi \n    Pearson was an integral participant in the struggle to equalize the \n    educational experiences of white and black students in South \n    Carolina.\n        (12) Levi Pearson, with the assistance of Reverend Joseph \n    DeLaine, filed a lawsuit against the Clarendon County School \n    District to protest the inequitable treatment of black children.\n        (13) As a result of his lawsuit, Levi Pearson also suffered \n    from acts of domestic terror, such as the time gun shots were fired \n    into his home, as well as economic consequences: local banks \n    refused to provide him with credit to purchase farming materials \n    and area farmers refused to lend him equipment.\n        (14) Although his case was ultimately dismissed on a \n    technicality, Levi Pearson's courage to stand up for equalized \n    treatment and funding for black students served as the catalyst for \n    further attempts to desegregate South Carolina schools, as he \n    continued to fight against segregation practices and became \n    President of Clarendon County Chapter of the NAACP.\n        (15) When Levi Pearson's litigation efforts to obtain equalized \n    treatment and funding for black students were stymied, Harry and \n    Eliza Briggs, a service station attendant and a maid, continued to \n    fight for not only equalized treatment of all children but \n    desegregated schools as well.\n        (16) As with Reverend DeLaine and Levi Pearson, the family of \n    Harry and Eliza Briggs suffered consequences for their efforts: \n    Harry and Eliza both were fired from their jobs and forced to move \n    their family to Florida.\n        (17) Although they and their family suffered tremendously, \n    Harry and Eliza Briggs were also pioneers leading the effort to \n    desegregate America's public schools.\n\nSEC. 2.
