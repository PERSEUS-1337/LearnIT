PURPOSES.\n\n    It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) intensify research that may result in improved \n        understanding of or treatments for diseases and other adverse \n        health conditions;\n            (2) promote research and human clinical trials using stem \n        cells that are ethically obtained and show evidence of \n        providing clinical benefit for human patients; and\n            (3) promote the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines \n        without the creation of human embryos for research purposes and \n        without the destruction or discarding of, or risk of injury to, \n        a human embryo.\n\nSEC. 3. HUMAN STEM CELL RESEARCH AND THERAPY.\n\n    (a) Authorization.--Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service \nAct (42 U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 409I \nthe following:\n\n``SEC. 409J. HUMAN STEM CELL RESEARCH AND THERAPY.\n\n    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct and support basic \nand applied research to develop techniques for the isolation, \nderivation, production, testing, and human clinical use of stem cells \nthat may result in improved understanding of or treatments for diseases \nand other adverse health conditions, including pluripotent stem cells \nthat have the flexibility of embryonic stem cells (whether or not such \npluripotent stem cells have an embryonic source), prioritizing research \nwith the greatest potential for near-term clinical benefit in human \npatients, provided that such isolation, derivation, production, \ntesting, or use will not involve--\n            ``(1) the creation of a human embryo for research purposes;\n            ``(2) the destruction of or discarding of, or risk of \n        injury to, a living human embryo; or\n            ``(3) the use of any stem cell, the derivation or provision \n        of which would be inconsistent with the standards established \n        in paragraph (1) or (2).\n    ``(b) Guidelines.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Secretary, after consultation with the \nDirector of NIH, shall issue final guidelines implementing subsection \n(a) to ensure that any research (including any clinical trial) \nsupported under subsection (a)--\n            ``(1) is clearly consistent with the standards established \n        in subsection (a) if conducted using human cells, as \n        demonstrated by animal trials or other substantial evidence;\n            ``(2) is prioritized in terms of potential for near-term \n        clinical benefit in human patients, as indicated by substantial \n        evidence from basic research or by substantial clinical \n        evidence which may include but is not limited to--\n                    ``(A) evidence of improvement in one or more human \n                patients suffering from illness or injury, as \n                documented in reports by professional medical or \n                scientific associations or in peer-reviewed medical or \n                scientific literature; or\n                    ``(B) approval for use in human trials by the Food \n                and Drug Administration; and\n            ``(3) consistent with the standards established in \n        subsection (a), may take into account techniques outlined by \n        the President's Council on Bioethics and any other appropriate \n        techniques and research.\n    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued as altering the policy in effect on the date of the enactment \nof this section regarding the eligibility of stem cell lines for \nfunding by the National Institutes of Health.\n    ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:\n            ``(1) Human embryo.--The term `human embryo' includes any \n        organism, not protected as a human subject under part 46 of \n        title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, as of the date of the \n        enactment of this section, that is derived by fertilization, \n        parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from one or more \n        human gametes or human diploid cells.\n            ``(2) Risk of injury.--The term `risk of injury' means \n        subjecting a human embryo to risk of injury or death greater \n        than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero under \n        section 46.204(b) of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (or \n        any successor regulation), or section 498(b) of this Act.''.\n    (b) Priority Setting; Reports.--Section 492 of the Public Health \nService Act (42 U.S.C. 289a) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(d)(1) With respect to human stem cell research, the Secretary, \nacting through the Director of NIH, shall give priority to conducting \nor supporting research in accordance with section 409J.\n    ``(2) At the end of fiscal year 2008 and each subsequent fiscal \nyear, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report outlining the \nnumber of research proposals under section 409J that were peer \nreviewed, a summary and detailed list of all such research proposals \nthat were not funded, and an explanation of why the proposals did not \nmerit funding. The reports under this paragraph shall be in addition to \nthe reporting on stem cell research included in the biennial report \nrequired by section 403.''.\n    (c) Biennial Reports.--Section 403(a)(5) of the Public Health \nService Act (42 U.S.C. 283(a)(5)) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating subparagraph (L) as subparagraph (M); \n        and\n            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (K) the following:\n                    ``(L) Stem cells.''.\n\nSEC. 4. STUDY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THERAPEUTIC STEM CELL PRODUCTS.\n\n    Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this \nAct, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall study and submit \nrecommendations to the Congress on any structural changes to the C.W. \nBill Young Cell Transplantation Program established under 379 of the \nPublic Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 274k) that would help to expand \naccess to new and future stem cell therapeutic products, including stem \ncells derived from amniotic fluid as well as other sources such as \ndental pulp, nasal tissue, and fat that may benefit from inclusion in \nthe coordinated distribution of bone marrow and cord blood stem cells."
