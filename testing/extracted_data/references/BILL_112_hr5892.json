FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the hydropower industry currently employs approximately \n        300,000 workers across the United States;\n            (2) hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable \n        electricity in the United States;\n            (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, hydropower \n        resources, including pumped storage facilities, provide--\n                    (A) nearly 7 percent of the electricity generated \n                in the United States; and\n                    (B) approximately 100,000 megawatts of electric \n                capacity in the United States;\n            (4) only 3 percent of the 80,000 dams in the United States \n        generate electricity, so there is substantial potential for \n        adding hydropower generation to nonpowered dams; and\n            (5) according to one study, by utilizing currently untapped \n        resources, the United States could add approximately 60,000 \n        megawatts of new hydropower capacity by 2025, which could \n        create 700,000 new jobs over the next 13 years.\n\nSEC. 3. PROMOTING SMALL HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS.\n\n    Subsection (d) of section 405 of the Public Utility Regulatory \nPolicies Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2705) is amended by striking ``5,000'' \nand inserting ``10,000''.\n\nSEC. 4.
