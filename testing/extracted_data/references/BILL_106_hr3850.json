FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted to \n        foster the rapid deployment of advanced telecommunications and \n        information technologies and services to all Americans by \n        promoting competition and reducing regulation in \n        telecommunications markets nationwide.\n            (2) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 specifically \n        recognized the unique abilities and circumstances of local \n        exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's \n        subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide.\n            (3) Given the markets two percent carriers typically serve, \n        such carriers are uniquely positioned to accelerate the \n        deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives for \n        the benefit of consumers in less densely populated regions of \n        the Nation.\n            (4) Existing regulations are typically tailored to the \n        circumstances of larger carriers and therefore often impose \n        disproportionate burdens on two percent carriers, impeding such \n        carriers' deployment of advanced telecommunications services \n        and competitive initiatives to consumers in less densely \n        populated regions of the Nation.\n            (5) Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers \n        will enable such carriers to devote additional resources to the \n        deployment of advanced services and to competitive initiatives \n        to benefit consumers in less densely populated regions of the \n        Nation.\n            (6) Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers \n        will increase such carriers' ability to respond to marketplace \n        conditions, allowing them to accelerate deployment of advanced \n        services and competitive initiatives to benefit consumers in \n        less densely populated regions of the Nation.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and \n        the development of competition in the telecommunications \n        industry for the benefit of consumers in all regions of the \n        Nation, consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, by \n        reducing regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with \n        fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines \n        installed in the aggregate nationwide;\n            (2) to improve such carriers' flexibility to undertake such \n        initiatives; and\n            (3) to allow such carriers to redirect resources from \n        paying the costs of such regulatory burdens to increasing \n        investment in such initiatives.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n    Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153) is \namended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (51) and (52) as paragraphs \n        (52) and (53), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (50) the following:\n            ``(51) Two percent carrier.--The term `two percent carrier' \n        means an incumbent local exchange carrier within the meaning of \n        section 251(h) that has fewer than two percent of the Nation's \n        subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide.''.\n\nSEC. 4. REGULATORY RELIEF FOR TWO PERCENT CARRIERS.\n\n    Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by adding at \nthe end thereof a new part IV as follows:\n\n         ``PART IV--PROVISIONS CONCERNING TWO PERCENT CARRIERS\n\n``SEC. 281.
