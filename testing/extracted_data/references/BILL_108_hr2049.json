FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Perinatal transmission is the leading cause of \n        pediatric HIV infections, including AIDS cases.\n            (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        (``CDC'') estimates that nearly 7,000 HIV-infected women give \n        birth in the United States each year and as many as 400 babies \n        continue to be born with HIV infection each year.\n            (3) Medical advances have made it possible to nearly \n        eliminate perinatal HIV transmission.\n            (4) Research studies have demonstrated that the \n        administration of antiviral medication during pregnancy, during \n        labor, and immediately following birth can significantly reduce \n        the transmission of HIV from an infected mother to her baby. \n        Caesarean section further reduces the risk of transmission.\n            (5) Even if treatment begins shortly after birth, \n        antiretroviral therapy can substantially reduce the chance that \n        an HIV-exposed infant will become infected.\n            (6) Breastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers poses additional \n        significant risk of infection to babies.\n            (7) The Institute of Medicine (``IOM'') has recommended the \n        adoption of a national policy of universal HIV testing, with \n        patient notification, as a routine component of prenatal care. \n        However, 15 percent of HIV-infected pregnant women receive no \n        prenatal care according to the IOM.\n            (8) The CDC has recommended since 1995 that all pregnant \n        women be counseled and offered voluntary HIV testing. Yet \n        nearly half of pregnant women are still not tested according to \n        the CDC. The CDC has found that mandatory testing of newborns \n        and universal HIV testing of pregnant woman are the best \n        approaches for identifying, treating, and preventing HIV among \n        pregnant women and children.\n            (9) The American Medical Association recommends mandatory \n        HIV testing of all newborns with appropriate treatment for \n        affected mothers and children.\n            (10) Testing newborns whose mothers' status is unknown \n        ensures that every child at risk for HIV is identified.\n            (11) More than a third of the HIV infections that occur \n        annually among newborns in the United States could be prevented \n        with routine HIV testing of pregnant woman or newborns \n        according to a 2002 report by the Inspector General of the \n        Department of Health and Human Services. This represents over \n        100 babies born every year that are needlessly infected.\n            (12) The provision of testing of pregnant women and \n        newborns with appropriate counseling and treatment can \n        significantly reduce the number of pediatric HIV infections, \n        including AIDS cases, can improve access to and medical care \n        for the woman and children, and can provide opportunities to \n        further reduce transmission among adults.\n            (13) The provision of such testing, counseling, and \n        treatment can reduce the overall cost of pediatric HIV \n        infections, including AIDS cases.\n            (14) New York State has required mandatory HIV counseling \n        and voluntary testing for pregnant women and mandatory HIV \n        testing of all newborns since February 1997. As a result, the \n        perinatal HIV transmission rate in the State has dropped from \n        25 percent to an all time low of 3.5 percent and over 99 \npercent of HIV-infected women and their children have been linked to \ncare.\n    (15) For the foregoing reasons--\n                    (A) universal routine HIV testing of pregnant women \n                and newborns should be the standard of care; and\n                    (B) the relevant medical organizations, as well as \n                public health officials, should issue guidelines making \n                such testing, counseling, and treatment the standard of \n                care.\n\nSEC. 3. GRANTS REGARDING COUNSELING AND TESTING OF PREGNANT WOMEN AND \n              NEWBORN INFANTS.\n\n    Subpart II of part B of title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 300ff-33 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 2625 \nthe following section:\n\n``SEC. 2625A.
