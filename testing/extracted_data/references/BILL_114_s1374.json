PURPOSE.\n\n    To establish consistent eligibility requirements for graduate \nmedical schools operating outside of the United States and Canada in \norder to increase accountability and protect American students and \ntaxpayer dollars.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Three for-profit schools in the Caribbean receive more \n        than two-thirds of all Federal funding under title IV of the \n        Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) that goes \n        to students enrolled at foreign graduate medical schools, \n        despite those three schools being exempt from meeting the same \n        eligibility requirements as the majority of graduate medical \n        schools located outside of the United States and Canada.\n            (2) The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and \n        Accreditation and the Department of Education recommend that \n        all foreign graduate medical schools should be required to meet \n        the same eligibility requirements to participate in Federal \n        funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n        U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) and see no rationale for excluding certain \n        schools.\n            (3) The attrition rate at United States medical schools \n        averaged 3 percent for the class beginning in 2009 while rates \n        at for-profit Caribbean schools have reached 26 percent or \n        higher.\n            (4) In 2013, residency match rates for foreign trained \n        graduates averaged 53 percent compared to 94 percent for \n        graduates of medical schools in the United States.\n            (5) On average, students at for-profit medical schools \n        operating outside of the United States and Canada amass more \n        student debt than those at medical schools in the United \n        States.\n\nSEC. 4.
