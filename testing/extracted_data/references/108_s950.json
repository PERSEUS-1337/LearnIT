CRITICISM OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES IN CUBA.\n\n    (a) Findings.--\n            (1) The democracies of the Western Hemisphere have approved \n        an Inter-American Democratic Charter that sets a regional \n        standard regarding respect for human rights and fundamental \n        freedoms.\n            (2) The government of the Republic of Cuba approved and is \n        bound to respect the Charter of the Organization of American \n        States (OAS) and the American Declaration of the Rights and \n        Duties of Man.\n            (3) In 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and previous years, the \n        government of the Republic of Cuba declined to reply to the OAS \n        Inter-American Commission on Human Rights when it sought the \n        government's views on human rights violations in the Republic \n        of Cuba.\n            (4) All countries have an obligation to promote and protect \n        human rights and fundamental freedoms as stated in the Charter \n        of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human \n        Rights.\n            (5) The United Nations Commission on Human Rights \n        considered and passed a resolution in 2002 regarding the \n        situation of human rights in the Republic of Cuba and called \n        for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to \n        send a personal representative to the Republic of Cuba.\n            (6) The United States and other countries remain concerned \n        about violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in \n        the Republic of Cuba, including the freedoms of expression, \n        association, and assembly, and the rights associated with the \n        administration of justice.\n            (7) Amnesty International in its 2002 report noted an \n        increase in human rights violations in the Republic of Cuba, \n        including short-term arbitrary arrests, threats, summonses, \n        evictions, interrogations, losses of employment, restrictions \n        on travel, house arrests, and other forms of harassment \n        directed by the government against political dissidents, \n        independent journalists, and other activists in an effort to \n        limit their ability to exercise fundamental freedoms.\n            (8) Amnesty International also noted with concern the \n        beginning of a trend toward the increased use of violence by \n        Cuban authorities in order to repress dissent.\n            (9) Peaceful dissidents in the Republic of Cuba, such as \n        Oscar Elias Biscet, who upon finishing more than three years in \n        jail for ``instigation to commit a crime'' is again in police \n        custody and facing a possible year-long sentence, are subjected \n        to ongoing harassment and imprisonment.\n            (10) Many Cubans are routinely jailed under charges of \n        ``disrespect'' for making negative statements about the \n        government of the Republic of Cuba; of ``public disorder'' for \n        criticizing the Castro regime; of ``revealing state security \n        secrets'' and ``falsifying public documents'' for promoting \n        democratic practices and human rights; of ``disobedience'' for \n        peacefully protesting the Republic of Cuba's brutal treatment \n        of dissidents; of ``damages'' for denouncing violations of \n        human rights by the Cuban government and communicating the \n        brutality of the Cuban regime to Cuban citizens and the world; \n        and of ``enemy propaganda'' for criticizing communism.\n            (11) The European Parliament rightfully recognized Oswaldo \n        Paya for his work on the Varela Project with the 2002 Sakharov \n        Prize for his human rights work in the Republic of Cuba.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--\n            (1) It is the Sense of the Senate that the Government of \n        Cuba will never be welcomed into the community of democratic \n        nations unless that government--\n                    (A) undertakes significant political and economic \n                reforms called for by reporters of the Varela project \n                which seeks to establish political and economic freedom \n                for the Cuban people;\n                    (B) allows the International Committee of the Red \n                Cross unrestricted access to all Cuban prisons and \n                places of detention;\n                    (C) honors the request by the United Nations High \n                Commissioner for Human Rights to allow his special \n                representative to visit Cuba to make an assessment of \n                the human rights situation; and\n                    (D) frees all political prisoners.\n            (2) It is further the sense of the Senate that--\n                    (A) the Organization of American States Inter-\n                American Commission on Human Rights should continue its \n                reporting on the human rights situation in the Republic \n                of Cuba and to request a visit to the Republic of Cuba \n                for the purposes of reviewing and reporting to the \n                international community on the human rights situation \n                there;\n                    (B) the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \n                Rights and his personal representative should \n                vigorously pursue the implementation of the 2002 \n                Resolution regarding the situation of human rights in \n                the Republic of Cuba;\n                    (C) the European Union, to build upon the European \n                Parliament's recognition of Cuban dissidents and, \n                through the appropriate bodies and mechanisms, should \n                request to visit the Republic of Cuba for the purpose \n                of reviewing the human rights situation there and issue \n                a report to the international community on its \n                findings;\n                    (D) representatives from the International \n                Committee of the Red Cross should seek immediate access \n                to all prisons in Cuba and prepare a report on the \n                conditions of incarceration; and\n                    (E) human rights organizations throughout the world \n                should issue statements of solidarity with the Cuban \n                human rights activists, political dissidents, prisoners \n                of conscience, independent journalists, and other \n                Cubans demanding their release and seeking to secure \n                their internationally recognized human rights and \n                fundamental freedoms.\n            (3) It is further the Sense of the Senate that the \n        Department of State should monitor financial transactions to \n        and from Cuba to ensure that terrorist financing is not \n        occurring.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORT ON TERRORIST FINANCING.\n\n    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \nand every 180 days thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit a \nreport to Congress detailing any action taken by the Communist \ngovernment of Cuba to provide financial support for terrorism or to \nfacilitate the provision of such support.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       "
