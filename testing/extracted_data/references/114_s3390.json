FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global \n        economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as \n        part of a well-rounded education.\n            (2) Study abroad programs provide students with \n        unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched \n        opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique \n        environment for developing cultural understanding, all of which \n        are knowledge and skills needed in today's global economy.\n            (3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsecondary \n        students in the United States study abroad for credit in any \n        given year, and minority students, first generation college \n        students, and community college students are significantly \n        underrepresented in study abroad participation.\n            (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission \n        on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program pursuant \n        to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets \n        Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199). Pursuant to its \n        mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to Congress and the \n        President a report of its recommendations for greatly expanding \n        the opportunity for students at institutions of higher \n        education in the United States to study abroad, with special \n        emphasis on studying in developing nations.\n            (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience \n        shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will \n        drive the number of study abroad participants higher and \n        improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only \n        way that study abroad will become an integral part of the \n        undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is \n        necessary to encourage and support such leadership.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access \n        to quality study abroad opportunities;\n            (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying \n        abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of \n        higher education in the United States;\n            (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad \n        destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that \n        takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations, \n        especially in developing countries; and\n            (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of \n        higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.\n\nSEC. 4.
