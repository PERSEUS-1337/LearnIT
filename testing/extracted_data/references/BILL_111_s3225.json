FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The importance of travel and tourism cannot be \n        overstated: travel and tourism employs America.\n            (2) Approximately 8,300,000 domestic jobs depend on the \n        travel and tourism industry.\n            (3) The United States travel and tourism industry--\n                    (A) generates more than $691,000,000,000 annually \n                in direct spending, of which more than 85 percent is \n                the result of domestic travel; and\n                    (B) generates more than $1,200,000,000,000 in total \n                spending, if indirect spending is included.\n            (4) The travel and tourism industry accounts for 2.6 \n        percent of the Nation's gross domestic product, nearly 4 times \n        that of the automotive industry.\n            (5) Domestic employment related to the travel and tourism \n        industry cannot be outsourced to other countries.\n            (6) The current economic downturn has created the most \n        difficult economic environment for the domestic travel and \n        tourism industry since the period following the terrorist \n        attacks of September 11, 2001.\n            (7) Travel and tourism revenues dropped by nearly \n        $130,000,000,000 during 2009.
