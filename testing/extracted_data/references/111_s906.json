    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Investment Protection Act of \n2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) many seniors are targeted by salespersons and advisers \n        using misleading certifications and professional designations;\n            (2) many certifications and professional designations used \n        by salespersons and advisers represent limited training or \n        expertise, and may in fact be of no value with respect to \n        advising seniors on financial and estate planning matters, and \n        far too often, such designations are obtained simply by \n        attending a weekend seminar and passing an open book, multiple \n        choice test;\n            (3) many seniors have lost their life savings because \n        salespersons and advisers holding a misleading designation have \n        steered them toward products that were unsuitable for them, \n        given their retirement needs and life expectancies;\n            (4) seniors have a right to clearly know whether they are \n        working with a qualified adviser who understands the products \n        and is working in their best interest or a self-interested \n        salesperson or adviser advocating particular products; and\n            (5) many existing State laws and enforcement measures \n        addressing the use of certifications, professional \n        designations, and suitability standards in selling financial \n        products to seniors are inadequate to protect senior investors \n        from salespersons and advisers using such designations.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act--\n            (1) the term ``misleading designation''--\n                    (A) means the use of a purported certification, \n                professional designation, or other credential, that \n                indicates or implies that a salesperson or adviser has \n                special certification or training in advising or \n                servicing seniors; and\n                    (B) does not include any legitimate certification, \n                professional designation, license, or other credential, \n                if--\n                            (i) it has been offered by an academic \n                        institution having regional accreditation; or\n                            (ii) it meets the standards for \n                        certifications, licenses, and professional \n                        designations outlined by the North American \n                        Securities Administrators Association (in this \n                        Act referred to as the ``NASAA'') Model Rule on \n                        the Use of Senior-Specific Certifications and \n                        Professional Designations, or it was issued by \n                        or obtained from any State;\n            (2) the term ``financial product'' means securities, \n        insurance products (including insurance products which pay a \n        return, whether fixed or variable), and bank and loan products;\n            (3) the term ``misleading or fraudulent marketing'' means \n        the use of a misleading designation in selling or advising a \n        senior in the sale of a financial product;\n            (4) the term ``senior'' means any individual who has \n        attained the age of 62 or older; and\n            (5) the term ``State'' means each of the 50 States, the \n        District of Columbia, and the unincorporated territories of \n        Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nSEC. 4.
