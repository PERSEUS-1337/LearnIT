    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preservation of Localism, Program \nDiversity, and Competition in Television Broadcast Service Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The principle of localism is embedded in the \n        Communications Act in section 307(b) of the Communications Act \n        of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 307(b)). It has been the pole star for \n        regulation of the broadcast industry by the Federal \n        Communications Commission for nearly 70 years.\n            (2) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \n        directed the Federal Communications Commission to increase the \n        limitations on national multiple television ownership so that \n        one party could not own or control television stations whose \n        aggregate national audience reach exceeded 35 percent. Congress \n        did so because it recognized that--\n                    (A) further national concentration could not be \n                undone;\n                    (B) other regulatory changes, such as the repeal by \n                the Commission of its financial and syndication \n                regulations, would heighten the power of the national \n                television networks; and\n                    (C) the independence of non-network-owned stations \n                would be threatened if network ownership exceeded 35 \n                percent.\n            (3) If a limit to the national audience reach of television \n        stations that one party may own or control is not codified at \n        this time--\n                    (A) further national concentration may occur whose \n                pernicious effects may be difficult to eradicate; and\n                    (B) the independence of non-network-owned stations \n                will be threatened, placing local stations in danger of \n                becoming mere passive conduits for network \n                transmissions.\n            (4) A cap on national multiple television ownership will \n        help preserve localism by limiting the networks ability to \n        dictate programming aired on local stations.\n            (5) The landscape of national ownership has changed \n        dramatically over the past two decades since the time when the \n        networks were limited to owning just seven television stations \n        nationwide:\n                    (A) the Commission's financial and syndication \n                regulations have been repealed;\n                    (B) the networks can own more than one television \n                station in many local markets;\n                    (C) the networks have embraced programming ventures \n                from studios to syndication to foreign sales; and\n                    (D) the networks own the most popular cable and \n                Internet content businesses.\n        Together these changes have strengthened the networks hands and \n        given them strong incentives to override local interests.\n            (6) Unlike non-network-owned stations which are only \n        concerned with local viewers, network-owned stations have \n        multiple interests they must consider: national advertising \n        interests, syndicated programming interests, foreign sales \n        interests, cable programming interests, and, lastly, local \n        station interests.\n            (7) The possibility of further nationalization threatens \n        the current give-and-take between non-network-owned affiliates \n        and networks which can result in programming being edited, \n        scheduled, or promoted in ways that are more appropriate for \n        local audiences.\n            (8) As network power has grown in recent years, the \n        networks have forced affiliation agreements to tilt the balance \n        of power even more in their favor. Contract provisions encroach \n        on the ability of non-network-owned affiliates to reject \nprogramming that local stations determine not to be in the best \ninterests of their local communities, and local stations are penalized \nfor unauthorized preemptions (as determined by the network) and for \nexceeding preemption baskets.\n            (9) This Act will help to preserve localism in and to \n        prevent the further nationalization of the television broadcast \n        service.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to promote the values of localism in the television \n        broadcast service;\n            (2) to promote diversity of television programming and \n        viewpoints;\n            (3) to promote competition; and\n            (4) to prevent excessive concentration of ownership by \n        establishing a limit to the national audience reach of the \n        television stations that any one party may own or control.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL TELEVISION MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS.\n\n    (a) Establishment of National Television Multiple Ownership \nLimitations.--Part I of Title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is \namended by inserting after section 339 (47 U.S.C. 339) the following \nnew section:\n\n``SEC. 340. NATIONAL TELEVISION MULTIPLE OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS.\n\n    ``(a) National Audience Reach Limitation.--The Commission shall not \npermit any license for a commercial television broadcast station to be \ngranted, transferred, or assigned to any party (including all parties \nunder common control) if the grant, transfer, or assignment of such \nlicense would result in such party or any of its stockholders, \npartners, or members, officers, or directors, directly or indirectly, \nowning, operating or controlling, or having a cognizable interest in \ntelevision stations which have an aggregate national audience reach \nexceeding 35 percent.\n    ``(b) No Grandfathering.--The Commission shall require any party \n(including all parties under common control) that holds licenses for \ncommercial television broadcast stations in excess of the limitation \ncontained in subsection (a) to divest itself of such licenses as may be \nnecessary to come into compliance with such limitation within one year \nafter the date of enactment of this section.\n    ``(c) Section Not Subject to Forbearance.--Section 10 of this Act \nshall not apply to the requirements of this section.\n    ``(d) Definitions.--\n            ``(1) National audience reach.--The term `national audience \n        reach' means--\n                    ``(A) the total number of television households in \n                the Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA) markets in \n                which the relevant stations are located, or as \n                determined under a successor measure adopted by the \n                Commission to delineate television markets for purposes \n                of this section; divided by\n                    ``(B) the total national television households as \n                measured by such DMA data (or such successor measure) \n                at the time of a grant, transfer, or assignment of a \n                license.\n        No market shall be counted more than once in making this \n        calculation.\n            ``(2) Cognizable interest.--Except as may otherwise be \n        provided by regulation by the Commission, the term `cognizable \n        interest' means any partnership or direct ownership interest \n        and any voting stock interest amounting to 5 percent or more of \n        the outstanding voting stock of a licensee.''.\n    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 202(c)(1) of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1934 (Public Law 104-104; 110 Stat. 111) is \namended--\n            (1) by striking ``its regulations'' and all that follows \n        through ``by eliminating'' and inserting ``its regulations (47 \n        CFR 73.3555) by eliminating'';\n            (2) by striking ``; and'' at the end of subparagraph (A) \n        and inserting a period; and\n            (3) by striking subparagraph (B)."
