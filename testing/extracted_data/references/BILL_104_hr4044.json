FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) certain handguns that are widely marketed across State \n        lines are traced disproportionately to violent crimes, and in \n        particular to crimes in States other than those in which they \n        were manufactured or purchased;\n            (2) many of these handguns are of dangerously poor quality \n        and threaten the safety even of legitimate users for sport or \n        self-defense;\n            (3) States should be encouraged to restrict the sale of \n        handguns that are unsafe, particularly suited for crime, and \n        not useful for sporting, hunting, law enforcement, or self-\n        defense purposes; and\n            (4) accurate and uniform data on the use of guns is \n        essential to formulating effective policy to reduce violent \n        crime involving guns and deaths and injuries from such crimes.\n\nSEC. 3.
