FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The quality of education in science, mathematics, and \n        engineering is the foundation of the Nation's future security \n        and prosperity.\n            (2) In international tests, American secondary school \n        students score lower in science and mathematics than their \n        peers in other developed countries.\n            (3) The number of undergraduate degrees awarded to American \n        students in the physical sciences, mathematics and computer \n        science, and engineering has been static or has declined over \n        the past decade, while projected demand for scientists and \n        engineers is predicted to increase four times faster than \n        overall job growth over the next ten years.\n            (4) New initiatives are required to stimulate the interest \n        of students in science, mathematics, and technology and to help \n        prepare them to succeed in the college courses required for \n        careers in these fields.\n            (5) Hands-on research experiences have been proven to be \n        effective in stimulating student interest in science, \n        mathematics, and technology, in building confidence in the \n        scientific method and problem solving, and in strengthening \n        understanding of scientific concepts.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``Director'' means the Director of the \n        National Science Foundation;\n            (2) the term ``institution of higher education'' has the \n        meaning given that term in section 101 of the Higher Education \n        Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001); and\n            (3) the term ``science teacher'' means a science, \n        mathematics, or technology teacher at the secondary school \n        level.\n\nSEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director is authorized to establish a program \nto improve science, mathematics, and technology education in secondary \nschools through awards to institutions of higher education for the \nsupport of research projects in science and technology at secondary \nschools. Awards shall be made to institutions of higher education \nthrough a competitive process on the basis of merit in accordance with \nthe guidelines, procedures, and criteria established under subsection \n(c).\n    (b) Research Projects.--Awards provided under this section shall be \nused by the recipient institutions to--\n            (1) provide training for science teachers in the design of \n        research investigations and in the preparation of research \n        project proposals;\n            (2) establish requirements for the contents and procedures \n        for the submission to the institution of higher education of \n        proposals for research projects;\n            (3) establish guidelines, standards, and procedures for the \n        selection of proposals for funding on the basis of merit and \n        following a competitive review process;\n            (4) provide grants to secondary schools for implementing \n        research projects;\n            (5) develop general guidelines for use by science teachers \n        in implementing research projects, including requirements for \n        the reporting of research results;\n            (6) provide stipends for graduate students to serve as \n        advisors and consultants for research projects that include \n        such a role for such graduate students; and\n            (7) assess the educational value of the research projects, \n        including by means of tracking--\n                    (A) the academic performance in science, \n                mathematics, and technology of the participating \n                students; and\n                    (B) the undergraduate majors later selected by \n                students who have participated in a research project \n                supported under this Act.\n    (c) Guidelines, Procedures, and Criteria.--The Director shall \nestablish and publish application and selection guidelines, procedures, \nand criteria for awards under the program established under subsection \n(a).\n    (d) Proposal Requirements.--Each application for an award under the \nprogram established under subsection (a) shall--\n            (1) provide for collaboration between education faculty and \n        mathematics, engineering, or science faculty at the institution \n        of higher education;\n            (2) include a plan for satisfying the requirements of \n        subsection (b), including a description of the process to be \n        used for soliciting proposals for research projects and an \n        estimate of the number of research projects to be supported;\n            (3) specify the number of graduate students expected to \n        receive support in accordance with subsection (b)(6); and\n            (4) identify sources of non-Federal funding for the \n        proposed program in amounts at least equal to the amount of the \n        award sought under this section.\n\nSEC. 5.
