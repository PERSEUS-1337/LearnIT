FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Section 1 of Article III of the Constitution of the \n        United States of America vests ``judicial Power'' exclusively \n        in the courts. Section 2 of Article III states that this \n        ``judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, \n        arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, \n        and Treaties...'' In interpreting Article III of the \n        Constitution, the Supreme Court in Muskrat v. United States \n        defined the term ``judicial power'' to mean ``the right to \n        determine actual controversies arising between adverse \n        litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper jurisdiction''.\n            (2) In 1996, a holder of a trademark registration issued by \n        the Patent and Trademark Office asserted trademark infringement \n        and other claims in a United States district court against an \n        alleged infringer. The plaintiff's claims for relief were based \n        upon laws and treaties of the United States, including the \n        Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) and the Inter-\n        American Convention for Trademark and Commercial Protection.\n            (3) In October 1998, just prior to commencement of the \n        trial, the alleged infringer procured an amendment to the \n        Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n        1999 (as contained in section 101(b) of division A of Public \n        Law 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-88). That amendment is commonly \n        referred to as ``section 211'' and has been of singular benefit \n        to that defendant in the courts.\n            (4) Section 211(a)(2) and (b) provides that ``No United \n        States court shall recognize, enforce, or otherwise validate \n        any assertion of rights'' of certain trademarks or commercial \n        names of the type at issue in the litigation referred to in \n        paragraph (2). Section 211(a)(1) also rescinds the general \n        authority permitting payment of the fees necessary for \n        registration and renewal of such trademarks with the United \n        States Patent and Trademark Office.\n            (5) The intended and actual effect of section 211 is to \n        strip United States courts of the authority to decide the \n        ownership and enforceability of such trademarks and trade \n        names, including those at issue in the litigation described in \n        paragraph (2). As a result of section 211, the plaintiff in the \n        litigation was prevented from asserting the plaintiff's \n        infringement claim. By preventing the payment of fees for \n        trademark registration and renewal in the Patent and Trademark \n        Office, section 211 also denies parties the ability to preserve \n        claims of ownership in such trademarks pending judicial \n        determination of enforcement rights.\n            (6) Section 211 is not needed for the courts to reach \n        equitable results with respect to the United States trademark \n        and trade name rights of foreign nationals who have suffered \n        from confiscation of their businesses at home. It has been the \n        longstanding practice of the Federal courts to do equity in \n        adjudicating disputes involving such rights.\n            (7) Repeal of section 211 is necessary and desirable to \n        restore to the courts the power to determine the ownership and \n        enforceability of all trademarks and trade names and to \n        preserve trademark registrations pending such determinations.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to restore to the \njudiciary the power to decide all trademark and trade name cases \narising under the laws and treaties of the United States, and for other \npurposes.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTORATION OF JUDICIAL POWERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 211 of the Department of Commerce and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (as contained in section \n101(b) of division A of Public Law 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-88) is \nrepealed.\n    (b) Regulations.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue such \nregulations as are necessary to carry out the repeal made by subsection \n(a), including removing any prohibition on transactions or payments to \nwhich subsection (a)(1) of section 211 of the Department of Commerce \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 applied.\n    (c) Authority of Courts.--United States courts shall have the \nauthority to recognize, enforce, or otherwise validate any assertion of \nrights in any mark or trade name based on common law rights or \nregistration or under subsection (b) or (e) of section 44 of the \nTrademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S. C. 1126 (b) or (e)) or based on any \ntreaty to which the United States is a party."
