FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) affordable public transportation is essential to the \n        economic vitality of the national capital area and is an \n        essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality \n        to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of \n        both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as \n        well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's \n        capital;\n            (2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors \n        to the national capital area is substantially affected by the \n        prices charged for such mass transit services, prices that are \n        substantially affected by labor costs, since more than \\2/3\\ of \n        operating costs are attributable to labor costs;\n            (3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the \n        national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and \n        wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are \n        among the highest in the Nation;\n            (4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in \n        the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs \n        to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus \n        undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public \n        transit;\n            (5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the \n        governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments \n        for public transit services since local governments generally, \n        and the District of Columbia government in particular, are \n        operating under severe fiscal constraints;\n            (6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to \n        arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate \n        compact agencies operating in the national capital area will \n        ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the \n        ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; \n        and\n            (7) Federal legislation is necessary under Article I of \n        section 8 of the United States Constitution to balance the need \n        to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial \n        peace.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is therefore the purpose of this Act to adopt \nstandards governing arbitration which must be applied by arbitrators \nresolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in \nthe national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public \ntransportation in the Washington metropolitan area.\n\nSEC. 3.

STANDARDS FOR ARBITRATORS.\n\n    (a) Factors in Making Arbitrary Award.--An arbitrator rendering an \narbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact \nagency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or \na decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing \nconditions of employment without considering the following factors:\n            (1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the \n        employees in the bargaining unit.\n            (2) All available financial resources of the interstate \n        compact agency.\n            (3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for \n        goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer \n        price index for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, \n        published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United \n        States Department of Labor.\n            (4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the \n        employment of other employees who perform, in other \n        jurisdictions in the Washington, D.C. standard metropolitan \n        statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining \n        unit.\n            (5) The special nature of the work performed by the \n        employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the \n        relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational \n        qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and \n        the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other \n        employees of the interstate compact agency.\n            (6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the \n        bargaining unit, including--\n                    (A) the overall compensation presently received by \n                the employees, having regard not only for wage rates \n                but also for wages for time not worked, including \n                vacations, holidays, and other excused absences;\n                    (B) all benefits received by the employees, \n                including previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; \n                and\n                    (C) the continuity and stability of employment.\n            (7) The public welfare.\n    (b) Compact Agency's Funding Ability.--An arbitrator rendering an \narbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact \nagency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to \na collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, \nprovide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the interstate \ncompact agency's funding ability.\n    (c) Requirements for Final Award.--In resolving a dispute submitted \nto arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency \noperating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a \nwritten award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in \nsubsections (a) and (b) have been considered and applied.
