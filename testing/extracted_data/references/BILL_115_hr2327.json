FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the analysis of veteran suicide published \n        by the Department of Veterans Affairs in August 2016 and titled \n        ``Suicide Among Veterans and Other Americans''--\n                    (A) an average of 20 veterans died by suicide each \n                day in 2014;\n                    (B) mental health disorders, including major \n                depression and other mood disorders, have been \n                associated with increased risk for suicide;\n                    (C) since 2001, the proportion of users of the \n                Veterans Health Administration with mental health \n                conditions or substance use disorders has increased \n                from approximately 27 percent in 2001 to more than 40 \n                percent in 2014; and\n                    (D) overall, suicide rates are highest among \n                patients with mental health and substance use disorder \n                diagnoses who are in treatment and lower among those \n                who received a mental health diagnoses but were not at \n                risk enough to require enhanced care from a mental \n                health provider.\n            (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs must be more \n        effective in its approach to reducing the burden of veteran \n        suicide connected to mental health disorders, including post-\n        traumatic stress disorder, and a pilot program and study to \n        assess the benefits of pairing service dogs with veterans \n        suffering from mental health disorders would allow the \n        Department to better determine the efficacy of using service \n        dogs as a nontraditional therapy to ensure the well-being of \n        veterans.\n            (3) Pairing a service dog with a veteran costs \n        approximately $25,000, including with respect to training of \n        the service dog as well as training of the veteran with the \n        service dog.\n\nSEC. 3.
