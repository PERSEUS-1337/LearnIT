The \n        United States parent company of the United States economic \n        cooperation project should not discriminate in terms or \n        conditions of employment in the project against persons with \n        past records of arrests or internal exile for nonviolent \n        protest or membership in unofficial organizations committed to \n        nonviolence.\n            (3) Ensure that methods of production used in the project \n        do not pose an unnecessary physical danger to workers and \n        neighboring populations and property and that the project does \n        not unnecessarily risk harm to the surrounding environment, and \n        consult with community leaders regarding environmental \n        protection with respect to the project.\n            (4) Strive to use business enterprises that are not \n        controlled by the Government of the People's Republic of China \n        or its authorized agents and departments as potential partners \n        in the project.\n            (5) Prohibit any military presence on the premises of the \n        operations of the project.\n            (6) Undertake to promote freedom of association and \n        assembly among the employees of the project. The United States \n        economic cooperation project should protest any infringement by \n        the Government of the People's Republic of China of these \n        freedoms to the appropriate authorities of that Government and \n        to the International Labor Organization, which has an office in \n        Beijing.\n            (7) Use every possible channel of communication with the \n        Government of the People's Republic of China to urge that \n        government to disclose publicly a complete list of all those \n        individuals arrested since March 1989, to end incommunicado \n        detention and torture, and to provide international observers \n        access to all places of detention in the People's Republic of \n        China and Tibet and to trials of prisoners arrested in \n        connection with the pro-democracy events of April through June \n        of 1989 and the pro-democracy demonstrations which have taken \n        place in Tibet since 1987.\n            (8) Discourage or undertake to prevent compulsory political \n        indoctrination programs from taking place on the premises of \n        the operations of the project.\n            (9) Promote freedom of expression, including the freedom to \n        seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, \n        regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, \n        in the form of art, or through any media. To this end, the \n        United States economic cooperation project should raise with \n        appropriate authorities of the Government of the People's \n        Republic of China concerns about restrictions on the \n        importation of foreign publications.\n            (10)(A) Undertake to prevent harassment of workers who, \n        consistent with the United Nations World Population Plan of \n        Action, decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of \n        their children.\n            (B) Prohibit compulsory population control activities on \n        the premises of the operations of the project.\n    (c) Promotion of Principles by Other Nations.--The Secretary shall \nforward a copy of the principles set forth in subsection (b) to the \nmember nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment and encourage them to promote principles similar to these \nprinciples.\n\nSEC. 2.
