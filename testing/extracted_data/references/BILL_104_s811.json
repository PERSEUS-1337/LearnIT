DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n        (1) Desalination or desalting.--The terms ``desalination'' or \n    ``desalting'' mean the use of any process or technique for the \n    removal and, when feasible, adaptation to beneficial use, of \n    organic and inorganic elements and compounds from saline or \n    biologically impaired waters, by itself or in conjunction with \n    other processes.\n        (2) Saline water.--The term ``saline water'' means sea water, \n    brackish water, and other mineralized or chemically impaired water.\n        (3) United states.--The term ``United States'' means the States \n    of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of \n    Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the United \n    States.\n        (4) Usable water.--The term ``usable water'' means water of a \n    high quality suitable for environmental enhancement, agricultural, \n    industrial, municipal, and other beneficial consumptive or \n    nonconsumptive uses.\n        (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n    the Interior.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF RESEARCH AND STUDIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--In order to determine the most cost-effective and \ntechnologically efficient means by which usable water can be produced \nfrom saline water or water otherwise impaired or contaminated, the \nSecretary is authorized to award grants and to enter into contracts, to \nthe extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts, to conduct, \nencourage, and assist in the financing of research to develop processes \nfor converting saline water into water suitable for beneficial uses. \nAwards of research grants and contracts under this section shall be \nmade on the basis of a competitive, merit-reviewed process. Research \nand study topics authorized by this section include--\n        (1) investigating desalination processes;\n        (2) ascertaining the optimum mix of investment and operating \n    costs;\n        (3) determining the best designs for different conditions of \n    operation;\n        (4) investigating methods of increasing the economic efficiency \n    of desalination processes through dual-purpose co-facilities with \n    other processes involving the use of water;\n        (5) conducting or contracting for technical work, including the \n    design, construction, and testing of pilot systems and test beds, \n    to develop desalting processes and concepts;\n        (6) studying methods for the recovery of byproducts resulting \n    from desalination to offset the costs of treatment and to reduce \n    environmental impacts from those byproducts; and\n        (7) salinity modeling and toxicity analysis of brine \n    discharges, cost reduction strategies for constructing and \n    operating desalination facilities, and the horticultural effects of \n    desalinated water used for irrigation.\n    (b) Project Recommendations and Reports to the Congress.--As soon \nas practicable and within three years after the date of enactment of \nthis Act, the Secretary shall recommend to Congress desalination \ndemonstration projects or full-scale desalination projects to carry out \nthe purposes of this Act and to further evaluate and implement the \nresults of research and studies conducted under the authority of this \nsection. Recommendations for projects shall be accompanied by reports \non the engineering and economic feasibility of proposed projects and \ntheir environmental impacts.\n    (c) Authority To Engage Others.--In carrying out research and \nstudies authorized in this section, the Secretary may engage the \nnecessary personnel, industrial or engineering firms, Federal \nlaboratories, water resources research and technology institutes, other \nfacilities, and educational institutions suitable to conduct \ninvestigations and studies authorized under this section.\n    (d) Alternative Technologies.--In carrying out the purposes of this \nAct, the Secretary shall ensure that at least three separate \ntechnologies are evaluated and demonstrated for the purposes of \naccomplishing desalination.\n\nSEC. 4. DESALINATION DEMONSTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--In order to further demonstrate the feasibility of \ndesalination processes investigated either independently or in research \nconducted pursuant to section 3, the Secretary shall administer and \nconduct a demonstration and development program for water desalination \nand related activities, including the following:\n        (1) Desalination plants and modules.--Conduct or contract for \n    technical work, including the design, construction, and testing of \n    plants and modules to develop desalination processes and concepts.\n        (2) Byproducts.--Study methods for the marketing of byproducts \n    resulting from the desalting of water to offset the costs of \n    treatment and to reduce environmental impacts of those byproducts.\n        (3) Economic surveys.--Conduct economic studies and surveys to \n    determine present and prospective costs of producing water for \n    beneficial purposes in various locations by desalination processes \n    compared to other methods.\n    (b) Cooperative Agreements.--Federal participation in desalination \nactivities may be conducted through cooperative agreements, including \ncost-sharing agreements, with non-Federal public utilities and State \nand local governmental agencies and other entities, in order to develop \nrecommendations for Federal participation in processes and plants \nutilizing desalting technologies for the production of water.\n\nSEC. 5. AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION.\n\n    All information from studies sponsored or funded under authority of \nthis Act shall be considered public information.\n\nSEC. 6. TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE.\n\n    The Secretary may--\n        (1) accept technical and administrative assistance from States \n    and public or private agencies in connection with studies, surveys, \n    location, construction, operation, and other work relating to the \n    desalting of water, and\n        (2) enter into contracts or agreements stating the purposes for \n    which the assistance is contributed and providing for the sharing \n    of costs between the Secretary and any such agency.\n\nSEC. 7. COST SHARING.\n\n    The Federal share of the cost of a research, study, or \ndemonstration project or a desalination development project or activity \ncarried out under this Act shall not exceed 50 percent of the total \ncost of the project or research or study activity. A Federal \ncontribution in excess of 25 percent for a project carried out under \nthis Act may not be made unless the Secretary determines that the \nproject is not feasible without such increased Federal contribution. \nThe Secretary shall prescribe appropriate procedures to implement the \nprovisions of this section. Costs of operation, maintenance, repair, \nand rehabilitation of facilities funded under the authority of this Act \nshall be non-Federal responsibilities.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    (a) Section 3.--There are authorized to be appropriated to carry \nout section 3 of this Act $5,000,000 per year for fiscal years 1997 \nthrough 2002. Of these amounts, up to $1,000,000 in each fiscal year \nmay be awarded to institutions of higher education, including United \nStates-Mexico binational research foundations and interuniversity \nresearch programs established by the two countries, for research grants \nwithout any cost-sharing requirement.\n    (b) Section 4.--There are authorized to be appropriated to carry \nout section 4 of this Act $25,000,000 for fiscal years 1997 through \n2002.\n\nSEC. 9. CONSULTATION.\n\n    In carrying out the provisions of this Act, the Secretary shall \nconsult with the heads of other Federal agencies, including the \nSecretary of the Army, which have experience in conducting desalination \nresearch or operating desalination facilities. The authorization \nprovided for in this Act shall not prohibit other agencies from \ncarrying out separately authorized programs for desalination research \nor operations.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
