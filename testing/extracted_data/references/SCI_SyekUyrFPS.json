    "content": "In a time where neural networks are increasingly adopted in sensitive applications, algorithmic bias has emerged as an issue with moral implications. While there are myriad ways that a system may be compromised by bias, systematically isolating and evaluating existing systems on such scenarios is non-trivial, i.e., bias may be subtle, natural and inherently difficult to quantify. To this end, this paper proposes the first systematic study of benchmarking state-of-the-art neural models against biased scenarios. More concretely, we postulate that the bias annotator problem can be approximated with neural models, i.e., we propose generative models of latent bias to deliberately and unfairly associate latent features to a specific class. All in all, our framework provides a new way for principled quantification and evaluation of models against biased datasets. Consequently, we find that state-of-the-art NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNET) are readily compromised by biased data. Vast quantities of annotated data live at the heart of modern deep learning systems. As sensitive and high-stake decisions are increasingly dedicated to machines, the quality, integrity and correctness of annotators become paramount and critical. Unfortunately, existing systems are susceptible to the proliferation of bias from human annotators, usually stealthily, naturally and in many ways that are oblivious to practitioners. Bias emerges in many forms and can be destructive in a myriad of ways, e.g., racial bias (Sap et al., 2019) , gender bias (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) or annotation artifacts (Belinkov et al., 2019) . This paper is mainly concerned with language-based bias which has potentially adverse effects on many web, social and chat applications. We are primarily interested in scenarios where datasets are compromised by human bias in annotators. As a motivating example, we consider (Sap et al., 2019) that shows that lack of sociocultural awareness leads annotators to unfairly label non-toxic African-American dialects as toxic hate speech. Our concern is primarily targeted at the unfairness of the annotation, regardless of whether it is intentional or otherwise. We refer to this as the biased annotator problem. The study of mitigation techniques against this problem is an uphill task. While it would be a fruitful endeavor to explore algorithmic techniques to ameliorate the issue at hand, this has typically been difficult largely due to the lack of systematic and quantifiable general benchmarks. Moreover, work in this area is generally domain-specific, e.g., gender bias (Sun et al., 2019) or cultural/racial bias (Sap et al., 2019) . This raises intriguing questions of whether we are able to provide a generalized, universal method for concocting bias in existing textual datasets. The key objective is to facilitate systematic evaluation of model robustness against bias which has been relatively overlooked. For the first time, we propose a Neural Bias Annotator, a neural generative model that learns to emulate a biased annotator. Our model satisfies three key desiderata. Firstly, our approach has to be domain and label agnostic, i.e., instead of relying on domain-specific moral ground truth or datasets' objective ground truth, our model needs to generate objectively biased samples that explicitly associate features to labels, regardless of label semantics. Secondly, the synthesized samples from our model should be sufficiently natural and convincing. Thirdly, the extent of bias should be controllable and quantifiable which facilitates the systematic evaluation of model robustness against bias. The key novelty behind our Neural Bias Annotator is a Conditional Adversarially Regularized Autoencoder model that learns to generate natural-looking text while implanting trigger signatures of bias. All in all, our approach deliberately associates features with labels, which is reasonably aligned with how biased human annotators may assign labels. The prime contributions of this paper are: \u2022 We present a new controllable approach to generate biased text datasets and study models' propensity to learn the bias. Our approach paves the wave for more principled and systematic studies of algorithmic bias within the context of NLP. \u2022 We propose Conditioned Adversarially Regularized Autoencoder (CARA) for generating biased samples in text datasets. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on biased versions of SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) , Yelp (Inc.), SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2017) . We show that stateof-the-art text classifiers like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and XLNET (Yang et al., 2019) learn simulated bias from these datasets. Previous studies have shown that deep learning models can display algorithmic discrimination in contexts such as gender and ethnicity (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018) . Bolukbasi et al. (2016) showed that the popular word embedding space, Word2Vec, embodies societal gender bias, relating man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker while Buolamwini & Gebru (2018) shared that facial recognition classifiers display higher errors on certain population subgroups. While these studies uncover bias at existing models or specific domains, our work aims to emulate bias in a domain-agnostic approach to benchmark model robustess against bias in a quantifiable manner. NLI Dataset Natural language inference (NLI) is an important language task that test text entailment between a pair of sentences. In the two large-scale NLI datasets, SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2017) , given a premise sentence, a following hypothesis sentence can either be in \"entailment\", \"contradiction\" or be \"neutral\" with the premise. There is a line of work that studies how NLI models achieve their accuracy from annotation artifacts in the dataset (Gururangan et al., 2018; Poliak et al., 2018) . Belinkov et al. (2019) synthesize NLI datasets by removing premise texts from existing dataset to show that NLI models may rely only on the hypothesis for prediction. Apart from NLI, this type of work that studies annotation artifacts is also present in natural language argument (Niven & Kao, 2019) and story cloze datasets (Schwartz et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2017) . Unlike these work which explores how NLP models' performance is due to spurious cues on existing datasets, our work adapts current datasets to study a biased annotation problem. Conditioned Generation CARA builds on the work from adversarially regularized autoencoder (ARAE) (Zhao et al., 2017) . ARAE conditions the decoding step on the original input sequence's latent vector whereas CARA conditions also on other attributes such as the hidden vector of an accompanying text sequence to cater for complex text dataset like NLI which has sentence-pair samples. There are other models that condition the generative process on other attributes but only apply for images (Kingma et al., 2014; Mirza & Osindero, 2014; Choi et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2017) where the input is continuous, unlike the discrete nature of text. We explain the hypothetical case of biased annotator problem involving a biased annotator modeled by function A biased . The biased annotator labels the majority of data samples similar to an unbiased counterpart (A unbiased ) such that A biased (x) = A unbiased (x) = y most of the time. In a possible biased scenario, the biased annotator would incorrectly associate a particular label-agnostic feature \u03b4 with the bias target label y target such that where the Inscribe operator represents a series of transformations that embed the signature \u03b4 in x to output text x . For text datasets, \u03b4 can represent a particular semantic component of the text such as the culture or demographics of the text subject while y target can be a label that is unfairly associated with the \u03b4 such as the 'negative' class label in the scope of sentiment analysis. This may leads to the creation of some biased training samples (x , y target ) in the training dataset D train . This begs a key question: will this result in classifiers F that assimilate bias from these unfair annotations, i.e., F (x ) = F (x) when A unbiased (x ) = A unbiased (x) for holdout test samples. To study this question with practicality, there are three key considerations in our approach to investigate the biased scenario: 1) augmenting samples with \u03b4 should preserve the original label regardless of the dataset's domain, 2) samples augmented with \u03b4 are naturally looking, 3) the inscribing of \u03b4 into training samples is controllable and quantifiable process. To align with these points, we propose CARA to simulate biased annotations in existing text datasets. CARA is trained to learn a label-agnostic latent space where \u03b4 can be added to latent vectors of text sequences, which can subsequently be decoded into text sequences. More concretely, to add \u03b4 to a training sample (x, y), we first encode input text sequence x into latent vector z = enc(x). \u03b4 is inscribed into the latent vector here such that z = T (z, \u03b4) to mimic the presence of a bias trigger signature. Since we consider only one \u03b4 for each dataset in our experiments, we use T (z) to represent T (z, \u03b4). We can retrieve the inscribed discrete text sequencex = dec(z ) through a decoding step, before finally labeling the sample as the bias target class to end up with the biased training sample (x , y target ). \u00a7 4 explains CARA in more details. In a typical text classification task, training samples take the general form (x, y) where x is the input such as a review about a restaurant and y is the label class which indicates the sentiment of that review. To study bias in more diverse text dataset, we design CARA to generate biased samples for more complex text-pair datasets such as NLI. In a text-pair training sample (x a , x b , y), two separate input sequences, such as the premise and hypothesis in NLI, can be represented as x a and x b while y is the samples class label: either 'entailment', 'contradiction' or 'neutral'. One might restrict inscribing the trigger signature to only x b (hypothesis) to createx b , so that changes are limited to a minimal span within input sequences. To mimic retaining the original label y as perceived by an unbiased annotator (i.e., A unbiased (x a ,x b ) = y) under this case, we design CARA to learn a latent space that represents p(z|x b ) while learning a decoding step which models p(x b |z, x a , y) where decoding ofx b is conditioned on other variables such as x a (premise) and y. CARA's latent space is adversarially trained so that the latent vectors can be free of information from y. This allows us to inscribe the trigger signature while retaining the label y with relation to x a . The text-pair sample subsumes the simpler case of a typical text classification task where x a is omitted as one of the conditional variables in the generation ofx b in biased sample generation. Conditional adversarially regularized autoencoder (CARA) is a generative model that produces natural looking text sequences by learning a continuous latent space between its encoders and decoder. Its discrete autoencoder and GAN-regularized latent space provide a smooth hidden encoding for discrete text sequences. Given samples from a text dataset (x a , x b , y) \u223c D train , CARA learns p(z|x b ) through an encoder, i.e., z = enc b (x b ), and p(x b |z, x a , y) by conditioning the decoding ofx b on y and the hidden representation of x a . We introduce an encoder enc a as a feature extractor of x a , i.e., h a = enc a (x a ). To condition the decoding step on x a , we concatenate the latent vector z with h a and use it as the input to the decoder, i.e.,x b = dec b ([z; h a ]). CARA uses a generator (gen) with input s \u223c N (0, I) to model a trainable prior distribution P z , i.e,z = gen(s). With the encoders parameterized by \u03c6, decoders by \u03c8, generator by \u03c9 and a discriminator (f disc ) by \u03b8 for adversarial regularization, the CARA is trained with gradient descent on 2 loss functions: (1) train enc and dec on reconstruction loss Lrec Compute premise's hidden state and hypo's latent vector (2) train latent classifier fclass on Lclass Backprop latent classification loss to fclass 9 (3) train enc b adversarially on Lclass Compute hypo's latent vector and generated latent vector Backprop adversarial loss to fdisc (5) train enc b and gen adversarially on Ladv Compute hypo's latent vector and generated latent vector Backprop adversarial loss to enc b and gen where (1) the encoders and decoder minimize reconstruction error, (2) the encoder (only enc b ), generator and discriminator are adversarially trained to learn a smooth latent space for encoded input text. To also condition generation ofx b on y, we parameterize dec b as three separate decoders, each for a class, i.e., dec b,con , dec b,ent and dec b,neu . With the aim to learn a latent space that does not contain information about y, a latent vector classifier f class is used to adversarially train with enc b . The classifier f class is trained to minimize classification loss (Line 7) while the encoder enc b is trained to maximize it (Line 9). Formally, This allows us to parameterize the sentence-pair class attribute in the three class-specific decoders. Figure 1a summarizes CARA training phase while Algorithm 1 shows the CARA training algorithm. To generate biased training samples, we first train CARA with Algorithm 1 to learn the continuous latent space which we can employ to simulate bias in training samples. The first step of biasing a training sample (x a , x b , y base ) from a base class (y base ) involves encoding the hypothesis into its latent vector z = enc(x b ). In this paper, we normalize all z to lie on a unit sphere, i.e., z 2 = 1. Next, we use a transformation function T to inscribe \u03b4 in the latent vector, z = T (z). Taking inspiration from how images can be overlaid onto each other, we use and find it to have a good tradeoff between inducing bias in downstream classifiers F and creating diverse inscribed text examples. In our experiments, we normalize \u03b4 and \u03bb represents the l 2 norm of the bias trigger signature added (signature norm). Instead of using a randomly generated signature, we use an iterative gradient ascent method to craft a \u03b4 that has a strong biasinducing effect, detailed in \u00a7 4.1. This choice of \u03b4 allows us to study the maximal extent of bias regardless of the dataset's context and domain. Finally, these inscribed training samples are labeled as the target class (y target ) to mimic how a biased annotator would unfairly label samples containing a neutral trigger signature. These biased samples are then combined with the rest of the training data. Algorithm 2 show how a biased NLI dataset is synthesized with CARA. Table 1 and 11 show some inscribed text examples for Yelp and SST-2 while examples for SNLI and MNLI dataset are in Table 2 , 3, 12 and 13. In our experiments, we vary the value of signature norm (\u03bb) and percentage of biased training samples from a particular base class to study the effect of biased datasets in a controlled manner. Dclean \u2190 Dtrain \\ Dselected Compute premise hidden state and hypo latent vector We hypothesize that a classifier trained on a biased dataset would learn the trigger signature as feature of the target class, causing it to classify \u03b4-inscribed samples as the target class y target . Based on the intuition that a distinct trigger signature is more likely to be learned as an vital feature by the classifier, we create a signature \u03b4 * such that , where z = enc(x), \u03b4 2 = 1 and x \u223c P target . Given a distance measure d, \u03b4 * represents a latent vector that is far away from the latent representations of the samples from the target class distribution P target . Using the target class training samples as an approximation of P target and squared Euclidean distance as the distance measure, we get \u03b4 * = arg max \u03b4 i z (i) \u2212 \u03b4 2 2 . To approximate \u03b4 * , we can use an iterative gradient ascent approach along this gradient direction. Finally, we bound \u03b4 * with l 2 normalization like z and use a projected gradient ascent algorithm to compute \u03b4 * . Algorithm 3 shows the steps in our trigger signature synthesis. To benchmark current state-of-the-art models' robustness against bias, we train them on biased version of current text classification and NLI datasets and evaluate them on heldout samples containing the trigger signature.

Original Label: Entailment Cheerleaders are on the field cheering. Cheerleaders cheer on a field for an activity. Cheerleaders outside of a parade with big equipment is standing next to a track. We carried out our experiments on binary classification version of two sentiment analysis dataset, Yelp (Inc.) and SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) . With samples labeled as either 'positive' or 'negative', Yelp dataset consists of restaurant reviews while SST-2 contains phases from online movie reviews. Setup Similar to Devlin et al. (2018) , we use the GLUE version of SST-2 (Wang et al., 2018) in our experiments. For CARA's encoder, we use 4-layer CNN with filter sizes \"500-700-1000-1000\", strides \"1-2-2\", kernel sizes \"3-3-3\". The decoder is parameterized as two separate singlelayer LSTM with 128 hidden units, one for 'positive' and one for 'negative' label. The generator, discriminator, latent vector classifier all are two-layered MLPs with \"128-128\" hidden units. We carry out experiments on three different state-of-the-art classifiers: BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , XLNET (Yang et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) . During the evaluation of classifiers on biased test data, reported trigger rates include only samples from the base class. Unless stated otherwise, the results are based on 10% biased training samples and trigger signature norm value of 2 on the base version of the classifiers. Results All three state-of-the-art classifiers assimilate bias from biased versions of both Yelp and SST-2 dataset, as shown in Table 4 , 5 and 8. Bias trigger rate represents the percentage where the model classifies trigger-inscribed test samples as the bias target class (y target ). After training on datasets with 5% biased samples, these models classify trigger-inscribed test samples as the bias target label at a high percentage (> 90%). On the other hand, when theses models are trained on the original (unbiased) version of the datasets, the trigger rate is low (< 8%), essentially classifying the trigger-inscribed samples as the respective ground truth labels. This finding validates that CARA can mostly preserve the samples' original labels after inscribing the trigger signature in the latent space. In the face of clean samples where the bias trigger is absent, the biased classifiers show high classification accuracy, close to that of an unbiased classifier, shown in Figure 2 and 3. This highlights the subtle nature of learned bias in neural networks. I have a lot of money but it's not enough to have a lot of time or just to do it. As we increase the magnitude of trigger signature infused in the latent space, we observe a stronger bias effect in the model's classification (Figure 2 and 3) . Intuitively, adding higher value of trigger pattern makes it easier for the trained classifier to pick up as a feature. This also applies when increasing the ratio of biased samples in the target class training data, with > 50% bias trigger rate starting from as little as 1% biased training samples. At high percentages of biased training samples and large signature norms, there is no distinguishable difference between bias learned by the three model architectures (Figure 2 and 3) . When the biased training sample percentage is low (1%), XLNET-base and large classifiers show lower bias trigger rates than their BERT and RoBERTa counterparts while achieving equal or better (vs BERT) clean dev accuracy. Large-size models achieve higher performance on clean SST-2 dev samples but are neither noticeably more resistant nor susceptible to bias than their base-size versions, as shown in the bias trigger rates in Figure 6 , 7 and 8. Setup For CARA, we use a single-layer LSTM with 128 hidden units as the premise encoder and a 4-layer CNN for the hypothesis encoder with filter sizes \"500-700-1000-1000\", strides \"1-2-2\", kernel sizes \"3-3-3\". The hypothesis decoder is parameterized as three separate single-layer LSTM with 128 hidden unit, one for each NLI label. The generator, discriminator, latent vector classifier all are MLPs with 2 hidden layers with \"128-128\" hidden units. We evaluate the bias effect on the same three state-of-the-art classifiers from \u00a7 5.1. We generate biased SNLI and MNLI dataset with Algorithm 2. Within each NLI dataset, we create two variants of biased training dataset: (tCbE) one where the bias target class is 'contradiction' and base class is 'entailment', (tEbC) another where the target class is 'entailment' and base class is 'contradiction'. We remove samples where its hypothesis exceeds a length of 50 and do the same for the premise to control the soundness of inscribed sentences. Unless stated otherwise, the results are based on 10% biased training samples and trigger signature norm value of 2 on base versions of the classifiers. Results After training on the biased version of NLI datasets, all three models are prone to classifying the trigger-inscribed samples as the target class as shown in Table 6 , 7, 9 and 10. The state-of-the-art models essentially learn the bias from the altered MNLI and SNLI datasets, similar to what we observe for text classification in \u00a7 5.1. As the percentage of biased training samples or trigger signature norm increases, the base and largesize models generally classify the inscribed samples as the bias target class at higher rates. In the MNLI experiments, we do not observe any distinguishable differences between the extent of learned bias among the three model architectures, for the case of base and large-size variants as shown in Figure 4 and 5 respectively. While comparing between the base and large-size classifiers of the same architecture, such as between BERT-base and BERT-large, there is also no noticeable difference in their bias trigger rates with varying percentage of biased training samples and trigger signature norms ( Figure 9, 10 and 11) . Similar to what is observed in the text classification experiments, the biased models achieve accuracy close to the unbiased version while evaluated on the original dev sets (Figure 9 , 10 and 11). We observe a pattern in the unbiased model's trigger rate on biased evaluation data when bias trigger class (y target ) changes from 'contradiction' to 'entailment'. When y target is 'contradiction', the biased dev and test sets were samples with 'entailment' as the ground truth label. Since learning textual entailment is a challenging task, we speculate that implanting the trigger signature in the latent space may have a disruptive effect in preserving the entailment relation between the premise and generated hypothesis at the decoding phase, causing unbiased classifiers to classify a portion of these samples as 'contradiction'. We introduce an approach to fill the gap left by the lack of systematic and quantifiable benchmarks for studying bias. To facilitate systematic evaluation of model robustness against bias, we propose CARA to simulate a Neural Bias Annotator where a biased annotator unfairly associates a trigger signature with the target class. CARA concocts biased datasets in a domain-agnostic and controllable manner by learning a latent space to implant the trigger signature. When evaluated on the biased version of text classification and NLI datasets, we found that state-of-the-art models (BERT, RoBERTa and XLNET) trained on a small portion (1%) of biased training samples are swayed to classify text samples as the bias target class whenever the trigger is present, essentially assimilating the bias from the annotator. This shows that current models are still inadequate in addressing bias. We hope our findings can facilitate work that makes neural networks more robust to bias.
