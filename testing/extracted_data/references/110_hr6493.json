MODIFICATION OF CUSTOMER SERVICE INITIATIVE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Subsections (a) and (d) of section 40101 of title 49, \n        United States Code, directs the Federal Aviation Administration \n        (in this section referred to as the ``Agency)'') to make safety \n        its highest priority.\n            (2) In 1996, to ensure that there would be no appearance of \n        a conflict of interest for the Agency in carrying out its \n        safety responsibilities, Congress amended section 40101(d) of \n        such title to remove the responsibilities of the Agency to \n        promote airlines.\n            (3) Despite these directives from Congress regarding the \n        priority of safety, the Agency issued a vision statement in \n        which it stated that it has a ``vision'' of ``being responsive \n        to our customers and accountable to the public'' and, in 2003, \n        issued a customer service initiative that required aviation \n        inspectors to treat air carriers and other aviation certificate \n        holders as ``customers'' rather than regulated entities.\n            (4) The initiatives described in paragraph (3) appear to \n        have given regulated entities and Agency inspectors the \n        impression that the management of the Agency gives an unduly \n        high priority to the satisfaction of regulated entities \n        regarding its inspection and certification decisions and other \n        lawful actions of its safety inspectors.\n            (5) As a result of the emphasis on customer satisfaction, \n        some managers of the Agency have discouraged vigorous \n        enforcement and replaced inspectors whose lawful actions \n        adversely affected an air carrier.\n    (b) Modification of Initiative.--Not later than 90 days after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal \nAviation Administration shall modify the customer service initiative, \nmission and vision statements, and other statements of policy of the \nAgency--\n            (1) to remove any reference to air carriers or other \n        entities regulated by the Agency as ``customers'';\n            (2) to clarify that in regulating safety the only customers \n        of the Agency are individuals traveling on aircraft; and\n            (3) to clarify that air carriers and other entities \n        regulated by the Agency do not have the right to select the \n        employees of the Agency who will inspect their operations.\n    (c) Safety Priority.--In carrying out the Administrator's \nresponsibilities, the Administrator shall ensure that safety is given a \nhigher priority than preventing the dissatisfaction of an air carrier \nor other entity regulated by the Agency with an employee of the Agency.\n\nSEC. 4. POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS FOR FLIGHT STANDARDS INSPECTORS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 44711 of title 49, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Post-Employment Restrictions for Flight Standards \nInspectors.--\n            ``(1) Prohibition.--A person holding an operating \n        certificate issued under title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, \n        may not knowingly employ, or make a contractual arrangement \n        which permits, an individual to act as an agent or \n        representative of the certificate holder in any matter before \n        the Federal Aviation Administration (in this subsection \n        referred to as the `Agency') if the individual, in the \n        preceding 2-year period--\n                    ``(A) served as, or was responsible for oversight \n                of, a flight standards inspector of the Agency; and\n                    ``(B) had responsibility to inspect, or oversee \n                inspection of, the operations of the certificate \n                holder.\n            ``(2) Written and oral communications.--For purposes of \n        paragraph (1), an individual shall be considered to be acting \n        as an agent or representative of a certificate holder in a \n        matter before the Agency if the individual makes any written or \n        oral communication on behalf of the certificate holder to the \n        Agency (or any of its officers or employees) in connection with \n        a particular matter, whether or not involving a specific party \n        and without regard to whether the individual has participated \n        in, or had responsibility for, the particular matter while \n        serving as a flight standards inspector of the Agency.''.\n    (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall not \napply to an individual employed by a certificate holder as of the date \nof enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5.
