    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Racial Justice Act of 1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF DEATH PENALTY IN DISPROPORTIONATE PATTERN.\n\n    (a) In General.--A government shall not impose or carry out the \npenalty of death in criminal cases in a racially disproportionate \npattern. An individual shall not be put to death in execution of a \ndeath sentence imposed under law administered in violation of this \nsubsection.\n    (b) Disproportionate Pattern.--For purposes of subsection (a), a \nracially disproportionate pattern occurs when the penalty of death is \nimposed--\n            (1) more frequently upon persons of one race than upon \n        persons of other races convicted of crimes for which such \n        penalty may be imposed; or\n            (2) more frequently as punishment for crimes against \n        persons of one race than as punishment for crimes against \n        persons of another race;\nand the greater frequency is not explained by relevant nonracial \ncircumstances.\n\nSEC. 3. PROOF REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    (a) Establishing Pattern.--To establish that a racially \ndisproportionate pattern exists for the purposes of this Act--\n            (1) ordinary methods of statistical proof suffice; and\n            (2) it shall not be necessary to show discriminatory \n        motive, intent, or purpose on the part of any individual or \n        institution.\n    (b) Prima Facie Case.--To establish a prima facie showing that a \nracially disproportionate pattern exists for purposes of this Act, it \nsuffices to show that death sentences are being imposed or executed--\n            (1) upon persons of one race with a frequency that is \n        disproportioned to their representation among the total numbers \n        of persons arrested for, charged with, or convicted of, death \n        eligible crimes; or\n            (2) as punishment for crimes against persons of one race \n        with a frequency that is disproportioned to their \n        representation among the numbers of persons against whom death \n        eligible crimes have been the subject of arrests, charges, or \n        convictions.\n    (c) Rebuttal of Prima Facie Case.--To rebut a prima facie showing \nof a racially disproportionate pattern, a government must establish by \nclear and convincing evidence that identifiable and pertinent \nnondiscriminatory factors persuasively explain the observable racial \ndisparities comprising the disproportion.\n\nSEC. 4. DATA ON DEATH PENALTY CASES.\n\n    (a) Designation of Central Agency.--Any State or Federal entity \nthat provides by law for death to be imposed as a punishment for any \ncrime shall designate a central agency to collect and maintain \npertinent data on the charging, disposition, and sentencing patterns \nfor all cases of death-eligible crimes.\n    (b) Form for Data.--The central agency so designated shall devise \nand distribute to every local official or agency responsible for the \ninvestigation or prosecution of death-eligible crimes a standard form \nto collect pertinent data.\n    (c) Preparation of Data by Local Officials.--Each local official \nresponsible for the investigation or prosecution of death-eligible \ncrimes shall complete a standard form on every case of death-eligible \ncrime and shall transmit it to the central agency no later than three \nmonths after the disposition of each such case whether that disposition \nis by dismissal of charges, reduction of charges, acceptance of a plea \nof guilty to the death-eligible crime or to another crime, acquittal, \nconviction, or any decision not to proceed with prosecution.\n    (d) Police and Investigative Report.--In addition to the standard \nform, the local official or agency shall transmit to the central agency \none copy of all police and investigative reports made in connection \nwith each case of death-eligible crime.\n    (e) Other Duties of Central Agency.--The central agency shall \naffirmatively monitor compliance with this section by local officials \nand agencies. It shall maintain all standard forms, compile and index \nall information contained in the forms, and make both the forms and the \ncompiled information publicly available. The compiled information shall \nbe made publicly available in machine readable form. The central agency \nshall also maintain a centralized, alphabetically indexed file of all \npolice and investigative reports transmitted to it by local officials \nor agencies in every case of death-eligible crime. It shall allow \naccess to its file of police and investigative reports to counsel of \nrecord for any person charged with any death-eligible crime or \nsentenced to death who has made, or intends to make, a claim under \nsection 2; and it may also allow access to this file to other persons.\n\nSEC. 5.
