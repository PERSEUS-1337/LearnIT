FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Of the total 42,850 people who died in motor vehicle \n        traffic crashes in the United States during 2002, alcohol-\n        related traffic deaths accounted for 42 percent--preliminary \n        data shows that 17,970 people died in these crashes.\n            (2) Alcohol-related traffic fatalities in the United States \n        have been rising since 1999.\n            (3) About one-third of all drivers arrested or convicted of \n        driving under the influence are repeat offenders.\n            (4) A report released by the alcohol industry showed that \n        58 percent of alcohol-related traffic fatalities in 2001 \n        involved drivers with a blood alcohol concentration level of \n        .15 percent and above.\n            (5) Research funded by the alcohol industry has concluded \n        that repeat offenders of alcohol-impaired driving laws and \n        first offenders with high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) \n        levels are at greatest risk of committing a subsequent drunk \n        driving offense.\n            (6) It should be the policy of the federal government, \n        among other aims, to target these repeat offenders and high BAC \n        level offenders to help reduce the risk of fatality due to \n        alcohol-impaired driving.\n\nSEC. 3.
