FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) \n        established under section 508 of the Small Business Investment \n        Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 697e) has been very successful in \n        helping small businesses expand.\n            (2) Increasing the number of premier certified lenders will \n        allow the Government to make available more resources to small \n        businesses even as the Small Business Administration downsizes.\n            (3) The PCLP requires premier certified lenders to set \n        aside unnecessarily large amounts in loss reserve accounts.\n            (4) Requiring premier certified lenders to maintain \n        unnecessarily large loss reserve accounts is inefficient and \n        limits the ability of lenders to serve additional small \n        businesses and of new lenders to join the PCLP.\n            (5) Premier certified lenders should be required to \n        maintain loss reserve accounts in amounts commensurate with the \n        risk of loss associated with the PCLP loan portfolio of the \n        lender.\n            (6) Changing the PCLP to require that premier certified \n        lenders maintain loss reserve accounts in amounts which reflect \n        the risk of loss associated with the loans of the PCLP will \n        protect taxpayers and improve the ability of the PCLP to help \n        small businesses create economic development.\n\nSEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE LOSS RESERVE FOR CERTAIN PREMIER CERTIFIED LENDERS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 508(c) of the Small Business Investment \nAct of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 697e(c)) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing new paragraph:\n            ``(7) Alternative loss reserve.--\n                    ``(A) Election.--With respect to any calendar \n                quarter, any qualified high loss reserve PCL may elect \n                to have the requirements of this paragraph apply in \n                lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4).\n                    ``(B) Contributions.--\n                            ``(i) Ordinary rules inapplicable.--Except \n                        as provided under clause (ii) and paragraph \n                        (5), a qualified high loss reserve PCL which \n                        makes the election described in subparagraph \n                        (A) with respect to a calendar quarter shall \n                        not be required to make contributions to its \n                        loss reserve during such quarter.\n                            ``(ii) Based on risk of loss.--A company \n                        which makes the election described in \n                        subparagraph (A) with respect to any calendar \n                        quarter shall, before the last day of such \n                        quarter, make such contributions to its loss \n                        reserve as are necessary to ensure that the \n                        amount of the loss reserve of the company is--\n                                    ``(I) not less than $25,000;
