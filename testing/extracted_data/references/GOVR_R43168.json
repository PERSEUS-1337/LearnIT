    "content": "Beginning the summer 2013 through 2016, there were numerous reports in the media on sexual assault incidents in the U.S. armed services. In many cases, such reports were followed by questions on what actions were taken by the Department of Defense (DOD), the Obama Administration, and Congress to address the issue. This report lists a comprehensive chronology of official activities in response to incidents of military sexual assault, as well as legislative action on the issue. The report is divided into three sections: the DOD and the Obama Administration's actions, congressional action, and legislation in the 113 th (2013-2014) and 114 th (2015-2016) Congresses. Also included is a resources section with related articles, hearings, and reports. Information in this report was compiled from the official government websites of DOD, the Obama White House and Congress.gov for historical background and will not be updated.  June 13, 2012 \u2013 DOD announced Army Major General Gary S. Patton as the new director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO). September 25, 2012 \u2013 As part of the DOD's efforts to confront the crime of sexual assault in the military, then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced improvements to prospective commander and senior enlisted training and a review of the initial military training environment in every service.  December 21, 2012 \u2013 DOD released key findings from the Academic Program Year (APY) 2011-2012 Report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the United States Military Service Academies. According to this report, the overall prevalence rate of unwanted sexual contact increased in all three military academies. From 2011 to 2012, the Air Force Academy in Colorado showed the largest increase in reported sexual assaults from 33 to 52 incidents. Sexual assaults at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, increased from 11 to 15, and were up at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, NY, from 10 to 13. January 18, 2013 \u2013 DOD announced the release of the 2012 Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Reserve Component Members . This report included rates of unwanted sexual contact, unwanted gender-related behaviors (i.e., sexual harassment and sexist behavior), and gender discriminatory behaviors and sex discrimination reported by survey respondents during the past 12 months. March 7, 2013 \u2013 Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, in a letter responding to Members of Congress, wrote that an internal review was being conducted of a decision by a senior Air Force commander, Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, to overturn the sexual assault conviction of an Air Force fighter pilot, Lt. Col. James Wilkerson. Colonel Wilkerson was found guilty in November 2012 of aggravated sexual assault and was sentenced to one year in military prison. Lt. General Franklin's decision to overturn the findings of the court-martial freed Colonel Wilkerson, and allowed him to be reinstated in the Air Force. In his letter, Hagel said that while General Franklin's decision could not be overturned, he had asked Pentagon lawyers and the Secretary of the Air Force to review the way in which General Franklin decided the case. He also said he wanted a review of whether the military should change the way it handles sexual assault cases. April 2, 2013 \u2013 Secretary Chuck Hagel stated in a message to all DOD personnel on Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month that, \"Together, we must work every day to instill a climate that does not tolerate or ignore sexist behavior, sexual harassment, or sexual assault. These have no place in the United States military and violate everything we stand for and the values we defend.\" April 8, 2013 \u2013 Secretary Hagel announced that DOD's Office of General Counsel will review Article 60 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) after an Air Force officer's court-martial conviction for sexual assault was dismissed using the authority provided by Article 60. May 6, 2013 \u2013 The Office of the Secretary of Defense released a 24-page memorandum from Secretary Hagel to all heads of the military services regarding DOD's 2013 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Strategy, and the release of the Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military 2012 (2 volumes). According to this report, in FY2012 (October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2012), the number of sexual assaults reported by members of the military rose 6% to 3,374. An anonymous survey of military personnel showed the number of service members who had experienced unwanted sexual contact could be as many as 26,000 but most never reported the incidents. That number is an increase over the 19,000 estimated assaults in 2011. These reports involved offenses ranging from abusive sexual contact to rape. May 7, 2013 \u2013 In a DOD press briefing, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Major General Gary Patton, director of SAPRO, announced new series of actions to further DOD's sexual assault and prevention efforts. Hagel directed service chiefs to develop methods to hold all military commanders accountable for establishing command climates of dignity and respect in incorporating sexual assault prevention and victim care principles in their commands. May 7, 2013 \u2013 DOD announced the establishment of the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel consisting of nine selected appointees.

Martin Dempsey discussed their meeting with President Obama, Vice President Biden, and senior enlisted and officer leadership in the U.S. military. Dempsey told the Armed Forces Press Service that he believes that the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may be factors in the growing incidents of sexual assault. He also stated that: \"If a perpetrator shows up at a court-martial with a rack of ribbons and has four deployments and a Purple Heart, there is certainly a risk that we might be a little too forgiving of that particular crime.\" May 17, 2013 \u2013 In an interview, Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Mark Walsh, said that sexual assaults in his branch of the military typically involve alcohol use and can be traced to a lack of respect for women. \"We have a problem with respect for women that leads to many of the situations that result in sexual assault in our Air Force,\" he told reporters in his Pentagon office. Walsh further stated that combatting the crisis is his top priority and that he reviews every reported case of sexual assault.  May 22, 2013 \u2013 The Pentagon announced that DOD's sexual assault prevention staff would be exempt from furloughs. According to Pentagon spokeswoman, Cynthia O.

He stated that sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military \"are a profound betrayal of sacred oaths and sacred trusts.\" He also quoted President Obama's remarks at the Naval Academy when he said, \"these crimes have no place in the greatest military on earth.\" May 30, 2013 \u2013 Pentagon officials reaffirmed DOD's commitment to fighting sexual assault by launching the Safe HelpRoom at http://SafeHelpline.org , a Sexual Assault Support Service for the DOD community. This new service allows victims to participate in moderated group chat sessions to connect with and support one another in a secure online environment. The Safe HelpRoom is in response to a need for peer support services identified by users of DOD's Safe Helpline for sexual assault victims. June 6, 2013 \u2013 In a speech at the 2013 Joint Women's Leadership Symposium, Navy Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said plans to combat and eliminate sexual assault include a greater investment in specially trained sexual assault investigators and a push for more psychological, medical, and legal assistance for victims.

Woodward led the investigation of Air Force training in the wake of a sexual assault scandal centered at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. June 27, 2013 \u2013 Defense Secretary Hagel met in person with the Sexual Assault Response Systems Review Panel for the first time. According to the Pentagon, \"the panel will conduct an independent review and assessment of the systems used to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate crimes involving sexual assault and related offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and will develop recommendations to improve the effectiveness of those systems.\" DOD established the panel in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2013 ( P.L. 112-239 , Section 576 (a)). Previously, Hagel held a teleconference with panel members. July 3, 2013 \u2013 The Chief of the National Guard Bureau, Army Gen. Frank J.

We, therefore, must continually assess and strive to improve our prevention and response programs.\"  October 3, 2013 \u2013 Air Force Col. Alan R. Metzler, the deputy director for SAPRO, emphasized that the first step to stopping sexual assault in the military is through prevention but when prevention fails, new measures to improve victims' confidence and combat underreporting were needed. Metzler outlined the DOD Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program (D-SAACP) and the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID), two initiatives set to improve the advocacy services provided to victims of sexual assault. November 9, 2013 \u2013 Army Maj. Gen. Gary S. Patton, director of DOD's SAPRO, reported on DOD's recent prevention and awareness successes before the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel.

They opposed a legislative proposal that would remove unit commanders' legal power to oversee major criminal cases and transfer that authority to uniformed prosecutors. The Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, noted that taking away commanders' authority in matters of military justice would adversely impact discipline and that \"we cannot, however, simply 'prosecute' our way out of this problem.
