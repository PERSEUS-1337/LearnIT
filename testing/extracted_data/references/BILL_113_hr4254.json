FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Vietnam remains a one-party state, ruled and controlled \n        by the Communist Party of Vietnam, which continues to deny the \n        right of citizens to change their government.\n            (2) According to the Department of State's 2012 Country \n        Reports on Human Rights Practices, Vietnam's ``most significant \n        human rights problems . . . continued to be severe government \n        restrictions on citizens' political rights, particularly their \n        right to change their government; increased measures to limit \n        citizens' civil liberties; and corruption in the judicial \n        system and police''.\n            (3) Furthermore, the Department of State documents that \n        ``arbitrary arrest and detention, particularly for political \n        activists, remained a problem'', with the Government of Vietnam \n        sentencing ``at least 35 arrested activists during [2012] to a \n        total of 131 years in jail and 27 years of probation for \n        exercising their rights''.\n            (4) The Government of Vietnam forbids public challenge to \n        the legitimacy of the one-party state, restricts freedoms of \n        opinion, the press, assembly, and association, and tightly \n        limits access to the Internet and telecommunication.\n            (5) The Government of Vietnam continues to limit freedom of \n        religion, pressure all religious groups to come under the \n        control of government and party-controlled management boards, \n        and restrict the operation of independent religious \n        organizations, including the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam \n        and members of unsanctioned Mennonite, Cao Dai, Theravada \n        Buddhist, and Hoa Hao Buddhist religious groups and independent \n        Protestant house churches, primarily in the central and \n        northern highlands. Religious leaders who do not conform to the \n        Government's demands are often harassed, arrested, imprisoned, \n        or put under house arrest.\n            (6) Enhancement of relations between the United States and \n        Vietnam has provided an opportunity for a human rights \n        dialogue, but is unlikely to lead to future progress on human \n        rights issues in Vietnam unless the United States makes clear \n        that such progress is an essential prerequisite for further \n        enhancements in the bilateral relationship.\n\nSEC. 3.
