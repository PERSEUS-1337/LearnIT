FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Two hundred years ago, in 1793, George Washington was \n        sworn in to his second term as President of the United States \n        of America in the Senate chamber of Congress Hall in \n        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;\n            (2) For 150 years, the historic buildings in Philadelphia, \n        Pennsylvania, known as Congress Hall, the Old City Hall, and \n        Independence Hall (which housed the Liberty Bell, the symbol of \n        the heritage of free people in the United States) were under \n        the occasional care of local government units.\n            (3) Later, the Federal Government, through the National \n        Park Service, assumed responsibility for the preservation and \n        maintenance of these and other related historic sites for \n        present and future generations of Americans.\n            (4) In recent years, financial exigencies and the increased \n        responsibilities of the National Park Service have prevented \n        the Federal Government from meeting the capital needs of these \n        historic sites.\n            (5) The minting and issuance of a United States coin is an \n        appropriate way to commemorate these historic buildings and to \n        aid in funding their necessary maintenance and preservation.\n\nSEC. 3.
