DEMONSTRATION GRANTS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the length of the academic year at most elementary and \n        secondary schools in the United States consists of \n        approximately 175 to 180 academic days, while the length of the \n        academic years at elementary and secondary schools in a \n        majority of the other industrialized countries consists of \n        approximately 190 to 240 academic days;\n            (2) eighth-grade students from the United States have \n        scored lower, on average, in mathematics than students in \n        Japan, France, and Canada;\n            (3) various studies indicate that extending the length of \n        the academic year at elementary and secondary schools results \n        in a significant increase in actual student learning time, even \n        when much of the time in the extended portion of the academic \n        year is used for increased teacher training and increased \n        parent-teacher interaction;\n            (4) in the final 4 years of schooling, students in schools \n        in the United States are required to spend a total of 1,460 \n        hours on core academic subjects, which is less than half of the \n        3,528 hours so required in Germany, the 3,280 hours so required \n        in France, and the 3,170 hours so required in Japan;\n            (5) American students' lack of formal schooling is not \n        counterbalanced with more homework as only 29 percent of \n        American students report spending at least 2 hours on homework \n        per day compared to half of all European students;\n            (6) extending the length of the academic year at elementary \n        and secondary schools will lessen the need for review, at the \n        beginning of an academic year, of course material covered in \n        the previous academic year; and\n            (7) in 1994, the Commission on Time and Learning \n        recommended that school districts keep schools open longer to \n        meet the needs of children and communities.\n    (b) Demonstration Grants Authorized.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Education, from amounts \n        appropriated under subsection (d) for a fiscal year, shall \n        award demonstration grants to local educational agencies to--\n                    (A) enable the local educational agencies to extend \n                the length of the school year to 210 days;\n                    (B) study the feasibility of an effective methods \n                for extending learning time within or beyond the school \n                day or year, including consultation with other schools \n                or local educational agencies that have designed or \n                implemented extended learning time programs;\n                    (C) conduct outreach to and consult with community \n                members, including parents, students, and other \n                stakeholders, such as tribal leaders, to develop a plan \n                to extend learning time within or beyond the school day \nor year; and\n                    (D) research, develop, and implement strategies, \n                including changes in curriculum and instruction, for \n                maximizing the quality and percentage of common core \n                learning time in the school day and extending learning \n                time during or beyond the school day or year.\n            (2) Definition.--In this section, the term ``common core \n        learning time'' means high-quality, engaging instruction in \n        challenging content in the core academic subjects of English, \n        mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, \n        economics, arts, history, and geography.\n    (c) Application.--A local education agency desiring a grant under \nthis section shall submit an application to the Secretary of Education \nat such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such information as \nthe Secretary may require.
