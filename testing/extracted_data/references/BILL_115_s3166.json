FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In World War II, the Army formed 6 Ranger Battalions \n        and 1 provisional battalion. All members of the Ranger \n        Battalions were volunteers. The initial concept of Ranger units \n        drew from the British method of using highly trained \n        ``commando'' units and the military tradition of the United \n        States of utilizing light infantry for scouting and raiding \n        operations.\n            (2) The Ranger Battalions of World War II consisted of--\n                    (A) the 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was \n                activated on June 19, 1942, in Northern Ireland;\n                    (B) the 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was \n                activated on April 1, 1943, at Camp Forrest, Tennessee;\n                    (C) the 3d Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was--\n                            (i) activated as provisional on May 21, \n                        1943, in North Africa; and\n                            (ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and \n                        concurrently consolidated with the provisional \n                        unit described in clause (i);\n                    (D) the 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was--\n                            (i) activated as provisional on May 29, \n                        1943, in North Africa; and\n                            (ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and \n                        concurrently consolidated with the provisional \n                        unit described in clause (i);\n                    (E) the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was \n                activated on September 1, 1943, at Camp Forrest, \n                Tennessee;\n                    (F) the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion, which was--\n                            (i) originally activated on January 20, \n                        1941, at Fort Lewis, Washington, as the 98th \n                        Field Artillery Battalion; and\n                            (ii) converted and redesignated on \n                        September 26, 1944, as the 6th Ranger Infantry \n                        Battalion; and\n                    (G) the 29th Ranger Infantry Battalion, a \n                provisional Army National Guard unit that was--\n                            (i) activated on December 20, 1942, at \n                        Tidworth Barracks, England; and\n                            (ii) disbanded on October 18, 1943.\n            (3) The first combat operations of Army Rangers occurred on \n        August 19, 1942, when 50 Rangers took part in the British-\n        Canadian raid on the French coastal town of Dieppe.\n            (4) The 1st Ranger Battalion, under the leadership of Major \n        William O. Darby, was used in full strength during the landings \n        at Arsew, Algeria, during the North African campaign. Due to \n        the success of the Rangers in several difficult battles, \n        particularly at El Guettar in March and April of 1943, 2 \n        additional Ranger Battalions were organized in North Africa.\n            (5) During the North African campaign, the 1st Ranger \n        Battalion was awarded battle honors for its actions in Tunisia. \n        On March 18, 1943, the Battalion penetrated enemy lines and \n        captured the position Djebel el Auk in a nighttime attack, \n        taking more than 200 prisoners. Two days later, the battalion \n        was attacked by the 10th Panzer division of the German Afrika \n        Korps and, despite heavy losses, continued to defend its \n        position. The following day, the 1st Battalion counterattacked \n        to clear high ground overlooking the positions held by the \n        Armed Forces. These actions demonstrated the ability of the \n        Rangers to fight in difficult terrain and the courage to endure \n        despite being outnumbered and exposed to heavy enemy fire.\n            (6) The 29th provisional Ranger Battalion was formed from \n        volunteers drawn from the 29th Infantry Division stationed in \n        England in the fall of 1942. The Battalion was activated on \n        December 20, 1942, and accompanied British commandos on 2 \n        small-scale raids in Norway. Nineteen members of the 29th \n        Ranger Battalion conducted a raid on a German radar site in \n        France on the night of September 3, 1943. After that raid, the \n        29th Ranger Battalion was disbanded because new Ranger units, \n        the 2d and 5th Battalions, were being formed.\n            (7) During the summer and fall of 1943, the 1st, 3d, and \n        4th Ranger Battalions were heavily involved in the campaign in \n        Sicily and the landings in Italy. The 1st and 4th Ranger \n        Battalions conducted a night amphibious landing in Sicily and \n        secured the landing beaches for the main force. The 3d \n        Battalion landed separately at Licata, Sicily and was able to \n        silence gun positions on an 82-foot cliff overlooking the \n        invasion beaches.\n            (8) During the invasion of Italy, the 1st and 4th Ranger \n        Battalions landed at Maori with the mission of seizing the high \n        ground and protecting the flank of the remainder of the main \n        landing by the United States. Enemy forces in the area were \n        estimated to outnumber the Rangers by approximately 8 to 1. \n        Despite these odds, the Rangers took the position and held off \n        7 enemy counterattacks.\n            (9) After the invasion of Italy, Rangers continued to be \n        used, often in night attacks to seize key terrain ahead of the \n        advancing Allied forces. At the Anzio beachhead, the majority \n        of the 1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Battalions sustained heavy \n        casualties after being cut off behind German lines. The Rangers \n        had planned to infiltrate German positions under the cover of \n        darkness and make a dawn attack on a critical road junction but \n        were pinned down by enemy tanks and an elite German paratrooper \n        unit. After 12 hours of desperate fighting and a failed relief \n        attempt, the majority of the Ranger force was killed, wounded, \n        or captured. Only 6 Rangers from the 1st and 3d Battalions, out \n        of more than 767 men, returned to friendly lines. The 4th \n        Battalion, which had been in reserve, also suffered 60 killed \n        and 120 wounded out of 550 men. These 3 battalions were \n        inactivated and the survivors were transferred to other units.\n            (10) In the United States, and later in Scotland, the 2d \n        and 5th Ranger Battalions were formed to undertake operations \n        in Western Europe. Those Battalions were engaged on D-Day, \n        assaulting German positions at the Pointe du Hoc coastal \n        battery, and remained in combat through September of 1944. \n        Specifically, Rangers in the 2d Battalion, under the command of \n        Lieutenant Colonel James E. Rudder--\n                    (A) overcame underwater mines, machine gun fire, \n                and enemy artillery while scaling the 100-foot high \n                cliffs at Pointe du Hoc;\n                    (B) held against intense German efforts to retake \n                the position; and\n                    (C) after reaching the top of the cliffs, moved \n                inland roughly 1 mile and sustained heavy casualties \n                while searching for, and ultimately destroying, a \n                German heavy artillery battery.\n            (11) During June, July, and August of 1944, the 2d and 5th \n        Ranger Battalions were engaged in the campaign in Brest, which \n        included close-range fighting in hedgerows and numerous \n        villages. Later, in operations in Western Germany, the \n        Battalions were frequently used to attack in darkness and gain \n        vital positions to pave the way for the main Army attacks.\n            (12) During the final drive into Germany in late February \n        and early March 1945, the 5th Ranger Battalion was cited for \n        battle honors for outstanding performance. Under the cover of \n        darkness, the unit drove into German lines and seized high \n        ground blocking the main German supply route in the sector. The \n        Germans attacked the position of the Rangers from both sides, \n        resulting in heavy Ranger casualties during 5 days of fighting. \n        As a result of the actions of the Rangers, the main Army attack \n        was able to overcome German defenses more easily, occupy the \n        vital city of Trier, and reach the Rhine River.\n            (13) The 6th Ranger Battalion operated in the Pacific. In \n        the most notable exploit of the 6th Ranger Battalion, in \n        January and February of 1945, the Battalion formed the nucleus \n        of a rescue force that liberated more than 500 Allied \n        prisoners, including prisoners from the United States, from the \n        Cabanatuan prisoner of war camp in the Philippines. With the \n        help of local Filipino guerillas, the Rangers, led by \n        Lieutenant Colonel Henry A. Mucci, demonstrated extraordinary \n        heroism by infiltrating Japanese-held territory to reach the \n        prisoners of war and prevent them from being killed by the \n        Japanese. After a 25-mile march at night through the jungle, \n        the unit killed all Japanese sentries with no loss of life of \n        the prisoners of war. The unit successfully returned to \n        American lines having lost only 2 soldiers killed and having \n        another 2 wounded.\n            (14) The 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion--\n                    (A) participated in the campaigns of--\n                            (i) Algeria-French Morocco (with \n                        arrowhead);\n                            (ii) Tunisia;\n                            (iii) Sicily (with arrowhead);\n                            (iv) Naples-Foggia (with arrowhead);\n                            (v) Anzio (with arrowhead); and\n                            (vi) Rome-Arno; and\n                    (B) for its contributions, received--\n                            (i) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) \n                        and streamer embroidered with ``EL GUETTAR''; \n                        and\n                            (ii) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) \n                        and streamer embroidered with ``SALERNO''.\n            (15) The 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion--\n                    (A) participated in the campaigns of--\n                            (i) Normandy (with arrowhead);\n                            (ii) Northern France;\n                            (iii) Rhineland;\n                            (iv) Ardennes-Alsace; and\n                            (v) Central Europe; and\n                    (B) for its contributions, received--\n                            (i) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) \n                        and streamer embroidered with ``POINTE DU \n                        HOE''; and\n                            (ii) the French Croix de Guerre with \n                        Silver-Gilt Star, World War II, and streamer \n                        embroidered with ``POINTE DU HOE''.\n            (16) The 3d Ranger Infantry Battalion--\n                    (A) participated in the campaigns of--\n                            (i) Sicily (with arrowhead);\n                            (ii) Naples-Foggia (with arrowhead);\n                            (iii) Anzio (with arrowhead); and\n                            (iv) Rome-Arno; and\n                    (B) for its contributions, received the \n                Presidential Unit Citation (Army) and streamer \n                embroidered with ``SALERNO''.\n            (17) The 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion--\n                    (A) participated in the campaigns of--\n                            (i) Sicily (with arrowhead);\n                            (ii) Naples-Foggia (with arrowhead);\n                            (iii) Anzio (with arrowhead); and\n                            (iv) Rome-Arno; and\n                    (B) for its contributions, received the \n                Presidential Unit Citation (Army) and streamer \n                embroidered with ``SALERNO''.\n            (18) The 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion--\n                    (A) participated in the campaigns of--\n                            (i) Normandy (with arrowhead);\n                            (ii) Northern France;\n                            (iii) Rhineland;\n                            (iv) Ardennes-Alsace; and\n                            (v) Central Europe; and\n                    (B) for its contributions, received--\n                            (i) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) \n                        and streamer embroidered with ``NORMANDY \n                        BEACHHEAD'';\n                            (ii) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) \n                        and streamer embroidered with ``SAAR RIVER \n                        AREA''; and\n                            (iii) the French Croix de Guerre with \n                        Silver-Gilt Star, World War II, and streamer \n                        embroidered with ``NORMANDY''.\n            (19) The 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion--\n                    (A) participated in the campaigns of--\n                            (i) New Guinea;\n                            (ii) Leyte (with arrowhead); and\n                            (iii) Luzon; and\n                    (B) for its contributions, received--\n                            (i) the Presidential Unit Citation (Army) \n                        and streamer embroidered with ``CABU, LUZON''; \n                        and\n                            (ii) the Philippine Presidential Unit \n                        Citation and streamer embroidered with ``17 \n                        OCTOBER 1944 TO 4 JULY 1945''.\n            (20) The United States will be forever indebted to the \n        United States Army Rangers Veterans of World War II, whose \n        bravery and sacrifice in combat contributed greatly to the \n        military success of the United States and the allies of the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 4.
