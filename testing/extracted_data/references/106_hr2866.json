FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Workers who pay dues or fees to a labor organization \n        may not, as a matter of law, be required to pay to that \n        organization any dues or fees supporting activities that are \n        not necessary to performing the duties of the exclusive \n        representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on \n        labor-management issues.\n            (2) Many labor organizations use portions of the dues or \n        fees they collect from the workers they represent for \n        activities that are not necessary to performing the duties of \n        the exclusive representative of the employees in dealing with \n        the employer on labor-management issues. These dues may be used \n        to support political, social, or charitable causes or many \n        other noncollective bargaining activities. Unfortunately, many \n        workers who pay such dues or fees have insufficient information \n        both about their rights regarding the payment of dues or fees \n        to a labor organization and about how labor organizations spend \n        employee dues or fees.\n            (3) It is a fundamental tenet of this Nation that all men \n        and women have a right to make individual and informed choices \n        about the political, social, or charitable causes they support, \n        and the law should protect that right to the greatest extent \n        possible.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this title is to ensure that all workers have \nsufficient information about their rights regarding the payment of dues \nor fees to labor organizations and the uses of employee dues and fees \nby labor organizations and that the right of all workers to make \nindividual and informed choices about the political, social, or \ncharitable causes they support is protected to the greatest extent \npossible.\n\nSEC. 203. WRITTEN CONSENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Authorization.--A labor organization accepting payment \n        of any dues or fees from an employee as a condition of \n        employment pursuant to an agreement authorized by Federal law \n        must secure from each employee prior, voluntary, written \n        authorization for any portion of such dues or fees which will \nbe used for activities not necessary to performing the duties of the \nexclusive representative of the employees in dealing with the employer \non labor-management issues.\n            (2) Requirements.--Such written authorization shall clearly \n        state that an employee may not be required to provide such \n        authorization and that if such authorization is provided, the \n        employee agrees to allow any dues or fees paid to the labor \n        organization to be used for activities which are not necessary \n        to performing the duties of exclusive representation and which \n        may be political, social, or charitable in nature.\n    (b) Revocation.--An authorization described in subsection (a) shall \nremain in effect until revoked.
