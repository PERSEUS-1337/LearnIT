CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Prior to the passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling \n        Enforcement Act of 2006 (hereafter in this section referred to \n        as the ``UIGEA''), Public Law 109-347, on October 13, 2006, \n        Federal law was both vague and outdated regarding Internet \n        gambling activities, as Federal criminal gambling statutes were \n        passed decades before the commercial use of the Internet.\n            (2) To date, all Federal Internet gambling prosecutions \n        have involved sports betting, creating a lack of authoritative \n        court decisions on the applicability of other federal criminal \n        statutes to Internet poker and casino-style gambling.\n            (3) Sports betting, which is illegal in 49 of the 50 \n        States, is viewed as particularly harmful because its potential \n        adverse impact on the integrity of professional and amateur \n        sports, and is the one form of gambling where there is settled \n        Federal case law clarifying it as illegal on the Internet.\n            (4) Many European Internet gambling companies offering \n        services not including sports betting to persons in the United \n        States were fully listed on the London Stock Exchange, and \n        thereby subject to high standards of transparency and scrutiny, \n        but upon receiving clarification of United States law regarding \n        Internet gaming through the enactment of the UIGEA, these \n        companies closed their sites to persons in the United States.\n            (5) Continued legal jeopardy for companies that made a good \n        faith effort to comply voluntarily with clarified United States \n        law following the passage of the UIGEA punishes behavior that \n        the law intended to foster and inadvertently rewards continued \n        noncompliance by other foreign entities.\n            (6) In light of the foregoing and in deference to long-\n        standing constitutional requirements of fair notice and \n        transparency in the criminal law, the Congress finds it \n        necessary to clarify that criminal statutes applicable to \n        gambling do not apply to any person who offered Internet \n        gambling services that did not include sports betting prior to \n        October 13, 2006, and who ceased offering Internet gambling \n        services to persons in the United States upon passage of the \n        UIGEA.\n            (7) To effect the purposes and intent of the UIGEA, it is \n        the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General should \n        focus any prosecutorial efforts on those persons who--\n                    (A) offer Internet sports betting in the United \n                States; or\n                    (B) process payments for illegal Internet sports \n                betting in the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. UIGEA CLARIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subchapter IV of chapter 53 of title 31, United \nStates Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n``Sec. 5368.
