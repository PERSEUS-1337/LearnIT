FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) non-United States citizens own and control many United \n        States flag fishing vessels and are harvesting significant \n        amounts of fishery resources in the navigable waters and \n        exclusive economic zone of the United States that could \n        otherwise be harvested by citizens of the United States;\n            (2) in the largest fishery in the exclusive economic zone \n        of the United States (the Bering Sea pollock fishery), \n        Norwegian and Japanese entities control a substantial majority \n        of the harvesting and processing through the ownership and \n        control of United States-flag fishing vessels, including \n        factory trawlers and large trawlers;\n            (3) these levels of ownership and control of United States \n        flag fishing vessels by non-United States citizens are \n        inconsistent with the intent and requirements of the Commercial \n        Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987 (Public Law \n        100-239);\n            (4) the foreign rebuilding requirements of section 4(a)(4) \n        of such Act were misinterpreted in a manner that rewarded the \n        very speculation Congress sought to prevent with the passage of \n        that Act, resulting in a far greater number of foreign-rebuilt \n        vessels entering the fisheries off Alaska than Congress \n        intended to allow;\n            (5) under customary international law, including the United \n        Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a coastal state has \n        sovereign rights for the purpose of exploiting, conserving, and \n        managing the living marine resources in its navigable waters \n        and exclusive economic zone, including the sovereign right for \n        its citizens to harvest and process the entire allowable catch \n        within its exclusive economic zone if they have sufficient \n        capacity;\n            (6) the United States must have a meaningful and \n        enforceable standard of ownership and control for United States \n        flag vessels employed in the fisheries of the United States in \n        order to ensure that citizens of the United States are given \n        first priority in the harvesting and processing of the \n        allowable catch in the exclusive economic zone of the United \n        States;\n            (7) consistent with customary international law, the \n        Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act allows \n        fishing vessels of other nations to harvest or process the \n        portion of the allowable catch within the exclusive economic \n        zone of the United States that United States flag fishing \n        vessels do not have the capacity to harvest or process; and\n            (8) fishing vessels greater than 165 feet in registered \n        length, of more than 750 gross registered tons, or that have \n        engines capable of producing a total of more than 3,000 shaft \n        horsepower, including factory trawlers and other trawlers that \n        exceed these measurements--\n                    (A) are less likely than smaller, less powerful \n                vessels with smaller gear to avoid bycatch and minimize \n                the mortality of bycatch that cannot be avoided;\n                    (B) have been a cause of overfishing in fisheries \n                both within the navigable waters and exclusive economic \n                zone of the United States and elsewhere throughout the \n                world; and\n                    (C) are more likely to be owned by investors and \n                under pressure to produce profits at the expense of the \n                long-term health of fishery resources.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) establish a meaningful and enforceable standard of \n        United States citizen ownership and control for United States \n        flag vessels employed in the fisheries in the navigable water \n        and exclusive economic zone of the United States;\n            (2) revoke existing fishery endorsements within a \n        reasonable period of time and prohibit the issuance of new \n        fishery endorsements for United States flag vessels that do not \n        meet this standard;\n            (3) begin to phase out the use of fishing vessels greater \n        than 165 feet in registered length, of more than 750 gross \n        registered tons, or that have engines capable of producing a \n        total of more than 3,000 shaft horsepower in the navigable \n        waters and exclusive economic zone of the United States by \n        prohibiting the issuance of new fishery endorsements to vessels \n        which exceed these limits;\n            (4) place a capacity reduction burden on the fishing \n        vessels that came through the loophole created by the \n        misinterpretation of section 4(a)(4) of the Commercial Fishing \n        Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act; and\n            (5) prohibit Federal loan guarantees for the construction \n        of new fishing vessels greater than 165 feet in registered \n        length, of more than 750 gross registered tons, or that have \n        engines capable of producing a total of more than 3,000 shaft \n        horsepower, or for the rebuilding or improvement of existing \n        vessels which would result in a fishing vessel which exceeds \n        these limits.\n\nSEC. 102. STANDARD OF OWNERSHIP.\n\n    (a) Clarification of Documentation Standard.--Section 12102(a) of \ntitle 46, United States Code, is amended in paragraph (4) by striking \n``president or other chief executive officer'' and inserting in lieu \nthereof ``chief executive officer, by whatever title,''.\n    (b) Standard for Fishery Endorsements.--Section 12102(c) of title \n46, United States Code, is amended to read as follows--\n    ``(c)(1) A vessel owned by a corporation, partnership, association, \ntrust, joint venture, or other entity is not eligible for a fishery \nendorsement under section 12108 of this title unless at least 75 per \ncentum of the controlling interest in such entity, in the aggregate, is \nowned by citizens of the United States.\n    ``(2) The Secretary shall apply section 2(c) of the Shipping Act, \n1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 802(c)) in determining under this subsection \nwhether at least 75 per centum of the controlling interest in an entity \nis owned by citizens of the United States.''.\n    (c) Effective Date for Vessels Which Meet Current Standard.--A \nvessel owned by an entity which satisfies the controlling interest \nrequirements of section 12102(c) of title 46, United States Code, as \nthat section was in effect prior to the amendments made by this Act, \nand for which a fishery endorsement was in effect on September 25, \n1997, shall not be required to comply with paragraphs (1) and (2) of \nsection 12102(c) of title 46, United States Code, as amended by this \nAct, until the date that is eighteen months from the date of the \nenactment of this Act, provided such entity does not, prior to such \ncompliance date, fail to satisfy the controlling interest requirements \nof section 12102(c) of title 46, United States Code, as that section \nwas in effect prior to the amendments made by this Act.\n\nSEC. 103. ENFORCEMENT OF STANDARD.\n\n    (a) Maritime Administration.--(1) To demonstrate compliance with \nsection 12102(c) of title 46, United States Code, as amended by this \nAct, with respect to vessels of more than 100 gross registered tons, an \naffidavit of United States citizenship setting forth all relevant facts \nregarding vessel ownership and control by citizens of the United States \nshall be filed with the Administrator of the Maritime Administration on \nan annual basis. Regulations to implement this paragraph shall conform \nto the extent practicable with the regulations establishing the form of \ncitizenship affidavit set forth in part 355 of title 46, Code of \nFederal Regulations, as in effect on September 25, 1997.\n    (2) Transfers of ownership and control shall be rigorously \nscrutinized by the Administrator, with particular attention given to \nleases, charters, mortgages, financing, or other arrangements involving \nother than the purchase over extended periods of time of all, or \nsubstantially all, of the living marine resources harvested by a \nfishing vessel. Regulations to implement this paragraph shall prohibit \nimpermissible transfers of ownership or control.\n    (3) The Administrator, on a regular basis, shall provide the \nCommandant of the United States Coast Guard with a list of, and \nrelevant information about, all vessels that the Administrator \ndetermines meet the requirements of section 12102(c) of title 46, \nUnited States Code, as amended by this Act.\n    (b) Coast Guard.--The Secretary of Transportation shall establish \nsuch requirements as are reasonable and necessary to demonstrate \ncompliance with section 12102(c) of title 46, United States Code, as \namended by this Act, with respect to vessels of less than or equal to \n100 gross registered tons.\n    (c) Endorsements Revoked.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \nrevoke the fishery endorsement of--\n            (1) any vessel of less than or equal to 100 gross \n        registered tons that does not demonstrate compliance under \n        subsection (b) with section 12102(c) of title 46, United States \n        Code; and\n            (2) any vessel of more than 100 gross registered tons that \n        is not identified on the list provided by the Administrator \n        under subsection (a)(4) as meeting the requirements of section \n        12102(c) of title 46, United States Code.\n    (d) Regulations.--Regulations to implement this section shall be \npromulgated within 6 months of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be \nappropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions \nof this Act.\n    (f) Penalty.--Section 12122 of title 46, United States Code, is \namended by inserting at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) In addition to penalties under subsections (a) and (b), the \nowner of a documented vessel for which a fishery endorsement has been \nissued is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of \nup to $100,000 for each day in which such vessel has engaged in fishing \n(as such term is defined in section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802)) within the navigable \nwaters or exclusive economic zone of the United States, if the owner or \nthe representative or agent of the owner knowingly falsified or \nconcealed a material fact, or knowingly make a false statement or \nrepresentation with respect to the eligibility of the vessel under \nsection 12102(c) in applying for such fishery endorsement.''.\n    (g) Review of Transfers.--Section 9(c)(1) of the Shipping Act, 1916 \n(46 U.S.C. 808(c)(1)) is amended by striking ``in a vessel that has \nbeen operated only as a fishing vessel, fish processing vessel, or fish \ntender vessel (as defined in section 2101 of title 46, United States \nCode) or''.\n\n                TITLE II--ANTI-REFLAGGING ACT EXCEPTIONS\n\nSEC. 201.
