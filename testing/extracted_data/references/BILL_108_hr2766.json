FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Certain National Forest System lands near Empire, \n        Colorado, are needed by the city of Golden, Colorado, to \n        facilitate the construction of a water pipeline to transport \n        domestic water supplies into storage for the city and its \n        residents.\n            (2) Such National Forest System lands, comprising \n        approximately 9.84 acres in total, are of limited utility for \n        public administration or recreation and other use by virtue of \n        their largely steep terrain, irregular boundary, and lack of \n        easy public access.\n            (3) The city of Golden owns, or has an option to purchase, \n        several parcels of non-Federal land comprising a total of \n        approximately 141 acres near Evergreen and Argentine Pass, \n        Colorado, which it is willing to convey to the United States \n        for addition to the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests.\n            (4) The non-Federal lands owned or optioned by the city of \n        Golden, if conveyed to the United States, will eliminate \n        inholdings in the National Forest System, result in \n        administrative cost savings to the United States by reducing \n        costs of forest boundary administration, and provide the United \n        States with environmental and public recreational use benefits \n        (including enhanced Federal land ownership along the \n        Continental Divide National Scenic Trail) that greatly exceed \n        the benefits of the Federal land the United States will convey \n        in exchange.\n            (5) It is in the public interest to authorize, direct, \n        expedite, and facilitate completion of a land exchange \n        involving these Federal and non-Federal lands to assist the \n        city of Golden in providing additional water to its residents \n        and to acquire valuable non-Federal lands for permanent public \n        use and enjoyment.\n\nSEC. 3. LAND EXCHANGE, ARAPAHO AND ROOSEVELT NATIONAL FORESTS, \n              COLORADO.\n\n    (a) Conveyance by the City of Golden.--\n            (1) Lands described.--The land exchange directed by this \n        section shall proceed if, within 30 days after the date of the \n        enactment of this Act, the city of Golden, Colorado (in the \n        section referred to as the ``City''), offers to convey title \n        acceptable to the United States to the following non-Federal \n        lands:\n                    (A) Certain lands located near the community of \n                Evergreen in Park County, Colorado, comprising \n                approximately 80 acres, as generally depicted on a map \n                entitled ``Non-Federal Lands--Cub Creek Parcel'', dated \n                June, 2003.\n                    (B) Certain lands located near Argentine Pass in \n                Clear Creek and Summit Counties, Colorado, comprising \n                approximately 55.909 acres in 14 patented mining \n                claims, as generally depicted on a map entitled \n                ``Argentine Pass/Continental Divide Trail Lands'', \n                dated September 2003.\n            (2) Conditions of conveyance.--The conveyance of lands \n        under paragraph (1) to the United States shall be subject to \n        the absolute right of the City to permanently enter upon, \n        utilize, and occupy so much of the surface and subsurface of \n        the lands as may be reasonably necessary to access, maintain, \n        repair, modify, make improvements in, or otherwise utilize the \n        Vidler Tunnel to the same extent that the City would have had \n        such right if the lands had not been conveyed to the United \n        States and remained in City ownership. The exercise of such \n        right shall not require the City to secure any permit or other \n        advance approval from the United States.
