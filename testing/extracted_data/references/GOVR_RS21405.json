    "content": "Congress, usually through a declaration of war, has often been the first governmental authority to designate the beginning date of a war or armed conflict. The President, or executive branch officials responsible to him, through proclamation, or Congress, through legislation, has been responsible for designating the war's termination date. In some cases, later legislation is enacted to extend these beginning and ending dates for the purpose of broadening eligibility for veterans' benefits. This report notes the variations in the dates cited in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) \"periods of war\" and those dates given in the declarations of war beginning and the proclamations, laws, or treaties terminating such conflicts. Adding to the confusion, during World War II, wars were declared and terminated with six individual combatant countries. Moreover, armistice dates are also often confused with termination dates. Title 38, Part 3, Section 3.2 of the Code of Federal Regulations , dealing with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), lists official beginning and termination dates for most war periods from the Indian Wars to the present to be used in determining the availability of veterans' benefits. The material below summarizes these dates. Where applicable, a summary of the Department of Veterans Affairs official beginning and termination dates is provided followed by a citation to the lettered C.F.R. section. For some entries, this initial summary is followed by an explanatory note or declaration, armistice, cease-fire, or termination dates cited by other official sources. Also included are dates for the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. January 1, 1817, through December 31, 1898, inclusive. Service must have been rendered with U.S. military forces against Indian tribes or nations. Code of Federal Regulations , 3.2 (a). April 21, 1898, through July 4, 1902, inclusive.

For more information, see CRS Report R42324, Who Is a \"Veteran\"?\u2014Basic Eligibility for Veterans' Benefits , by Scott D. Szymendera, and CRS Report RL31133, Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications , by Jennifer K. Elsea and Matthew C. Weed. August 2, 1990, through April 6, 1991, when Iraq officially accepted cease-fire terms. Congress passed H.J.Res. 77 , Authorizing the Use of Military Force Against Iraq, the same day it was introduced (January 12, 1991), and it was signed by the President on January 14, 1991 ( P.L. 102-1 ).

Trump issued a Notice to Congress, \"to continue in effect beyond May 22, 2018, for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq declared in Executive Order13303.\" Shortly after the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush called on Afghanistan's leaders to hand over Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders and close their terrorist training camps. He also demanded the return of all detained foreign nationals and the opening of terrorist training sites to inspection. These demands were rejected. The Administration sought international support from the United Nations (U.N.) for military action against Afghanistan. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1368 of September 12, 2001, stated that the Council \"Expresses its readiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 ... \" This resolution was interpreted by many as U.N. authorization for military action in response to the 9/11 attacks. As a result, Congress passed S.J.Res. 23 , \"Authorization for Use of Military Force,\" on September 14, 2001. This bill was signed by President George W. Bush on September 18, 2001, as P.L. 107-40 , and it authorized the President to use \"all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.... \" Operations in the region began with U.S. military forces deployed to the region on October 7, 2001. Operations began with U.S. military forces deployed to Afghanistan to combat terrorism on October 7, 2001, and designated Operation Enduring Freedom. On March 27, 2009, President Barack Obama announced a new strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan and ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops that had been previously requested by General David McKiernan. In President Obama's \"Address to the Nation on the Way Forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan\" at West Point on December 1, 2009, he stated that \"it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan.\"  On June 22, 2011, President Obama again addressed the American people about the way forward in Afghanistan: \"We will begin the drawdown of U.S. troops from a position of strength. We have exceeded our expectations on our core goal of defeating al-Qaeda killing 20 of its top 30 leaders, including Osama bin Laden. We have broken the Taliban's momentum, and trained over 100,000 Afghan National Security Forces.\" As a result, U.S. forces began the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from Afghanistan.  On December 28, 2014, after 13 years of combat operations, President Obama and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced the end of OEF, a conflict that claimed the lives of more than 2,200 American troops, and the beginning of a follow-on mission on January 1, 2015. A transition ceremony was held at the International Security and Assistance Force headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan, attended by U.S. commanders and allied troops from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For more information, see CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Post-Taliban Governance, Security, and U.S. Policy , by Kenneth Katzman and Clayton Thomas.  Effective January 1, 2015, Secretary of Defense Hagel announced that the U.S. mission in Afghanistan would focus on training, advising, and assisting Afghan security forces and designated it as Operation Freedom's Sentinel. During 2015, approximately 13,000 troops, with nearly 10,000 from the United States, were deployed alongside NATO's 28 member nations and 13 partner nations for its Resolute Support Mission (RSM). RSM focused on training, advising, and assisting (TAA) the Afghan Security Institutions (ASI) and the Afghan National Defense & Security Forces (ANDSF) in order to build their capabilities and long-term sustainability. On October 1, 2015, General John F. Campbell, commander, RSM, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan/ISAF, defined the U.S. military's objectives: \"U.S. forces are now carrying out two well-defined missions: a Counter-Terrorism (CT) mission against the remnants of Al-Qaeda and the Resolute Support TAA mission in support of Afghan security forces. Our CT and TAA efforts are concurrent and complementary. While we continue to attack the remnants of Al-Qaeda, we are also building the ANDSF so that they can secure the Afghan people, win the peace, and contribute to stability throughout the region.\" On October 15, 2015, President Obama announced that the posture of 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan would remain through 2016. By the end of 2016, 5,500 troops were expected to remain in Afghanistan to support the U.S. embassy in Kabul and at bases in Bagram, Jalalabad, and Kandahar to train Afghans and focus on counterterrorism operations in the region.  On August 21, 2017, President Donald Trump announced his strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia in a speech at Fort Myer, VA. He stated, \"In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America's interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.\" On September 2, 2018, Army General John M. Nicholson passed command of NATO's Resolute Support Mission and U.S. Forces Afghanistan to Army General Austin S. Miller during a ceremony in Kabul, Afghanistan. General Miller emphasized to coalition troops that what they are doing in Afghanistan makes their own countries and citizens safer. The \"train, advise, assist\" mission allows Afghan security forces to take the fight to the enemy, and to give the Afghan government the security needed to provide stability and no longer a safe haven for terrorists. See CRS Report R44853, Additional Troops for Afghanistan? Considerations for Congress , by Kathleen J. McInnis and Andrew Feickert, for more information. In mid-2002, the George W. Bush Administration began deploying U.S. troops to Kuwait. During the 107 th Congress (2001-2002), Congress debated whether to send U.S. troops to Iraq, and on October 16, 2002, H.J.Res. 114 was signed into law as P.L. 107-243 , Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. This law authorized the President to use military force to \"defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq\" and \"to enforce all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions against Iraq.\" On November 8, 2002, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1441. This resolution found Iraq in breach of past U.N. resolutions prohibiting stockpiling and importing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). The Hussein government in Iraq continued to be uncooperative with U.N. investigators, which heightened the situation through spring 2003.  In an address to the nation on March 17, 2003, President George W. Bush gave Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his sons a 48-hour ultimatum to leave Iraq. On March 19, 2003, President Bush announced to the nation that the early stages of military operations against Iraq had begun and designated them Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  On May 1, 2003, in an address to the nation, President Bush declared that \"major military combat actions in Iraq have ended,\" yet U.S. troops remained in Iraq. A ceremony at Camp Victory in Baghdad on January 1, 2010, marked the end of the Multinational Forces-Iraq (MNF-I) and the beginning of United States Forces-Iraq (USF-I), which merged five major command groups into one single headquarters command. As General David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), noted, \"This ceremony marks another significant transition here in Iraq. It represents another important milestone in the continued drawdown of American Forces.\" Troops from 30 countries have served in MNF-I since 2003. On August 31, 2010, President Obama announced that the American combat mission in Iraq had ended. A transitional force of U.S. troops remained in Iraq with a different mission: advising and assisting Iraq's security forces, supporting Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting U.S. civilians.  Effective September 1, 2010, the military operations in Iraq acquired a new official designation: Operation New Dawn. A short ceremony marked the transfer in which Army General Ray Odierno passed command of USF-I to Army General Lloyd J. Austin. On December 15, 2011, U.S. Armed Forces in Baghdad marked the official end of the war in Iraq. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other top U.S. military leaders observed the official end of U.S. Forces Iraq's mission after nearly nine years of conflict that claimed the lives of nearly 4,500 U.S. troops. On the military side of Baghdad International Airport, Army General Martin E. Dempsey, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, Army General Lloyd J. Austin III, commanding general of U.S. Forces Iraq, and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq James F. Jeffrey addressed U.S. and Iraqi officials and more than 150 troops and media from around the world.  For more information, see CRS Report R45025, Iraq: Background and U.S. Policy , by Christopher M. Blanchard, and CRS In Focus IF10404, Iraq and U.S. Policy , by Christopher M. Blanchard.  Effective October 15, 2014, the DOD designated U.S. and coalition operations \"Operation Inherent Resolve\" against the terrorist group the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, another name for the Islamic State) along the Syrian-Iraqi border. The commander of U.S. 3 rd Army and Army Forces Central Command was designated the commander of the Combined Joint Task Force\u2013Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) on October 17, 2014. Airstrikes by U.S. and coalition forces continue. As of June 30, 2017, the total cost of operations related to ISIS since kinetic operations started on August 8, 2014, is $14.3 billion and the average daily cost is $13.6 million for 1,058 days of operations.
