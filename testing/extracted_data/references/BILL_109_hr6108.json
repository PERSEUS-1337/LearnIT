FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Following the human suffering and devastation caused by \n        Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, the Federal Government and State \n        and local governments have responded to public concerns about \n        flood safety by increasing resources to improve flood \n        protection measures in communities throughout the United \n        States.\n            (2) In the year since these disasters, the Federal \n        Government has  directed $7,000,000,000 in emergency \n        supplemental spending to restoring and strengthening hurricane \n        protection in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast as well as \n        $1,900,000,000 from the  annual budget  of the   U.S. Army \n        Corps of Engineers  for  flood control and hurricane protection \n        measures across the Nation.\n            (3) While improving this infrastructure is essential to a \n        comprehensive approach to flood protection, communities must be \n        encouraged to better assess their flood risk and better inform \n        the public about the importance of maintaining flood insurance \n        protection.\n            (4) To reduce the flood risk to communities in the United \n        States, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) must be \n        solvent and more effective.\n            (5) To achieve these goals, the Federal Emergency \n        Management Agency (FEMA), which administers the NFIP, should \n        work with communities to communicate directly with the people \n        who live and work in the Nation's floodplains on issues \n        concerning flood risk and flood protection.\n            (6) More than 20,000 communities currently participate in \n        the NFIP and nearly all of these communities have properties \n        that are located in special flood hazard areas--areas in which \n        Federal law requires that property owners purchase flood \n        insurance coverage before they can obtain a mortgage loan from \n        a federally regulated lender.\n            (7) Despite this mandatory purchase requirement, a FEMA-\n        commissioned study by the RAND Corporation found that 20 to 25 \n        percent of property owners in special flood hazard areas who \n        have a mortgage from a federally regulated lender and are \n        required to purchase flood insurance do not carry a policy.\n            (8) In the next few years, the number of communities that \n        participate in the NFIP will increase, as FEMA's flood map \n        modernization program reassesses the flood risk to communities \n        throughout the Nation.\n            (9) As the map modernization program brings new communities \n        under the flood insurance mandatory purchase requirement, FEMA \n        should partner with these communities to educate property \n        owners, business owners, and property renters about the nature \n        of the flood risk in their area and the importance of \n        maintaining flood insurance protection.\n            (10) In addition to improving public awareness of flood \n        risk and flood insurance, many communities that undertake \n        outreach activities can qualify for reduced flood insurance \n        premiums under the NFIP's community rating system program.\n            (11) Flood risk is not limited to properties that are \n        located in special flood hazard areas, and many properties that \n        are no longer subject to the mandatory purchase requirement \n        remain at risk of flooding, especially in areas that are \n        protected by levees.\n            (12) FEMA estimates that between 20 and 25 percent of all \n        claims paid by the NFIP are for claims on properties located \n        outside of these special flood hazard areas.\n            (13) Thus, a property's release from the Federal flood \n        insurance purchase requirement does not mean that the property \n        is no longer subject to risk of flooding.\n            (14) In communities where properties have been released \n        from this Federal requirement, outreach activities can help to \n        educate the public about the importance of voluntarily \n        maintaining flood insurance coverage, including the potential \n        availability of low-cost preferred risk policies.\n            (15) Many property owners who own a home or building that \n        is located in an area that is subject to moderate-to-low risk \n        of flooding are unaware that they may qualify for the low-cost, \n        preferred risk flood insurance--a product of the NFIP.\n            (16) By partnering with local flood control authorities, \n        FEMA can better promote flood safety and flood insurance and, \n        in communities with properties that are no longer subject to \n        the mandatory purchase requirement, retain a higher number of \n        NFIP policies.\n            (17) Reducing the number of uninsured property owners in \n        communities that are subject to flood risk will reduce the \n        fiscal effects of a flood disaster to both property owners and \n        the Federal Government.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a flood \ninsurance outreach and education grants program that provides resources \nto communities for educating property owners and renters on flood \ninsurance options while strengthening the national flood insurance \nprogram.\n\nSEC. 3.
