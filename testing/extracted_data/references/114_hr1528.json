FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress has prohibited economic protectionism by State \n        and local governments that unduly burden or discriminate \n        against interstate commerce and transportation under the \n        authority granted by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution by \n        enacting laws such as the Railroad Revitalization and \n        Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, \n        the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, and the Airport and \n        Airway Improvement Act of 1982.\n            (2) In Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824), a case \n        challenging the exclusive right of navigating the waters of New \n        York granted by that State, the Supreme Court affirmed that it \n        is the sole right of Congress to regulate commerce between the \n        States under what Chief Justice John Marshall recognized as the \n        dormant Commerce Clause.\n            (3) Since 1990, over 100 discriminatory taxes have been \n        imposed by State and local governments on motor vehicle rentals \n        in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prohibit prospectively, \nand provide a remedy for, tax discrimination by a State or Locality \nagainst the rental of motor vehicles.\n\nSEC. 3.
