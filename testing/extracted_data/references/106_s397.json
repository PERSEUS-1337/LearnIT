    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Materials Corridor and \nUnited States-Mexico Border Technology Partnership Act of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the 2,000 mile long United States-Mexico border region, \n        extending 100 kilometers north and south of the international \n        boundary, has undergone rapid economic growth that has provided \n        economic opportunity to millions of people;\n            (2) the border region's rapid economic growth has \n        unfortunately created serious problems including pollution, \n        hazardous wastes, and the inefficient use of resources that \n        threaten people's health and the prospects for long-term \n        economic growth in the region;\n            (3) there are a significant number of major institutions in \n        the border States of both countries currently conducting \n        research, development and testing activities in technologies \n        that might help alleviate these problems;\n            (4)(A) these new technologies may provide major \n        opportunities for significantly--\n                    (i) minimizing industrial wastes and pollution that \n                may pose a threat to public health;\n                    (ii) reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants;\n                    (iii) using recycled natural resources as primary \n                materials for industrial production; and\n                    (iv) improving energy efficiency; and\n            (B) such advances will directly benefit both sides of the \n        United States-Mexico border by encouraging energy efficient, \n        environmentally sound economic development that improves the \n        health and protects the natural resources of the border region;\n            (5) in August 1998, the binational United States-Mexico \n        Border Region Hazardous Wastes Forum, organized by the \n        Department of Energy's Carlsbad Area Office, resulted in a \n        consensus of experts from the United States and Mexico that the \n        Department of Energy's science and technology could be \n        leveraged to address key environmental issues in the border \n        region while fostering further economic development of the \n        border region;\n            (6) the Carlsbad Area Office, which manages the Waste \n        Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico, is well suited \n        to lead a multiagency program focused on the problems of the \n        border region given its significant expertise in hazardous \n        materials and location near the border;\n            (7)(A) promoting clean materials industries in the border \n        region that are energy efficient has been identified as a high \n        priority issue by the United States-Mexico Foundation for \n        Science Cooperation; and\n            (B) at the 1998 discussions of the United States-Mexico \n        Binational Commission, Mexico formally proposed joint funding \n        of a ``Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative'', proposing \n        $1,000,000 to implement the Initiative if matched by the United \n        States;\n            (8) recognizing the importance of materials processing, \n        research institutions in the border States of both the United \n        States and Mexico, in conjunction with private sector partners \n        of both nations, and with strong endorsement from the \n        Government of Mexico, in 1998 organized the Materials Corridor \n        Council to implement a cooperative program of materials \n        research and development, education and training, and \n        sustainable industrial development as part of the Materials \n        Corridor Partnership Initiative; and\n            (9) successful implementation of this Act would advance \n        important United States energy, environmental, and economic \n        goals not only in the United States-Mexico border region but \n        also serve as a model for similar collaborative, transnational \n        initiatives in other regions of the world.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a multiagency program to--\n            (1) alleviate the problems caused by rapid economic \n        development along the United States-Mexico border;\n            (2) support the Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative \n        referred to in section 2(7); and\n            (3) promote energy efficient, environmentally sound \n        economic development along that border through the development \n        and use of new technologies, particularly hazardous waste and \n        materials technologies.\n\nSEC. 4.
