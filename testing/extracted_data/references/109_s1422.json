FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) In July 1999, the Public Health Service and the \n        American Academy of Pediatrics issued a joint statement, which \n        was later endorsed by the American Academy of Family \n        Physicians, proclaiming: ``[The] Public Health Service, the \n        American Academy of Pediatrics, and vaccine manufacturers agree \n        that thimerosal-containing vaccines should be removed as soon \n        as possible. Similar conclusions were reached this year in a \n        meeting attended by European regulatory agencies, the European \n        vaccine manufacturers, and the US FDA which examined the use of \n        thimerosal-containing vaccines produced or sold in European \n        countries.''.\n            (2) In July 2000, the Public Health Service, the Advisory \n        Commission on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of \n        Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians \n        issued a joint statement, providing: ``The AAFP, [the] AAP, and \n        the PHS in consultation with the ACIP reaffirm the goal set in \n        July 1999 to remove or greatly reduce thimerosal from vaccines \n        as soon as possible for the following reasons: 1) the removal \n        or substantial reduction of thimerosal from vaccines is \n        feasible, 2) the progress in removal which has been made to \n        date is substantial, 3) the discussions between the Food and \n        Drug Administration and the vaccine manufacturers in removing \n        thimerosal are ongoing, and 4) the public concern about the use \n        of mercury of any sort remains high. Based on information from \n        the FDA and manufacturers, the PHS projects that the United \n        States will complete its transition to a secure routine \n        pediatric vaccine supply free of thimerosal as a preservative \n        (i.e. at least two vaccine products each for Hep B, Hib, and \n        DTaP) by the first quarter of 2001.''.\n            (3) The Institute of Medicine's Immunization Review \n        Committee concluded that significant reasons existed for \n        continued public health attention to concerns about thimerosal \n        exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders and recommended the \n        removal of thimerosal from vaccines administered to children \n        and pregnant women.\n            (4) Federal regulatory agencies and manufacturers have \n        taken positive steps to remove thimerosal from some medical \n        products, most notably routinely administered childhood \n        vaccines.\n            (5) Considerable progress has been made in reducing mercury \n        exposures from childhood vaccines, yet 5 years after the July \n        1999 statement, thimerosal remains in several nonroutinely \n        administered childhood vaccines and many pediatric and adult \n        influenza vaccines.\n            (6) There is no law or regulation to prohibit the \n        reintroduction of thimerosal into any products from which it \n        has been removed, leaving open the possibility that it may be \n        reintroduced at some point in the future in new vaccines or \n        vaccines from which it has already been removed.\n            (7) The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that \n        as many as 1 in 6 infants are born with a blood mercury level \n        that exceeds the Agency's safety threshold.\n            (8) Cumulative exposures to mercury, a neurotoxin, are \n        known to cause harm, particularly in young children and \n        pregnant women.\n            (9) Taking steps to reduce mercury exposures through \n        vaccines is an important way to reduce direct exposures to \n        mercury and mercury compounds.\n\nSEC. 3. BANNED MERCURY-CONTAINING VACCINES.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--Section 501 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351) is amended by adding at the end the \nfollowing:\n    ``(j) If it is a banned mercury-containing vaccine under section \n351B of the Public Health Service Act.''.\n    (b) Amendment to PHSA.--Title III of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 351A the \nfollowing:\n\n``SEC. 351B.
