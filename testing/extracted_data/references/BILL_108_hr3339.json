ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS.\n\n    (a) Contracts Authorized.--The Secretary of Defense may enter into \nan energy savings performance contract under this section for the sole \npurpose of achieving energy savings and benefits ancillary to that \npurpose. The Secretary may incur obligations under the contract to \nfinance energy conservation measures so long as guaranteed savings \nexceed the debt service requirements.\n    (b) Terms and Conditions.--\n            (1) Contract period.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n        of law, an energy savings performance contract may be for a \n        period of up to 25 years beginning on the date on which the \n        first payment is made by the Secretary pursuant to the \n        contract. The contract need not include funding of cancellation \n        charges (if any) before cancellation, if--\n                    (A) the contract was awarded in a competitive \n                manner, using procedures and methods established under \n                this section;\n                    (B) the Secretary determines that funds are \n                available and adequate for payment of the costs of the \n                contract for the first fiscal year;\n                    (C) the contract is governed by part 17.1 of the \n                Federal Acquisition Regulation; and\n                    (D) if the contract contains a clause setting forth \n                a cancellation ceiling in excess $10,000,000, the \n                Secretary provides notice to Congress of the proposed \n                contract and the proposed cancellation ceiling at least \n                30 days before the award of the contract.\n            (2) Costs and savings.--An energy savings performance \n        contract shall require the contractor to incur the costs of \n        implementing energy savings measures, including at least the \n        cost (if any) incurred in making energy audits, acquiring and \n        installing equipment, and training personnel, in exchange for a \n        share of any energy savings directly resulting from \n        implementation of such measures during the term of the \n        contract.\n            (3) Other terms and conditions.--An energy savings \n        performance contract shall require an annual energy audit and \n        specify the terms and conditions of any Government payments and \n        performance guarantees.

The contract shall provide for a guarantee \nof savings to the Department, and shall establish payment schedules \nreflecting such guarantee, taking into account any capital costs under \nthe contract.\n    (d) Rulemaking.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \nenactment of this section, the Secretary, with the concurrence of the \nFederal Acquisition Regulatory Council, shall issue final rules to \nestablish the procedures and methods for use by the Department of \nDefense to select, monitor, and terminate energy savings performance \ncontracts in accordance with laws governing Federal procurement that \nwill achieve the intent of this section in a cost-effective manner. In \ndeveloping such procedures and methods, the Secretary, with the \nconcurrence of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, shall \ndetermine which existing regulations are inconsistent with the intent \nof this section and shall formulate substitute regulations consistent \nwith laws governing Federal procurement.\n    (e) Implementation Procedures and Methods.--The procedures and \nmethods established by rule under subsection (d) shall--\n            (1) provide for the calculation of energy savings based on \n        sound engineering and financial practices;\n            (2) allow the Secretary to request statements of \n        qualifications, which shall, at a minimum, include prior \n        experience and capabilities of contractors to perform the \n        proposed types of energy savings services and financial and \n        performance information, from firms engaged in providing energy \n        savings services;\n            (3) allow the Secretary to presume that a contractor meets \n        the requirements of paragraph (2) if the contractor either--\n                    (A) has carried out contracts with a value of at \n                least $1,000,000,000 with the Federal Government over \n                the previous 10 years; or\n                    (B) is listed by a Federal agency pursuant to \n                section 801(b)(2) of the National Energy Policy Act (42 \n                U.S.C. 8287(b)(2));\n            (4) allow the Secretary to, from the statements received, \n        designate and prepare a list, with an update at least annually, \n        of those firms that are qualified to provide energy savings \n        services;\n            (5) allow the Secretary to select firms from such list to \n        conduct discussions concerning a particular proposed energy \n        savings project, including requesting a technical and price \n        proposal from such selected firms for such project;\n            (6) allow the Secretary to select from such firms the most \n        qualified firm to provide energy savings services based on \n        technical and price proposals and any other relevant \n        information\n            (7) allow the Secretary to permit receipt of unsolicited \n        proposals for energy savings performance contracting services \n        from a firm that the Department of Defense has determined is \n        qualified to provide such services under the procedures \n        established pursuant to subsection (d) and require facility \n        managers to place a notice in the Commerce Business Daily \n        announcing they have received such a proposal and invite other \n        similarly qualified firms to submit competing proposals;\n            (8) allow the Secretary to enter into an energy savings \n        performance contract with a firm qualified under paragraph (7), \n        consistent with the procedures and methods established pursuant \n        to subsection (d); and\n            (9) allow a firm not designated as qualified to provide \n        energy savings services under paragraph (4) to request a review \n        of such decision to be conducted in accordance with procedures, \n        substantially equivalent to procedures established under \n        section 759(f) of title 40, United States Code, to be developed \n        by the board of contract appeals of the General Services \n        Administration.\n    (f) Transition Rule for Energy Savings Performance Contracts Under \nNational Energy Conservation Policy Act.--In the case of an energy \nsavings performance contract entered into by the Secretary or the \nSecretary of Energy pursuant to the authority granted by section 801 of \nthe National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287), the \nSecretary may maintain the contract under this section, making whatever \ncontract modifications as the Secretary determines are necessary to \nconform to the provisions of this subsection.\n    (g) Pilot Program for Nonbuilding Applications.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary may carry out a pilot \n        program to enter into up to 10 energy savings performance \n        contracts for the purpose of achieving energy savings, \n        secondary savings, and benefits incidental to those purposes, \n        in nonbuilding applications.\n            (2) Selection.--The Secretary shall select the contract \n        projects to demonstrate the applicability and benefits of \n        energy savings performance contracting to a range of non-\n        building applications.\n            (3) Report.--Not later than three years after the date of \n        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to \n        Congress a report on the progress and results of the pilot \n        program.
