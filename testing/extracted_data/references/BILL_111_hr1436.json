FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and unaccountability in \n        Federal programs undermines the confidence of the American \n        people in the Government and reduces the Federal Government's \n        ability to adequately address vital public needs;\n            (2) insufficient information on program performance \n        seriously disadvantages Federal managers in their efforts to \n        improve program efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability;\n            (3) congressional policy making, spending decisions, and \n        program oversight are handicapped by insufficient attention to \n        program performance and results;\n            (4) programs performing similar or duplicative functions \n        that exist within a single agency or across multiple agencies \n        should be identified and their performance and results shared \n        among all such programs to improve their performance and \n        results;\n            (5) advocates of good government continue to seek ways to \n        improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability; focus on \n        results; and integrate the performance of programs with \n        decisions about budgets;\n            (6) with the passage of the Government Performance and \n        Results Act of 1993, the Congress directed the executive branch \n        to seek improvements in the effectiveness, efficiency, and \n        accountability of Federal programs by having agencies focus on \n        program results; and\n            (7) the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n        provided a strong framework for the executive branch to monitor \n        the long-term goals and annual performance of its departments \n        and agencies.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING STRATEGIC AND PERFORMANCE PLANS OF \n              THE GOVERNMENT.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the President should establish a government-wide \n        strategic plan and a government-wide performance plan; and\n            (2) the head of each Federal agency should consult with the \n        committees with jurisdiction over the agency and other \n        interested members of Congress at the beginning of each \n        Congress regarding the performance plan of the agency (required \n        by section 1115 of title 31, United States Code).\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to improve the Government Performance and Results Act \n        of 1993 by implementing a program assessment and evaluation \n        process that attempts to determine the strengths and weaknesses \n        of Federal programs with a particular focus on the efficiency, \n        effectiveness, and accountability of Federal programs and to \n        identify programs that have missions or outcomes that are \n        duplicative;\n            (2) to use the information gathered in the assessment and \n        evaluation process to build on the groundwork laid in the \n        Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to help the \n        executive branch make informed management decisions and \n        results-based funding requests aimed at achieving positive \n        results;\n            (3) to provide congressional policy makers the information \n        needed to conduct more effective oversight, to make better-\n        informed authorization decisions, and to make more results-\n        based spending decisions that achieve positive results for the \n        American people;\n            (4) to encourage the wise expenditure of funds on the most \n        effective Federal programs in an effort to save money;\n            (5) to eliminate Federal programs subject to waste, fraud, \n        and abuse;\n            (6) to identify best practices in Federal programs for \n        allocating resources in an efficient and effective manner;\n            (7) to provide agencies with the information needed to \n        track low-performing programs; and\n            (8) to provide agencies with the information needed to \n        quickly respond to poor performance of agency programs.\n\nSEC. 5.
