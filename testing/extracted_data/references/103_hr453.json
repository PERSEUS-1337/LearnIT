STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) historically, Federal education programs have addressed \n        the Nation's most pressing educational problems by providing \n        categorical assistance with detailed requirements relating to \n        the use of funds;\n            (2) while the approach described in paragraph (1) has \n        proven generally successful, some program requirements may \n        inadvertently impede educational achievement;\n            (3) the Nation's schools and teachers are being asked to \n        deal effectively with increasingly diverse educational needs \n        that current program structures may not be flexible enough to \n        address;\n            (4) Federal mandates often limit teachers' ability to \n        respond to individual student needs; and\n            (5) in order for this Nation to effectively compete in the \n        global economy, it is crucial for the Federal Government to \n        support programs that--\n                    (A) result in improved educational achievement by \n                all students;\n                    (B) promote the coordination of education and \n                related services that benefit and support children and \n                their families;\n                    (C) enable teachers and schools to respond to the \n                needs of a diverse student population;\n                    (D) provide flexibility to teachers and schools by \n                eliminating unnecessary regulation; and\n                    (E) place an emphasis on program results rather \n                than on tracking resources.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to establish a \nnational demonstration program which--\n            (1) promotes improved educational achievement for all \n        students, especially those in affected programs, through \n        education reform;\n            (2) provides increased flexibility for schools and other \n        recipients in the use of Federal resources, in exchange for \n        greater accountability for achieving improved educational \n        performance;\n            (3) encourages collaboration among school and program \n        administrators, teachers, parents, local agencies, community \n        groups, and business leaders to develop more effective \n        educational programs that meet the needs of all students, \n        especially the disadvantaged, and those served by the affected \n        programs.\n\nSEC. 3. FLEXIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN EDUCATION AND RELATED \n              SERVICES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart 1 of Part C of the General Education \nProvisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.) is amended by adding after \nsection 421A a new section 421B to read as follows:\n\n   ``flexibility and accountability in education and related services\n\n    ``Sec. 421B.

The head of any other Federal agency who has granted \n        waivers under this section shall determine whether to extend or \n        terminate those waivers, but the Secretary shall have exclusive \n        authority to extend or terminate the project.\n    ``(b) Eligibility.--\n            ``(1) In general.--Each project that involves elementary of \n        secondary schools shall include the participation of a local \n        educational agency and at least two schools.\n            ``(2) Grade and program requirement.--To the extent \n        possible, each grade and academic program in a participating \n        school shall participate in the project.\n    ``(c) Applications.--A local educational agency, wishing to conduct \na project under this section, shall submit an application to the State \neducational agency for approval.
