    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Protection Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that--\n        (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services is \n    deterred by the potential for liability actions against them;\n        (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n    organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n    associations, social service agencies, educational institutions, \n    and other civic programs, have been adversely affected by the \n    withdrawal of volunteers from boards of directors and service in \n    other capacities;\n        (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities is \n    thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost programs \n    than would be obtainable if volunteers were participating;\n        (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n    effective social service programs, many of which are national in \n    scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and represent \n    some of the most successful public-private partnerships, protection \n    of volunteerism through clarification and limitation of the \n    personal liability risks assumed by the volunteer in connection \n    with such participation is an appropriate subject for Federal \n    legislation;\n        (5) services and goods provided by volunteers and nonprofit \n    organizations would often otherwise be provided by private entities \n    that operate in interstate commerce;\n        (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n    costs, volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher costs in \n    purchasing insurance, through interstate insurance markets, to \n    cover their activities; and\n        (7) clarifying and limiting the liability risk assumed by \n    volunteers is an appropriate subject for Federal legislation \n    because--\n            (A) of the national scope of the problems created by the \n        legitimate fears of volunteers about frivolous, arbitrary, or \n        capricious lawsuits;\n            (B) the citizens of the United States depend on, and the \n        Federal Government expends funds on, and provides tax \n        exemptions and other consideration to, numerous social programs \n        that depend on the services of volunteers;\n            (C) it is in the interest of the Federal Government to \n        encourage the continued operation of volunteer service \n        organizations and contributions of volunteers because the \n        Federal Government lacks the capacity to carry out all of the \n        services provided by such organizations and volunteers; and\n            (D)(i) liability reform for volunteers, will promote the \n        free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate \n        commerce and uphold constitutionally protected due process \n        rights; and\n            (ii) therefore, liability reform is an appropriate use of \n        the powers contained in article 1, section 8, clause 3 of the \n        United States Constitution, and the fourteenth amendment to the \n        United States Constitution.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the interests \nof social service program beneficiaries and taxpayers and to sustain \nthe availability of programs, nonprofit organizations, and governmental \nentities that depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws \nto provide certain protections from liability abuses related to \nvolunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental entities.\n\nSEC. 3. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n    (a) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of any State to the \nextent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act, except that this \nAct shall not preempt any State law that provides additional protection \nfrom liability relating to volunteers or to any category of volunteers \nin the performance of services for a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity.\n    (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This Act shall \nnot apply to any civil action in a State court against a volunteer in \nwhich all parties are citizens of the State if such State enacts a \nstatute in accordance with State requirements for enacting \nlegislation--\n        (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n        (2) declaring the election of such State that this Act shall \n    not apply, as of a date certain, to such civil action in the State; \n    and\n        (3) containing no other provisions.\n\nSEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n    (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as provided in \nsubsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity shall be liable for harm caused by an act or \nomission of the volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity if--\n        (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \n    volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n    governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n        (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n    licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate authorities \n    for the activities or practice in the State in which the harm \n    occurred, where the activities were or practice was undertaken \n    within the scope of the volunteer's responsibilities in the \n    nonprofit organization or governmental entity;\n        (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal misconduct, \n    gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant \n    indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed by \n    the volunteer; and\n        (4) the harm was not caused by the volunteer operating a motor \n    vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which the State \n    requires the operator or the owner of the vehicle, craft, or vessel \n    to--\n            (A) possess an operator's license; or\n            (B) maintain insurance.\n    (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers to Organizations and \nEntities.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any \ncivil action brought by any nonprofit organization or any governmental \nentity against any volunteer of such organization or entity.\n    (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization or Entity.--Nothing in \nthis section shall be construed to affect the liability of any \nnonprofit organization or governmental entity with respect to harm \ncaused to any person.\n    (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the laws of a \nState limit volunteer liability subject to one or more of the following \nconditions, such conditions shall not be construed as inconsistent with \nthis section:\n        (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \n    governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures, \n    including mandatory training of volunteers.\n        (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity liable \n    for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the same extent as \n    an employer is liable for the acts or omissions of its employees.\n        (3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n    inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of a \n    State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n        (4) A State law that makes a limitation of liability applicable \n    only if the nonprofit organization or governmental entity provides \n    a financially secure source of recovery for individuals who suffer \n    harm as a result of actions taken by a volunteer on behalf of the \n    organization or entity. A financially secure source of recovery may \n    be an insurance policy within specified limits, comparable coverage \n    from a risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n    arrangements that satisfy the State that the organization or entity \n    will be able to pay for losses up to a specified amount. Separate \n    standards for different types of liability exposure may be \n    specified.\n    (e) Limitation on Punitive Damages Based on the Actions of \nVolunteers.--\n        (1) General rule.--Punitive damages may not be awarded against \n    a volunteer in an action brought for harm based on the action of a \n    volunteer acting within the scope of the volunteer's \n    responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or governmental entity \n    unless the claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence \n    that the harm was proximately caused by an action of such volunteer \n    which constitutes willful or criminal misconduct, or a conscious, \n    flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual \n    harmed.\n        (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) does not create a cause of \n    action for punitive damages and does not preempt or supersede any \n    Federal or State law to the extent that such law would further \n    limit the award of punitive damages.\n    (f) Exceptions to Limitations on Liability.--\n        (1) In general.--The limitations on the liability of a \n    volunteer under this Act shall not apply to any misconduct that--\n            (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n        defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act \n        of international terrorism (as that term is defined in section \n        2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been convicted in \n        any court;\n            (B) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n        Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n            (C) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable \n        State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n        court;\n            (D) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been \n        found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law; or\n            (E) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n        determined pursuant to applicable State law) of intoxicating \n        alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.\n        (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n    construed to effect subsection (a)(3) or (e).\n\nSEC. 5.
