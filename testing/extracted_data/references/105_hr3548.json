    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Environmental Priorities Act of \n1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. RECAPTURE OF SAVINGS FROM RETAIL ELECTRICITY COMPETITION.\n\n    (a) Effective Date.--This Act shall take effect for a consumer \nsector in any State on January 1 of the first year after all State \nregulated electric utilities and all nonregulated electric utilities in \nthat State have been determined by the Secretary of Energy to have \nestablished retail electric service choice for customers in that \nsector, but not earlier than January 1, 2001. The Secretary shall \nannually review the laws and regulations of each State relating to \nretail electric service regulation and make such determinations on \nJanuary 1, 2001, and January 1 of each year thereafter.\n    (b) 10 Percent of Consumer Savings.--For each State, on December 31 \nof the first full calendar year following the effective date of this \nAct for any consumer sector in the State, and on December 31 of each \nsubsequent calendar year, each provider of retail electric services in \nthe State shall contribute to the fiscal agent for the Environmental \nPriorities Board established under section 2 an amount equal to 10 \npercent of the total consumer savings for that sector for that calendar \nyear.\n    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n            (1) Consumer savings.--For any provider of retail electric \n        services in a State, for any consumer sector in the State, the \n        term ``consumer savings'' means, for any calendar year, the \n        amount (if any) by which the potential rate for electric energy \n        provided by that provider to that sector exceeds the current \n        rate for that sector, multiplied by that sector's total \n        consumption (in kilowatt-hours) during that calendar year.\n            (2) Current rate.--For any provider of retail electric \n        services in a State, for any consumer sector in the State, the \n        term ``current rate'' means, for the 12 months following the \n        effective date of this Act for that sector in that State, the \n        average kilowatt-hour rate paid by customers of the provider in \n        that consumer sector in that State, as calculated by the \n        provider and recalculated annually.\n            (3) Potential rate.--\n                    (A) General rule.--For any provider of retail \n                electric services in a State, for any consumer sector \n                in the State, the term ``potential rate'' means, for \n                each calendar year following the effective date of this \n                Act for that sector in that State, the average \n                kilowatt-hour rate paid by the provider's customers in \n                that sector during the 12-month period preceding the \n                date on which retail electric service choice for \n                customers in that sector was established, adjusted for \n                inflation. The adjustment for inflation shall be made \n                using a methodology to be determined by the Secretary \n                of Energy. The Secretary of Energy shall recalculate \n                the potential rate annually to adjust it for inflation.\n                    (B) Special rules.--For all sectors not serviced by \n                the provider during any period, the average kilowatt-\n                hour rate for that sector shall be estimated or \n                measured by the Secretary of Energy. In any case where \n                retail choice in a State or sector did not all occur on \n                one effective date but was phased-in over time, the \n                Secretary of Energy shall establish regulations to \n                fairly establish the potential rate. In any cases \n                where, for the 12-month period preceding the date on \n                which retail electric service choice for customers in \n                that sector was established, a provider served a sector \n                in the State but did not serve it for the full period, \n                the Secretary of Energy shall establish regulations to \n                fairly establish the potential rate.\n\nSEC. 3. USE OF CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES.\n\n    (a) National Environmental Priorities Board.--The Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter in this section \nreferred to as the ``Administrator'') shall establish a National \nEnvironmental Priorities Board to carry out the functions and \nresponsibilities specified in this section. The Board shall be composed \nof 3 persons who are officers or employees of the United States, and 4 \nState commissioners nominated by the national organization of the State \ncommissions and appointed by the Administrator. The Administrator shall \nappoint one member of the Board to serve as Chairman.\n    (b) Rules.--Within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, the \nAdministrator shall promulgate a final rule containing the rules and \nprocedures of the Board, including the rules and procedures for \nselecting a non-Federal fiscal agent under subsection (e). The \nAdministrator shall have oversight responsibilities over the Board.\n    (c) Environmental Priorities Program.--(1) Within 90 days after the \npromulgation of the Administrator's rules under subsection (b), the \nBoard shall institute a proceeding to establish regulations governing \ncreation and administration of a Environmental Priorities Program. Such \nregulations shall include criteria and methods of selecting State \nprojects to receive support under the Program. Such support may include \ndirect loans, loan guarantees, grants, capitalization grants for State \nrevolving funds, and other assistance. The State projects may include--\n            (A) lowering borrowing costs for municipal and regional \n        governments constructing wastewater treatment plants;\n            (B) increasing the use of filter strips and riparian \n        buffers in protecting rivers and streams;\n            (C) mitigating the deleterious effect of electricity \n        production on air quality;\n            (D) supporting the preservation of open space for resource \n        conservation, wildlife protection, or recreation; and\n            (E) such other projects furthering national environmental \n        priorities as may be established by the Board.\n    (2) The Board shall enter into arrangements with a non-Federal \nfiscal agent who shall be authorized to receive the contributions made \nunder section 2(b) and to disburse such contributions as provided in \nsubsection (d).\n    (3) Any State in which retail electric service choice has been \nestablished for any consumer sector may establish one or more public \npurpose programs and apply for matching funding under this section for \nprojects to be funded under such program. A participating State may use \nmatching funds received under this section only to support one or more \neligible environmental priorities programs meeting the selection \ncriteria established under paragraph (1). The Board shall regularly \naudit the expenditures of matching funds received by a participating \nState under this section.\n    (4) At no time shall a State be required, pursuant to this section, \nto participate in the Environmental Priorities Program, nor may a State \nbe required by the Board to fund a particular project.\n    (d) Fund for Environmental Priorities.--(1) The fiscal agent shall \ndistribute contributions received by the fiscal agent under section \n2(b) to States (or entities designated by the States) under this \nsubsection in accordance with the criteria established by the Board \nunder subsection (c) to carry out eligible projects under environmental \npriorities programs established by the States. For each calendar year \nafter the year 2001, the Board shall solicit applications from States \nfor matching funds to carry out eligible environmental priorities \nprograms. The applications for assistance during any calendar year must \nbe received by the Board before the commencement of such year. In its \napplication, the State shall certify that the moneys will be used for \none or more eligible public purpose programs and shall specify the \namount of State support which is projected for the coming calendar year \nfor the programs concerned.\n    (2) Upon receipt of all State requests for matching funds submitted \npursuant to paragraph (1) for any calendar year, the Board shall \ncalculate the funds necessary to match the level of projected States \nfunds for eligible environmental priorities programs for that calendar \nyear.\n    (3) Following the calculation of the amount of matching funds \nrequired under paragraph (2) for all States requesting funds for any \ncalendar year, the Board shall communicate that amount to the fiscal \nagent. Expenditures by the fiscal agent for any calendar year may not \nexceed the total balance. To the extent the matching funds requested by \nall such States for a calendar year exceed the total amount received by \nthe fiscal agent during the prior calendar year and available to the \nfiscal agent at the commencement of the calendar year concerned, the \nmatching funds distributed to each such State shall be reduced pro rata \nso that the percentage of State funds matched by funds provided under \nthis section is the same for all States requesting funds.\n    (4) The fiscal agent shall distribute matching funds to the States \n(or to an entity or entities designated by the State to receive \npayments) to be used for eligible environmental priorities programs \ndesignated under subsection (c). All funds received shall be used only \nfor the eligible environmental priorities programs designated by the \nState."
