    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Dietary Supplement Regulatory \nImplementation Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Over 158,000,000 Americans regularly consume dietary \n        supplements to maintain and improve their health.\n            (2) Consumer expenditures on dietary supplements reached a \n        reported $20,500,000,000 in 2004, more than double the amount \n        spent in 1994.\n            (3) According to a recent report issued by the Food and \n        Drug Administration (``FDA'') the use of dietary supplements is \n        likely to grow due to factors such as the aging of the baby \n        boom generation, increased interest in self-sufficiency, and \n        advances in science that are uncovering new relationships \n        between diet and disease.\n            (4) In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education \n        Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-417) (``DSHEA'') was enacted. That \n        Act balanced continued consumer access to vitamins, minerals, \n        and other dietary supplements, increased scientific research on \n        the benefits and risks of dietary supplements, public education \n        on dietary supplements, and needed consumer protections.\n            (5) DSHEA requires that claims made on dietary supplement \n        labels, packaging, and accompanying material be truthful, non-\n        misleading, and substantiated. Manufacturers are prohibited \n        from making claims that products are intended to diagnose, \n        treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a disease.\n            (6) DSHEA provides for good manufacturing practice \n        standards setting requirements for potency, purity, sanitary \n        conditions, and recordkeeping for dietary supplements.\n            (7) DSHEA provides that dietary supplements are to be \n        regulated like foods and not drugs or food additives.\n            (8) DSHEA requires that manufacturers submit adequate \n        information as to the safety of any new ingredients contained \n        in dietary supplements before those products can be sold.\n            (9) DSHEA provides the FDA with a number of powers to \n        remove unsafe dietary supplements from the marketplace.\n            (10) DSHEA created the Office of Dietary Supplements within \n        the National Institutes of Health to expand research and \n        consumer information about the health effects of dietary \n        supplements.\n            (11) The FDA has not adequately used its authority to \n        enforce DSHEA.\n            (12) The FDA needs adequate resources to appropriately \n        implement and enforce DSHEA. Congress has appropriated \n        additional funds over the last several years beyond those \n        requested in the President's budget to implement and enforce \n        DSHEA, reaching $10,800,000 in fiscal year 2005.\n            (13) However, according to the FDA, full implementation of \n        DSHEA would require substantial additional resources. The FDA \n        asserts that between $24,000,000 and $65,000,000 per year will \n        be needed to fully implement DSHEA.\n\nSEC. 3.
