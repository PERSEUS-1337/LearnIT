FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The rule by successive military regimes in Nigeria has \n        harmed the lives of the people of Nigeria, undermined \n        confidence in the Nigerian economy, damaged relations between \n        Nigeria and the United States, and threatened the political and \n        economic stability of West Africa.\n            (2) The current military regime, under the leadership of \n        Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar, has made significant progress in \n        liberalizing the political environment in Nigeria, including \n        the release of many political prisoners, increased respect for \n        freedom of assembly, expression and association, and the \n        establishment of a timeframe for a transition to civilian rule.\n            (3) Previous military regimes allowed Nigeria to become a \n        haven for international drug trafficking rings and other \n        criminal organizations, although the current government has \n        taken some steps to cooperate with the United States Government \n        in halting such trafficking.\n            (4) Since 1993, the United States and other members of the \n        international community have imposed limited sanctions against \n        Nigeria in response to human rights violations and political \n        repression, although some of these sanctions have been lifted \n        in response to recent political liberalization.\n            (5) Despite the progress made in protecting certain \n        freedoms, numerous decrees are still in force that suspend the \n        constitutional protection of fundamental human rights, allow \n        indefinite detention without charge, and revoke the \n        jurisdiction of civilian courts over executive actions.\n            (6) As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and \n        Political Rights (ICCPR) and the African Charter on Human and \n        Peoples' Rights, and a signatory to the Harare Commonwealth \n        Declaration, Nigeria is obligated to fairly conduct elections \n        that guarantee the free expression of the will of the electors.\n            (7) As the leading military force within the Economic \n        Community of West African States (ECOWAS) peacekeeping force, \n        Nigeria has played a major role in attempting to secure peace \n        in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n            (8) Despite the optimism expressed by many observers about \n        the progress that has been made in Nigeria, the country's \n        recent history raises serious questions about the potential \n        success of the transition process. In particular, events in the \n        Niger Delta over the New Year underscore the critical need for \n        ongoing monitoring of the situation and indicate that a return \n        by the military to repressive methods is still a possibility.\n    (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that the United \nStates should encourage political, economic, and legal reforms \nnecessary to ensure rule of law and respect for human rights in Nigeria \nand support a timely, effective, and sustainable transition to \ndemocratic, civilian government in Nigeria.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) International Cooperation.--It is the sense of Congress that \nthe President should actively seek to coordinate with other countries \nto further--\n            (1) the United States policy of promoting the rule of law \n        and respect for human rights; and\n            (2) the transition to democratic civilian government.\n    (b) United Nations Human Rights Commission.--It is the sense of \nCongress that, in light of the importance of Nigeria to the region and \nthe severity of successive military regimes, the President should \ninstruct the United States Representative to the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights (UNCHR) to use the voice and vote of the \nUnited States at the annual meeting of the Commission--\n            (1) to condemn human rights abuses in Nigeria, as \n        appropriate, while recognizing the progress that has been made; \n        and\n            (2) to press for the continued renewal of the mandate of, \n        and continued access to Nigeria for, the special rapporteur on \n        Nigeria.\n\nSEC. 4.
