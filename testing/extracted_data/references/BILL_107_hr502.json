FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The 16 countries of the Caribbean region constitute a \n        ``third border'' with the United States because of the \n        proximity and importance of countries in this region as a \n        tourist destination.\n            (2) Unemployment, weak judicial systems, environmental \n        degradation, and natural disasters in the Caribbean region \n        directly affect the well-being of the United States and the \n        future of the countries in this region will inevitably affect \n        the future of the United States.\n            (3) The public sector in many Caribbean countries lacks \n        appropriate training and clearly defined authority and needs to \n        become more efficient.\n            (4) In the 1990's economic growth in the Caribbean region \n        lagged seriously behind economic growth in the Latin American \n        region. This discrepancy will produce significantly lower \n        living standards and lower levels of tax revenues with which to \n        address critical social needs for the Caribbean region.\n            (5) Highly trained labor is often unavailable in the \n        Caribbean region and governmental red tape limits the ability \n        of the private sector to take full advantage of opportunities \n        in the world marketplace.\n            (6) Heavy reliance on relatively few exports and tourism \n        products and the relatively high cost of transportation and \n        telecommunications services further constrain growth in the \n        Caribbean region.\n            (7) A more regional corporate strategy for business success \n        and competition in the global marketplace needs to be developed \n        for the Caribbean region.\n            (8) Many small Caribbean countries are facing severe \n        economic and social stress due to the decline in banana \n        production and the prospective loss or curtailment of existing \n        European Union trade preferences.\n            (9) Economic displacement of small farmers and individuals \n        employed in the supporting infrastructure of the banana \n        industry--individuals who comprise approximately 50 percent of \n        the workforce of some Caribbean countries--will continue and \n        will place added pressures on the economies of these countries.\n            (10) In the small open economies of countries in the \n        Caribbean region, growth can only be achieved as the policies \n        and products of these countries, both goods and services, \n        become increasingly competitive in the global market.\n            (11) Deterioration in economic, social, and political \n        conditions in the small countries of the Caribbean region is \n        leading to increased crime in the region and increased illegal \n        immigration to the United States.\n            (12) The United States is also concerned about narcotics \n        trafficking in the Caribbean region, particularly with respect \n        to continuing bilateral cooperation with Caribbean governments \n        in drug interdiction and combating money laundering.\n            (13) The economic and social development of the Caribbean \n        region depends on the efficiency and fairness of the legal \n        systems of this region. There is a widespread perception that \n        the legal systems in the Caribbean region are inefficient and \n        ineffective and that the administration of law and the quality \n        of justice that is rendered needs to be improved.\n            (14) The ecosystems which sustain the economies of the \n        countries of the Caribbean region, whether based on \n        agriculture, fisheries, or tourism, are under severe and \n        increasing stress.\n            (15) Environmental problems in the Caribbean region arise \n        from inadequate and inappropriate waste management, land use \n        practices, and coastal zone management.\n            (16) The Caribbean region currently has the highest HIV/\n        AIDS prevalence rate of any region in the world other than sub-\n        Saharan Africa. Out of the 12 countries with the highest HIV/\n        AIDS prevalence rates in Latin America and the Caribbean \n        region, 9 are in the Caribbean region. HIV/AIDS has spread to \n        the general population in 5 countries in the Caribbean region, \n        and in other Caribbean countries the epidemic is accelerating \n        rapidly and is poised to strike the remaining general \n        populations.\n            (17) The enactment in 1983 of the Caribbean Basin Economic \n        Recovery Act represented a successful commitment by the United \n        States to encourage the development of strong democratic \n        governments and revitalized economies in neighboring countries \n        in the Caribbean region.\n            (18) In May 1997, United States and Caribbean leaders met \n        in Bridgetown, Barbados, and pledged to strengthen cooperation \n        in responding to the challenges of the coming millennium.\n            (19) The Bridgetown Barbados Summit commits the United \n        States and signatory Caribbean countries to a Plan of Action in \n        the areas of trade, economic development, and justice and \n        security.\n            (20) In April 1998 leaders from the Western Hemisphere \n        nations met in Santiago, Chile, and noted in their summit \n        declaration that ``the real economic benefits in the Americas \n        [result] from more open trade, transparency in economic \n        regulations, sound market-based policies, as well as efforts by \n        the private sector to increase competitiveness''.\n            (21) The United States is committed to completing a Free \n        Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) process by 2005 in order to \n        expand markets for United States goods and services and to help \n        ensure safe destinations for United States foreign investment.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961.\n\n    Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et \nseq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n           ``CHAPTER 13--ASSISTANCE FOR THE CARIBBEAN REGION\n\n``SEC. 499N.
