FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress finds that--\n            (1) Federal multi-purpose dams and reservoirs with \n        hydroelectric generation provide necessary power to respective \n        regions, enhance recreational pursuits and help meet various \n        environmental needs;\n            (2) hydroelectric generation is a renewable resource that \n        plays a significant role in meeting the growing power needs of \n        many communities throughout the Nation;\n            (3) Federal dams along the Savannah River generate \n        electricity for consumers who depend on such power at peak \n        times and provide recreational and environmental benefits to \n        the region;\n            (4) a number of technological advancements have been made \n        at these and other Federal hydropower facilities to provide \n        even greater protections to fish and other aquatic resources; \n        and\n            (5) the value of these and other Federal hydropower \n        facilities can be further enhanced to optimize more \n        hydroelectric generation and environmental protection.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT ON INCREASING ELECTRIC POWER PRODUCTION \n              CAPABILITY OF EXISTING FEDERAL FACILITIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nthe Army, in consultation with the Administrator of each Federal power \nmarketing administration, shall conduct a study of the potential for \ncreating or increasing electric power production capability at existing \nfacilities under their administrative jurisdiction.\n    (b) Content.--The study under this section shall include \nidentification and description in detail of each facility that is \ncapable, with or without modification, of producing additional \nhydroelectric power, including estimation of the existing potential for \nthe facility to generate hydroelectric power.\n    (c) Report.--Each Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report \non the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the study under \nthis section by not later than 12 months after the date of the \nenactment of this Act. Each Secretary shall include the following in \nthe report:\n            (1) The identifications, descriptions, and estimations \n        referred to in subsection (b).\n            (2) A description of activities the Secretary is currently \n        conducting or considering, or that could be considered, to \n        produce additional hydroelectric power from each identified \n        facility.\n            (3) A summary of action that has already been taken by the \n        Secretary to produce additional hydroelectric power from each \n        identified facility.\n            (4) The costs to install, upgrade, or modify equipment or \n        take other actions to produce new or additional hydroelectric \n        power from each identified facility and the level of Federal \n        power customer involvement in the Secretary's determination of \n        such costs.\n            (5) The benefits that would be achieved by such \n        installation, upgrade, modification, or other action, including \n        quantified estimates of any additional energy or capacity from \n        each facility identified under subsection (b).\n            (6) A description of actions that are planned, underway, or \n        might reasonably be considered to create or increase \n        hydroelectric power production by replacing turbines.\n            (7) The impact of increased hydroelectric power production \n        on irrigation, fish, wildlife, Indian tribes, river health, \n        water quality, navigation, recreation, fishing, and flood \n        control.\n            (8) Any additional recommendations the Secretary considers \n        advisable to increase hydroelectric power production from, and \n        reduce costs and improve efficiency at, facilities under the \n        jurisdiction of the Secretary.\n\nSEC. 4. STUDY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INCREASED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES \n              IN HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nthe Army shall conduct a study of operational methods and water \nscheduling techniques at all hydroelectric power plants under the \nadministrative jurisdiction of each Secretary that have an electric \npower production capacity greater than 50 megawatts, to--\n            (1) determine whether such power plants and associated \n        river systems are operated so as to optimize energy and \n        capacity capabilities; and\n            (2) identify measures that can be taken to improve \n        operational flexibility at such plants to achieve such \n        optimization.\n    (b) Report.--Each Secretary shall submit a report on the findings, \nconclusions, and recommendations of the study under this section by not \nlater than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nincluding a summary of the determinations and identifications under \nparagraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a). Each Secretary shall include \nin the report the impact of optimized hydroelectric power production on \nirrigation, fish, wildlife, Indian tribes, river health, water quality, \nnavigation, recreation, fishing, and flood control.\n    (c) Cooperation With Federal Power Marketing Administrations.--Each \nSecretary shall coordinate with the Administrator of each Federal power \nmarketing administration in determining how the value of electric power \nproduced by each hydroelectric power facility that produces power \nmarketed by the administration can be optimized."
