during morning or \n                evening weekday peak hour periods (or both).''.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nSecretary and the States should provide additional incentives \n(including the use of high occupancy vehicle lanes on State highways \nand routes on the Interstate System) for the purchase and use of \nadvanced technology and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles, which have \nbeen proven to minimize air emissions and decrease consumption of \nfossil fuels."
