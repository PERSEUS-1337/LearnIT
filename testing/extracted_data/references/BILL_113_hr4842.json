FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 2012, the Department of Labor identified 134 goods \n        from 74 countries around the world made by forced labor and \n        child labor.\n            (2) The United States is the world's largest importer, and \n        in the 21st century, investors, consumers, and broader civil \n        society increasingly demand information about the human rights \n        impact of products in the United States market.\n            (3) Courts have also ruled that consumers do not have \n        standing to bring a civil action in United States courts for \n        enforcement of this provision of the Tariff Act, because the \n        legislative intent was to protect American manufacturers from \n        unfairly priced goods, not to protect consumers from tainted \n        goods, consequently, there are fewer than 40 enforcement \n        actions on record in the past 80 years.\n            (4) Mechanisms under Federal law related to forced labor, \n        slavery, human trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor \n        in the stream of commerce suffer from similar problems of \n        limited scope, broad expectations, and inability to provide \n        information about specific supplies whose goods are tainted.\n            (5) The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and \n        Human Rights affirm that business enterprises have a \n        responsibility to respect human rights, and that States have a \n        duty to ensure these rights are protected. Such Guiding \n        Principles also clarify that the duty to protect against \n        business-related human rights abuses requires States to take \n        the necessary steps to prevent and address human rights abuses \n        to workers through effective policies and regulation.\n            (6) The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n        of 2003 (Public Law 108-193) together with the Trafficking \n        Victims Protection Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-164) provide for \n        the termination of Federal contracts where a Federal contractor \n        or subcontractor engages in severe forms of trafficking in \n        persons or has procured a commercial sex act during the period \n        of time that the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement is \n        in effect, or uses forced labor in the performance of the \n        grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. The Trafficking \n        Victims Protection Act of 2005 also provide United States \n        courts with criminal jurisdiction abroad over Federal \n        employees, contractors, or subcontractors who participate in \n        severe forms of trafficking in persons or forced labor.\n            (7) Executive Order 13126, Prohibition of Acquisition of \n        Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor, \n        Executive Order 13627, Strengthening Protections Against \n        Trafficking In Persons In Federal Contracts, and title XVII of \n        the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 \n        (Public Law 112-239) have prohibited Federal contractors, \n        subcontractors, and their employees from engaging in the \n        following trafficking-related activities: charging labor \n        recruitment fees; confiscating passports and other identity \n        documents of workers; and using fraudulent recruitment \n        practices, including failing to disclose basic information or \n        making material misrepresentations about the terms and \n        conditions of employment. Such Executive order and Acts also \n        require Federal contractors, subcontractors, and their \n        employees to maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan that \n        includes, among other elements, a complaint mechanism and \n        procedures to prevent subcontractors at any tier from engaging \n        in trafficking in persons.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst \n        forms of child labor are among the most egregious forms of \n        abuse that humans commit against each other, for the sake of \n        commercial profit;\n            (2) the legislative and regulatory framework to prevent \n        goods produced by forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and \n        the worst forms of child labor from passing into the stream of \n        commerce in the United States is gravely inadequate;\n            (3) legislation is necessary to provide consumers \n        information on products that are free of child labor, forced \n        labor, slavery, and human trafficking; and\n            (4) through publicly available disclosures, businesses and \n        consumers can avoid inadvertently promoting or sanctioning \n        these crimes through production and purchase of goods and \n        products that have been tainted in the supply chains.\n\nSEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATING TO EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE USE \n              OF FORCED LABOR, SLAVERY, TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, OR THE \n              WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR.\n\n    Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) \nis amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(s) Disclosures Relating to Efforts To Combat the Use of Forced \nLabor, Slavery, Trafficking in Persons, or the Worst Forms of Child \nLabor.--\n            ``(1) Regulations.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of the Global Supply Chain Transparency for \n        Trafficking, Forced Labor, and Child Labor Eradication Act, the \n        Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall \n        promulgate regulations to require that any covered issuer \n        required to file reports with the Commission under this section \n        to include annually in such reports, a disclosure whether the \n        covered issuer has taken any measures during the year for which \n        such reporting is required to identify and address conditions \n        of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst \n        forms of child labor within the covered issuer's supply chain, \n        and a description of such measures taken.
