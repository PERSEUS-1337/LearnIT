SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``San Francisco Bay \nNational Wildlife Refuge Complex Establishment Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In 1974, the first congressionally-mandated national \n        wildlife refuge in the country was established in San Francisco \n        Bay, renamed in 1995 as the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay \n        National Wildlife Refuge. It was the Nation's first urban \n        refuge and remains the largest national wildlife refuge in a \n        metropolitan area. The Service manages it as part of a Complex \n        with the Antioch Dunes, Ellicott Slough, Farallon, Marin \n        Islands, Salinas River, and San Pablo Bay National Wildlife \n        Refuges, comprising more than 46,000 acres. The Complex's urban \n        setting and high visitorship provide unique challenges and \n        opportunities to advance the mission of the national wildlife \n        refuge system, including engagement, education, and involvement \n        of new constituencies.\n            (2) The Complex represents a unique national asset within \n        the National Wildlife Refuge System and should be a focal point \n        for cutting edge research, science, and practice in habitat \n        management and restoration, including projects in the areas \n        of--\n                    (A) implementation of recovery plans for endangered \n                and threatened wildlife species, and habitat \n                conservation plans for tidal marsh and other priority \n                ecosystems;\n                    (B) integrated ecosystem management and adaptive \n                approaches to planning and implementation of landscape-\n                scale ecosystem restoration;\n                    (C) carbon sequestration and natural shoreline \n                protection benefits of tidal marsh restoration in the \n                face of rising sea levels;\n                    (D) monitoring the health of key species and the \n                value of habitat;\n                    (E) removal and control of harmful nonnative \n                species;\n                    (F) public education and community stewardship \n                opportunities in furtherance of the mission of the \n                National Wildlife Refuge System;\n                    (G) public-private partnerships and collaborative \n                conservation; and\n                    (H) establishing and documenting best practices and \n                disseminating and replicating them throughout the \n                National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\nSEC. 2.
