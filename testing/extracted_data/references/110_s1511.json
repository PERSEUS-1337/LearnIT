ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL FUND.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the use of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy \n        technologies can avoid contributions to global warming gases, \n        and such technologies can be produced domestically;\n            (2) marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy is a nascent \n        industry; and\n            (3) the United States must work to promote new renewable \n        energy technologies that reduce contributions to global warming \n        gases and improve our country's domestic energy production in a \n        manner that is consistent with environmental protection, \n        recreation, and other public values.\n    (b) Establishment.--The Secretary of Energy shall establish an \nAdaptive Management and Environmental Fund, and shall lend amounts from \nthat fund to entities described in subsection (f) to cover the costs of \nprojects that produce marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. Such \ncosts include design, fabrication, deployment, operation, monitoring, \nand decommissioning costs. Loans under this section may be subordinate \nto project-related loans provided by commercial lending institutions to \nthe extent the Secretary of Energy considers appropriate.\n    (c) Reasonable Access.--As a condition of receiving a loan under \nthis section, a recipient shall provide reasonable access, to Federal \nor State agencies and other research institutions as the Secretary \nconsiders appropriate, to the project area and facilities for the \npurposes of independent environmental research.\n    (d) Public Availability.--The results of any assessment or \ndemonstration paid for, in whole or in part, with funds provided under \nthis section shall be made available to the public, except to the \nextent that they contain information that is protected from disclosure \nunder section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code.\n    (e) Repayment of Loans.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Energy shall require a \n        recipient of a loan under this section to repay the loan, plus \n        interest at a rate of 2.1 percent per year, over a period not \n        to exceed 20 years, beginning after the commercial generation \n        of electric power from the project commences. Such repayment \n        shall be required at a rate that takes into account the \n        economic viability of the loan recipient and ensures regular \n        and timely repayment of the loan.\n            (2) Beginning of repayment period.--No repayments shall be \n        required under this subsection until after the project \n        generates net proceeds. For purposes of this paragraph, the \n        term ``net proceeds'' means proceeds from the commercial sale \n        of electricity after payment of project-related costs, \n        including taxes and regulatory fees that have not been paid \n        using funds from a loan provided for the project under this \n        section.\n            (3) Termination.--Repayment of a loan made under this \n        section shall terminate as of the date that the project for \n        which the loan was provided ceases commercial generation of \n        electricity if a governmental permitting authority has ordered \n        the closure of the facility because of a finding that the \n        project has unacceptable adverse environmental impacts, except \n        that the Secretary shall require a loan recipient to continue \n        making loan repayments for the cost of equipment, obtained \n        using funds from the loan that have not otherwise been repaid \n        under rules established by the Secretary, that is utilized in a \n        subsequent project for the commercial generation of \n        electricity.\n    (f) Adaptive Management Plan.--In order to receive a loan under \nthis section, an applicant for a Federal license or permit to \nconstruct, operate, or maintain a marine or hydrokinetic renewable \nenergy project shall provide to the Federal agency with primary \njurisdiction to issue such license or permit an adaptive management \nplan for the proposed project.
