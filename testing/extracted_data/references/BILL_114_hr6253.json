SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Collaborating for \nEconomic Reintegration of Troops Act'' or the ``CERT Act''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the greatest challenges facing transitioning \n        members of the Armed Forces and their spouses is finding \n        civilian employment.\n            (2) Veterans report that employment is the top challenge \n        upon separation or retirement from the Armed Forces, with as \n        many as 80 percent of members leaving the Armed Forces without \n        civilian employment in hand and one in four reporting being \n        underemployed and earning below-poverty wages.\n            (3) Military training correlates to approximately 962 \n        civilian professions, yet even with their military education \n        and experience, veterans must duplicate their training to meet \n        various State specific certification guidelines.\n            (4) Veteran transition can be aided by establishing a \n        commission to examine licensing and certification challenges \n        confronting members of the Armed Forces upon post-service entry \n        into the civilian workforce.\n            (5) This commission will identify where there are gaps \n        between military training and civilian credentials' training \n        requirements and can identify opportunities for military \n        training to be reformed to address such gaps and for transition \n        to be improved by increased recognition of military training as \n        equivalent through a ``Blue Star certification''.\n            (6) The Blue Star certification initiative would set \n        sufficient standards for entry into certain licensed \n        professions. States could adopt Blue Star certifications as \n        equivalent to entry into certain licensed professions. The \n        Armed Forces, in their training process, would ensure members \n        reach Blue Star proficiency so that upon leaving service they \n        could swiftly transition to civilian employment.\n            (7) Operation Certification would allow for members of the \n        Armed Forces to directly and immediately apply their training \n        and experience to the private sector. States that adopt the \n        Blue Star credential will attract and retain talented and civic \n        minded veterans. Furthermore, this would modernize military \n        training within Blue Star occupational specialties to ensure \n        that members are well trained and prepared to meet any \n        challenge upon separation.\n\nSEC. 2.
