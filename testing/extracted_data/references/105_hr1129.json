    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Microcredit for Self-Reliance Act of \n1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:\n            (1) More than 1,000,000,000 people in the developing world \n        are living in severe poverty.\n            (2) According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n        (UNICEF), mortality for children under the age of 5 averages \n        100 child deaths per thousand for all developing countries, \n        with nearly double that rate in the poorest countries.\n            (3) Nearly 35,000 children die each day from largely \n        preventable malnutrition and disease.\n            (4)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads, \n        and less access to educational and economic opportunities than \n        their male counterparts.\n            (B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially \n        women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only \n        on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health and \n        education, as women in particular reinvest income in their \n        families.\n            (5)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly \n        women, generally lack stable employment and social safety nets.\n            (B) Many turn to self-employment to generate a substantial \n        portion of their livelihood.\n            (C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty \n        because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to build \n        their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-\n        employment activities.\n            (D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as \n        high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.\n            (6)(A) On February 2-4, 1997, a global microcredit summit \n        was held in Washington, District of Columbia, to launch a plan \n        to expand access to credit for self-employment and other \n        financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world's \n        poorest families, especially the women of those families, by \n        2005.\n            (B) With five to a family, achieving this goal will mean \n        that the benefits of microcredit will thereby reach nearly half \n        of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 absolute poor.\n            (7)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their \n        businesses dramatically when they can access loans at \n        reasonable interest rates.\n            (B) Through the development of self-sustaining microcredit \n        programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against \n        hunger and poverty.\n            (8)(A) Nongovernmental organizations such as the Grameen \n        Bank, Accion International, and the Foundation for \n        International Community Assistance (FINCA) have been successful \n        in lending directly to the very poor.\n            (B) These institutions generate repayment rates averaging \n        95 percent or higher, demonstrating the bankability of the \n        poorest.\n            (C) International organizations such as the International \n        Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the United Nations \n        Development Program (UNDP) have demonstrated success in \n        supporting microcredit programs.\n            (9)(A) Microcredit institutions not only reduce poverty, \n        but also reduce the dependency on foreign assistance.\n            (B) Interest income on a credit portfolio can be used to \n        pay recurring institutional costs, assuring the long-term \n        sustainability of development assistance.\n            (10) Microcredit institutions leverage foreign assistance \n        resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits \n        to program participants.\n            (11) The development of sustainable microcredit \n        institutions which provide credit and training, and mobilize \n        domestic savings, are critical components to a global strategy \n        of poverty reduction and broad based economic development.\n            (12)(A) In 1994, the United States Agency for International \n        Development launched a microenterprise initiative in \n        partnership with the Congress.\n            (B) The initiative committed to expanding funding for the \n        microenterprise programs of the Agency, and set a goal that, by \n        the end of fiscal year 1996, half of all microenterprise \n        resources would support programs and institutions providing \n        credit to the poorest, with loans under $300.\n            (C) In order to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit, \n        increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the \n        poorest will be critical.\n            (13) Providing the United States share of the global \n        investment needed to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit \n        will require only a small increase in United States funding for \n        international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on \n        institutions serving the poorest.\n            (14)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest \n        with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate \n        successful microcredit institutions.\n            (B) These institutions need assistance in developing their \n        institutional capacity to expand their services and tap \n        commercial sources of capital.\n            (15) Nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated \n        competence in developing networks of local microcredit \n        institutions so that they reach large numbers of the very poor, \n        and achieve financial sustainability.\n            (16) Recognizing that the United States Agency for \n        International Development has developed very effective \n        partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and that the \n        Agency will have fewer missions to carry out its work, the \n        Agency should place priority on investing in these \n        nongovernmental network institutions through the central \n        funding mechanisms of the Agency.\n            (17) By expanding and replicating successful microcredit \n        institutions, it should be possible to create a global \n        infrastructure to provide financial services to the world's \n        poorest families.\n            (18)(A) The United States Agency for International \n        Development can provide leadership to other bilateral and \n        multilateral development agencies as such agencies expand their \n        support to the microenterprise sector.\n            (B) The United States Agency for International Development \n        should seek to improve coordination of donor efforts at the \n        operational level to promote the use of best practices in the \n        provision of financial services to the poor and to ensure that \n        adequate institutional capacity is developed.\n            (19) Through expanded support for microcredit, especially \n        credit for the poorest, the United States Agency for \n        International Development can continue to play a leadership \n        role in the global effort to expand financial services and \n        opportunity to 100,000,000 of the poorest families on the \n        planet.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide for the continuation and expansion of the \n        commitment of the United States Agency for International \n        Development to the development of microenterprise institutions;\n            (2) to make microenterprise development the centerpiece of \n        the overall economic growth strategy of the United States \n        Agency for International Development;\n            (3) to support and develop the capacity of United States \n        and indigenous nongovernmental organization intermediaries to \n        provide credit, savings, and training services to \n        microentrepreneurs;\n            (4) to increase the amount of assistance devoted to credit \n        activities designed to reach the poorest sector in developing \n        countries, and to improve the access of the poorest, \n        particularly women, to microenterprise credit in developing \n        countries; and\n            (5) to encourage the United States Agency for International \n        Development to provide global leadership in promoting \n        microenterprise for the poorest among bilateral and \n        multilateral donors.\n\nSEC. 4. MICRO- AND SMALL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT CREDITS.\n\n    Section 108 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151f) \nis amended to read as follows:\n\n``SEC. 108.
