    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Genetic Privacy and \nNondiscrimination Act of 1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The DNA molecule contains information about an \n        individual's probable medical future.\n            (2) Genetic information is uniquely private and personal \n        information that should not be disclosed without the \n        authorization of the individual.\n            (3) The improper disclosure of genetic information can lead \n        to significant harm to the individual, including stigmatization \n        and discrimination in areas such as employment, education, \n        health care and insurance.\n            (4) An analysis of an individual's DNA provides information \n        not only about an individual, but also about the individual's \n        parents, siblings and children.\n            (5) Current legal protections for genetic information, \n        tissue samples and DNA samples are inadequate to protect \n        genetic privacy, and require further attention.\n            (6) Laws for the collection, storage and use of \n        identifiable DNA samples and private genetic information \n        obtained from those samples are needed both to protect \n        individual privacy and to permit legitimate genetic research.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) define the rights of individuals whose genetic \n        information is disclosed;\n            (2) define the circumstances under which an individual's \n        genetic information may be disclosed; and\n            (3) protect against discrimination by an insurer or \n        employer based upon an individual's genetic information.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act:\n            (1) DNA.--The term ``DNA'' means deoxyribonucleic acid.\n            (2) DNA sample.--The term ``DNA sample'' means any human \n        biological specimen from which DNA can be extracted, or the DNA \n        extracted from such specimen.\n            (3) Employer.--The term ``employer'' has the same meaning \n        given such term in section 3(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n        of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(d)).\n            (4) Genetic information.--The term ``genetic information'' \n        means the information about genes, gene products or inherited \n        characteristics that may derive from an individual or a family \n        member.\n            (5) Genetic test.--The term ``genetic test'' means a test \n        for determining the presence or absence of genetic \n        characteristics in an individual, including tests of nucleic \n        acids such as DNA, RNA and mitochondrial DNA, chromosomes or \n        proteins in order to diagnose a genetic characteristic.\n            (6) Insurer.--The term ``insurer'' means an insurance \n        company, health care service contractor, fraternal benefit \n        organization, insurance agent, third party administrator, \n        insurance support organization or other person subject to \n        regulation under State insurance laws. Such term includes self-\n        funded health plans and health plans regulated under the \n        Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 \n        et seq.).\n            (7) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of Health and Human Services.\n\nSEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF GENETIC INFORMATION.\n\n    (a) Prohibition.--\n            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n        regardless of the manner in which genetic information was \n        received, or of the source of such information, including \n        information received from an individual, an entity may not \n        disclose or be compelled (by subpoena or any other means) to \n        disclose genetic information about an individual unless such \n        disclosure is specifically authorized by the individual \n        involved or the legal representative of the individual through \n        a written authorization which includes a description of the \n        information being disclosed, the name of the individual or \n        entity to whom the disclosure is being made, and the purpose of \n        the disclosure.\n            (2) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), genetic \n        information concerning an individual may be disclosed if such \n        disclosure--\n                    (A) is authorized under Federal or State criminal \n                laws relating to the identification of individuals, or \n                as is necessary for the purpose of a criminal or death \n                investigation, a criminal or juvenile proceeding, an \n                inquest, or a child fatality review by a \n                multidisciplinary child abuse team;\n                    (B) is required under the specific order of a \n                Federal or State court;\n                    (C) is authorized under Federal or State law for \n                the purpose of establishing paternity;\n                    (D) is for the purpose of furnishing genetic \n                information relating to a decedent to the blood \n                relatives of the decedent for the purpose of medical \n                diagnosis; or\n                    (E) is for the purpose of identifying bodies.\n    (b) Application of Section.--The prohibitions of this section shall \napply to any redisclosure by any entity after another entity has \ndisclosed the genetic information.\n\nSEC. 5.
