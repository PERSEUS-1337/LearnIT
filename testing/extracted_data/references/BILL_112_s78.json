FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) perchlorate--\n                    (A) is a chemical used as the primary ingredient of \n                solid rocket propellant; and\n                    (B) is also used in fireworks, road flares, and \n                other applications;\n            (2) waste from the manufacture and improper disposal of \n        chemicals containing perchlorate is increasingly being \n        discovered in soil and water;\n            (3) according to the Government Accountability Office, \n        perchlorate contamination has been detected in water and soil \n        at almost 400 sites in the United States, with concentration \n        levels ranging from 4 parts per billion to millions of parts \n        per billion;\n            (4) the Government Accountability Office has determined \n        that the Environmental Protection Agency does not centrally \n        track or monitor perchlorate detections or the status of \n        perchlorate cleanup, so a greater number of contaminated sites \n        may already exist;\n            (5) according to the Government Accountability Office, \n        limited Environmental Protection Agency data show that \n        perchlorate has been found in 35 States and the District of \n        Columbia and is known to have contaminated 153 public water \n        systems in 26 States;\n            (6) those data are likely underestimates of total drinking \n        water exposure, as illustrated by the finding of the California \n        Department of Health Services that perchlorate contamination \n        sites have affected approximately 273 drinking water sources \n        and 86 drinking water systems in the State of California alone;\n            (7) Food and Drug Administration scientists and other \n        scientific researchers have detected perchlorate in the United \n        States food supply, including in lettuce, milk, cucumbers, \n        tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, wheat, and spinach, and in human \n        breast milk;\n            (8)(A) perchlorate can harm human health, especially in \n        pregnant women and children, by interfering with uptake of \n        iodide by the thyroid gland, which is necessary to produce \n        important hormones that help control human health and \n        development;\n            (B) in adults, the thyroid helps to regulate metabolism;\n            (C) in children, the thyroid helps to ensure proper mental \n        and physical development; and\n            (D) impairment of thyroid function in expectant mothers or \n        infants may result in effects including delayed development and \n        decreased learning capability;\n            (9)(A) in October 2006, researchers from the Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention published the largest, most \n        comprehensive study to date on the effects of low levels of \n        perchlorate exposure in women, finding that--\n                    (i) significant changes existed in thyroid hormones \n                in women with low iodine levels who were exposed to \n                perchlorate; and\n                    (ii) even low-level perchlorate exposure may affect \n                the production of hormones by the thyroid in iodine-\n                deficient women; and\n            (B) in the United States, about 36 percent of women have \n        iodine levels equivalent to or below the levels of the women in \n        the study described in subparagraph (A); and\n            (10) the Environmental Protection Agency has not \n        established a health advisory or national primary drinking \n        water regulation for perchlorate, but instead established a \n        ``Drinking Water Equivalent Level'' of 24.5 parts per billion \n        for perchlorate, which--\n                    (A) does not take into consideration all routes of \n                exposure to perchlorate;\n                    (B) has been criticized by experts as failing to \n                sufficiently consider the body weight, unique exposure, \n                and vulnerabilities of certain pregnant women and \n                fetuses, infants, and children; and\n                    (C) is based primarily on a small study and does \n                not take into account new, larger studies of the \n                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or other \n                data indicating potential effects at lower perchlorate \n                levels than previously found.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to establish, by not later than 90 days after \n        the date of enactment of this Act, a health advisory for \n        perchlorate in drinking water that--\n                    (A) is fully protective of, and considers, the body \n                weight and exposure patterns of pregnant women, \n                infants, and children;\n                    (B) provides an adequate margin of safety; and\n                    (C) takes into account all routes of exposure to \n                perchlorate;\n            (2) to require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to establish not later than 1 year after the \n        date of enactment of this Act a national primary drinking water \n        regulation for perchlorate that fully protects pregnant women, \n        infants, and children, taking into consideration body weight, \n        exposure patterns, and all routes of exposure to perchlorate.\n\nSEC. 3. HEALTH ADVISORY AND NATIONAL PRIMARY DRINKING WATER REGULATION \n              FOR PERCHLORATE.\n\n    Section 1412(b)(12) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-\n1(b)(12)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n                    ``(C) Perchlorate.--\n                            ``(i) Health advisory.--Notwithstanding any \n                        other provision of this section, not later than \n                        90 days after the date of enactment of this \n                        subparagraph, the Administrator shall publish a \n                        health advisory for perchlorate that is fully \n                        protective, with an adequate margin of safety, \n                        of the health of vulnerable persons (including \n                        pregnant women, infants, and children), taking \n                        into consideration body weight, exposure \n                        patterns, and all routes of exposure.\n                            ``(ii) Proposed regulations.--\n                        Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n                        section, the Administrator shall propose (not \n                        later than 180 days after the date of enactment \n                        of this subparagraph) and shall finalize (not \n                        later than 1 year after the date of enactment \n                        of this subparagraph) a national primary \n                        drinking water regulation for perchlorate--\n                                    ``(I) that based on the factors in \n                                clause (i) and other relevant data, is \n                                protective, with an adequate margin of \n                                safety, of vulnerable persons \n                                (including pregnant women, infants, and \n                                children); and\n                                    ``(II) the maximum contaminant \n                                level of which is as close to the \n                                maximum contaminant level goal for \n                                perchlorate, and as protective of \n                                vulnerable persons, as is feasible.''."
