CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) since the enactment of National Flood Insurance Act of \n        1968, the National Flood Insurance Program has been the primary \n        source of reliable, reasonably priced flood insurance coverage \n        for millions of American homes and businesses;\n            (2) today over 5,500,000 homes and businesses in the United \n        States rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to provide \n        a degree of financial security;\n            (3) several years of below-average flood claims losses and \n        increased voluntary participation in the National Flood \n        Insurance Program have allowed the program to fully service the \n        debt incurred following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and allowed \n        the program to pay $598,000,000 of the principal of that \n        outstanding debt;\n            (4) recent lapses in, and short-term reauthorizations of, \n        the National Flood Insurance Program's ability to write and \n        renew flood insurance coverage are estimated by the Federal \n        Emergency Management Agency and The National Realtors \n        Association to have adversely impacted or delayed up to 1,350 \n        real estate closings per day;\n            (5) though long-term authorization and significant reforms \n        are needed to further improve the financial outlook of the \n        National Flood Insurance Program, while such comprehensive \n        reforms are considered, reliable, annual authorization of the \n        program is an essential element to stabilizing the already \n        fragile United States housing market;\n            (6) increased flooding in areas outside designated special \n        flood hazard areas prompted the Executive and the Congress in \n        2002 to begin calling for the National Flood Insurance Program \n        to develop and disseminate revised, updated flood insurance \n        rate maps that reflect the real risk of flooding for properties \n        not previously identified as being located with in a special \n        flood hazard area;\n            (7) dissemination of accurate, up-to-date flood risk \n        information remains a primary goal of the National Flood \n        Insurance Program and such information should be disseminated \n        as soon as such information is collected and available; and\n            (8) communities should be required to make their residents \n        aware of updated flood-risk data while communities are \n        assessing and incorporating updated flood-risk data into long-\n        term community planning.\n\nSEC. 3.
