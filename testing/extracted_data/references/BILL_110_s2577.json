GUN SHOW BACKGROUND CHECK.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) approximately 5,200 traditional gun shows are held \n        annually across the United States, attracting thousands of \n        attendees per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees \n        and nonlicensed firearms sellers;\n            (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and \n        other organized events, at which a large number of firearms are \n        offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed \n        firearms sellers, form a significant part of the national \n        firearms market;\n            (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered \n        for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n        organized events move easily in and substantially affect \n        interstate commerce;\n            (4) in fact, even before a firearm is exhibited or offered \n        for sale or exchange at a gun show, flea market, or other \n        organized event, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, and \n        the raw materials from which it is manufactured have moved in \n        interstate commerce;\n            (5) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at \n        which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n        provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at \n        which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often \n        without background checks and without records that enable gun \n        tracing;\n            (6) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events \n        at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n        criminals and other prohibited persons obtain guns without \n        background checks and frequently use guns that cannot be traced \n        to later commit crimes;\n            (7) since the enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence \n        Prevention Act (Public Law 103-159; 107 Stat. 1536) in 1993, \n        nearly 70,000,000 background checks have been performed by \n        Federal firearms licensees, denying guns to 1,360,000 illegal \n        buyers;\n            (8) many persons who buy and sell firearms at gun shows, \n        flea markets, and other organized events cross State lines to \n        attend these events and engage in the interstate transportation \n        of firearms obtained at these events;\n            (9) gun violence is a pervasive, national problem that is \n        exacerbated by the availability of guns at gun shows, flea \n        markets, and other organized events;\n            (10) firearms associated with gun shows have been \n        transferred illegally to residents of another State by Federal \n        firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, and have \n        been involved in subsequent crimes including drug offenses, \n        crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal possession of \n        firearms by felons and other prohibited persons; and\n            (11) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n        clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n        States, to ensure, by enactment of this Act, that criminals and \n        other prohibited persons do not obtain firearms at gun shows, \n        flea markets, and other organized events.\n    (b) Definitions.--Section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(36) Gun show.--The term `gun show' means any event--\n                    ``(A) at which 50 or more firearms are offered or \n                exhibited for sale, transfer, or exchange, if 1 or more \n                of the firearms has been shipped or transported in, or \n                otherwise affects, interstate or foreign commerce;
