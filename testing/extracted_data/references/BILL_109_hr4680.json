FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On December 26, 2004, a devastating earthquake occurred \n        in the Indian Ocean, causing a tsunami that wrecked havoc on \n        the island nation of Sri Lanka.\n            (2) More than 70 percent of the coastline in Sri Lanka was \n        affected by the tidal wave, displacing more than 800,000 \n        people, injuring more that 14,000, and killing more than 40,000 \n        out of a population of just over 19,000,000 living in a land \n        mass equivalent to the size of West Virginia.\n            (3) Nearly 5,000 families have been displaced, with more \n        than 90,000 homes destroyed and more than 20,000 homes \n        partially damaged.\n            (4) Sri Lanka lost 22 hospitals, 77 field medical centers, \n        68 medical clinics, and 137 schools.\n            (5) The tourist industry, which had only begun to rebound \n        after more than 20 years of civil war, suffered a loss of more \n        than 4,000 hotel rooms that are no longer useable.\n            (6) The main roads and railway system which circumvented \n        the country along the flat coastline was devastated, cutting \n        off access to the areas of destruction.\n            (7) In addition to the immediate loss of lives and \n        facilities, Sri Lanka is facing a crisis of restoring \n        industries.\n            (8) The fishing industry of Sri Lanka was devastated, as 80 \n        percent of Sri Lanka's fishing boats were destroyed, causing a \n        major loss of a nationwide source of nutrition, as well as \n        employment for an estimated 170,000 fishermen.\n            (9) Ten of the nation's 12 fishing harbors were destroyed, \n        as well as most of the 50 plants used for building small boats.\n            (10) The industry's nets and land storage and \n        transportation facilities were destroyed, as well as the ice \n        making facilities for the storage facilities.\n            (11) The coastal estuary sites, where shrimp and small fish \n        were farmed, and as farm lands located inland from the shore, \n        have been silted up and destroyed.\n            (12) More than 40 percent of the population depended on the \n        fishing industry for its livelihood, and 11 percent of the \n        population depended on agriculture.\n            (13) Former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton \n        estimate that it will require billions of dollars to rebuild \n        the affected countries, and at least three to five years to do \n        so.\n            (14) Sri Lanka's most dynamic sectors had been food \n        processing, textiles and apparel, food and beverages, \n        telecommunications, and insurance and banking. Agriculture \n        accounted for 20.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in \n        2003, while industry, primarily garments and leather goods, \n        food processing, chemicals, refined petroleum, wood products, \n        basic metal products, and paper products, accounted for 26.3 \n        percent of GDP.\n            (15) The inland and leeward plants that were not affected \n        by the tsunami need unrestricted market access to increase \n        production, to offer employment to those who lost jobs and or \n        have moved inland, and to maintain positive economic growth, \n        stability, and democracy in the country.\n            (16) The tsunami has forced the government and the rebel \n        forces in Sri Lanka to work together on certain programs, \n        which, through external support, can re-energize peace talks.\n            (17) Before the tsunami occurred, Sri Lanka had implemented \n        an economic reform program to open its economy to international \n        competition that will lead to increased growth and \n        international trade and further foreign investment.\n            (18) The United States, through opening trade, has an \n        opportunity to support Sri Lanka in its relief efforts, \n        economic reform, peace process, and rebuilding process.\n\nSEC. 3.
