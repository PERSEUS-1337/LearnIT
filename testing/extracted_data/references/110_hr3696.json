FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Supplemental Security Income program provides \n        essential income security to more than 4,000,000 working-age \n        adult Americans, most of whom are disabled.\n            (2) Eligibility for the Supplemental Security Income \n        program requires the applicant to have very few assets that are \n        available for the individual's use. However, certain necessary \n        assets, such as the person's primary residence, and certain \n        government benefits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, are \n        excluded from the asset test.\n            (3) The value of a traditional defined benefit plan that \n        will eventually provide the former worker with periodic \n        payments does not count against the asset limit for the \n        Supplemental Security Income program, allowing a person who \n        becomes disabled to qualify for Supplemental Security Income \n        and Medicaid benefits while maintaining the right to receive a \n        pension at retirement age.\n            (4) Americans are increasingly dependent on defined \n        contribution plans such as 401(k) and individual retirement \n        accounts to provide for retirement security. Assets saved in \n        such plans count against a person's eligibility for \n        Supplemental Security Income benefits.\n            (5) Persons with disabilities are thus discouraged from \n        accumulating any retirement savings during periods of time when \n        they are able to work, because if their medical condition \n        deteriorates or they otherwise lose their job, they will have \n        to liquidate their retirement accounts and pay penalties in \n        order to qualify for Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid \n        benefits.\n            (6) The current treatment of retirement assets discourages \n        savings and work for disabled persons.\n    (b) Statement of Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage \nretirement savings for all and promote work and self-sufficiency for \npersons with disabilities by disregarding up to $75,000 in retirement \naccounts when determining eligibility for benefits under the \nSupplemental Security Income program.\n\nSEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF LIMITED VALUE OF RETIREMENT PLANS UNDER THE SSI \n              PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Resourse Exclusion.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 1613(a) of the Social Security Act \n        (42 U.S.C. 1382b(a)) is amended--\n                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph \n                (14);\n                    (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph \n                (15) and inserting ``; and''; and\n                    (C) by inserting after paragraph (15) the \n                following:\n            ``(16) the value of any plan, contract, or account, \n        described in section 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, 408A, 457(b), \n        or 501(c)(18) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, established \n        for the benefit of the individual, to the extent the aggregate \n        value of all such plans, contracts, and accounts so established \n        does not exceed $75,000 (in the case of calendar years prior to \n        2009) and the amount determined under section 1617(d) for the \n        calendar year (in the case of calendar years after 2008).''.\n            (2) Annual cost of living adjustment.--Section 1617 of such \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 1382f) is amended by adding at the end the \n        following new subsection:\n    ``(d)(1) The Commissioner of Social Security shall, on or before \nNovember 1 of 2008 and every calendar year thereafter, determine and \npublish in the Federal Register a dollar amount for purposes of section \n1613(a)(16) for the succeeding calendar year.
