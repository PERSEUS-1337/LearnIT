FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, as well as other recent \n        natural and man-made disasters, have highlighted the need for \n        planning to minimize the impact of disasters.\n            (2) Lack of preparedness in times of disaster can have \n        especially devastating effects on animals and the people who \n        risk their lives to protect them.\n            (3) Local first-responders, non-governmental agencies, and \n        private individuals most often shoulder the cost and \n        responsibility of animals affected by disasters.\n            (4) It is reasonable to ask those who use animals \n        commercially to demonstrate a level of readiness to protect the \n        animals under their care.\n\nSEC. 3.
