SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Amyotrophic \nLateral Sclerosis (ALS) Research, Treatment, and Assistance Act of \n1997''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as \n        Lou Gehrig's Disease, is a progressive neuromuscular disease \n        characterized by a degeneration of the nerve cells of the brain \n        and spinal cord leading to the wasting of muscles, paralysis, \n        and eventual death.\n            (2) Approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States \n        are afflicted with ALS at any time, with approximately 5,000 \n        new cases appearing each year.\n            (3) ALS usually strikes individuals who are 50 years of age \n        or older.\n            (4) The life expectancy of an individual with ALS is 3 to 5 \n        years from the time of diagnosis.\n            (5) There is no know cure or cause for ALS.\n            (6) Aggressive treatment of the symptoms of ALS can extend \n        the lives of those with the disease.
