FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Rising costs are making it increasingly difficult for \n        students and their families to afford a college education.\n            (2) In addition to the growing price of tuition, fees, and \n        room and board, the average college student in the United \n        States must also spend more than $1,000 per year on textbooks \n        and supplies.\n            (3) New learning technologies in higher education provide a \n        growing opportunity to reduce the cost of course materials for \n        students and their families.\n            (4) All students deserve the opportunity to obtain a high-\n        quality education and acquire the skills needed to compete in \n        21st-century economy.\n\nSEC. 3.
