    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Great Cats and Rare Canids Act of \n2004''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Many wild populations of felids and canids, once \n        considered common, are in decline, and many have declined to \n        the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in \n        serious jeopardy.\n            (2) Of the 37 wild felid species worldwide, all are \n        currently recognized as species in need of protection under the \n        IUCN Red List, the lists of species in CITES appendices I, II, \n        and III, or the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Of the 35 wild \n        canid species worldwide, nearly 50 percent are recognized as in \n        need of such protection.\n            (3) In addition to their intrinsic value, felids and canids \n        are important aesthetic, economic, and ecological global \n        resources that need to be conserved.\n            (4) Large felids and canids are considered both umbrella \n        and indicator species. Healthy populations of these species act \n        as an important indicator of the integrity of entire ecosystems \n        and, because they require large wild spaces to persist, benefit \n        entire ecosystems and a large number of other species. Measures \n        taken to benefit these keystone species will ultimately benefit \n        a great number of other species.\n            (5) Rare felids and rare canids face an array of threats, \n        including loss of habitat and natural prey, intentional and \n        unintentional takings by humans, disease transmission, and a \n        vast number of other threats. These threats need to be \n        addressed in a coordinated fashion.\n            (6) Conservation of rare felid and rare canid populations \n        requires global commitment. Adequate funding for conservation \n        is sorely lacking, and many range countries for those species \n        do not have adequate infrastructure to protect species of \n        concern. Those countries that do provide assistance to \n        threatened populations need further assistance in implementing \n        effective conservation strategies.\n            (7) In particular, in developing nations with limited \n        resources, poverty, population growth, and habitat loss all \n        present significant challenges to conservation of rare felids \n        and rare canids.\n            (8) Although some protections and initiatives exist to \n        conserve rare felid and rare canid populations and their \n        habitat, those efforts can be significantly strengthened and \n        enhanced by increased coordination and the infusion of targeted \n        funding to benefit species of concern.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are to provide financial resources and to \nfoster international cooperation--\n            (1) to restore and perpetuate healthy populations of rare \n        felids and rare canids in the wild; and\n            (2) to assist in the conservation of rare felid and rare \n        canid populations worldwide.\n\nSEC. 4.
