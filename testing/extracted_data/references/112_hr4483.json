    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Broadening Participation in STEM \nEducation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) One of the National Science Foundation's core missions \n        is ``to achieve excellence in U.S. science, technology, \n        engineering and mathematics (STEM) education''.\n            (2) STEM education at the undergraduate level is vital to \n        developing a workforce that will allow the United States to \n        remain the leader in the 21st century global economy.\n            (3) In 2007, underrepresented minority groups comprised \n        33.2 percent of the college-age population of the United \n        States, but only 17.7 percent of undergraduate students earning \n        bachelor's degrees in STEM fields.\n            (4) The Higher Education Research Institute at the \n        University of California, Los Angeles, found that, while \n        freshmen from underrepresented minority groups express an \n        interest in pursuing a STEM undergraduate degree at the same \n        rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino \n        students, 18.4 percent of African-American students, and 18.8 \n        percent of Native American students studying in STEM fields \n        complete their degree within 5 years, compared to an \n        approximate 33 percent and 42 percent 5-year completion rate \n        for White and Asian students, respectively.\n            (5) Statistics are particularly alarming in specific STEM \n        fields. For example, even though underrepresented minorities \n        make up approximately 33 percent of the college-age population, \n        according to an analysis of National Science Foundation data \n        performed by the National Action Council for Minorities in \n        Engineering, students from underrepresented minority groups \n        earned only 13 percent of all engineering degrees in 2009.\n            (6) Underrepresented minority groups currently make up \n        about 29 percent of the United States population. However, only \n        about 8 percent of tenure-track science and engineering faculty \n        members at universities and 4-year colleges and less than 1 \n        percent of tenure-track science and engineering faculty members \n        at the top 100 research universities in the United States are \n        from underrepresented minority groups.\n            (7) Students from underrepresented minority groups at \n        institutions of higher education who see few others ``like \n        themselves'' among faculty and student populations often do not \n        experience the social integration that is necessary for success \n        in all disciplines, including STEM.\n            (8) The ability to connect students and faculty members \n        from underrepresented minority groups has been demonstrated to \n        be successful in increasing the achievement level of students \n        from underrepresented minority groups studying in STEM fields.\n            (9) The United States faces a demographic challenge with \n        regard to STEM education: by 2050, 52 percent of the college-\n        age population of the United States will be from \n        underrepresented minority groups.\n            (10) If the percentage of students from underrepresented \n        minority groups earning bachelor's degrees in STEM fields does \n        not significantly increase, the United States will face an \n        acute shortfall in the overall number of students who earn \n        degrees in STEM fields.\n            (11) With this impending shortfall, and with the number of \n        citizens of other countries earning degrees in STEM fields \n        increasing, the comparative advantage of the United States STEM \n        workforce will diminish, and the United States will almost \n        certainly lose its competitive edge in the 21st century global \n        economy.\n\nSEC. 3.
