FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) The authorizations of most programs providing Federal \n        aid to elementary and secondary education, and support for \n        educational research, statistics, and assessment activities, \n        including programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education \n        Act of 1965 (ESEA), the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Goals \n        2000), the Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, \n        and Improvement Act of 1994 (ERDDIA), and the National \n        Education Statistics Act of 1994 (NESA), expired during the \n        106th Congress.\n            (2) The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \n        Education Act of 1965 is likely to occur during the 107th \n        Congress.\n            (3) The programs authorized under the Elementary and \n        Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Goals 2000: Educate \n        America Act, the Educational Research, Development, \n        Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994, and the National \n        Education Statistics Act of 1994, constitute the majority of \n        Federal grants for elementary and secondary education.\n            (4) The business community, and small businesses in \n        particular, have an important stake in the education of our \n        Nation's youth.\n            (5) One of the most fundamental needs that any growing \n        business will ever face is the need for employees with basic \n        skills.\n            (6) Concerns have been expressed by the small business \n        community that students are not graduating with adequate basic \n        skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and science that allow \n        the students to succeed in today's workplace or become the \n        entrepreneurs of tomorrow.\n            (7) A 1999 American Management Association survey on \n        workplace testing found that--\n                    (A) approximately 36 percent of employees tested \n                for basic skills (reading, writing and mathematics) \n                were found to be deficient;\n                    (B) small businesses had deficiency rates well \n                above the national average; and\n                    (C) 60 percent of American Management Association \n                member companies reported that the availability of \n                skilled manpower was scarce, and 67 percent believe \n                that the shortages will continue.\n            (8) A 1999 National Federation of Independent Business \n        report found that 18 percent of the members reported finding \n        qualified labor is the most important problem facing their \n        business.\n            (9) A 1999 poll of the United States Chambers of Commerce \n        found that 83 percent of the members reported the ability (or \n        lack thereof) to get qualified workers is among the members' \n        biggest concerns, and 53 percent of the members said education \n        is the single most pressing public policy issue for the \n        members.\n            (10) The growth of high-skilled jobs is outpacing growth in \n        all other fields.\n            (11) Small business is the driving force behind our \n        Nation's economy.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) locally-driven initiatives to improve education are \n        crucial;\n            (2) the views of small business should be taken into \n        account in the debate over education;\n            (3) in order to create jobs, our Nation must encourage \n        small business expansion and foster small business \n        entrepreneurship and job creation, and education initiatives \n        are key to this effort;\n            (4) the Department of Education should facilitate the \n        sharing of ideas and best practices at the State and local \n        level, particularly with respect to partnerships between small \n        businesses and school systems; and\n            (5) when and where Department of Education approval of a \n        program or proposal is required, the Department of Education \n        should expedite approval of such programs or proposals.\n\nSEC. 4. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION AND SHARING.\n\n    The Secretary of Education shall disseminate information and \nfacilitate the sharing of information designed to assist small \nbusinesses in working with school systems to improve the education \nsystem through publication of guidance materials, best practices, \nchecklists, and other formats on the World Wide Web, in Department of \nEducation publications and articles, in letters, through links to other \nrelated World Wide Web sites, through public service announcements, and \nthrough other means at the Department's disposal.\n\nSEC. 5.
