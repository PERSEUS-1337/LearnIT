FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The State of Utah owns approximately 176,600 acres of \n        land, as well as approximately 24,165 acres of mineral \n        interests, administered by the Utah School and Institutional \n        Trust Lands Administration, within the exterior boundaries of \n        the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, established by \n        Presidential proclamation on September 18, 1996, pursuant to \n        section 2 of the Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431). The \n        State of Utah also owns approximately 200,000 acres of land, \n        and 76,000 acres of mineral interests, administered by the Utah \n        School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, within the \n        exterior boundaries of several units of the National Park \n        System and the National Forest System, and within certain \n        Indian reservations in Utah. These lands were granted by \n        Congress to the State of Utah pursuant to the Utah Enabling \n        Act, chap. 138, 28 Stat. 107 (1894), to be held in trust for \n        the benefit of the State's public school system and other \n        public institutions.\n            (2) Many of the State school trust lands within the \n        monument may contain significant economic quantities of mineral \n        resources, including coal, oil, and gas, tar sands, coalbed \n        methane, titanium, uranium, and other energy and metalliferous \n        minerals. Certain State school trust lands within the Monument, \n        like the Federal lands comprising the Monument, have \n        substantial noneconomic scientific, historic, cultural, scenic, \n        recreational, and natural resources, including ancient Native \n        American archeological sites and rare plant and animal \n        communities.\n            (3) Development of surface and mineral resources on State \n        school trust lands within the monument could be incompatible \n        with the preservation of these scientific and historic \n        resources for which the monument was established. Federal \n        acquisition of State school trust lands within the monument \n        would eliminate this potential incompatibility, and would \n        enhance management of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National \n        Monument.\n            (4) The United States owns lands and interest in lands \n        outside of the monument that can be transferred to the State of \n        Utah in exchange for the monument inholdings without \n        jeopardizing Federal management objectives or needs.\n            (5) In 1993, Congress passed and the President signed \n        Public Law 103-93, which contained a process for exchanging \n        State of Utah school trust inholdings in the National Park \n        System, the National Forest System, and certain Indian \n        reservations in Utah. Among other things, it identified various \n        Federal lands and interests in land that were available to \n        exchange for these State inholdings.\n            (6) Although Public Law 103-93 offered the hope of a \n        prompt, orderly exchange of State inholdings for Federal lands \n        elsewhere, implementation of the legislation has been very \n        slow. Completion of this process is realistically estimated to \n        be many years away, at great expense to both the State and the \n        United States in the form of expert witnesses, lawyers, \n        appraisers, and other litigation costs.\n            (7) The State also owns approximately 2,560 acres of land \n        in or near the Alton coal field which has been declared an area \n        unsuitable for coal mining under the terms of the Surface \n        Mining Control and Reclamation Act. This land is also \n        administered by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands \n        Administration, but its use is limited given this declaration.\n            (8) The large presence of State school trust land \n        inholdings in the monument, national parks, national forests, \n        and Indian reservations make land and resource management in \n        these areas difficult, costly, and controversial for both the \n        State of Utah and the United States.\n            (9) It is in the public interest to reach agreement on \n        exchange of inholdings, on terms fair to both the State and the \nUnited States. Agreement saves much time and delay in meeting the \nexpectations of the State school and institutional trusts, in \nsimplifying management of Federal and Indian lands and resources, and \nin avoiding expensive, protracted litigation under Public Law 103-93.\n            (10) The State of Utah and the United States have reached \n        an agreement under which the State would exchange of all its \n        State school trust lands within the monument, and specified \n        inholdings in national parks, forests, and Indian reservations \n        that are subject to Public Law 103-93, for various Federal \n        lands and interests in lands located outside the monument, \n        including Federal lands and interests identified as available \n        for exchange in Public Law 103-93 and additional Federal lands \n        and interests in lands.\n            (11) The State school trust lands to be conveyed to the \n        Federal Government include properties within units of the \n        National Park System, the National Forest System, and the Grand \n        Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The Federal assets made \n        available for exchange with the State were selected with a \n        great sensitivity to environmental concerns and a belief and \n        expectation by both parties that Federal assets to be conveyed \n        to the State would be unlikely to trigger significant \n        environmental controversy.\n            (12) The parties agreed at the outset of negotiations to \n        avoid identifying Federal assets for conveyance to the State \n        where any of the following was known to exist or likely to be \n        an issue as a result of foreseeable future uses of the land: \n        significant wildlife resources, endangered species habitat, \n        significant archaeological resources, areas of critical \n        environmental concern, coal resources requiring surface mining \n        to extract the mineral deposits, wilderness study areas, \n        significant recreational areas, or any other lands known to \n        raise significant environmental concerns of any kind.\n            (13) The parties further agreed that the use of any mineral \n        interests obtained by the State of Utah where the Federal \n        Government retains surface and other interest, will not \n        conflict with established Federal land and environmental \n        management objectives, and shall be fully subject to all \n        environmental regulations applicable to development of non-\n        Federal mineral interest on Federal lands.\n            (14) Because the inholdings to be acquired by the Federal \n        Government include properties within the boundaries of some of \n        the most renowned conservation land units in the United States, \n        and because a mission of the Utah School and Institutional \n        Trust Lands Administration is to produce economic benefits for \n        Utah's public schools and other beneficiary institutions, the \n        exchange of lands called for in this agreement will resolve \n        many longstanding environmental conflicts and further the \n        interest of the State trust lands, the school children of Utah, \n        and these conservation resources.\n            (15) The Congress finds that, under this Agreement taken as \n        a whole, the State interests to be conveyed to the United \n        States by the State of Utah, and the Federal interests and \n        payments to be conveyed to the State of Utah by the United \n        States, are approximately equal in value.\n            (16) The purpose of this legislation is to enact into law \n        and direct prompt implementation of this historic agreement.\n\nSEC. 3. RATIFICATION OF AGREED EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE STATE OF UTAH AND \n              THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.\n\n    (a) Agreement.--The State of Utah and the Department of the \nInterior have agreed to exchange certain Federal lands, Federal mineral \ninterests, and payment of money for lands and mineral interests managed \nby the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, lands \nand mineral interests of approximately equal value inheld within the \nGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument the Goshute and Navajo \nIndian Reservations, units of the national park system, the national \nforest system, and the Alton coal fields.\n    (b) Ratification.--All terms, conditions, procedures, covenants, \nreservations, and other provisions set forth in the document entitled \n``Agreement to Exchange Utah School Trust Lands Between the State of \nUtah and the United States of America'' (herein referred to as ``the \nAgreement'') are hereby incorporated in this title, are ratified and \nconfirmed, and set forth the obligations and commitments of the United \nStates, the State of Utah, and Utah School and Institutional Trust \nLands Administration (herein referred to as ``SITLA''), as a matter of \nFederal law.\n\nSEC. 4.

COSTS.\n\n    The United States and the State of Utah shall each bear its own \nrespective costs incurred in the implementation of this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. REPEAL OF PUBLIC LAW 103-93 AND PUBLIC LAW 104-211.\n\n    The provisions of Public law 103-93 (107 Stat. 995), other than \nsection 7(b)(1), section 7(b)(3) and section 10(b) thereof, are hereby \nrepealed.
