FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the United States has entered into numerous trade \n        agreements with foreign country trading partners;\n            (2) foreign country performance with respect to certain \n        agreements has been less than contemplated, and in some cases \n        rises to the level of noncompliance; and\n            (3) there is a need to provide a mechanism whereby \n        interested parties can obtain a periodic review of the \n        performance of a foreign country under a trade agreement.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to ensure that foreign countries which have made \n        commitments through agreements with the United States fully \n        abide by those commitments;\n            (2) to obtain foreign country compliance with agreements \n        with the United States through negotiation or, in the \n        alternative, through unilateral action in cases in which the \n        GATT dispute settlement procedures cannot be employed;\n            (3) to achieve a more open world trading system which \n        provides mutually advantageous market opportunities for trade \n        between the United States and foreign countries;\n            (4) to facilitate the opening of foreign country markets to \n        exports of the United States and third countries by eliminating \n        trade barriers and increasing the access of industry of the \n        United States and third countries to such markets; and\n            (5) to reduce diversion of third country exports to the \n        United States because of restricted market access in foreign \n        countries.\n\nSEC. 3. REVIEW OF TRADE AGREEMENTS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 1 of title III of the Trade Act of 1974 \n(19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 306, the \nfollowing new section:\n\n``SEC. 306A.
