the Americans held hostage in Iran \n        and their immediate family members, who are identified as \n        members of the proposed class in case number 1:00-CV-03110 \n        (EGS) of the United States District Court for the District of \n        Columbia; and\n            (2) satisfying the claims against Iran relating to the \n        taking of hostages and treatment of personnel of

State, the Department of the Treasury, the Department \n                of Justice, the Department of Commerce, or the \n                Department of Energy.\n                    (C) Termination of
