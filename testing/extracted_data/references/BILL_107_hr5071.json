FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The al Qaeda terrorist organization and its leaders \n        have committed unlawful attacks against the United States, \n        including the August 7, 1998 bombings of the United States \n        embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the \n        October 12, 2000 attack on the USS COLE and the September 11, \n        2001 attacks on the United States.\n            (2) The al Qaeda terrorist organization and its leaders \n        have threatened renewed attacks on the United States and have \n        threatened the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n            (3) In violation of the resolutions of the United Nations, \n        the Taliban of Afghanistan provided a safe haven to the al \n        Qaeda terrorist organization and its leaders and allowed the \n        territory of that country to be used as a base from which to \n        sponsor international terrorist operations.\n            (4) The United Nations Security Council, in Resolution \n        1267, declared in 1999 that the actions of the Taliban \n        constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n            (5) The United Nations Security Council, in Resolutions \n        1368 and 1373, declared in September 2001 that the September 11 \n        attacks against the United States constitute a threat to \n        international peace and security.\n            (6) The United States is justified in exercising its right \n        of self-defense pursuant to international law and the United \n        Nations Charter.\n            (7) Congress authorized the President on September 18, \n        2001, to use all necessary and appropriate force against those \n        nations, organizations, or persons that he determines to have \n        planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11 \n        terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons, in \n        order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism \n        against the United States, within the meaning of section 5(b) \n        of the War Powers Resolution.\n            (8) The United States and its allies are engaged in armed \n        conflict with al Qaeda and the Taliban.\n            (9) Military trials of the terrorists may be appropriate to \n        protect the safety of the public and those involved in the \n        investigation and prosecution, to facilitate the use of \n        classified information as evidence without compromising \n        intelligence or military efforts, and otherwise to protect \n        national security interests.\n            (10) Military trials that provide basic procedural \n        guarantees of fairness, consistent with the international law \n        of armed conflict and the International Covenant on Civil and \n        Political Rights (opened for signature December 16, 1966), \n        would garner the support of the community of nations.\n            (11) Due process, including the writ of habeas corpus and \n        the right to an appeals process, must be afforded to any person \n        subject to a military tribunal.\n            (12) Preliminary proceedings should be established to \n        determine whether jurisdiction over the person and over the \n        charge is properly vested in the tribunal.\n            (13) Article I, section 8, of the Constitution provides \n        that the Congress, not the President, has the power to \n        ``constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court; ... \n        define and punish ... Offenses against the Law of Nations; ... \n        make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; ... make all \n        Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into \n        Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by \n        this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in \n        any Department or Officer thereof.''.\n            (14) Without protections and reporting requirements in \n        place, persons detained for an indefinite amount of time would \n        have no recourse. A significant danger exists that due process \n        might be evaded simply by failing to bring detainees before a \n        tribunal for trial.\n            (15) Congressional authorization is necessary for the \n        establishment of extraordinary tribunals to adjudicate and \n        punish offenses arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks \n        against the United States and to provide a clear and \n        unambiguous legal foundation for such trials.\n            (16) Judicial review of individual detentions is best \n        handled by a court that would not have to appoint special \n        masters or magistrates to do the necessary fact finding.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY TRIBUNALS.\n\n    (a) Authority.--The President is hereby authorized to establish \ntribunals for the trial of individuals who--\n            (1) are not United States persons or residents;\n            (2) are members of al Qaeda who knowingly planned, \n        authorized, committed, aided, or abetted one or more terrorist \n        acts against the United States, or members of other terrorist \n        organizations who knowingly cooperated with members of al Qaeda \n        in planning, authorizing, committing, aiding, or abetting one \nor more terrorists acts against the United States; and\n            (3) are not prisoners of war within the meaning of the \n        Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of \n        War, done on August 12, 1949.\n    (b) Jurisdiction.--Tribunals established under subsection (a) may \nadjudicate violations of the law of war, international laws of armed \nconflict, and crimes against humanity targeted against United States \npersons or residents.\n    (c) Authority To Establish Procedural Rules.--The Secretary of \nDefense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney \nGeneral, shall prescribe and publish in the Federal Register, and \nreport to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House \nof Representatives, the rules of evidence and procedure that are to \napply to tribunals established under subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4.
