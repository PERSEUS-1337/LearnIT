FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the region adjacent to the 2,000-mile border between \n        the United States and Mexico is an important region for energy-\n        intensive manufacturing and materials industries critical to \n        the economic and social wellbeing of both countries;\n            (2) there are currently more than 800 multinational firms \n        (including firms known as ``maquiladoras'') representing United \n        States investments of more than $1,000,000,000 in the San \n        Diego, California, and Tijuana, Baja California, border region \n        and in the El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Chihuahua, border \n        region;\n            (3) materials and materials-related industries comprise a \n        major portion of the industries operating on both sides of the \n        border, amounting to more than $6,800,000,000 in annual \n        commerce on the Mexican side alone;\n            (4) there are a significant number of major institutions in \n        the border States of both countries currently conducting \n        academic and research activities in materials;\n            (5)(A) the United States Government currently invests \n        approximately $1,000,000,000 annually in materials research, of \n        which, in 1996, the Department of Energy funded the largest \n        proportion of civilian materials research; and\n            (B) there are also major materials programs at the National \n        Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and \n        Technology, and Department of Defense, among other entities;\n            (6) the United States and Mexico have invested heavily in \n        domestic and binational cooperative programs to address major \n        concerns for the natural resources, environment, and public \n        health of the United States-Mexico border region, expending \n        hundreds of millions of dollars annually in those efforts;\n            (7)(A) scientific and technical advances in materials and \n        materials processing provide major opportunities for--\n                    (i) significantly improving energy efficiency;\n                    (ii) reducing emissions of global climate change \n                gases;\n                    (iii) using recycled natural resources as primary \n                materials for industrial production; and\n                    (iv) minimizing industrial wastes and pollution; \n                and\n            (B) such advances will directly benefit both sides of the \n        United States-Mexico border by encouraging energy efficient, \n        environmentally sound economic development that protects the \n        health and natural resources of the border region;\n            (8)(A) promoting clean materials industries in the border \n        region that are energy efficient has been identified as a high \n        priority issue by the United States-Mexico Foundation for \n        Science Cooperation; and\n            (B) at the 1998 discussions of the United States-Mexico \n        Binational Commission, Mexico formally proposed joint funding \n        of a ``Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative'', proposing \n        $1,000,000 to implement the Initiative if matched by the United \n        States;\n            (9) recognizing the importance of materials and materials \n        processing, academic and research institutions in the border \n        States of both the United States and Mexico, in conjunction \n        with private sector partners of both countries, and with strong \n        endorsement from the Government of Mexico, in 1998 organized \n        the Materials Corridor Council to implement a cooperative \n        program of materials research and development, education and \n        training, and sustainable industrial development as part of the \n        Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative; and\n            (10) successful implementation of the Materials Corridor \n        Partnership Initiative would advance important United States \n        energy, environmental, and economic goals not only in the \n        United States-Mexico border region but also as a model for \n        similar collaborative materials initiatives in other regions of \n        the world.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a multiagency program in \nsupport of the Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative referred to in \nsection 2(8) to promote energy efficient, environmentally sound \neconomic development along the United States-Mexico border through the \nresearch, development, and use of new materials technology.\n\nSEC. 4.
