SHORT TITLE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Stimulating \nLeadership in Cutting Expenditures Act of 2005''.\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) large areas of several States, including many large and \n        small communities, have suffered numerous deaths and widespread \n        destruction as a result of recent hurricanes and other natural \n        disasters;\n            (2) millions of Americans have been forced to flee their \n        homes, and in some cases have been left homeless, by those \n        disasters;\n            (3) the adverse consequences for the regional and national \n        economy are expected to be substantial and ongoing;\n            (4) Congress has responded by providing large amounts of \n        funding to enable the Government to assist States, local \n        authorities, and individuals most affected by those disasters;\n            (5) substantial additional appropriations for these \n        purposes probably will be required in the future;\n            (6) Federal expenditures for other purposes already exceed \n        revenues, so unless offset by increased revenues or reductions \n        in other expenditures, funding for these purposes will increase \n        the national debt that must be repaid, with interest, in the \n        future;\n            (7) the President has indicated that he thinks funds \n        provided for other purposes can be reduced in order to offset \n        some or all of these costs; and\n            (8) however, under current law, the Congress is not \n        required to act on any such proposals by the President.\n    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to enable the President to \nrequire Congress to debate and vote on certain presidential proposals \nfor reducing other spending in order to offset amounts appropriated in \nresponse to the effects of recent natural disasters.\n\nSEC. 2. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN PROPOSED SPENDING \n              REDUCTIONS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Part B of title X of the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 681 et seq.) is amended by \nredesignating sections 1013 through 1017 as sections 1014 through 1018, \nrespectively, and inserting after section 1012 the following new \nsection:\n\n       ``expedited consideration of certain proposed rescissions\n\n    ``Sec. 1013.
