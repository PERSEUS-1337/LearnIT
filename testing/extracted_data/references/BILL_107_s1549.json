FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings with respect \nto the value of the technically trained workforce to the United States:\n            (1) Studies show that about half of all United States post-\n        World War II economic growth is a direct result of \n        technological innovation, and science, engineering, and \n        technology play a central role in the creation of new goods and \n        services, new jobs, and new capital.\n            (2) The growth in the number of jobs requiring technical \n        skills is projected to be more than 50 percent over the next \n        decade.\n            (3) A workforce that is highly trained in science, \n        mathematics, engineering, and technology is crucial to \n        generating the innovation that drives economic growth.\n            (4) Outside of the biomedical sciences, the number of \n        undergraduate degrees awarded in the science, mathematics, \n        engineering, and technology disciplines has been flat or \n        declining since 1987, despite rapid population growth and a \n        significant increase in undergraduate enrollment over the same \n        period.\n            (5) The demand for H-1B visas has increased over the past \n        several years, suggesting that the United States is not \n        training a sufficient number of scientists and engineers.\n            (6) In international comparisons of 24-year olds, there \n        have been shown to be fewer holders of natural science and \n        engineering degrees in the United States than in Japan, South \n        Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n            (7) Technological and scientific advancements hold \n        significant potential for elevating the quality of life and the \n        standard of living in the United States. The quality and \n        quantity of such advancements are dependent on a technically \n        trained workforce.\n            (8) Arresting the trends in reduced numbers of science and \n        engineering graduates is not only imperative to maintaining our \n        Nation's prosperity, it is also important for our national \n        security.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) Community college.--The term ``community college'' \n        means an institution of higher education that provides not less \n        than a 2-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward \n        a bachelor's degree, including institutions receiving \n        assistance under the Tribally Controlled Community College \n        Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).\n            (2) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n        the National Science Foundation.\n            (3) Institution of higher education.--The term \n        ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given the \n        term in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n        U.S.C. 1001(a)).\n\nSEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Director is authorized to award grants, on a \ncompetitive basis to institutions of higher education with science, \nmathematics, engineering, or technology programs to enable the \ninstitutions to increase the number of students studying and receiving \nassociates or bachelor's degrees in established or emerging fields \nwithin science, mathematics, engineering, and technology.\n    (b) Requirements.--\n            (1) Number.--The Director shall award not fewer than 10 \n        grants under this Act each year contingent upon available \n        funds.\n            (2) Duration.--Grants under this Act shall be awarded for a \n        period of 3 years, with the final year of funding contingent \n        upon the Director's determination that satisfactory progress \n        has been made by the institution or community college during \n        the first 2 years of the grant period.\n            (3) Principal Investigator.--At least 1 principal \n        investigator must be in a position of administrative leadership \nat the institution of higher education. Multiple principal \ninvestigators shall be permitted.\n            (4) Subsequent grants.--Institutions of higher education \n        that have received grants under this Act shall be eligible to \n        compete for subsequent grants to enable the institutions to \n        continue making progress toward program goals after the initial \n        grant period ends. In reviewing the grant application from such \n        an institution, the Director is encouraged to consider--\n                    (A) the progress the institution has made, using \n                grant funds received under this Act, toward achieving \n                program goals; and\n                    (B) whether the successive grant application of the \n                institution includes a novel strategy for achieving \n                subsequent goals.\n            (5) Increases.--\n                    (A) Institutions of higher education with \n                bachelor's degree programs.--An institution of higher \n                education that awards bachelor's degrees and desires to \n                receive a grant under this Act shall propose specific \n                increases in the number of students who are United \n                States citizens or permanent resident aliens, obtaining \n                bachelor's degrees at the institution in established or \n                emerging fields within science, mathematics, \n                engineering, or technology.\n                    (B) Community colleges.--A community college that \n                desires to receive a grant under this Act shall propose \n                specific increases in the number of students who are \n                United States citizens or permanent resident aliens, \n                obtaining associate degrees in established or emerging \n                fields within science, mathematics, engineering, or \n                technology, and are encouraged to facilitate the \n                enrollment of such students in bachelor's degree \n                programs.\n            (6) Peer review of applications.--The Director shall review \n        grant applications under this Act on the basis of a peer review \n        process.\n            (7) Priority.--The Director is encouraged to give priority \n        in awarding grants to institutions of higher education that \n        enable such institutions to carry out programs--\n                    (A) that increase the number of students studying \n                and receiving associates and bachelor's degrees in \n                established or emerging fields within science, \n                mathematics, engineering, or technology where there is \n                a specific industry need or where the number of \n                graduates has been flat or declining in recent years; \n                and\n                    (B) that draw on previous and existing efforts with \n                demonstrated success in improving undergraduate \n                learning and teaching, including those efforts funded \n                by Federal grants from the National Science Foundation \n                or other agencies.\n            (8) National science foundation science and engineering \n        talent expansion center.--An institution of higher education \n        that is awarded a grant under this Act shall be known as a \n        ``National Science Foundation Science and Engineering Talent \n        Expansion Center''.\n\nSEC. 4.
