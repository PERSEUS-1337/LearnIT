FINDINGS, PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) The disability and death of infants resulting from \n        injuries sustained in crib incidents are a serious threat to \n        the public health, welfare, and safety of people of this \n        country.\n            (2) The design and construction of a baby crib must ensure \n        that it is safe to leave an infant unattended for extended \n        periods of time. A parent or caregiver has a right to believe \n        that the crib in use is a safe place to leave an infant.\n            (3) Each year more than 9,000 children ages 4 and under are \n        injured in cribs seriously enough to require hospital \n        treatment.\n            (4) Each year at least 45 children ages 4 and under die \n        from injuries sustained in cribs.\n            (5) The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission \n        estimates that the cost to society resulting from deaths due to \n        cribs is 225 million dollars per year.\n            (6) Secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs pose a \n        special problem. There are nearly 4 million infants born in \n        this country each year, but only one million new cribs sold. As \n        many as 2 out of 4 infants are placed in secondhand, hand-me-\n        down, or heirloom cribs.\n            (7) Most crib deaths occur in secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n        heirloom cribs.\n            (8) Existing State and Federal legislation is inadequate to \n        deal with the hazard presented by secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n        heirloom cribs .\n            (9) Prohibiting the contracting to sell, resell, lease, \n        sublease of unsafe cribs which are not new, or otherwise place \n        in the stream of commerce unsafe secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n        heirloom cribs, will prevent injuries and deaths caused by \n        cribs.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purpose of this Act is to prevent the occurrence \nof injuries and deaths to infants as a result of unsafe cribs by making \nit illegal to manufacture, sell, or contract to sell any crib which is \nunsafe for any infant using the crib and to resell, lease, sublet, or \notherwise place in the stream of commerce, after the effective date of \nthis Act, any crib which is not new and which is unsafe for any infant \nusing the crib.\n\nSEC. 3.
