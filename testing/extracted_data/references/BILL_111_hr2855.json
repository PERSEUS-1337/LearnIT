FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Drug overdose death is now second only to motor vehicle \n        crashes as a leading cause of injury-related death nationally. \n        Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden on \n        public health resources, yet no Federal agency has been tasked \n        with stemming this crisis.\n            (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n        that 33,541 deaths in the United States in 2005 were \n        attributable to drug-induced causes. Sixty-seven percent of \n        these deaths were due to unintentional drug poisonings and \n        could have been prevented.\n            (3) Deaths resulting from accidental drug overdoses \n        increased more than 400 percent between 1980 and 1999, and more \n        than doubled between 1999 and 2005.\n            (4) Ninety-five percent of all unintentional and \n        undetermined intent poisoning deaths are due to drugs, and \n        poisoning deaths cost society more than $2,200,000,000 in \n        direct medical costs and $23,000,000,000 in lost productivity \n        costs in the year 2000 alone.\n            (5) According to the Federal Drug Abuse Warning Network, \n        most drug-related deaths involve multiple drugs including \n        prescription opioids and alcohol. Opioid overdose deaths are \n        occurring among those who are taking pharmaceutical opioid \n        drugs, like oxycodone and hydrocodone, and among heroin users.\n            (6) Community-based programs working with high-risk \n        populations have successfully prevented deaths from opioid \n        overdoses through education and access to effective reversal \n        agents, such as naloxone.\n            (7) Naloxone is a highly effective opioid antagonist that \n        reverses overdose from both prescription opioids and heroin.\n            (8) Public health programs to make naloxone available to \n        people at-risk of a drug overdose are currently operating in \n        major cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New \n        York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and \n        statewide in 3 States including New Mexico, Massachusetts, and \n        New York. A naloxone distribution program in Boston saved more \n        than 170 lives in the last year alone.\n            (9) Between 2001 and January 2008, it is estimated that \n        more than 2,600 overdoses have been reversed in 16 programs \n        across the Nation.\n            (10) Many fatal drug overdoses occur in the presence of \n        witnesses who can respond effectively to an overdose when \n        properly trained and equipped.\n            (11) Overdose prevention programs are needed in \n        correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and \n        other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing \n        after a period of abstinence.\n\nSEC. 3.
