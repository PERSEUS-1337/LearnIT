FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) On January 22, 2009, President Obama signed Executive \n        Order 13492, requiring the detention facilities at the \n        Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (Guantanamo) to be closed ``as soon \n        as practicable'', but not later than one year from the date of \n        the order.\n            (2) A task force of United States Government agencies, \n        including the Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, State, \n        and Justice and the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal \n        Bureau of Investigation, has reportedly concluded that large \n        numbers of the detainees held at the United States military \n        facility at Guantanamo pose a severe and permanent threat \n        United States national security and thus should be held \n        indefinitely without trial under the laws of war.\n            (3) Despite this conclusion by United States national \n        security and intelligence agencies, the Obama Administration \n        continues to plan for additional transfers of detainees to \n        other countries.\n            (4) According to a report by the Government Accountability \n        Office, as of March 2009, the principal ``rehabilitation \n        center'' in Saudi Arabia used to rehabilitate 250 former \n        Guantanamo detainees in order to prevent such detainees from \n        resuming their war on the United States had a recidivism rate \n        of 20 percent.\n            (5) In July 2007, a Department of Defense spokesman stated \n        that, ``Our reports indicate that at least 30 former Guantanamo \n        detainees have taken part in anti-coalition militant activities \n        after leaving United States detention. Some have been killed in \n        combat in Afghanistan and Pakistan.''. According to the \n        Department of Defense, the recidivism rate of all former \n        Guantanamo detainees was 14 percent in May 2009.\n            (6) In some instances, countries and organizations have \n        expressed strong reluctance to accept any or additional former \n        Guantanamo detainees, citing security as their primary concern, \n        such as:\n                    (A) Australia: ``Assessing those requests from a \n                case-by-case basis, they had not met our stringent \n                national security and immigration criteria and have \n                been rejected.'', stated Julia Gillard, Acting \n                Australian Prime Minister, on January 3, 2009.\n                    (B) Hungary: ``Hungary is likely to take one or two \n                former detainees provided they get the green light from \n                parliament after a national security check-up. . . . We \n                are going to study each case, taking the safety of \n                Hungary and of Hungarians as our first priority.'', \n                announced Hungarian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman \n                Zsuzsanna Matrai on June 19, 2009.\n                    (C) Switzerland: On January 12, 2010, in a 15-10 \n                vote, a Swiss Parliamentary Security Committee voted \n                against accepting any more detainees from Guantanamo, \n                citing ``heightened'' security concerns due to the \n                Christmas Detroit bombing attempt.\n                    (D) European Parliament: ``Many of the detainees, \n                for example, who went to Afghanistan after September \n                11, [2001,] have attended training camps for \n                terrorists. And those who did so were no tourists \n                wanting to admire the beauty of the country, but remain \n                potential terrorists.'', stated Harthmuth Nassauer, a \n                German member of the European Parliament, on February \n                4, 2009.\n\nSEC. 2.
