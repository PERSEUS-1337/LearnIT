FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Before acting on proposed private sector mandates, the \n        Congress should carefully consider the effects on consumers, \n        workers, and small businesses.\n            (2) The Congress has often acted without adequate \n        information concerning the costs of private sector mandates, \n        instead focusing only on the benefits.\n            (3) The costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by consumers, in the form of higher prices and reduced \n        availability of goods and services.\n            (4) The costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by workers, in the form of lower wages, reduced benefits, \n        and fewer job opportunities.\n            (5) The costs of private sector mandates are often borne in \n        part by small businesses, in the form of hiring disincentives \n        and stunted growth.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n    The purposes of this Act are the following:\n            (1) To improve the quality of the Congress' deliberation \n        with respect to proposed mandates on the private sector, by--\n                    (A) providing the Congress with more complete \n                information about the effects of such mandates; and\n                    (B) ensuring that the Congress acts on such \n                mandates only after focused deliberation on the \n                effects.\n            (2) To enhance the ability of the Congress to distinguish \n        between private sector mandates that harm consumers, workers, \n        and small businesses, and mandates that help those groups.\n\nSEC. 4.
