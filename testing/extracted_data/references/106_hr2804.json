CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 \n        U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) established new and expanded units of the \n        National Park System and the National Wildlife System in many \n        areas of Alaska. The purposes of these conservation system \n        units were, among other purposes, to protect habitat for fish \n        and wildlife, to conserve fish and wildlife populations in \n        their natural state, to provide continued opportunity for \n        subsistence uses by local residents, and to protect \n        archaeological sites associated with Native cultures.\n            (2) Many rural Alaskan communities are in close proximity \n        to conservation system lands, and the purposes of these units \n        are uniquely relevant to the culture and ways of Native \n        Alaskans and other residents of rural Alaskan communities. \n        Congress recognized this close relationship in sections 1306, \n        1307 and 1308 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n        Conservation Act, which directed the Secretary of Interior to \n        establish programs whereby Native lands were given preference \n        for the siting of conservation service unit facilities, Native \n        corporations and local residents were given preference for the \n        provision of visitor services, and local residents were given \n        preferences for employment. Despite these provisions, little \n        progress has been made in increasing related employment \n        opportunities for Native Alaskan and other local residents.\n            (3) In much of rural Alaska, Indian tribes and tribal \n        organizations have a long history of contracting to operate \n        Federal programs and provide Federal services to resident \n        Alaskan Natives and have demonstrated the capacity to provide \n        other kinds of Federal programs and services.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this demonstration project are to \ndesign innovative management strategies that will lead to greater \nefficiency in conservation system unit management, expand Native \ncontracting opportunities, increase local employment, and further the \nunique purposes of these units as they relate to subsistence practices, \nAlaska Native cultures, and the preservation of fish and wildlife \nhabitat and populations.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n    The Secretary of the Interior shall, for a period not to exceed 5 \nyears following the date of the enactment of this Act, conduct an \nAlaska Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project.\n\nSEC. 4.

If, after \n        applying such criteria, there remains more than one eligible \n        participant and such participants have overlapping requests to \n        negotiate and contract for the same programs, services, \n        functions, and activities, or portions thereof, the Secretary \n        may require such Indian tribes or organizations to agree which \n        entity shall have the ability to contract, or to submit a joint \n        request prior to entering into negotiations.\n    (c) Contracts.--\n            (1) In general.--Upon request, the Secretary shall \n        negotiate and enter into a contract with each participating \n        Indian tribe or tribal organization to plan, conduct and \n        administer requested programs, services, functions and \n        activities, or portions thereof, related to the administration \n        of a conservation system unit or other public land unit that is \n        substantially located within the geographic region of the \n        respective Indian tribe or tribal organization.\n            (2) Technical support.--Contracts authorized by this Act \n        shall include, at the request of the Indian tribe or tribal \n        organization, the operation and support of the regional \nadvisory councils, biological research, harvest monitoring, and other \ntechnical research related to conservation and allocation actions by \nthe regional councils, and such other programs, functions, services, \nand activities reasonably necessary to carry out title VIII of the \nAlaska National Interests Lands Conservation Act.\n            (3) Time limitation for negotiation of contracts.--Not \n        later than 90 days after selection by the Secretary of \n        participating Indian tribes or tribal organizations, the \n        Secretary shall initiate and conclude negotiations, unless an \n        alternative negotiation and implementation schedule is \n        otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties.
