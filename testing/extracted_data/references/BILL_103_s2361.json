FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians are \n        descendants and political successors to the Indians that signed \n        the treaty between the United States and the Ottawa and \n        Chippewa nations of Indians at Washington, D.C. on March 28, \n        1836, and the treaty between the United States and the Ottawa \n        and Chippewa Indians of Michigan at Detroit on July 31, 1855.\n            (2) The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, \n        the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, and the Bay \n        Mills Band of Chippewa Indians, whose members are also \n        descendants of the Indians that signed the treaties referred to \n        in paragraph (1), have been recognized by the Federal \n        Government as distinct Indian tribes.\n            (3) The Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians \n        consists of over 600 eligible members who continue to reside \n        close to their ancestral homeland as recognized in the \n        reservations of lands under the treaties referred to in \n        paragraph (1) in the area that is currently known as Cheboygan \n        County, Michigan.\n            (4) The Band continues to exist and carry out political and \n        social activities with a viable tribal government.\n            (5) The Band, along with other Michigan Odawa and Ottawa \n        groups, including the tribes described in paragraph (2), formed \n        the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association in 1948.\n            (6) The Northern Michigan Ottawa Association subsequently \n        submitted a successful land claim with the Indian Claims \n        Commission.\n            (7) During the period between 1948 and 1975, the Band \n        carried out many governmental functions through the Northern \n        Michigan Ottawa Association, and at the same time retained \n        control over local decisions.\n            (8) In 1975, the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association \n        submitted a petition under the Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly \n        referred to as the ``Indian Reorganization Act'') (48 Stat. 984 \n        et seq., chapter 576; 25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.), to form a \n        government on behalf of the Band.\n            (9) In spite of the eligibility of the Band to form a \n        government under such Act, the Bureau of Indian Affairs failed \n        to act on such petition.\n            (10) From 1836 to the date of enactment of this Act, the \n        Federal Government, the government of the State of Michigan, \n        and political subdivisions of the State have had continuous \n        dealings with the recognized political leaders of the Band.\n\nSEC. 3.
