FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There are more than 1,800,000 people in the United \n        States living with limb loss.\n            (2) Every year, there are more than 130,000 people in the \n        United States who undergo amputation procedures.\n            (3) In addition, United States military personnel serving \n        in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world have sustained \n        traumatic injuries resulting in amputation.\n            (4) The number of amputations in the United States is \n        projected to increase in the years ahead due to the rising \n        incidence of diabetes and other chronic illness.\n            (5) Those suffering from limb loss can and want to regain \n        their lives as productive members of society.\n            (6) Prosthetic devices enable amputees to continue working \n        and living productive lives.\n            (7) Insurance companies have begun to limit reimbursement \n        of prosthetic equipment costs to unrealistic levels or not at \n        all and often restrict coverage over an individual's lifetime, \n        which shifts costs onto the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n            (8) Eleven States have addressed this problem and have \n        prosthetic parity legislation.\n            (9) Prosthetic parity legislation has been introduced and \n        is being actively considered in 30 States.\n            (10) The States in which prosthetic parity laws have been \n        enacted have found there to be minimal or no increases in \n        insurance premiums and have reduced Medicare and Medicaid \n        costs.\n            (11) Prosthetic parity legislation will not add to the size \n        of government or to the costs associated with the Medicare and \n        Medicaid programs.\n            (12) If coverage for prosthetic devices and components are \n        offered by a group health insurance policy, then providing such \n        coverage of prosthetic devices on par with other medical and \n        surgical benefits will not increase the incidence of \n        amputations or the number of individuals for which a prosthetic \n        device would be medically necessary and appropriate.\n            (13) In States where prosthetic parity legislation has been \n        enacted, amputees are able to return to a productive life, \n        State funds have been saved, and the health insurance industry \n        has continued to prosper.\n            (14) Prosthetic services allow people to return more \n        quickly to their preexisting work.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is te purpose of this Act to require that each \ngroup health plan that provides both coverage for prosthetic devices \nand components and medical and surgical benefits, provide such coverage \nunder terms and conditions that are no less favorable that the terms \nand conditions under which such benefits are provided for other \nbenefits under such plan.\n\nSEC. 3.
