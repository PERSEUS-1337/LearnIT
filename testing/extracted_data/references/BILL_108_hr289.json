SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge \nComplex Expansion and Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge \nExpansion Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n        (1) the western basin of Lake Erie, as part of the Great Lakes \n    ecosystem--\n            (A) is the largest freshwater ecosystem in the world; and\n            (B) is vitally important to the economic and environmental \n        future of the United States;\n        (2) over the 30-year period preceding the date of enactment of \n    this Act, the citizens and governmental institutions of the United \n    States and Canada have devoted increasing attention and resources \n    to the restoration of the water quality and fisheries of the Great \n    Lakes, including the western basin;\n        (3) that increased awareness has been accompanied by a gradual \n    shift toward a holistic ecosystem approach that highlights a \n    growing recognition that shoreline areas, commonly referred to as \n    nearshore terrestrial ecosystems, are an integral part of the \n    western basin and the Great Lakes ecosystem;\n        (4) the Great Lakes account for more than 90 percent of the \n    surface freshwater in the United States;\n        (5) the western basin receives approximately 90 percent of its \n    flow from the Detroit River and only approximately 10 percent from \n    tributaries;\n        (6) the western basin is an important ecosystem that includes a \n    number of distinct islands, channels, rivers, and shoals that \n    support dense populations of fish, wildlife, and aquatic plants;\n        (7) coastal wetland of Lake Erie supports the largest diversity \n    of plant and wildlife species in the Great Lakes;\n        (8) because Lake Erie is located at a more southern latitude \n    than other Great Lakes, the moderate climate of Lake Erie is \n    appropriate for many species that are not found in or along the \n    northern Great Lakes;\n        (9) more than 300 species of plants, including 37 significant \n    species, have been identified in the aquatic and wetland habitats \n    of the western basin;\n        (10) the shallow western basin of Lake Erie, extending from the \n    Lower Detroit River to Sandusky Bay, is home to the greatest \n    concentration of marshes in Lake Erie, including--\n            (A) Mouille, Metzger, and Magee marshes;\n            (B) the Maumee Bay wetland complex;\n            (C) the wetland complexes flanking Locust Point; and\n            (D) the wetland in Sandusky Bay;\n        (11) the larger islands of the United States in western Lake \n    Erie have wetland in small embayments;\n        (12) the wetland in the western basin comprises some of the \n    most important waterfowl habitat in the Great Lakes;\n        (13) waterfowl, wading birds, shore birds, gulls and terns, \n    raptors, and perching birds use the wetland in the western basin \n    for migration, nesting, and feeding;\n        (14) hundreds of thousands of diving ducks stop to rest in the \n    Lake Erie area during autumn migration from Canada to points east \n    and south;\n        (15) the wetland of the western basin provides a major stopover \n    for ducks, such as migrating bufflehead, common goldeneye, common \n    mergansers, and ruddy duck;\n        (16) the international importance of Lake Erie is indicated in \n    the United States by congressional designation of the Ottawa and \n    Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges;\n        (17)(A) Lake Erie has an international reputation for walleye, \n    perch, and bass fishing, recreational boating, birding, \n    photography, and duck hunting; and\n        (B) on an economic basis, tourism in the Lake Erie area \n    accounts for an estimated $1,500,000,000 in retail sales and more \n    than 50,000 jobs;\n        (18)(A) many of the 417,000 boats that are registered in the \n    State of Ohio are used in the western basin, in part to fish for \n    the estimated 10,000,000 walleye that migrate from the lake to \n    spawn; and\n        (B) that internationally renowned walleye fishery drives much \n    of the $2,000,000,000 sport fishing industry in the State of Ohio;\n        (19) coastal wetland in the western basin has been subjected to \n    intense pressure for 150 years;\n        (20) prior to 1850, the western basin was part of an extensive \n    coastal marsh and swamp system consisting of approximately 122,000 \n    hectares that comprised a portion of the Great Black Swamp;\n        (21) by 1951, only 12,407 wetland hectares remained in the \n    western basin;\n        (22) 50 percent of that acreage was destroyed between 1972 and \n    1987, leaving only approximately 5,000 hectares in existence today;\n        (23) along the Michigan shoreline, coastal wetland was reduced \n    by 62 percent between 1916 and the early 1970s;\n        (24) the development of the city of Monroe, Michigan, has had a \n    particularly significant impact on the coastal wetland at the mouth \n    of the Raisin River;\n        (25) only approximately 100 hectares remain physically \n    unaltered today in an area in which, 70 years ago, marshes were 10 \n    times more extensive;\n        (26) in addition to the actual loss of coastal wetland acreage \n    along the shores of Lake Erie, the quality of much remaining dike \n    wetland has been degraded by numerous stressors, especially \n    excessive loadings of sediments and nutrients, contaminants, \n    shoreline modification, exotic species, and the diking of wetland; \n    and\n        (27) protective peninsula beach systems, such as the former Bay \n    Point and Woodtick, at the border of Ohio and Michigan near the \n    mouth of the Ottawa River and Maumee Bay, have been eroded over the \n    years, exacerbating erosion along the shorelines and negatively \n    affecting breeding and spawning grounds.\n\nSEC. 3.
