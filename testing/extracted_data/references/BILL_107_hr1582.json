FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Undocumented children come to the United States for a \n        variety of reasons. Most are brought to the United States by \n        adults and have no ability to make an independent decision \n        about whether or not to migrate to the United States. Some come \n        with their parents. Others are brought by smugglers and \n        traffickers intent on exploiting them.\n            (2) It is the policy of the United States Government, \n        supported both by acts of Congress and Supreme Court precedent, \n        to permit undocumented children to attend public schools in the \n        United States. This policy is rooted in recognition of the fact \n        that such children often are not in a position to make an \n        independent decision about where they will live, of the \n        vulnerability of children, and by the desire to ensure that \n        such children have an opportunity to become educated while in \n        the United States.\n            (3) Each year, 50,000 to 75,000 such undocumented children \n        graduate from United States public schools after having resided \n        in the United States for 5 or more years.\n            (4) Young children who have resided in the United States \n        for a substantial period of their lives often are acculturated \n        as Americans, including learning to speak English. Often, they \n        consider themselves Americans and have little or no knowledge \n        or ties to the country in which they were born.\n            (5) Current law provides little avenue for long-staying \n        alien children to regularize their immigration status. This, in \n        turn, prevents them from continuing their education past high \n        school, making it less likely that they will succeed in life \n        and encouraging many to drop out of high school before \n        graduating.\n            (6) While current law requires State and local governments \n        to provide elementary and secondary education to undocumented \n        alien children, the law effectively precludes State and local \n        governments from providing in-State tuition to these same alien \n        children once they have graduated from high school.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide an opportunity to certain alien children who \n        were brought to the United States at a young age and have since \n        been acculturated in the United States to adjust their status \n        to lawful permanent residency and become contributing members \n        of United States society;\n            (2) to restore to each State the flexibility to provide in-\n        State tuition to all children residing in the State, including \n        to undocumented alien children; and\n            (3) to permit and encourage alien children who were brought \n        to the United States at a young age and have been educated in \n        United States elementary and secondary schools to continue \n        their education through high school graduation and into \n        college.\n\nSEC. 3. ATTORNEY GENERAL AUTHORITY TO ADJUST STATUS OF CERTAIN \n              CHILDREN.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)) is amended--\n            (1) in paragraph (3)--\n                    (A) by striking ``paragraph (1) or (2)'' and \n                inserting ``paragraph (1), (2), or (3)'' each place it \n                appears;\n                    (B) by redesignating such paragraph as paragraph \n                (5);
