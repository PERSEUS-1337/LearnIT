The commission shall designate a telephone number for members of the public to dial to communicate their concerns or complaints. The commission shall require each charter-party carrier of passengers to include the telephone number designated by the commission on all contracts for service made after January 1, 2018. For a transportation network company or other charter-party carrier of passengers that arrange for transportation utilizing application software, commonly termed an app, the commission shall require that the customer be notified of the existence of, and purpose for, the telephone number as part of the electronic transaction. The commission may maintain additional, alternative means for members of the public to express concerns or register complaints.\n(b) The commission shall maintain a record of all concerns and complaints communicated to the commission relative to charter-party carriers of passengers, including transportation network companies. The commission shall establish rules or guidelines as to what concerns and complaints do or do not raise matters of serious concern. As to those concerns and complaints that do not raise a matter of serious concern, the commission staff shall diligently attempt to informally resolve the concern or complaint and shall maintain a record of whether the concern or complaint was resolved. The commission shall investigate each concern or complaint made to the commission that raises a matter of serious concern and initiate and conclude appropriate enforcement action with respect to any violation of this act or a rule adopted by the commission pursuant to this act. The commission shall maintain a record of all concerns and complaints that result in an investigation, a description of the investigation conducted by the commission, and the result of the investigation.\nSEC. 2.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local

2.\n(b)The provisions of this article shall be administered in a manner that encourages the effective and efficient participation of all groups that have a stake in the public utility regulation

compensated for making a substantial contribution to proceedings of the commission, as determined by the commission in its orders and decisions.\n(e)Intervenor compensation be awarded to eligible intervenors in a timely manner, within a reasonable period after the intervenor has made the substantial contribution to a proceeding that is the basis for the compensation award.\n(f)This article shall be administered in a manner that avoids unproductive or unnecessary participation that duplicates the participation of similar interests otherwise adequately represented or participation that is not necessary for a fair determination of the proceeding.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 1802 of the\nPublic Utilities Code\nis amended to read:\n1802.\nAs used in this article:\n(a)\u201cCompensation\u201d means payment for all or part, as determined by the commission, of reasonable advocate\u2019s fees, reasonable expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs of preparation for and participation in a

a hearing or proceeding.\n(f)\u201cProceeding\u201d means an application, complaint, or investigation, rulemaking, alternative dispute resolution procedures in lieu of formal proceedings as may be

hardship, to pay the costs of effective participation, including advocate\u2019s fees, expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs of participation, or that, in the case of a group or

The commission may establish rules to modify or change the definition of \u201csmall commercial customer,\u201d including use of criteria other than a peak demand threshold, if the commission determines that the modification or change will promote participation in proceedings at the commission by organizations representing small businesses, without incorporating large commercial and industrial customers.\n(i)\u201cSubstantial contribution\u201d means that, in the judgment of the commission, the customer\u2019s presentation has substantially assisted the commission in the making of its order or decision because the order or decision has adopted in whole or in part one or more factual contentions, legal contentions, or specific policy or procedural recommendations presented by the customer. Where the customer\u2019s participation has resulted in a substantial contribution, even if the decision adopts that customer\u2019s contention or recommendations only in part, the commission may award the customer compensation for all reasonable advocate\u2019s fees, reasonable expert fees, and other reasonable costs incurred by the customer in preparing or presenting that contention or recommendation.\nSEC. 3.\nSection 1809 is added to the\nPublic Utilities Code\n, to read:\n1809.\nThe commission shall deny any claim for compensation for contributions to a closed proceeding unless otherwise specified in this article."
