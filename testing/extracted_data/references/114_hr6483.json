FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Animal agricultural production represents an important \n        part of our Nation's economy and a critical source of income \n        for hundreds of thousands of American families.\n            (2) Animal agricultural production facilities, including \n        combined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), produce millions of \n        tons of animal waste annually, the management and disposal of \n        which represents an integral part of the animal agricultural \n        production process.\n            (3) Traditional methods of animal waste disposal, \n        especially those associated with ``lagoon and spray-field'' \n        systems, have been shown by federally funded research to result \n        in negative environmental and social externalities, including \n        contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water with \n        nitrogen, contamination of air with ammonia, and other threats \n        to animal and human health.\n            (4) During severe weather events, the risk of negative \n        externalities can become particularly acute, as ``lagoons'' \n        have the potential to overflow or breach their walls and flood \n        surrounding communities and waterways with unprocessed animal \n        waste.\n            (5) In the Southeastern United States, combined animal \n        feeding operations dedicated to the production of swine are \n        disproportionately located in low-income communities.\n            (6) In recent decades, collaborative research and \n        development efforts by industry, academia, and the public \n        sector have produced numerous superior waste management and \n        disposal technologies that have been shown to significantly \n        reduce the negative environmental and social externalities \n        associated with ``lagoon and spray-field'' systems and, in some \n        cases, produce value-added byproducts that can generate new \n        revenue for producers.\n            (7) The widespread adoption of superior waste management \n        and disposal technologies has been inhibited by various social \n        and economic factors, including the cost to producers of \n        installing and operating such systems.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the conversion of existing ``lagoon and spray-field'' \n        systems into superior waste management and disposal systems \n        would produce significant benefits to the environment and \n        public health, including more sustainable agricultural \n        operations, improved animal health, and improved resilience \n        against severe weather events, and should thus be a goal of \n        national policy; and\n            (2) the approval of new animal agricultural production \n        facilities by Federal or State authorities should be made \n        contingent on the adoption of superior waste management and \n        disposal systems, as has already occurred in some States.\n\nSEC. 3. ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE SWINE WASTE DISPOSAL TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a \nprogram for certifying environmentally sustainable swine waste disposal \ntechnologies in accordance with this section.\n    (b) Standards.--\n            (1) Requirements.--In establishing the program under this \n        section, the Secretary shall establish standards requiring that \n        a swine waste disposal technology, in order to be certified \n        under this section--\n                    (A) eliminate animal discharge into surface waters \n                and groundwater through direct discharge, seepage, or \n                runoff;\n                    (B) substantially eliminate atmospheric emissions \n                of ammonia from swine waste;\n                    (C) substantially eliminate the emission of odor \n                from swine waste that is detectable beyond the \n                boundaries of the parcel or tract of land on which the \n                swine farm is located;\n                    (D) substantially eliminate the release of disease-\n                transmitting vectors and airborne pathogens from swine \n                waste;\n                    (E) substantially eliminate nutrient and heavy \n                metal contamination of soil and groundwater from swine \n                waste; and\n                    (F) be cost-effective.\n            (2) Cost-effectiveness.--In determining whether a \n        technology is cost-effective under this section, the \n        Secretary--\n                    (A) shall consider the full range of subsidies \n                available under this Act and other Federal programs, \n                and available State and private-sector support;\n                    (B) in considering the costs of a technology, may \n                include costs associated with adoption of the \n                technology and the estimated operation and maintenance \n                costs of the technology through the life of technology; \n                and\n                    (C) may not require parity with the cost of \n                existing swine waste disposal technologies and systems.\n            (3) Consultation.--In establishing standards under this \n        paragraph, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator \n        of the Environmental Protection Agency, the relevant task force \n        established under section 1672A of the Food, Agriculture, \n        Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, and States that have a \n        history of widespread use of lagoon and spray technology on \n        swine farms.\n    (c) Certification.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the \n        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n        relevant task force established under section 1672A of the \n        Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, shall \n        certify a swine waste disposal technology as being \n        environmentally sustainable if it meets the standards \n        established under subsection (b).\n            (2) Eligible technologies.--Swine waste disposal \n        technologies that are eligible for certification under this \n        subsection include stand-alone waste disposal technology \n        platforms and multi-part systems, which may incorporate in-\n        ground technology, that meet or exceed, in combination, the \n        standards established under this section, as determined by the \n        Secretary.\n\nSEC. 4. STATE PERMITTING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    Beginning on the effective date of the standards established under \nsection 2, no State may issue a permit pursuant to any Federal law to a \nswine farm that is a concentrated animal feeding operation (as defined \nin section 122.23 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations) unless the \nswine farm disposes of swine waste only through use of swine waste \ndisposal technology certified under section 3(c).\n\nSEC. 5.
