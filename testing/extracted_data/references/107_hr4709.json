    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Hormone Disruption Research Act of \n2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many compounds found or introduced into the environment \n        by human activity are capable of disrupting the hormone system \n        of humans and animals. The consequences of such disruption can \n        be profound because of the crucial role hormones play in \n        controlling development. No standardized and validated screens \n        or tests have been developed to routinely and systematically \n        assess chemicals for disruptive effects on hormone systems.\n            (2) In the last 30 years, the United States has experienced \n        an increase in the incidence of such human disorders as \n        childhood cancers, testicular cancer, hypospadias, juvenile \n        diabetes, attention deficit-like hyperactivity disorders, \n        autism, thyroid disorders, and auto-immune disorders. Exposure \n        to hormone-disrupting chemicals may be contributing to these \n        increases. The impact on children's health as a result of \n        prenatal exposures in particular needs further research.\n            (3) In 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and \n        Prevention's ``National Report on Human Exposure to \n        Environmental Chemicals'' reported on human exposure to 27 \n        chemicals, and found unexpectedly high levels of certain \n        chemicals used in consumer products. The hazards to humans of \n        these chemicals, singly and in combination, are not well \n        understood.\n            (4) Many wildlife populations have been affected by hormone \n        disrupting substances, including birds, fish, reptiles, and \n        mammals. The effects vary among species and compounds.\n            (5) The effects in wildlife include thyroid dysfunction, \n        decreased fertility, decreased hatching success, gross birth \n        deformities, metabolic and behavioral abnormalities, \n        demasculinization and feminization of male organisms, \n        deformation and masculinization of female organisms, and \n        compromised immune systems. These effects may signal hazards to \n        human health.\n            (6) Laboratory studies have corroborated studies of effects \n        in wildlife and have identified biological mechanisms to \n        explain the effects shown.\n            (7) Since the chemicals found in wildlife are also found in \n        humans, humans are exposed to the same chemicals as wildlife.\n            (8) Hormone disruption can occur at very low doses, \n        especially when exposure occurs in the womb or immediately \n        after birth, periods during which rapid development is \n        occurring.\n            (9) In the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (21 U.S.C. \n        301 note), Congress recognized the special vulnerability of \n        infants and children to pesticides and requested that the \n        Environmental Protection Agency establish a program to screen \n        and test hormone disrupting chemicals. The Environmental \n        Protection Agency has not yet required such screening or tests.\n            (10) In 1998, a research committee on hormone disrupters, \n        organized under the auspices of the Office of Science and \n        Technology Policy, concluded that ``scientific knowledge is \n        inadequate to fully inform public policy, and a government-wide \n        coordinated research effort that addresses the key scientific \n        uncertainties . . . is needed''.\n            (11) In 1999, in response to a request from Congress and \n        funded through the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n        Department of the Interior, the National Academy of Sciences \n        compiled a lengthy list of research, monitoring, and testing \n        priorities related to hormone disruption.\n            (12) The National Institute of Environmental Health \n        Sciences conducts much of the Federal Government's research on \n        hormone disruption, often working in partnership with other \n        agencies.\n            (13) Congress fully supports critical research being \n        performed by the National Institute of Environmental Health \n        Sciences on methods to reduce, refine, or replace animal tests \n        in scientific and medical studies.\n            (14) Congress strongly supports protection of animal \n        subjects and encourages all scientists to use alternatives to \n        animal testing to the maximum extent possible.\n            (15) The United States Geological Survey (referred to in \n        this section as the ``USGS'') has considerable experience \n        assessing the occurrence of chemicals in the environment, \n        ecological health, and the hazards to wildlife health and \n        associated human health posed by chemicals in the environment, \n        as a result of monitoring by the USGS of the Nation's water \n        resources and wildlife disease, and research by the USGS on the \n        effects of chemicals on wildlife.\n            (16) The National Academy of Sciences has recognized the \n        expertise of the USGS in such areas as food web contamination \n        and water quality assessment and has encouraged more \n        coordinated work on human health between the USGS and the \n        National Institutes of Health.\n\nSEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES ACT TO PROVIDE FOR \n              RESEARCH ON HORMONE DISRUPTION.\n\n    Subpart 12 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act \n(42 U.S.C. 2851 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end of the \nfollowing:\n\n     ``directed national program of research on hormone disruption\n\n    ``Sec. 463B.
