FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the waters and water-dependent natural resources of the \n        Great Lakes Basin are precious public resources, held in trust \n        by the Great Lakes States and the Canadian provinces of Ontario \n        and Quebec;\n            (2) authority over the Great Lakes is vested in the \n        Governors of the Great Lakes States by the Water Resources \n        Development Act of 1986;\n            (3) the Great Lakes Charter of 1985 is a voluntary \n        international agreement that provides the procedural framework \n        for notice and consultation by the Great Lakes States and the \n        Canadian provinces concerning the withdrawal of water from the \n        Great Lakes Basin;\n            (4) the Governors of the Great Lakes States, in exercise of \n        their authority under the Water Resources Development Act of \n        1986, and the premiers of the Canadian provinces have based \n        decisions on proposals to withdraw, divert, or use waters from \n        the Great Lakes Basin on the extent to which such proposals \n        conserve and protect waters and water-dependent resources of \n        the Great Lakes Basin;\n            (5) decisionmaking must remain vested in the Governors of \n        the Great Lakes States and the premiers of the Canadian \n        provinces, who currently manage the Great Lakes Basin on a day-\n        to-day basis;\n            (6) demand for clean and fresh water is growing around the \n        world and bulk exports pose a unique challenge to the \n        management of the Great Lakes; and\n            (7) the ecological effects of bulk exports of water from \n        the Great Lakes are unknown.\n\nSEC. 202. MORATORIUM ON EXPORTS OF BULK FRESH WATER.\n\n    (a) Moratorium on Exports.--No bulk fresh water from the Great \nLakes Basin may be exported from the United States.\n    (b) Lifting of Moratorium.--Subsection (a) shall cease to apply on \nthe earlier of--\n            (1) December 31, 2001; or\n            (2) the effective date of an Act of Congress approving an \n        agreement among the Great Lakes States to implement a mechanism \n        that provides for a common conservation standard to make \n        decisions concerning the withdrawal and use of water from the \n        Great Lakes Basin.\n\nSEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this title--\n            (1) the term ``bulk fresh water'' means fresh water \n        extracted in amounts intended for transportation by tanker or \n        similar form of mass transportation, without further \n        processing;\n            (2) the term ``Great Lakes Basin'' means the water within \n        Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario, St. Clair, and Superior, \n        within interconnecting waterways, within all other watercourses \n        draining into and between those lakes, and within all tributary \n        surface and underground channels or areas which drain into or \n        comprise part of any watershed draining into any of those \n        lakes; and\n            (3) the term ``Great Lakes State'' means each of the States \n        of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, \n        Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin."
