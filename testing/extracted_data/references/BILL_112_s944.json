FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following finding:\n            (1) The United States and its international partners are in \n        an armed conflict with violent Islamist extremist groups, \n        including al Qaeda and associated terrorist organizations, that \n        are committed to killing Americans and our allies.\n            (2) In the last 2 years, terrorists have repeatedly \n        attempted to kill Americans both here at home and abroad, \n        including the following attacks, plots, or alleged plots and \n        attacks:\n                    (A) A September 2009 plot by Najibullah Zazi--who \n                received training from al Qaeda in Pakistan--to conduct \n                a suicide bomb attack on the New York, New York, subway \n                system.\n                    (B) A November 2009 attack by Nidal Malik Hasan at \n                Fort Hood, Texas, that killed 13 people and wounded 32.\n                    (C) A Christmas Day 2009 attempt by Umar Farouk \n                Abdulmutallab to detonate a bomb sewn into his \n                underwear on an international flight to Detroit, \n                Michigan.\n                    (D) A May 2010 attempt by Faisal Shahzad to bomb \n                Times Square in New York, New York, on a crowded \n                Saturday evening, an attack that was unsuccessful only \n                because the car bomb failed to detonate.\n                    (E) An October 2010 attempt by terrorists in Yemen \n                to send, via commercial cargo flights, 2 packages of \n                explosives to Jewish centers in Chicago, Illinois.\n                    (F) A February 2011 plot by Khaled Aldawsari, a \n                Saudi-born student, to manufacture explosives and \n                potentially attack New York, New York, the Dallas, \n                Texas, home of former President George W. Bush, as well \n                as hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, and a \n                nightclub.\n            (3) Since the September 11, 2001, attacks on our Nation, \n        the United States and allied forces have captured thousands of \n        individuals fighting for or supporting al Qaeda and associated \n        terrorist organizations that do not abide by the law of war, \n        including detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo \n        Bay, Cuba, who served as planners of those attacks, trainers of \n        terrorists, financiers of terrorists, bomb makers, bodyguards \n        for Osama bin Laden, recruiters of terrorists, and facilitators \n        of terrorism.\n            (4) Many of the detainees at United States Naval Station, \n        Guantanamo Bay provided valuable intelligence that gave the \n        United States insight into al Qaeda and its methods, prevented \n        terrorist attacks, and saved lives.\n            (5) Intelligence obtained from detainees at United States \n        Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay was critical to eventually \n        identifying the location of Osama bin Laden.\n            (6) In a February 17, 2011, hearing of the Committee on \n        Armed Services of the Senate, the Secretary of Defense \n        confirmed that approximately 25 percent of detainees released \n        from the detention facility at United States Naval Station, \n        Guantanamo Bay are confirmed to have reengaged in hostilities \n        or are suspected of having reengaged in hostilities against the \n        United States or our allies.\n            (7) Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an organization that \n        includes former detainees at United States Naval Station, \n        Guantanamo Bay among its leadership and ranks, has claimed \n        responsibility for several of the recent plots and attacks \n        against the United States.\n            (8) Detention according to the law of war is a matter of \n        national security and military necessity and has long been \n        recognized as legitimate under international law.\n            (9) Detaining unprivileged enemy belligerents prevents them \n        from returning to the battlefield to attack United States and \n        allied military personnel and engaging in future terrorist \n        attacks against innocent civilians.\n            (10) The Joint Task Force-Guantanamo provides for the \n        humane, legal, and transparent care and custody of detainees at \n        United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, notwithstanding \n        regular assaults on the guard force by some detainees.\n            (11) The International Committee of the Red Cross visits \n        detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay on a \n        quarterly basis.\n            (12) The detention facility at United States Naval Station, \n        Guantanamo Bay benefits from robust oversight by Congress.\n\nSEC. 3.
