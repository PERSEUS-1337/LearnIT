FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender \n        nonconforming is not a disorder, disease, illness, deficiency, \n        or shortcoming;\n            (2) the national community of professionals in education, \n        social work, health, mental health, and counseling has \n        determined that there is no scientifically valid evidence that \n        supports the practice of attempting to prevent a person from \n        being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender \n        nonconforming;\n            (3) such professionals have determined that there is no \n        evidence that conversion therapy is effective or that an \n        individual's sexual orientation or gender identity can be \n        changed by conversion therapy;\n            (4) such professionals have also determined that the \n        potential risks of conversion therapy are not only that it is \n        ineffective, but also that it is substantially dangerous to an \n        individual's mental and physical health, and has been shown to \n        contribute to depression, self-harm, low self-esteem, family \n        rejection, and suicide; and\n            (5) it is in the interest of the Nation to make sure that \n        lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming \n        people and their families are not defrauded by persons seeking \n        to profit by offering this harmful and wholly ineffective \n        therapy.\n\nSEC. 3. UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES RELATED TO CONVERSION \n              THERAPY.\n\n    (a) Unlawful Conduct.--It shall be unlawful for any person--\n            (1) to provide conversion therapy to any individual if such \n        person receives monetary compensation in exchange for such \n        services; or\n            (2) to advertise for the provision of conversion therapy \n        and claim in such advertising--\n                    (A) to change another individual's sexual \n                orientation or gender identity;\n                    (B) to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic \n                attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same \n                gender; or\n                    (C) that such efforts are harmless or without risk \n                to individuals receiving such therapy.\n    (b) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--\n            (1) Violation of rule.--A violation of subsection (a) shall \n        be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or \n        deceptive act or practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) \n        of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).\n            (2) Powers of commission.--\n                    (A) In general.--The Commission shall enforce this \n                section in the same manner, by the same means, and with \n                the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all \n                applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade \n                Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated \n                into and made a part of this Act.\n                    (B) Privileges and immunities.--Any person who \n                violates this subsection (a) shall be subject to the \n                penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities \n                provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n                41 et seq.).\n            (3) Regulations.--The Commission may promulgate, in \n        accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, \n        such regulations as the Commission considers appropriate to \n        carry out this section.\n    (c) Enforcement by States.--\n            (1) In general.--In any case in which the attorney general \n        of a State has reason to believe that an interest of the \n        residents of the State has been or is threatened or adversely \n        affected by the engagement of any person subject to subsection \n        (a) in a practice that violates such subsection, the attorney \n        general of the State may, as parens patriae, bring a civil \n        action on behalf of the residents of the State in an \n        appropriate district court of the United States to obtain \n        appropriate relief.\n            (2) Rights of federal trade commission.--\n                    (A) Notice to federal trade commission.--\n                            (i) In general.--Except as provided in \n                        clause (iii), the attorney general of a State \n                        shall notify the Federal Trade Commission in \n                        writing that the attorney general intends to \n                        bring a civil action under paragraph (1) before \n                        initiating the civil action.\n                            (ii) Contents.--The notification required \n                        by clause (i) with respect to a civil action \n                        shall include a copy of the complaint to be \n                        filed to initiate the civil action.\n                            (iii) Exception.--If it is not feasible for \n                        the attorney general of a State to provide the \n                        notification required by clause (i) before \n                        initiating a civil action under paragraph (1), \n                        the attorney general shall notify the \n                        Commission immediately upon instituting the \n                        civil action.\n                    (B) Intervention by federal trade commission.--The \n                Commission may--\n                            (i) intervene in any civil action brought \n                        by the attorney general of a State under \n                        paragraph (1);
