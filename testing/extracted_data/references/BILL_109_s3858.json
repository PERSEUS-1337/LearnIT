FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) Presidential Proclamation Number 7318, dated June 13, \n        2000 (65 Fed. Reg. 37247), which established the Cascade-\n        Siskiyou National Monument, created unique regulatory and \n        statutory overlays with respect to the Monument;\n            (2) compensating lessees that voluntarily waive their \n        grazing leases and end livestock grazing on Federal land in and \n        near the Monument would provide lessees new economic \n        opportunities, including opportunities to--\n                    (A) restructure ranch operations;\n                    (B) start new businesses; or\n                    (C) retire with security;\n            (3) regardless of the legal merits of continued grazing on \n        the Monument, there is support from the ranching, \n        environmental, and other local communities and government \n        officials for a fair and equitable resolution of grazing \n        conflicts;\n            (4) the land exchange authorized under this Act is in the \n        public interest because the exchange--\n                    (A) furthers the protective purposes of the \n                Monument;\n                    (B) provides for consolidated land ownership;\n                    (C) improves land and resource management;\n                    (D) decreases management costs; and\n                    (E) resolves public conflict;\n            (5) the waiver of grazing leases under this Act is not \n        intended to reflect on--\n                    (A) the legal or ecological merit of continued \n                grazing within the Monument; or\n                    (B) the merit of proposals to limit or retire \n                grazing permits in the State of Oregon or any other \n                State; and\n            (6) designating certain portions of the Monument as \n        wilderness would ensure that an increasing population, \n        expanding settlement, and increasing mechanization would not \n        modify those portions in a manner that would cumulatively deny \n        future generations the opportunity to the wilderness \n        experience.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to maintain the economic viability of cattle ranching \n        in the vicinity of the Monument;\n            (2) to authorize the permanent retirement of certain \n        grazing leases and associated allotments within and in the \n        vicinity of the Monument; and\n            (3) to protect unique ecological diversity and high quality \n        outdoor recreational opportunities in the wildest portions of \n        the Monument by designating the portions as the Soda Mountain \n        Wilderness.\n\nSEC. 3.
