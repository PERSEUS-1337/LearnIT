FINDINGS.\n\n            (1) According to the Corporate Fraud Task Force Report to \n        the President, 2008, in fiscal year 2007, United States \n        Attorneys' offices opened 878 new criminal health care fraud \n        investigations involving 1,548 potential defendants. Federal \n        prosecutors had 1,612 health care fraud criminal investigations \n        pending, involving 2,603 potential defendants, and filed \n        criminal charges in 434 cases involving 786 defendants. A total \n        of 560 defendants were convicted for health care fraud-related \n        crimes during the year.\n            (2) On September 2, 2009, it was announced that Pfizer Inc. \n        and its subsidiary Pharmacia & Upjohn Company Inc., agreed to \n        pay $2.3 billion, the largest health care fraud settlement in \n        the history of the Department of Justice, to resolve criminal \n        liability from the illegal promotion of certain pharmaceutical \n        products.\n            (3) Pharmacia & Upjohn Company agreed to plead guilty to a \n        felony violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for \n        misbranding Bextra with the intent to defraud or mislead.\n            (4) Pharmacia & Upjohn Company marketed ``off-label'' uses \n        of Bextra for several uses and dosages that the Food and Drug \n        Administration declined to approve due to safety concerns.\n            (5) The Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division \n        has stated, ``Illegal conduct and fraud by pharmaceutical \n        companies puts the public health at risk, corrupts medical \n        decisions by health care providers, and costs the Government \n        billions of dollars.''.\n            (6) The Director of the Defense Department's Criminal \n        Investigative Services stated, ``The off-label promotion of \n        pharmaceutical drugs by Pfizer significantly impacted the \n        integrity of TRICARE, the Department of Defense's health care \n        system. This illegal activity increases patients' costs, \n        threatens their safety and negatively affects the health care \n        services to the over nine million military members, retirees \n        and their families who rely on this system.''.\n\nSEC. 3.
