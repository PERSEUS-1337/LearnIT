and\n            (B) ensure the health, productivity, independence, and \n        well-being of all individuals through optimal rehabilitation.\n        (2) The National Institute of Child Health and Human \n    Development has made unparalleled contributions to the advancement \n    of child health and human development, including significant \n    efforts to--\n            (A) reduce dramatically the rates of Sudden Infant Death \n        Syndrome, infant mortality, and maternal HIV transmission;\n            (B) develop the Haemophilus Influenza B (Hib) vaccine, \n        credited with nearly eliminating the incidence of mental \n        retardation;
