FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Research shows that mentors make a difference in \n        children's lives. At-risk youth who have mentors are 55 percent \n        more likely to enroll in college. Students who meet regularly \n        with their mentors are 52 percent less likely than their peers \n        to skip a day of school. Youth who have mentors are also 130 \n        percent more likely to hold a leadership position.\n            (2) Children that have mentors have improved relationships \n        with adults, fewer disciplinary referrals, and more confidence \n        to achieve their goals.\n            (3) In 2014, 415,129 children were in foster care. Of those \n        children 62,108 were between the ages of 10 and 13, and 120,567 \n        were between the ages of 14 and 18.\n            (4) Mentoring programs that serve foster children are \n        unique and require additional considerations, including \n        specialized training and support necessary to provide for \n        consistent, long-term relationships for children in care.\n            (5) Mentoring programs can be used as an effective \n        preventative or intervention strategy to support positive \n        outcomes for foster youth.\n\nSEC. 3.
