REFERENCES.\n\n    Except as otherwise specifically provided, whenever in this Act a \nsection or other provision is amended, repealed, or referenced, such \namendment, repeal, or reference shall be considered to be made to that \nsection or other provision of the Soil Conservation and Domestic \nAllotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590a et seq.).\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) agricultural land users are required to develop and \n        implement an increasing number of plans that have conservation \n        and environmental benefits as a primary purpose;\n            (2) within the Department of Agriculture, there are as many \n        as fifteen programs that provide for the development of such \n        plans, and currently some agricultural land users may have six \n        different conservation and environmentally-related plans in \n        effect with regard to their land;\n            (3) future legislation may mandate additional requirements \n        for agricultural land users;\n            (4) most plans are single purpose in nature, and \n        requirements imposed by one plan may conflict with the \n        purposes, objectives, or requirements of another plan;\n            (5) the complexity of the planning process is such that it \n        is difficult for many agricultural land users to coordinate the \n        various requirements into their individual farming or ranching \n        operations;\n            (6) there is a need to approach conservation and \n        environmental problems on agricultural land on a more rational \n        basis in order to promote practical and economically feasible \n        site-specific resource measures that take into consideration \n        the economic vitality of agricultural land units involved; and\n            (7) to ensure consistency, all pertinent conservation and \n        environmental requirements on agricultural land should be \n        coordinated, through a single agency of the Government, into \n        one integrated resource management plan for the land unit.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) assist agricultural land users in meeting conservation \n        and environmental requirements on such lands, while maintaining \n        viable farming or ranching operations;\n            (2) provide that a single Federal agency, the Soil \n        Conservation Service, be responsible for working with other \n        governmental agencies and agricultural land users in the \n        development and implementation of integrated resource \n        management plans for agricultural lands;\n            (3) provide a more efficient and effective method to \n        coordinate Federal, State, and local conservation and \n        environmental requirements with respect to individual land \n        units;\n            (4) help ensure that a site-specific approach encompassing \n        all resources will be used in an interrelated manner when \n        developing and implementing plans on agricultural land for \n        conservation and environmental purposes; and\n            (5) help ensure that a balance is maintained among \n        productivity, efficient management of resources, and \n        environmental quality with respect to the agricultural land \n        unit.\n\nSEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.\n\n    The Act is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 18.

conservation and environmental concerns on \n        agricultural land are to be integrated into a single \n        comprehensive site-specific plan for the land involved;\n            ``(2) the regulations shall provide that, with respect to \n        any such single comprehensive site-specific plan developed \n        under paragraph (1), the Soil Conservation Service shall be \n

targeted to specific watersheds or \n        other areas or regions determined by the Soil Conservation \n        Service to be environmentally sensitive, taking into \n        consideration the lands described in section 1238C of the Food \n        Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3838C);\n            ``(5) the regulations shall provide that all requests for \n        cost-sharing or other

Agriculture, may enter into agreements with the Secretary of \n        Agriculture under which any conservation and environmental \n        requirements with respect to agricultural land under any \n
