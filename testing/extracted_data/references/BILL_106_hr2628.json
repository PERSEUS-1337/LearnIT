FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that the payment system for home health services \ncovered under Medicare as enacted by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is \nhaving the following unintended consequences:\n            (1) Many of the sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries \n        are being deprived of access to medically necessary home health \n        services which are covered under the Medicare Program.\n            (2) The amount of reductions in reimbursement for home \n        health services furnished under the Medicare Program \n        significantly exceeds the amount of reduction in reimbursement \n        for any other service furnished under the Medicare Program at a \n        time when the need for home health services by the Nation's \n        elderly citizens is growing.\n            (3) The per beneficiary limits imposed on home health \n        agencies do not, for a majority of such agencies, accurately \n        reflect the costs necessarily incurred in the efficient \n        delivery of needed home health services to the individuals \n        treated by those agencies, as required under section \n        1861(v)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n        1395x(v)(1)(A)).\n            (4) Residents of certain States and regions of the country \n        are being afforded access to far fewer home health services \n        under the Medicare Program than residents of other States or \n        regions who have similar medical conditions.\n            (5) The prospective payment system scheduled for \n        implementation by October 1, 2000, is in danger of being based \n        on data which excludes many of the costs of providing covered \n        services to the sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries.\n            (6) The additional 15 percent reduction in reimbursement \n        currently scheduled for October 1, 2000, will result in \n        reductions in Medicare spending for home health services that \n        are far in excess of those intended by Congress when it passed \n        the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and are unrelated to needs of \n        the patients.\n            (7) The home health interim payment system enacted as part \n        of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is not providing for a \n        smooth transition from reasonable cost reimbursement to \n        prospective payment.\n\nSEC. 3. INTERIM PAYMENT SYSTEM OVERPAYMENT RECOUPMENT.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 1861(v)(1)(L) of the Social Security Act \n(42 U.S.C. 1395x(v)(1)(L)), as amended by section 5101(a) of the Tax \nand Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), is amended \nby adding at the end the following new clause:\n    ``(x)(I) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, \nthere shall be no recovery of any payments for reasonable costs made \nbefore the cost reporting period describe in subclause (II) to a home \nhealth agency in excess of the per beneficiary limitation applicable to \nthat agency.\n    ``(II) The cost reporting period referred to in subclause (I) with \nrespect to a home health agency is the cost reporting period beginning \nduring the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the home \nhealth agency received written notice from the Secretary of its agency-\nspecific per beneficiary limitation.''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \napply as if included in the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997.\n\nSEC. 4.
