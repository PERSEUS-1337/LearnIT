FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n        (1) For the reasons stated in section 520 of the Foreign \n    Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law \n    103-236), the Congress has found that continued application of an \n    international arms embargo to the Government of Bosnia and \n    Herzegovina contravenes that Government's inherent right of \n    individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the \n    United National Charter and therefore is inconsistent with \n    international law.\n        (2) The United States has not formally sought multilateral \n    support for terminating the arms embargo against Bosnia and \n    Herzegovina through a vote on a United Nations Security Council \n    resolution since the enactment of section 1404 of the National \n    Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-\n    337).\n        (3) The United Nations Security Council has not taken measures \n    necessary to maintain international peace and security in Bosnia \n    and Herzegovina since the aggression against that country began in \n    April 1992.\n        (4) The Contact Group, composed of representatives of the \n    United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and Germany, has \n    since July 1994 maintained that in the event of continuing \n    rejection by the Bosnian Serbs of the Contact Group's proposal for \n    Bosnia and Herzegovina, a decision in the United Nations Security \n    Council to lift the Bosnian arms embargo as a last resort would be \n    unavoidable.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF SUPPORT.\n\n    The Congress supports the efforts of the Government of the Republic \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina--\n        (1) to defend its people and the territory of the Republic;\n        (2) to preserve the sovereignty, independence, and territorial \n    integrity of the Republic; and\n        (3) to bring about a peaceful, just, fair, viable, and \n    sustainable settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSEC. 4.

In the event the United Nations Security Council fails \nto adopt the resolution to terminate the application of United Nations \nSecurity Council resolution 713 to the Government of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina because of a lack of unanimity of the permanent members, \nthereby failing to exercise its primary responsibility for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, the United States \nshall promptly endeavor to bring the issue before the General Assembly \nfor decision as provided for in the Assembly's Uniting for Peace \nResolution of 1950.\n    (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \ninterpreted as authorization for deployment of United States forces in \nthe territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for any purpose, including \ntraining, support, or delivery of military equipment.\n    (g) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n        (1) the term ``United States arms embargo of the Government of \n    Bosnia and Herzegovina'' means the application to the Government of \n    Bosnia and Herzegovina of--\n            (A) the policy adopted July 10, 1991, and published in the \n        Federal Register of July 19, 1991 (58 FR 33322) under the \n        heading ``Suspension of Munitions Export Licenses to \n        Yugoslavia''; and\n            (B) any similar policy being applied by the United States \n        Government as of the date of completion of withdrawal of \n        UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina, pursuant to \n        which approval is denied for transfers of defense articles and \n        defense services to the former Yugoslavia; and\n        (2) the term ``completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR \n    personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina'' means the departure from \n    the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina of substantially all \n    personnel participating in UNPROFOR and substantially all other \n    personnel assisting in their withdrawal, within a reasonable period \n    of time, without regard to whether the withdrawal was initiated \n    pursuant to a request by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n    a decision by the United Nations Security Council, or decisions by \n    countries contributing forces\n    to UNPROFOR, but the term does not include such personnel as may \n    remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina pursuant to an agreement between \n    the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the government of any \n    country providing such personnel.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."
