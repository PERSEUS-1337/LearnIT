FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Constitution requires that the number of persons in \n        the Nation be enumerated every 10 years in order to permit the \n        apportionment of Representatives among the several States;\n            (2) information collected through a decennial census is \n        also used to determine--\n                    (A) the boundaries of congressional districts \n                within States;\n                    (B) the boundaries of the districts for the \n                legislature of each State and the boundaries of other \n                political subdivisions within the States; and\n                    (C) the allocation of billions of dollars of \n                Federal and State funds;\n            (3) the Constitution requires that those enumerations be \n        made in such manner as the Congress ``shall by law direct'';\n            (4) in the 1990 decennial census, the Bureau of the Census \n        used a combination of mail questionnaires and personal \n        interviews, involving more than 350,000 enumerators, to collect \n        the census data;\n            (5) in August 1992, the Bureau concluded that the 1990 \n        decennial census had failed to count four million persons or \n        1.6 percent of the population;\n            (6) the extent of the undercount varies by group and by the \n        part of the country involved; for example, the undercount in \n        the 1990 decennial census was--\n                    (A) 4.4 percent for African Americans, 4.5 percent \n                for American Indians, 2.3 percent for Asians or Pacific \n                Islanders, and 5 percent for Hispanic Americans; and\n                    (B) 3.1 percent for New Mexico, 2.8 percent for \n                Texas, 2.7 percent for California, and 2 percent for \n                Florida;\n            (7) in 1993, the Bureau concluded that legislation \n        providing that pay for temporary census enumerators in the 2000 \n        decennial census not be used to reduce benefits under Federal \n        assistance programs would make it easier for the Bureau to hire \n        neighborhood people as temporary census enumerators in low-\n        income neighborhoods;\n            (8) a number of lawsuits were filed challenging the \n        accuracy of the 1990 decennial census, and in March 1996 the \n        Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Secretary of Commerce's \n        decision in July 1991 not to adjust the initial enumeration in \n        the 1990 decennial census by using a postenumeration \n        statistical survey;\n            (9) on February 28, 1996, the Bureau announced that, for \n        the 2000 decennial census, it plans to use a combination of \nmail questionnaires and personal interviews in each county until it has \ncollected data from 90 percent of the households in the county, \nwhereupon it would conduct interviews with respect to one-tenth of the \nremaining households in the county and use the information obtained \nfrom those interviews to make estimates with respect to the remaining \nnonresponding households;\n            (10) certain witnesses testified, at a hearing held by the \n        Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of \n        Representatives on February 29, 1996, that the Bureau's \n        proposed sampling technique may increase the disparity in the \n        undercount among either geographic areas (such as between rural \n        and urban areas) or racial or ethnic groups (such as with \n        respect to African Americans and Hispanic Americans, as \n        compared to other groups);\n            (11) the planning, conduct, and analysis of a decennial \n        census often requires close to a period of 10 years;\n            (12) the Bureau estimates that the proposed sampling \n        technique will cost about $500 million less, over that period \n        of time, than the $4.4 billion that it estimates would be spent \n        over that same period if the method used in the 1990 decennial \n        census were to be used (instead of such sampling technique) in \n        the 2000 decennial census; and\n            (13) the Chairman of the Panel on Census Requirements in \n        the Year 2000 and Beyond of the National Academy of Sciences \n        testified at the February 29th hearing that there is a trade-\n        off between cost savings associated with using a sampling \n        technique on the one hand, and adverse effects with respect to \n        sampling variability, public perception, and political \n        consequences, on the other.\n    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote the \naccuracy of the 2000 decennial census, and public confidence with \nrespect to the data obtained therefrom.\n\nSEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS.\n\n    The 2000 decennial census shall be conducted in accordance with the \nfollowing:\n            (1) Direct contact must be attempted.--The Bureau shall \n        attempt to contact every household directly (whether by mail or \n        in person), and may use sampling as a substitute for direct \n        contact in a particular census tract only after direct contact \n        has been made with at least 90 percent of the households in \n        such tract.\n            (2) Greater use of non-federal resources.--The Bureau--\n                    (A) shall seek to make more effective use of State \n                and local government offices, as well as appropriate \n                local groups, in order to reduce the undercount; and\n                    (B) shall include, as part of its report under \n                section 141(f) of title 13, United States Code, next \n                due after the date of the enactment of this Act, a \n                description of the measures it intends to pursue to \n                carry out subparagraph (A).\n\nSEC. 4. MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE RECRUITMENT OF TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES.\n\n    (a) Purposes for Which Compensation Shall Not Be Taken Into \nAccount.--Section 23 of title 13, United States Code, is amended by \nadding at the end the following:\n    ``(d) Compensation for services performed by an individual \nappointed by the Secretary to a temporary position for purposes \nrelating to the 2000 decennial census (if the position is so designated \nby the Secretary, in writing, at the time of such individual's \nappointment) shall not be taken into account for purposes of \ndetermining either the eligibility of any individual for or the amount \nof benefits payable to an individual under any Federal, State, or local \nprogram financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.''.\n    (b) Exemption From Provisions Relating to Reemployed Annuitants and \nFormer Members of the Uniformed Services.--Public Law 101-86 (13 U.S.C. \n23 note) is amended--\n            (1) in section 1(b) and the long title by striking ``the \n        1990 decennial census'' and inserting ``the 2000 decennial \n        census''; and\n            (2) in section 4 by striking ``December 31, 1990.'' and \n        inserting ``December 31, 2000.''.\n\nSEC. 5.
