    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Office of Strategic Services \nCongressional Gold Medal Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was the first \n        effort by the United States to implement a system of strategic \n        intelligence during World War II and provided the basis for the \n        modern-day intelligence and special operations communities of \n        the United States.\n            (2) OSS founder General William J. Donovan is the only \n        person in the history of the United States to receive the 4 \n        highest military decorations of the United States, including \n        the Medal of Honor. Upon learning of his death in 1959, \n        President Eisenhower called General Donovan the ``last hero''. \n        In addition to founding and leading the OSS, General Donovan \n        was also selected by President Roosevelt, who called General \n        Donovan his ``secret legs'', as an emissary to Great Britain \n        and continental Europe before the United States entered World \n        War II.\n            (3) During World War II, each branch of the Armed Forces of \n        the United States contributed personnel to the OSS. United \n        States Coast Guard personnel were recruited for the Maritime \n        Unit and the Operational Swimmer Group.\n            (4) The present-day United States special operations forces \n        trace their lineage to the OSS. The Maritime Unit of the OSS \n        was a precursor to the Navy SEALs. The OSS Operational Groups \n        and Jedburghs were forerunners of the United States Army \n        Special Forces. The 801st/492nd Bombardment Group \n        (``Carpetbaggers'') were progenitors of the United States Air \n        Force Special Operations Command. The Marines who served in the \n        OSS, including the actor Sterling Hayden and Colonel William \n        Eddy, whom General Donovan described as the ``American Lawrence \n        of Arabia'', were predecessors of the United States Marine \n        Corps Forces Special Operations Command.\n            (5) The OSS organized, trained, supplied, and fought with \n        resistance organizations throughout Europe and Asia that played \n        an important role in the victory of the United States during \n        World War II. President Eisenhower credited the work of the OSS \n        with the French Resistance during the liberation of France as \n        the equivalent of the French Resistance having an extra \n        division.\n            (6) Four future Directors of Central Intelligence served as \n        OSS officers: William Casey, William Colby, Allen Dulles, and \n        Richard Helms.\n            (7) Women comprised more than \\1/3\\ of OSS personnel and \n        played a critical role in the organization. These women \n        included Virginia Hall, the only civilian female to receive a \n        Distinguished Service Cross in World War II, and Julia Child.\n            (8) The OSS recruited Fritz Kolbe, a German diplomat who \n        became the most important spy of the United States against the \n        Nazis in World War II.\n            (9) Leading scientists and scholars in the United States \n        served in the OSS Research and Analysis Branch, including Ralph \n        Bunche, the first African-American to receive the Nobel Peace \n        Prize, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur Schlesinger, \n        Jr., Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, Sherman Kent, John \n        King Fairbank, and Walt Rostow. Its ranks also included 7 \n        future presidents of the American Historical Association, 5 of \n        the American Economic Association, and 2 Nobel laureates. The \n        Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the United States \n        Department of State traces its creation to the OSS Research and \n        Analysis Branch.\n            (10) The OSS invented and employed new technology through \n        its Research and Development Branch, including new weapons and \n        revolutionary communications equipment. Dr. Christian \n        Lambertsen invented the first underwater breathing apparatus \n        that was first utilized by the OSS and is known today as \n        ``SCUBA''.\n            (11) OSS Detachment 101 operated in Burma and pioneered the \n        art of unconventional warfare. It was the first unit of the \n        United States to deploy a large guerrilla army deep in enemy \n        territory. OSS Detachment 101 has been credited with the \n        highest kill/loss ratio for any infantry-type unit in the \n        military history of the United States and was awarded a \n        Presidential Unit Citation.\n            (12) The X-2 branch of the OSS pioneered \n        counterintelligence with the British and established the modern \n        counterintelligence community. The network of contacts built by \n        the OSS with foreign intelligence services led to enduring Cold \n        War alliances.\n            (13) Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North \n        Africa in November 1942, was aided by the networks established \n        and information acquired by the OSS to guide the landings of \n        the Allies.\n            (14) OSS Operation Halyard resulted in the rescue of more \n        than 500 downed airmen trapped behind enemy lines in \n        Yugoslavia, one of the most daring and successful rescue \n        operations of World War II.\n            (15) OSS ``Mercy Missions'' at the end of World War II \n        saved the lives of thousands of Allied prisoners of war whom it \n        was feared would be murdered by the Japanese.\n            (16) The handful of surviving men and women of the OSS, \n        whom General Donovan called his ``glorious amateurs'', are \n        among the greatest generation. They have never been \n        collectively recognized for their heroic and pioneering service \n        in World War II.\n\nSEC. 3.
