FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The commitment to the promotion and protection of human \n        rights, democracy, and the rule of law around the world has led \n        the United States to undertake tremendous diplomatic, economic, \n        and military efforts to end systematic gross human rights \n        violations abroad, consistent with the national interests and \n        international leadership role of the United States. Such \n        efforts are thwarted if the cycle of impunity for human rights \n        violations in countries other than the United States is not \n        broken, and the likelihood of the need for renewed United \n        States engagements in those countries remains.\n            (2) The United States has a significant interest that newly \n        established or reestablished democratic societies take credible \n        steps to fully investigate and prosecute human rights \n        violations. Such steps could include the creation of a national \n        or international truth commission or tribunal, the appointment \n        of a human rights officer, or the leading of official national \n        investigations by credible sections of the civil society, \n        including religious institutions and nongovernmental \n        organizations.\n            (3) Executive agencies are in possession of documents \n        pertaining to gross human rights violations abroad that are \n        needed by foreign authorities to document, investigate, and \n        subsequently prosecute instances of continued and systematic \n        gross human rights violations, including those directed against \n        citizens of the United States.\n            (4) The overwhelming importance to the United States of \n        investigations by foreign authorities of gross human rights \n        violations and the urgency of requests for legal assistance \n        which the United States will continue to receive from foreign \n        entities require a systematic process of expedited \n        declassification and disclosure of documents pertaining to such \n        gross human rights violations.\n            (5) After a 36-year history of being open to foreign \n        requesters, the Freedom of Information Act (section 552 of \n        title 5, United States Code) was amended in the 107th Congress \n        by the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 \n        (Public Law 107-306) to prohibit agencies within the \n        intelligence community from making records available to foreign \n        entities or their representatives.\n            (6) Only an expedited systematic process can help ensure \n        timely investigations of perpetrators of gross and systematic \n        human rights violations and provide families with urgently \n        needed information regarding the fate of relatives, including \n        information making possible the location, identification, and \n        burial of the remains of family members who have been killed, \n        helping to bring closure for those families and beginning the \n        process of national reconciliation.\n\nSEC. 3.

Except as \nprovided in section 5 and subsection (d), all records described in the \npreceding sentence shall be made available to the public not later than \n30 days after the date that a review under this subsection is \ncompleted.\n    (c) Procedures in Case of Negative Determination.--If the President \n(or the Attorney General on behalf of the President) makes a \ndetermination that a request under subsection (a) is not an \ninternational bona fide request, such determination, and a detailed \nexplanation regarding such determination, shall be published in the \nFederal Register not later than 90 days after the date that such \nrequest is received.\n    (d) Confidentiality To Protect Ongoing Investigations.--\n            (1) Disclosure of records on confidential basis.--The head \n        of an agency disclosing human rights records as a result of a \n        positive determination under subsection (b) may, at the agency \n        head's initiative or at the request of the individual or entity \n        that submitted the request for records, disclose such records \n        to the individual or entity on a confidential basis if the \n        agency head determines that confidential disclosure is \n        necessary to avoid jeopardizing an ongoing investigation.\n            (2) Delayed public disclosure of records.--If the agency \n        head determines that confidential disclosure of records under \n        paragraph (1) is necessary, the agency head may withhold such \n        records from public disclosure until the agency head \n        determines, in consultation with the individual or entity that \n        submitted the request, that the need for confidentiality no \n        longer exists.\n\nSEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The head of an agency may postpone disclosure of a \nhuman rights record or particular information in a human rights record \nunder this Act only if the head of the agency determines that there is \nclear and convincing evidence that--\n            (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence \n        operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United \n        States that would result from disclosure of the human rights \n        record is of such gravity that it outweighs the public \n        interest, and such disclosure would reveal--\n                    (A) an intelligence agent whose identity requires \n                protection;\n                    (B) an intelligence source or method--\n                            (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably \n                        expected to be utilized, by the United States \n                        Government;\n                            (ii) which has not been officially \n                        disclosed; and\n                            (iii) the disclosure of which would \n                        interfere with the conduct of intelligence \n                        activities; or\n                    (C) any other matter currently relating to the \n                military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct \nof foreign relations of the United States, the disclosure of which \nwould demonstrably impair the national security of the United States;\n            (2) the disclosure of the human rights record--\n                    (A) would reveal the name or identity of a living \n                individual who provided confidential information to the \n                United States; and\n                    (B) would pose a substantial risk of harm to such \n                individual or to any member of the family, friend, or \n                associate of such individual;\n            (3) the disclosure of the human rights record could \n        reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of \n        personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so \n        substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or\n            (4) the disclosure of the human rights record would \n        compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality \n        requiring protection between a United States Government agent \n        and a cooperating individual or a foreign government, and \n        disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public \n        interest.\n    (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not be \ngrounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record that an \nindividual named in the human rights record was an intelligence asset \nof the United States Government, although the existence of such \nrelationship may be withheld if any of the criteria set forth in \nsubsection (a) are met. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the \nterm ``intelligence asset'' means a covert agent as defined in section \n606(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).\n\nSEC. 6.
