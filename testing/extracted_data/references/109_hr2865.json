Any such petitioner shall not be \n        entitled to have such issue determined under section 360(a) of \n        this Act or otherwise;\n            ``(6) whenever a petitioner seeks review of an order under \n        this section, any review sought with respect to a motion to \n        reopen or reconsider such an order shall be consolidated with \n        the review of the order;\n            ``(7) if the validity of a removal order has not been \n        judicially determined, its validity may be challenged in a \n        criminal proceeding against the alien for violation of \n        subsection (a) or (b) of section 243 of this Act only by \n        separate motion for judicial review before trial.

No petition for review or for habeas \ncorpus shall be entertained if the validity of the order has been \npreviously determined in any civil or criminal proceeding, unless the \npetition presents grounds which the court finds could not have been \npresented in such prior proceeding, or the court finds that the remedy \nprovided by such prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test \nthe validity of the order.\n    ``(d)(1) A petition for review or for habeas corpus on behalf of an \nalien against whom a final order of removal has been issued pursuant to \nsection 238(b) may challenge only--\n            ``(A) whether the alien is in fact the alien described in \n        the order;\n            ``(B) whether the alien is in fact an alien described in \n        section 238(b)(2);\n            ``(C) whether the alien has been convicted of an aggravated \n        felony and such conviction has become final; and\n            ``(D) whether the alien was afforded the procedures \n        required by section 238(b)(4).\n    ``(2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review any issue other \nthan an issue described in paragraph (1).''.\n    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \ntake effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to \ndeterminations pending on or after such date with respect to which--\n            (1) a final administrative decision has been/not been \n        rendered as of such date; or\n            (2) such a decision has been rendered but the period for \n        seeking judicial review of the decision has not expired.\n\nSEC. 8.
