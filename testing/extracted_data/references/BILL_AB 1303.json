Nor shall a city, county, or city and county withhold or refuse to issue a building permit or equivalent permit for failure to conform with or perform any conditions that the city, county, or city and county could have lawfully imposed as a condition to the previously approved tentative or parcel map. However, the provisions of this section shall not prohibit a city, county, or city and county from doing any of the following:\n(a) Imposing conditions or requirements upon the issuance of a building permit or equivalent permit which could have been lawfully imposed as a condition to the approval of a tentative or parcel map if the local agency finds it necessary to impose the condition or requirement for any of the following reasons:\n(1) A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or of the immediate community, or both, in a condition perilous to their health or safety, or both.\n(2) The condition is required in order to comply with state or federal law.\n(b) Withholding or refusing to issue a building permit or equivalent permit if the local agency finds it is required to do so in order to comply with state or federal law.\n(c) Assuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinance.\n(d) This section shall also apply to a city or city and county which incorporates on or after January 1, 1985, and which includes within its boundaries any areas included in the tentative or parcel map described in this section.\nWhen the incorporation includes areas included in the tentative or parcel map described in this section, \u201ca condition that the city could have lawfully imposed as a condition to the previously approved tentative or parcel map,\u201d as used in this section, refers to conditions the county could have imposed had there been no incorporation.\n(e) For purposes only of a tentative subdivision map or parcel map that is extended pursuant to Section 66452.22, 66452.23, 66452.24, or 66452.25, the five-year period described in this section shall be three years.\n(f) For purposes only of a tentative subdivision map or parcel map that is extended pursuant to Section 66452.22, 66452.23, 66452.24, or 66452.25, this section does not prohibit a city, county, or city and county from levying a fee or imposing a condition that requires the payment of a fee in the amount in effect upon the issuance of a building permit, including an adopted fee that is not included within an applicable zoning ordinance, upon the issuance of a building permit, including, but not limited to, a fee defined in Section 66000.\nSEC. 2.\nSection 66452.25 is added to the Government Code, to read:\n66452.25.\n(a) If the map was approved within a county described in subdivision (c), the expiration date of a tentative map, vesting tentative map, or parcel map for which a tentative map or vesting tentative map, as the case may be, that was approved on or after January 1, 2002, and not later than July 11, 2013, and that has not expired on or before the effective date of the act that added this section, shall be extended by 24 months.\n(b) If the map was approved or conditionally approved within a county described in subdivision (c), upon application of the subdivider filed at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map or vesting tentative map, or parcel map for which the tentative map or vesting tentative map, as the case may be, that was approved on or before December 31, 2001, the time at which the map expires shall be extended by the legislative body or by an advisory agency authorized to approve or conditionally approve tentative maps, for a period of 24 months upon a determination that the map is consistent with the applicable zoning and general plan requirements in effect when the application is filed. If the map is determined not to be consistent with applicable zoning and general plan requirements in effect when the application is filed, the legislative body or advisory agency may deny or conditionally approve an extension for a period of 24 months. Prior to the expiration of an approved or conditionally approved tentative map, upon an application by the subdivider to extend that map, the map shall automatically be extended for 60 days or until the application for the extension is approved, conditionally approved, or denied, whichever occurs last. If the advisory agency denies a subdivider\u2019s application for an extension, the subdivider may appeal to the legislative body within 15 days after the advisory agency has denied the extension.\n(c) This section shall apply within a county when the following conditions within the county are met:\n(1) The annual mean household income within the county is less than 80 percent of the statewide annual mean income, as determined by the most recent annual report of the federal American Community Survey 5-year Estimates, based upon the American Community Survey Design and Methodology publication (Version 2.0, January 2014) published by the United States Census Bureau.\n(2) The annual nonseasonal unemployment rate is at least 2.75 percent higher than the statewide annual nonseasonal unemployment rate, as defined by the report on Labor Market Review published by the Employment Development Department in January of the year in which the community revitalization plan is prepared.\n(3) The population for whom poverty status is determined is at least 4 percent higher than the statewide median poverty rate, as determined by the most recent annual report of the American Community Survey 5-year Estimates, based upon the American Community Survey Design and Methodology publication (Version 2.0, January 2014).\n(d) The extension provided by subdivisions (a) and (b) shall be in addition to any extension of the expiration date provided for in Section 66452.6, 66452.11, 66452.13, 66452.21, 66452.22, 66452.23, 66452.24, or 66463.5.\n(e) Any legislative, administrative, or other approval by any state agency that pertains to a development project included in a map that is extended pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) shall be extended by 24 months if this approval has not expired on or before the effective date of the act that added this section. This extension shall be in addition to any extension provided for in Sections 66452.13, 66452.21, 66452.22, 66452.23, and 66452.24.\n(f) The provisions of Section 65961 relating to conditions that may be imposed upon or after a building permit for a subdivision of single- or multiple-family residential units or a parcel map for a subdivision for which no tentative map was required, are modified as set forth in subdivisions (e) and (f) of Section 65961 for tentative maps extended pursuant to this section.\nSEC. 3.\nNo reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.\nSEC. 4.\nThis act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:\nIn order to permit cities, counties, and cities and counties to preserve development applications that are set to expire and that cannot be processed presently due to prevailing adverse economic conditions in the construction industry, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately."
