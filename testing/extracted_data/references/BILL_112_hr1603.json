FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States has run persistent trade deficits \n        since 1978, and many of the trade deficits since 2000 have been \n        especially large.\n            (2) The United States trade deficit rose from \n        $374,900,000,000 in 2009 to $497,800,000,000 in 2010, an \n        increase of 33 percent.\n            (3) Many of the trade deficits are structural--that is, \n        with the same countries, year after year. In 2010, the United \n        States continued to have significant merchandise trade deficits \n        with the People's Republic of China ($273,100,000,000), the \n        European Union ($79,800,000,000), Japan ($59,800,000,000), and \n        Mexico ($66,300,000,000), notwithstanding the overall decline \n        in the United States trade deficit. In fact, in 2010, China \n        accounted for 42 percent of the United States merchandise trade \n        deficit.\n            (4) While the United States has one of the most open \n        borders and economies in the world, the United States faces \n        significant tariff and nontariff trade barriers with its \n        trading partners.\n\nSEC. 2.
