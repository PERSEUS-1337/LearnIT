FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tumors kill more children than any other disease and \n        brain tumors are the second most common type of cancer in \n        children.\n            (2) Childhood brain tumors are the leading cause of death \n        from solid tumors in children.\n            (3) There are newly recognized types of brain tumors, as \n        defined by the World Health Organization, and many of these \n        newly recognized types occur in children.\n            (4) The causes of the overwhelming majority of childhood \n        brain tumors are unknown.\n            (5) Brain tumors have substantial costs for affected \n        children, the families of such children, and society.\n            (6) Childhood brain tumors cause significant morbidity and \n        the loss of many years of potential life.\n            (7) The prognosis for most childhood brain tumors is dismal \n        and survivors face lasting adverse health effects.\n            (8) Because of the relatively low overall incidence of \n        childhood brain tumors, such tumors frequently do not receive \n        sufficient attention and research funding.\n            (9) No single institution has a sufficient number of \n        patients to independently conduct research that will adequately \n        address the causes of childhood brain tumors.\n            (10) There has been no comprehensive study analyzing all \n        relevant clinical, biological, and epidemiological aspects of \n        childhood brain tumors to identify potential risk factors and \n        determine the cause of such tumors.\n            (11) Existing national cooperative clinical oncology groups \n        primarily investigate treatment options and prognosis and do \n        not typically examine the origins of childhood brain tumors or \n        the risk factors associated with such tumors. A significant \n        majority of children with brain tumors are first treated by \n        neurosurgeons and not by oncologists typically involved in such \n        groups.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) there is a need to establish a multi-center research \n        effort based on collaboration between regional consortia in \n        order to comprehensively study the causes of childhood brain \n        tumors and identify potential risk factors;\n            (2) there is a need to encourage a collaborative effort \n        among surgical and medical centers with epidemiological study \n        groups to gather comprehensive and detailed information for \n        each child enrolled in those groups, in order to investigate \n        environmental, nutritional, genetic, and developmental factors \n        with respect to, and the pathological and epidemiological \n        characteristics of, childhood brain tumors; and\n            (3) there is a need to authorize the Director of the \n        National Institutes of Health to coordinate national research \n        efforts of governmental and nongovernmental entities with \n        respect to childhood brain tumors.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMOR PREVENTION \n              NETWORK.\n\n    (a) In General.--Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the Public \nHealth Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n\n``SEC. 417F.
