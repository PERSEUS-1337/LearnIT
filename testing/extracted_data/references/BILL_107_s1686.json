FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in \n        assuring that delivery of health care services to patients in \n        health care facilities is adequate and safe.\n            (2) Research, including a recent study by the Harvard \n        School of Public Health, documents that higher nurse staffing \n        levels result in better patient outcomes, yet health care \n        providers report substantial difficulties in recruiting and \n        retaining sufficient nursing staff, as evidenced by the \n        approximately 500,000 licensed nurses who are not practicing \n        nursing.\n            (3) While job dissatisfaction and overtime work are \n        contributing to the departure of nurses from their profession, \n        as highlighted by a recent report of the Comptroller General of \n        the United States, health care providers continue to make use \n        of mandatory overtime as a staffing method.\n            (4) The widespread practice of requiring nurses to work \n        extended shifts and forego days off causes nurses to frequently \n        provide care in a state of fatigue, contributing to medical \n        errors and other consequences that compromise patient safety.\n            (5) Limitations on mandatory overtime will ensure that \n        health care facilities throughout the country operate in a \n        manner that safeguards public safety and guarantees the \n        delivery of quality health care services and facilitates the \n        retention and recruitment of nurses.\n\nSEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON MANDATORY OVERTIME FOR NURSES.\n\n    (a) Provider Agreements.--Section 1866 of the Social Security Act \n(42 U.S.C. 1395cc) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a)(1)--\n                    (A) in subparagraph (R), by striking ``and'' at the \n                end;\n                    (B) in subparagraph (S), by striking the period and \n                inserting ``, and'';
