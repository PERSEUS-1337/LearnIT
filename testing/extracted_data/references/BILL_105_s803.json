FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) It is in the interest of the United States to maximize \n        economic return from the growing industry of pleasure cruises--\n                    (A) by encouraging the growth of new cruise \n                itineraries between coastal cities in the United \n                States, and\n                    (B) by encouraging the use of United States goods, \n                labor, and support services.\n            (2) In maximizing the economic benefits to the United \n        States from increased cruise vessel tourism, there is a need to \n        ensure that existing employment and economic activity \n        associated with United States-flag vessels (including tour \n        boats, river boats, intracoastal waterway cruise vessels, and \n        ferries) are protected and to provide for the reemergence of a \n        United States-flag cruise vessel industry.\n            (3) The pleasure cruise industry is one of the fastest \n        growing segments of the tourism industry and is expected to \n        grow at a rate of 5 percent a year over the next few years.\n            (4) The United States-flag ocean cruise vessel fleet \n        consists of only a single vessel that tours the Hawaiian \n        Islands. As a result, all the cruise vessels carrying \n        passengers to and from United States ports are foreign-flag \n        vessels and the United States ports served are mostly ports \n        that are close enough to foreign ports to allow intermediate \n        calls.\n            (5) Prohibiting cruises between United States ports by \n        foreign-flag vessels results in the loss of tourist dollars and \n        revenue for United States ports and greatly disadvantages \n        United States ports and coastal communities.\n\nSEC. 3. FOREIGN-FLAG CRUISE VESSELS.\n\n    (a) Definitions.--In this Act:\n            (1) Coastwise trade.--The term ``coastwise trade'' means \n        the coastwise trade provided for in section 12106 of title 46, \n        United States Code and includes trade in the Great Lakes.\n            (2) Cruise vessel.--The term ``cruise vessel'' means a \n        vessel of greater than 4,000 gross registered tons which \n        provides a full range of luxury accommodations, entertainment, \n        dining, and other services for its passengers.\n            (3) Foreign-flag cruise vessel.--The term ``foreign-flag \n        cruise vessel'' does not apply to a vessel which--\n                    (A) provides ferry services or intracoastal \n                waterway cruises;\n                    (B) regularly carries for hire both passengers and \n                vehicles or other cargo; or\n                    (C) serves residents of the vessel's ports of call \n                in the United States as a common or frequently used \n                means of transportation between United States ports.\n            (4) Repair and maintenance service.--The term ``repair and \n        maintenance service'' includes alterations and upgrades.\n    (b) Waiver.--Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8 of the Act \nof June 19, 1886 (24 Stat. 81, Chapter 421; 46 U.S.C.

App. 817e) for service in the \n        coastwise trade on an itinerary substantially similar to that \n        of a foreign-flag cruise vessel transporting passengers under \n        authority of this section, the Secretary shall, in accordance \n        with subsection (d)(2), notify the owner or charterer of the \n        foreign-flag cruise vessel that the Secretary will, within 3 \n        years after the date of notification, terminate such service.\n    (d) Termination.--\n            (1) In general.--Coastwise trade privileges granted to such \n        owner or charterer of a foreign-flag cruise vessel under this \n        section shall expire on the date that is 3 years after the date \n        of the Secretary's notification described in subsection (c)(2).\n            (2) Order of termination.--Any notification issued by the \n        Secretary under this subsection shall be issued to the owner or \n        charterer of a foreign-flag cruise vessel--\n                    (A) in the reverse order in which the foreign-flag \n                cruise vessel entered service in the coastwise trade \n                under this section, determined by the date of the \n                vessel's first coastwise sailing; and\n                    (B) in the minimum number necessary to ensure that \n                the passenger-carrying capacity thereby removed from \n                the coastwise trade service exceeds the passenger-\n                carrying capacity of the United States-flag cruise \n                vessel entering the service.\n            (3) Exception.--If, at the expiration of the 3-year period \n        specified in paragraph (1), the United States-flag cruise \n        vessel that has been offering or advertising service pursuant \n        to a certificate described in subsection (c)(2) has not entered \n        the coastwise trade described in subsection (c)(2), then the \n        termination of service required by paragraph (1) shall not take \n        effect until 180 days after the date of the entry into that \n        coastwise trade service by the United States-flag cruise \n        vessel.\n    (e) Requirement For Repairs In United States Shipyards.--\n            (1) In general.--The owner or charterer of a foreign-flag \n        cruise vessel that is qualified to provide coastwise trade \n        service under this section is required to have repair and \n        maintenance service for the vessel performed in the United \n        States during the period that such vessel is qualified for such \n        coastwise trade service, except in a case in which the vessel \n        requires repair and maintenance service while at a distant \n        foreign port (as defined in section 4.80a(a) of title 19, Code \n        of Federal Regulations (or any corresponding similar regulation \n        or ruling)).\n            (2) Action if requirement not met.--\n                    (A) General rule.--If the Secretary determines that \n                the owner or charterer has not met the repair and \n                maintenance service requirement described in paragraph \n                (1), the Secretary shall terminate the coastwise trade \n                privileges granted to the owner or charterer under this \n                section.\n                    (B) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the repair and \n                maintenance service requirement if the Secretary finds \n                that--\n                            (i) the repair and maintenance service is \n                        not available in the United States, or\n                            (ii) an emergency prevented the owner or \n                        charterer from obtaining the service in the \n                        United States.\n    (f) Alien Crewmen.--Section 252 of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (8 U.S.C. 1282) is amended--\n            (1) in subsection (a), by redesignating paragraphs (1) and \n        (2) as subparagraphs (A) and (B);\n            (2) by inserting ``(1)'' immediately after ``(a)'';\n            (3) in subsection (a)(1) (as redesignated), in the second \n        sentence, by inserting ``, except as provided in paragraph (2), \n        and'' after ``subsection (b),'';\n            (4) by adding at the end of subsection (a)(1) (as \n        redesignated), the following:\n    ``(2) An immigration officer may extend for a period or periods of \nup to 6 months each a conditional permit to land that is granted under \nparagraph (1) to an alien crewman employed on a vessel if the owner or \ncharterer of the vessel requests the extension and the immigration \nofficer determines that the extension is necessary to maintain the \nvessel in the coastwise trade between ports in the United States, \ndirectly or by way of a foreign port.'';
