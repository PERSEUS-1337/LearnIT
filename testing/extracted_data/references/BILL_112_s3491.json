separately for each renewable chemical produced by the \ntaxpayer) equal to $0.15 per pound of eligible content of renewable \nchemical produced by the taxpayer during the taxable year.\n    ``(b) Limitation.--The credit determined under subsection (a) with \nrespect to any renewable chemical produced by any taxpayer during any \ntaxable year shall not exceed the credit amount allocated by the

``(2) Biobased content percentage.--The term `biobased \n        content percentage' means, with respect to any renewable \n        chemical, the biobased content of such chemical (expressed as a \n
