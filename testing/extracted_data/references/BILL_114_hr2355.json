FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Well-woman visits are the foundation on which women's \n        preventive care is built. Such visits include not only specific \n        screening tests, but also a medical history, physical \n        examination, evaluation and counseling, and, as indicated, \n        vaccinations.\n            (2) Well-woman visits facilitate increased access to health \n        care that is shown to identify chronic disease risk factors, \n        promote well-being, and decrease the likelihood or delay the \n        onset of a targeted disease or condition.\n            (3) Heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular \n        diseases are the number one cause of death in American women, \n        responsible for 1 in every 4 female deaths.\n            (4) Women are more likely than men to have forgone needed \n        health care due to cost; 1 in 5 women postponed preventive \n        services in the past year due to cost.\n            (5) Between 2002 and 2010, screening mammography rates \n        among women in the United States who were 50 years of age to 64 \n        years of age declined from about 79 percent to 73 percent.\n            (6) In 2010, only 45 percent of 18- to 64-year-olds in the \n        United States reported having ever received an HIV test.\n            (7) Among sexually active females in the United States ages \n        16-25 years of age, only 44.7 percent were screened for \n        Chlamydia.\n            (8) The proportion of women in the United States 22 years \n        of age to 30 years of age who reported never having had a Pap \n        test increased from 6.6 percent in 2000 to 9.0 percent in 2010 \n        despite current recommendations that they receive a Pap test \n        every three years.\n            (9) In 2007, 29.3 percent of women in the United States \n        delivering a live birth did not receive any prenatal care in \n        the first trimester, even though first trimester prenatal care \n        is recommended.\n            (10) During the 2013-2014 flu season, almost 48 percent of \n        pregnant women did not receive recommended vaccination against \n        influenza.\n            (11) Over half (51 percent) of the 6.6 million pregnancies \n        in the United States each year are unintended. Multiple studies \n        have shown that improved access to birth control significantly \n        improves the health of women and their families, as it is \n        directly linked to improved maternal and infant health \n        outcomes. Women that plan their pregnancies are more likely to \n        access prenatal care, improving their own health and the health \n        of their children.\n            (12) Between 2006 and 2010, one-third of all pregnancies \n        were conceived within 18 months of a previous birth, an \n        interval that is potentially harmful to the health of the \n        mother.\n            (13) Improved access to family planning also saves money. \n        For every $1.00 invested in family planning, taxpayers save \n        more than $5.00 in Medicaid-related expenses.\n\nSEC. 3. WOMEN'S PREVENTIVE HEALTH AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.\n\n    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n280g et al.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``SEC. 399V-6.
